AB Several groups of vertebrate taxa, including shorebirds, are unusual in that they produce a fixed number of offspring. The aim of this study was to examine whether the incubation capacity of western sandpipers (Calidris mauri) and semipalmated sandpipers (C. pusilla) limits their maximum clutch size to four eggs. Experimental enlargement of clutch size had no effect on rates of nest abandonment, nest attendance or loss of body mass by incubating sandpipers. The duration of incubation was significantly longer for enlarged five-egg nests, and there were trends towards increased partial clutch loss and asynchrony at hatch, but overall hatching success was unaffected by experimental egg number. I conclude that small, calidrine sandpipers with biparental care are able to compensate for an additional egg in an enlarged nestbowl, despite the constraints of conically shaped eggs and two brood patches. Possibly, shorebirds do not lay more than a fixed clutch size of four eggs because selection on factors acting during egg production or brood-rearing is more important in regulating offspring number.

AB We present data on the biology of Gerbillus dasyurus in the Central Negev based on 5 years of field observations and mark-recapture data of 893 individuals. The region is dominated by large erosion cirque. We sampled 45 plots in a variety of habitats in and around the cirque. Constant sexual differences in body size and mass were shown (with males generally larger and heavier) as well as variation in body mass among habitats, between seasons and among years. Reproduction was observed almost year round with a pause in December. Duration of pregnancy was 18-22 days and the litter size was 3-7 pups. There was constant male bias in the sex structure of the population in both adult and young animals. The dynamics of age structure were related to patterns of reproduction. Longevity of both males and females in the field was up to 2.5 years and in captivity was more than four years. The main factors affecting the distribution of the species in the study area were soil-structure variables. G. dasyurus avoided patches with sandy soils, and demonstrated intermediate selectivity for patches with high rock and clay content. Simultaneously, G. dasyurus mostly utilized sites with relatively high abundance of annual vegetation and shrub crown volume (suggestive of preference for highly productive and moderately covered patches, and avoided extremely dense vegetation). The highest density (up to 50 individuals per I ha) was found in loess hills. Habitat selection was not seasonally variable. Two types of burrows were recorded. Simple burrows with 1-3 openings and without a nest were more abundant than complex burrows with 4-5 openings and a nest chamber with a nest.

AB The cyanobacterium Nostoc commune has been developed as the prokaryotic model for the anhydrobiotic cell and it provides the means to answer Fundamental questions about desiccation tolerance. The anhydrobiotic cell is characterized by its singular lack of water - with contents as low as 0.02 g H2O g(-1) dry weight. These levels are orders of magnitude lower than those found either in bacterial spores or in cells subjected to acute salt (osmotic) stress. Mechanisms that contribute to the desiccation tolerance of N. commune include the selective stabilization of anhydrous proteins, the secretion of water- and lipid-soluble UV-absorbing pigments, and the secretion of a complex glycan that immobilizes the cells, immobilizes water stress proteins and the UV-absorbing pigments, and which may confer the properties of a mechanical glass upon colonies. Rehydration of desiccated cells induces an instantaneous resumption of metabolic activities, including membrane transport and global lipid biosynthesis. These initial recoveries may not follow classical Arrhenius-based kinetics, The rehydrating cell exhibits a stringent, stepwise recovery of physiological capacities beginning with respiration, then photosynthesis and finally nitrogen fixation. Protein turnover, de novo protein synthesis and a rapid rise in the intracellular ATP pool accompany these recoveries. During the early stages of rehydration, the de novo transcription of one gene set (rpoC1C2) is achieved using an extant DNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme that remains stable in desiccated cells. These properties of desiccation-tolerant cyanobacteria, present in extant forms such as N. commune and Chroococcidiopsis spp., may have been utilized by the eoanhydrobiotes. However, it is the desiccation-tolerant cyanobacterium as a whole, and not some collection of disparate properties, that must be considered as the primary strategy for the achievement of desiccation tolerance.

DT Article
AB An existing model that examines the effects of habitat destruction in forest ecosystems is analysed in detail and modified for application to coral reefs. This allows a comparison of the relative rates of species extinctions, as habitat fragmentation increases, for the two different ecosystems. Field data from the reefs in Eilat, Israel, suggests that a large class of corals have both poor recruitment abilities and low abundances; characteristics that make these corals highly sensitive to disturbance. In such a scenario, the model finds coral reefs to be extremely fragile, and predicts a relatively large number of species extinctions with only mild habitat destruction. The unusual effects of species indirect interactions are also analysed, and the equilibrium distributions of species abundances are determined analytically for a wide range of parameter regimes.

AB Characterizing how ecosystems are responding to rapid environmental change has become a major focus of ecological research. The empirical study of ecological stability, which aims to quantify these ecosystem responses, is therefore more relevant than ever.
   Based on a historical review and bibliometric mapping of the field of ecological stability, we show that the two main schools relating to the study of stability-one focusing on systems close to their equilibrium and the other on non-equilibrium behaviour-have developed in parallel leading to divergence in both concepts and definitions.
   We synthesize and expand previous frameworks and capitalize on the latest developments in the field to build towards an integrated framework by elaborating the overarching concept of ecological stability and its properties. Finally, the broad applicability of our work is demonstrated in two empirical cases.
   Synthesis. With rapidly changing environmental conditions, the stability of ecosystems has become a major focus of ecological research. Still, the concept of stability remains a major source of confusion and disagreement among ecologists. The conceptual framework presented here provides a basis to integrate currently diverging views on the study of ecological stability.

AB Aim Trait data are increasingly being used in studies investigating the impacts of global changes on the structure and functioning of ecological communities. Despite a growing number of trait data collations for terrestrial vertebrates, there is to date no global assessment of the gaps and biases the data present. Here, we assess whether terrestrial vertebrate trait data are taxonomically, spatially and phylogenetically biased. Location Global. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Terrestrial vertebrates. Methods We compile seven ecological traits and quantify coverage as the proportion of species for which an estimate is available. For a species, we define completeness as the proportion of non-missing values across traits. We assess whether coverage and completeness differ across classes and examine phylogenetic biases in trait data. To investigate spatial biases, we test whether wider-ranging species have more complete trait data than narrow-ranging species. Additionally, we test whether species-rich regions, which are of most concern for conservation, are less well sampled than species-poor regions. Results Mammals and birds are well sampled even in species-rich regions. For reptiles and amphibians (herptiles), only body size presents a high coverage (>80%), in addition to habitat-related variables (amphibians). Herptiles are poorly sampled for other traits. The shortfalls are particularly acute in some species-rich regions and for certain clades. Across all classes, geographically rarer species have less complete trait information. Main conclusions Trait information is less available on average in some of the most diverse areas and in geographically rarer species, both of which crucial for biodiversity conservation. Gaps in trait data might impede our ability to conduct large-scale analyses, whereas biases can impact the validity of extrapolations. A short-term solution to the problem is to estimate missing trait data using imputation techniques, whereas a longer-term and more robust filling of existing gaps requires continued data-collection efforts.

AB Conservation and management of marine biodiversity depends on biomonitoring of marine habitats, but current approaches are resource-intensive and require different approaches for different organisms. Environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from water samples is an efficient and versatile approach to detecting aquatic animals. In the ocean, eDNA composition reflects local fauna at fine spatial scales, but little is known about the effectiveness of eDNA-based monitoring of marine communities at larger scales. We investigated the potential of eDNA to characterize and distinguish marine communities at large spatial scales by comparing vertebrate species composition among marine habitats in Qatar, the Arabian Gulf (also known as the Persian Gulf), based on eDNA metabarcoding of seawater samples. We conducted species accumulation analyses to estimate how much of the vertebrate diversity we detected. We obtained eDNA sequences from a diverse assemblage of marine vertebrates, spanning 191 taxa in 73 families. These included rare and endangered species and covered 36% of the bony fish genera previously recorded in the Gulf. Sites of similar habitat type were also similar in eDNA composition. The species accumulation analyses showed that the number of sample replicates was insufficient for some sampling sites but suggested that a few hundred eDNA samples could potentially capture >90% of the marine vertebrate diversity in the study area. Our results confirm that seawater samples contain habitat-characteristic molecular signatures and that eDNA monitoring can efficiently cover vertebrate diversity at scales relevant to national and regional conservation and management.

AB Cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni) in soil have caused serious environmental problems and increased healthy risks to humans and biota, it is vital important and necessary to develop effective methods to resolve the combined contaminated problems. In this study, strains L5 and L6 with good heavy metal resistant and immobilizing capacities were isolated from Cd and Ni contaminated soil. Bacterial characteristic experiment illustrated that many functional groups (-OH, -NH2 and -COO et al.) were distributed on the surface of 1.5 and L6. Under the stress of heavy metals, bacterial appearances were distorted. The pot experiment indicated that the concentrations of HOAc-extractable Cd and Ni in soil reduced 6.26-15.33% and 13.31-19.53% with the inoculation of L5 and L6. In addition, the immobilization rates on Cd and Ni improved 61.27-128.50% and 23.69-39.66% with re-inoculation of strains L5 and L6 at 30 days, respectively. After inoculation of strains L5 and L6 for 60 days, the activities of FDA hydrolysis, acid phosphatase, urease, invertase and dehydrogenase in soil increased obviously. Furthermore, bacterial diversity indexes and community structure of soil were also improved. Thus, given the beneficial remediation effects of the isolated strains, L5 and L6 have great potentials for heavy metals contaminated soil remediation.

AB 1. State transitions are changes in ecosystem structure and self-reinforcing feedbacks that are initiated when an exogenous driver variable crosses a threshold. Reversing state transitions is difficult and costly. While some state transitions are relatively rapid, many take years to decades. Outside of theoretical models, very little is known about slower state transitions and how they unfold in time and space.
   2. We quantified changes in spatial variance as a mesic grassland ecosystem shifts to a shrub-dominated state, using long-term experiments and simulations that maintain grasslands with annual fires or initiate a state transition to shrub dominance by decreasing fire frequency.
   3. In the experiments, the susceptibility to state transitions varied substantially in space. In the less frequent fire treatment, some plots became shrub-dominated around year 20 and grass extirpations began in year 25, but a third of the plots were still grass-dominated in year 37. Variable rates of state transition resulted in increasing spatial variance of grass cover over time, whereas shrub cover variance decreased. In the annually burned treatment, grasses remained dominant and the spatial variance of grass cover declined.
   4. In a separate experiment, less frequent fires were maintained for 23 years and then switched to annual fires. The switch to annual fires occurred shortly after grass variance started to increase and a majority of these plots quickly returned to a grass dominated state.
   5. In simulations, spatial variance remained low and average grass cover was high under frequent fires. If fire frequency decreased below a threshold, the ecosystem transitioned to shrubland, with a transient increase in the spatial variance of grass cover during the transition between states.
   6. Synthesis. Spatial variability in the rate and susceptibility to state transitions is indicative of a system with a patchy spatial structure, high spatial heterogeneity and low connectivity between patches. Increases in spatial variance can serve as an indication that some patches have begun a state transition and that management interventions are needed to avoid widespread transitions. This is one of the first empirical examples where altering management after an increase in spatial variance prevented state transitions.

AB AimFaced with the dispute regarding spatial gradients of body size in ectotherms, we build upon their long-known allometric relationship with water economy, which scales with thermal and hydric regimes, to revisit and refine the water conservation hypothesis (WCH). We provide a brief description of the WCH, including its physiological basis and geographical predictions for body size clines in terrestrial amphibians, and test it against heat-based hypotheses in four amphibian clades.
   LocationThe Americas.
   MethodsWe employ phylogenetic comparative analyses to examine relationships between body size and both temperature, as a descriptor of the effect of heat alone, and potential evapotranspiration, which describes the water constraint along evaporative gradients. We assess these relationships in four amphibian clades: the subfamily of leaf frogs (Phyllomedusinae), genera of gladiator frogs (Hypsiboas), salamanders (Plethodon) and the family of glass frogs (Centrolenidae).
   ResultsThree clades did not show phylogenetic signals in body size variation. In addition, three clades showed a positive relationship with potential evapotranspiration as predicted, and all of them were unrelated to temperature. When present, however, the explanatory power of evaporative energy on body size variation was relatively weak.
   Main conclusionsThe conservation of water across evaporative gradients is both a more comprehensive explanation and a more pervasive driver of spatial clines in body size among terrestrial amphibians than is the balance of heat alone. However, the relatively low predictive ability of evaporative energy and its dependence on specific climatic configurations both emphasize and elucidate the non-universality of the phenomenon.

AB Mangroves are subject to the effects of tides and fluctuations in environmental conditions, which may reach extreme conditions. These ecosystems are severely threatened by human activities despite their ecological importance. Although mangroves are characterized by a highly specialized but low plant diversity in comparison to most other tropical ecosystems, they support a diverse microbial community. Adapted microorganisms in soil, water, and on plant surfaces perform fundamental roles in nutrient cycling, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. Cyanobacteria contribute to carbon and nitrogen fixation and their cells act as phosphorus storages in ecosystems with extreme or oligotrophic environmental conditions such as those found in mangroves. As the high plant productivity in mangroves is only possible due to interactions with microorganisms, cyanobacteria may contribute to these ecosystems by providing fixed nitrogen, carbon, and herbivory-defense molecules, xenobiotic biosorption and bioremediation, and secreting plant growth-promoting substances. In addition to water, cyanobacterial colonies have been detected on sediments, rocks, decaying wood, underground and aerial roots, trunks, and leaves. Some mangrove cyanobacteria were also found in association to algae or seagrasses. Few studies on mangrove cyanobacteria are available, but together they have reported a substantial number of species in these ecosystems. However, the cyanobacterial diversity in this biome has been traditionally underestimated. Though mangrove communities generally host cyanobacterial taxa commonly found in marine environments, unique microhabitats found in mangroves potentially harbor several undescribed cyanobacterial taxa. The relevance of cyanobacteria for mangrove conservation is highlighted in their use for the recovery of degraded mangroves as biostimulants or in bioremediation.

AB The main objective of this study was to determine the nature and relative importance of environmental factors that shape the distribution of dune vegetation in the Maspalomas dune field in the Canary Islands, an arid transgressive dune system. Environmental factors were defined according to their expression related to the linear distance from the coast and to the local aeolian geomorphic process-landform context. Plant communities were characterized through an integration of field mapping, digital orthophoto interpretation and GIS analysis. The vegetation of the study area consists of 19 plant communities. In areas with active sedimentary processes, vegetation tends to be localized in slacks. In areas with more stabilized landforms, vegetation appears at both dunes and slacks. In conclusion, the main factor controlling the distribution of vegetation in the transgressive dune system of Maspalomas is the local aeolian sedimentary process-landform context. Distance to the coast is not as significant as an influence. The gradient structuring of environmental factors associated with retentive coastal dune systems and expressed as distance to the coast does not fully capture the biogeomorphic dynamism of transgressive dune fields.

TI Contemporary connectivity is sustained by wind-and current-driven seed
   dispersal among seagrass meadows

AB Background: Seagrasses are clonal marine plants that form important biotic habitats in many tropical and temperate coastal ecosystems. While there is a reasonable understanding of the dynamics of asexual (vegetative) growth in seagrasses, sexual reproduction and the dispersal pathways of the seeds remain poorly studied. Here we address the potential for a predominantly clonal seagrass, P. australis, to disperse over long distances by movement of floating fruit via wind and surface currents within the coastal waters of Perth, Western Australia. We first simulated the dominant atmospheric and ocean forcing conditions that are known to disperse these seagrass seeds using a three-dimensional numerical ocean circulation model. Field observations obtained at 8 sites across the study area were used to validate the model performance over similar to 2 months in summer when buoyant P. australis fruit are released into the water column. P. australis fruit dispersal trajectories were then quantified throughout the region by incorporating key physical properties of the fruit within the transport model. The time taken for the floating fruit to release their seed (dehiscence) was incorporated into the model based on laboratory measurements, and was used to predict the settlement probability distributions across the model domain.
   Results: The results revealed that high rates of local and regional demographic connectivity among P. australis meadows are achieved via contemporary seed dispersal. Dispersal of seeds via floating fruit has the potential to regularly connect meadows at distances of 10s of kilometres (50% of seeds produced) and infrequently for meadows at distances 100 s km (3% of seeds produced).
   Conclusions: The spatial patterns of seed dispersal were heavily influenced by atmospheric and oceanographic conditions, which generally drove a northward pattern of connectivity on a regional scale, but with geographical barriers influencing finer-scale connectivity pathways at some locations. Such levels of seed dispersal infer greater levels of ecological and genetic connectivity and suggest that seagrasses are not just strongly clonal.

AB Global warming can lead to considerable impacts on natural plant communities, potentially inducing changes in plant physiology and the quantity and quality of floral rewards, especially nectar. Changes in nectar production can in turn strongly affect plant-pollinator interaction networks-pollinators may potentially benefit under moderate warming conditions, but suffer as resources reduce in availability as elevated temperatures become more extreme. Here, we studied the effect of elevated temperatures on nectar secretion of two Mediterranean Lamiaceae species-Ballota acetabulosa and Teucrium divaricatum. We measured nectar production (viz. volume per flower, sugar concentration per flower and sugar content per flower and per plant), number of open and empty flowers per plant, as well as biomass per flower under a range of temperatures selected ad hoc in a fully controlled climate chamber and under natural conditions outdoors. The average temperature in the climate chamber was increased every 3 days in 3 degrees C increments from 17.5 to 38.5 degrees C. Both study species showed a unimodal response of nectar production (volume per flower, sugar content per flower and per plant) to temperature. Optimal temperature for sugar content per flower was 25-26 degrees C for B. acetabulosa and 29-33 degrees C for T. divaricatum. According to our results, moderate climate warming predicted for the next few decades could benefit nectar secretion in T. divaricatum as long as the plants are not water stressed, but have a moderate negative effect on B. acetabulosa. Nevertheless, strong warming as predicted by climate change models for the end of the 21st century is expected to reduce nectar secretion in both species and can thus significantly reduce available resources for both wild bees and honeybees in Mediterranean systems.

AB The origins of large (>5 m diameter, >1 m height) and regularly spaced (i.e. over-dispersed) non-anthropogenic earth mounds (e.g. mima mounds, heuweltjies, nabhkas) that occur across all biomes remain unresolved. An. extensive literature documenting diverse explanations for mound genesis has accumulated that primarily ascribes mound formation to faunal agents. Recent modeling efforts suggest that both abiotic and biotic processes commonly interact to produce striking vegetation patterning (e.g. spots, labyrinths). The hypothesis that many earth mounds, apart from those with a clear faunal genesis (e.g. termitaria), may result from vegetation trapping of sediment or aeolian dust and/or protection of soil from erosion is reviewed here. The literature on the occurrence and properties of some of these mima-like mounds is reviewed, and the evidence for their origins evaluated. Some mounds, such as coppice dunes (otherwise known as nabkhas), clearly form as a consequence of aeolian deposition of sediment around vegetation patches. However, the clay, stone and rock content of some mima-like mounds is not consistent with purely aeolian origins. Instead it is suggested that non-aeolian mound over-dispersion, elongation, volumes, soil properties and stratigraphy are consistent with vegetation patches protecting soil from erosion, resulting in preferential erosional deflation of the inter-mound area leaving regularly spaced mounds. Although mima-like mounds around the world are formed in diverse vegetation types, climates and edaphic conditions, many may be long-term products of vegetation spatial patterning in which plant canopies and root systems increase sediment capture and reduce erosional losses.

AB 1. Mobility is important for the understanding of how species survive in fragmented landscapes and cope with increasing rates of habitat and climate change. However, mobility is a difficult trait to explore and is poorly known in most taxa. Species traits have been studied in relation to range shifts, extinction risks, and responses to habitat area and isolation, and have also been suggested as good estimators of mobility. Here we explore the relation between mobility and species traits in noctuid moths.
   2. We sampled noctuid moths by an automatic light-trap on an island far out in the Baltic Sea. We compared traits of the non-resident species on the island with traits of a species pool of assumed potential migrants from the Swedish mainland.
   3. Mobility was significantly related to adult activity period, length of flight period, and the interaction between host-plant specificity and distribution area. Widely distributed host-plant generalists were more mobile than host-plant specialists with more restricted distribution, and species with an adult activity period in August to September moved to the island to a higher extent than species with an adult activity period in May to July. Our results remained qualitatively robust in additional analyses, after controlling for phylogeny and including all species recorded on the island, except for the trait 'length of flight period'.
   4. Our results highlight the importance of the relation between mobility and species traits. Noctuid moths with certain traits move over longer distances than earlier known. This finding is important to include when predicting range dynamics in fragmented and changing landscapes, and when conservation measures of species are devised.

AB Sewall Wright introduced the metaphor of evolution Oil "adaptive landscapes" in a pair of papers published in 1931 and 1932. The metaphor has been one of the Most influential in modern evolutionary biology, although recent theoretical advancements show that it is deeply flawed and may have actually created research questions that are not, in fact, fecund. In this paper I examine in detail what Wright actually said in the 1932 paper, its well as what he thought of the matter at the very end of his career, in 1988. While the metaphor is flawed, some of the problems which Wright was attempting to address are still with LIS today, and are in the process of being reformulated as part of a forthcoming Extended Evolutionary Synthesis.

AB Simulation modelling is a methodology that appears highly suitable for use in farming systems innovation. However, if the aim is to improve I-arming systems by supporting farmer behaviour change, model-based approaches seem to have delivered Surprisingly little observable benefit to date. This paper identifies the problems underlying this apparent lack of impact, and proposes better approaches to improve on-farm benefits from farming systems modelling. A key principle that has been neglected in farm Simulation modelling is intimate involvement of clients (defined as "the individuals or groups whose approval is needed for change to be implemented") throughout the innovation process. We argue that client participation is essential in the problem definition, model design and testing and policy design and evaluation phases of model-based research projects. The role of a simulation model within the innovation process, then, is to be a jointly-created "virtual world" wherein experiments may be conducted to facilitate learning about the relevant system. We argue that whole simulation models that use decision rules to specify alternative farm management strategies are the best available form of virtual world models of farming systems. Besides appropriate client input, high quality models require excellent software development practices and Strenuous attention to building User confidence. The latter should include analysing the model to assess its stability and sensitivity properties, before using it to simulate experiments that compare several management alternatives under a ran-e of environmental and local conditions. This approach allows estimation of the variations in farm system performance that are likely to result from interactions between initial farm state. farm management policy and future weather and markets. On the other hand, using simulation models to discover "optimal" farm systems Would usually be inappropriate due to the complexity arising from multiple-stakeholder views, multiple-criteria, and the dynamic nature of farming systems problems. An improved systems modelling methodology is proposed that should be better able to provide benefits into farming practice.

AB Dispersal is a significant determinant of the pattern and process of invasions; however, weed dispersal distances are rarely described and descriptions of dispersal kernels are completely lacking for vertebrate-dispersed weeds. Here, we describe dispersal kernels generated by a native disperser, the endangered southern cassowary (Casuarius casuarius, L.) for an invasive, tropical rainforest plant, pond apple (Annona glabra, L.). Pond apple is primarily water-dispersed and is managed as such. We consider whether cassowary dispersal, as a numerically subordinate dispersal mode, provides an additional dispersal service that may modify the invasion process. In infested areas, pond apple seed was common in cassowary dung. Gut passage had no effect on the probability of single seed germination but deposition in clumps or as whole fruits reduced the probability of germination below that of single seeds. Gut passage times ranged from 65 to 1675 min. Combined with cassowary movement data, this resulted in estimated dispersal distances of 12.5-5212 m, with a median distance of 387 m (quartile range 112-787 m). Native frugivores can be effective dispersers of weeds in rainforest and even terrestrial dispersers can provide long-distance dispersal. Importantly, though pond apple might be expected to be almost entirely dispersed downstream and along the margins of aquatic and marine habitats, cassowaries provide dispersal upstream and between drainages, leading to novel dispersal outcomes. Even through the provision of small quantities of novel dispersal outcomes, subordinate dispersal modes can play a significant role in determining invasion pattern and influence the ultimate success of control programs by providing dispersal to locations unattainable via the primary mode.

AB It has been documented in the many-lined sun skink (Mabuya multifasciata) that pregnant females select lower body temperatures (27.6-30.8 degrees C) than do nonpregnant females and adult males (29.7-35.7 degrees C). We therefore used the skink to test the hypothesis that the maximization of reproductive benefits should be achieved in pregnant females by shifting thermal preferences towards the levels optimal for embryonic development but entailing relatively small costs of reproduction. Data on adult males showed that temperatures maximizing swimming stamina (indicative of locomotor endurance) fell within the range of body temperatures selected by nonpregnant females and adult males. Data on swimming stamina and feeding performance of pregnant females, nonpregnant females and adult males measured at 26 and 30 degrees C showed that: (1) pregnancy impaired locomotor and feeding performances, but such impairments did not persist after parturition; (2) the degree of locomotor impairment during pregnancy was greater at 26 degrees C than at 30 degrees C, but the degree of feeding impairment during pregnancy was greater at 30 degrees C than at 26 degrees C. Pregnant females of M. multifasciata selecting body temperatures at about 29 degrees C could not only produce good-quality offspring in a relatively short gestation length but also reduce reproductive costs associated with locomotor and feeding impairments to some extent. Thus, data from M. multifasciata validate the above hypothesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Using museum data of adult specimens whose sex, age, and locality are known, we studied temporal and geographical body size trends among the otter, Lutra lutra, in Norway. We found that body size of the otters increased during the last quarter of the twentieth century, and suggest that this trend is related to increased food availability from fish farming and possibly also to energy saving due to elevated sea temperatures. Birth year and death year explained 38.8 and 43.5%, respectively, of the variation in body size. Body size of otters was positively related to latitude, thus conforming to Bergmann's rule.

AB During the last four decades, the coral reef at Eilat, northern Red Sea, has undergone major changes. Increasing impacts from human activities, coupled with those from natural disasters, have set off its current poor state. Here, I critically overview the salient features for Eilat's reef degradation published since the 1960s. Although this reef is one of the most intensively studied small coral reef worldwide, the literature elucidates that the available results are exceedingly fragmented, offering only scanty knowledge for the causes and pathways of the reef deterioration. During the years, 1975-2000, scarcely any reef evaluation had been done and the reef at Eilat was not well characterized to establish baseline data for future evaluations and for analyzing the trends. Even the follow up studies on the extreme low tide episode (occurred during 1970) are limited and localized, and cannot be used as a model case in calibrating Eilat reef status. Natural forces affecting the reef at Eilat are understood only vaguely, and coral assemblages/recruitments, even between neighboring sites, vary markedly in any studied biological-ecological parameter. The importance of the complex networks of interactions between algae, their grazers and corals for structuring coral assemblages, were overlooked, and massive algal growths were mistakenly attributed to anthropogenic impacts alone. Whereas, no long-term study can provide much indication for future prospects, at present, the tourist industry is probably the major cause for reef decline. Surprisingly, the literature further unveils at some sites various ecological properties, such as species diversity and densities of coral species and colonies, similarly to the values recorded decades ago and reveals that the paucity of information has led to conclusions unsubstantiated by robust sets of experiments. At this stage, therefore, decisive conclusions pertaining to the causes and pathways of Eilat reef degradation cannot be reached. Four future prospectuses are outlined, including the need for implementation of active restoration measures. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we concentrate on spatial aspects of growth and reproduction for sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) to advance the general theory for development of reference points for sessile animals and to illustrate the general points with several specific examples. Nonlinear mixed effects models can be used to define the spatial distribution of growth rates and their implications for the definition of growth overfishing. We develop a basin model to illustrate that the typical "boom and bust" effects, often attributed to environmental factors, are explained equally well by spatial variations in habitat quality, spatial concentration of fisheries, and dispersal of larvae among areas. Results suggest that incentives to concentrate fishing effort in lower productivity areas may be an effective tool for reducing recruitment variation and improving yields. Reductions in fishing mortality might be possible with closed areas as they can be used to reduce the concentration of effort on high scallop densities. Further, rotational area management strategies can offer the promise of balancing demands for increased yield, prevention of recruitment overfishing, maintaining spawning reserves, and reducing habitat damage and bycatch.

AB We investigated the relationship between seed size and seed survival in the soil in 67 species from arid Australia. There was a very weak, marginally significant positive relationship between the viability of fresh seeds and diaspore mass. However, by the time seeds had been buried in the soil for 1 year in nylon mesh bags, there was a highly significant positive relationship between diaspore mass and diaspore viability. Over the range of seed masses observed, a tenfold increase in diaspore mass was associated with a threefold increase in the odds of surviving 1 year of burial in the soil. Thus, large-seeded species were favoured over small-seeded species during this important selective process. However, the magnitude of this advantage was small compared with the advantage experienced by small-seeded species during seed production. We also investigated aspects of diaspore morphology in relation to viability retention during burial. We found no relationship between seed survival and the amount of protective tissue per unit diaspore surface area. Diaspore mass was a better predictor of survival than was diaspore surface area.

AB Experiments were conducted to assess the influences of granivores on the seed bank in sagebrush-steppe. Rodent and/or ant exclosures were established at two distances from five harvester ant mounds. Monthly soil samples were collected from the exclosures, and from open access areas at two distances to ascertain changes in the seed bank. Seed dish experiments were conducted monthly to establish a maximum seed removal rate. Rodents were trapped monthly, More seeds were recovered from rodent exclosures than from ant exclosures. Seed banks changed temporally and spatially, with more seeds recovered in September and at 6 m from mounds. Rodents removed seeds more rapidly from seed dishes than did ants. Ants removed more seeds from dishes closest to the nests. Rodents may have a larger impact on the local seed bank than harvester ants. Ant activities, other than seed consumption, may have more influence on vegetation. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB This work describes the long-term acclimation of the halotolerant microalga Dunaliella viridis to different photon irradiance, ranging from darkness to 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1.) In order to assess the effects of long-term photoinhibition, changes in oxygen production rate, pigment composition, xanthophyll cycle and in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence using the saturating pulse method were measured. Growth rate was maximal at intermediate irradiance (250 and 700 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). The increase in growth irradiance from 700 to 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) did not lead to further significant changes in pigment composition or EPS, indicating saturation in the pigment response to high light. Changes in Photosystem II optimum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) evidenced photoinhibition at 700 and especially at 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The relation between photosynthetic electron flow rate and photosyntetic O-2 evolution was linear for cultures in darkness shifting to curvilinear as growth irradiance increased, suggesting the interference of the energy dissipation processes in oxygen evolution. Carbon assimilation efficiencies were studied in relation to changes in growth rate, internal carbon and nitrogen composition, and organic carbon released to the external medium. All illuminated cultures showed a high capability to maintain a C:N ratio between 6 and 7. The percentage of organic carbon released to the external medium increased to its maximum under high irradiance (1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). These results suggest that the release of organic carbon could act as a secondary dissipation process when the xanthophyll cycle is saturated.

AB 1 The present study provides quantitative estimates of soil, vegetation structure and species distribution in 144 stands along two transects in two extreme desert zones of western Egypt. This study had two aims: (1) to describe the floristic composition of the accidental type of vegetation growing in parts of the Western Desert of Egypt; and (2) to analyse the distribution of species in relation to certain environmental factors by multivariate data analysis.
   2 Eight environmental variables were recorded: salinity, pH, calcium carbonate, soil moisture, organic matter content, and percentages of sand, silt and clay. A total of 60 species belonging to 19 families of the angiosperms and Ephedra alata was recorded. Chamaephytes and therophytes were the most frequent, denoting a typical desert life-form spectrum, mainly of Saharo-Arabian distribution.
   3 The samples were classified into eight twinspan groups. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) showed that these groups could be distinguished by the first two DCA axes. They could also be effectively interpreted and explained with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Based on forward regression, salinity, fine sediments, organic matter and soil moisture content related closely to the first three canonical axes, and accounted for 84.1% of the species-environment relationship among the stands.
   4 Both classification and ordination resulted in a clear demonstration of the vegetation pattern in the study area. Other twinspan groups were characterized in addition to those identified previously. In conclusion, the study area has a transitional character where the Nubian Desert and the Northern Mediterranean vegetation meet.

AB Productivity and calcification were measured across a small, representative patch of the fringing reef near-Eilat, Israel in early March 1990. Measurements were made by floating an instrument package across the reef patch with the current and measuring changes in oxygen concentration and pH together with water temperature and light intensity (photosynthetically active radiation). Average rates of photosynthesis, respiration, calcification and solution of reef rock were estimated for the reef patch at different times of the day and, hence, at different light intensities. Light response curves were constructed for productivity and calcification and used, together with the diurnal light regime, to provide estimates for daily metabolic performance. Gross productivity for the reef patch was 12.3 gC . m-2 . d-1. The production: respiration ratio was 1.6:1. Net calcification was 16.3 gCaCO3 . m-2  . d-1, which extrapolates to 6.0 kgCaCO3 . m-2 . year-1. Although the reef is growing at high latitude, in a hypersaline environment, and is subject to unnatural pressures, its metabolic performance matches the performance of equivalent reefal areas in the tropical Indo-Pacific.

AB We review the literature on the relationship between water temperature and size of freshwater phytoplankton, to examine the hypothesis that freshwater phytoplankton, like marine phytoplankton and many other groups of organisms, conform to Bergmann's Rule and become smaller with warming. We provide both experimental and field evidence in support of the above hypothesis, much of this evidence was hidden in studies focused on other issues, but presenting temperature and phytoplankton size data. Freshwater phytoplankton size shrinks with increasing temperature at both the species level (by cells or colonies becoming smaller) and at the community level (shift to smaller species). Exceptions to the Rule do occur but in most cases those exceptions can be explained by indirect effects of temperature on phytoplankton size, via processes such as grazing or nutrient availability. With global warming, freshwater phytoplankton are likely to be of smaller size. This article is dedicated to Colin S. Reynolds, who has had a leading role in our personal education and understanding of phytoplankton ecology.

AB The evolution of secondary (insular) woodiness and the rapid disparification of plant growth forms associated with island radiations show intriguing parallels between oceanic islands and tropical alpine sky islands. However, the evolutionary significance of these phenomena remains poorly understood and the focus of debate. We explore the evolutionary dynamics of species diversification and trait disparification across evolutionary radiations in contrasting island systems compared with their nonisland relatives. We estimate rates of species diversification, growth form evolution and phenotypic space saturation for the classical oceanic island plant radiations - the Hawaiian silverswords and Macaronesian Echium - and the well-studied sky island radiations of Lupinus and Hypericum in the Andes. We show that secondary woodiness is associated with dispersal to islands and with accelerated rates of species diversification, accelerated disparification of plant growth forms and occupancy of greater phenotypic trait space for island clades than their nonisland relatives, on both oceanic and sky islands. We conclude that secondary woodiness is a prerequisite that could act as a key innovation, manifest as the potential to occupy greater trait space, for plant radiations on island systems in general, further emphasizing the importance of combinations of clade-specific traits and ecological opportunities in driving adaptive radiations.

AB A quantitative analysis of wing variation in grasshoppers can help us to understand how environmental heterogeneity affects the phenotypic patterns of insects. In this study, geometric morphometric methods were used to measure the differences in wing shape and size of Trilophidia annulata among 39 geographical populations in China, and a regression analysis was applied to identify the major environmental factors contributing to the observed morphological variations. The results showed that the size of the forewing and hindwing were significantly different among populations; the shape of the forewing among populations can be divided into geographical groups, however hindwing shape are geographical overlapped, and populations cannot be divided into geographical groups. Environmental PCA and thin-plate spline analysis suggested that smaller individuals with shorter and blunter-tip forewings were mainly distributed in the lower latitudes and mountainous areas, where they have higher temperatures and more precipitation. Correspondingly, the larger-bodied grasshoppers, those that have longer forewings with a longer radial sector, are distributed in contrary circumstances. We conclude that the size variations in body, forewing and hindwing of T. annulata apparently follow the Bergmann clines. The importance of climatic variables in influencing morphological variation among populations, forewing shape of T. annulata varies along an environmental gradient.

AB Animal populations are exposed to large-scale anthropogenic impact from e.g. climate change, habitat alteration and supplemental stocking. All of these may affect body condition in wintering dabbling ducks, which in turn may affect an individual's survival and reproductive success. The aim of this study was to assess whether there have been morphometric changes in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Teal (Anas crecca) over the last 30 years at a major wintering site. Body mass and condition increased from the 1950s-1960s to the 2000s in both species. The increase in body mass amounted to as much as 11.7%, with no corresponding change in body size. Improved body condition was maintained from early to mid-winter, but then converged with historical values for late winter. Our interpretation is that increasingly benign ambient winter conditions permit ducks to maintain better energetic "safety margins" throughout winter, and that converging spring departure values may be related to evolutionary flight energetic optima. The observed changes are consistent with large-scale climate amelioration and local/regional habitat improvement (both anthropogenic).

AB The hypothesis that physical constraints may be as important, if not more important, than biological ones in shaping the structure of phytoplankton assemblage was tested by analyzing long-term (11-29 years) phytoplankton series in eight lakes and nine sites located along a latitudinal gradient in the Northern hemisphere. Phytoplankton biomass was used and similarity of assemblages in same months of the annual data sets was then calculated by subtracting the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index from 1. The extent of biological and physical forcing was partly based on "expert evaluation": the importance of four physical (light availability, temperature, conductivity, and sediment stirring up) and five biological variables (basic nutrients [SRP-, DIN-, SRSi-availability] as estimators of competition straight, importance of grazing, and importance of parasitism) was evaluated month by month by arbitrarily scaling from 1 to 5 the intensity of each variable and then summing them in the appropriate subgroup. Since the number of physical variables is less than that of the biological ones, the latter was rescaled to reach the same maximum attainable value of physical variables. The results showed an extremely high variability, making evident that each lake, although showing the same metabolic processes, behaves as an individual with regard to its phytoplankton structure. More generally, it was possible to highlight a largely more important role of physical constraints in shaping both biomass and composition of phytoplankton. This is especially true in winter. In addition, the results were compared to the outcomes of the PEG model, since a plasticity in the structure of phytoplankton much greater than that reported in this widely acknowledged model has been recorded in the data set used. This high variability found in this study in relation to physical constraints might also explain the different patterns of phytoplankton growth observed from Northern temperate to Mediterranean lakes as well as those occurring in shallow and deep lakes.

AB The population dynamics of a consumer population with an internal structure is investigated. The population is divided into juvenile and adult individuals that consume different resources and do not interfere with each other. Over a broad range of external conditions (varying mortality and different resource levels), alternative stable states exist. These population states correspond to domination of juveniles and domination of adults, respectively. When mortality is varied, hysteresis between the alternative states only occurs if juveniles have more resources than adults. In the opposite case the juvenile-dominated state is stable for all values of mortality, but the adult-dominated state is not. When the population is modelled with more than one juvenile stage, the adult-dominated state becomes a periodic orbit due to a delay in the regulatory mechanism of the population dynamics. It is shown numerically that the stage-structured model converges to a model with continuous size structure for very large numbers of successive juvenile stages. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB To better understand the evolutionary and ecological effects of dispersal, there is growing emphasis on the need to integrate direct data on movement behaviour into landscape-scale analyses. However, little is known about the general link between movement behaviour and large-scale patterns of dispersal and gene flow. Likewise, although recent studies suggest that nonrandom, directionally biased movement and dispersal can promote evolutionary divergence, the generality of this mechanism is unknown. We test the hypothesis that directionally biased movement and dispersal by plethodontid salamanders interact with the topography of headwater areas to affect genetic and phenotypic divergence. Movements by Gyrinophilus porphyriticus and Eurycea bislineata show contrasting directional biases: upstream bias in G. porphyriticus and downstream bias in E. bislineata. Consistent with predictions of how these biases interact with slope to affect dispersal and gene flow, genetic distance increased with slope in G. porphyriticus and decreased with slope in E. bislineata over a standardized distance of 1 km along six headwater streams. In both species, phenotypic divergence in relative trunk length was positively related to genetic divergence. These results indicate that landscape-scale patterns of dispersal and gene flow are closely related to movement behaviour in G. porphyriticus and E. bislineata, and underscore the value of information on movement behaviour for predicting and interpreting patterns of dispersal and gene flow in complex landscapes. This study also provides new evidence that directionally biased movement and dispersal can be important sources of intra- and interspecific variation in population divergence, and highlights the value of explicit, a priori predictions in landscape genetic studies.

AB Nectar standing crops in flowers within an individual plant are often highly variable. This variability may be a by-product of the foraging activity of insect pollinators. Alternatively, plants may be selected to produce highly variable rewards to reduce consecutive visitation by risk-averse pollinators, thus diminishing within-plant pollen transfer. This study evaluated the roles of pollinator control vs. plant control over nectar variability in the bee-pollinated shrub Rosmarinus officinalis L. (Lamiaceae). We sampled nectar production, standing crop and pollinator visits in three shrubs of one population over 17 days during one blooming season. Nectar production rates were highly variable (CV = 1.48), and increased after rainy days. Nectar standing crops were even more variable (CV = 2.16), decreased with increasing temperatures, and increased with time since the last rain. Pollinator visit rates decreased with variability in nectar standing crops, increased with flower number per shrub, and were unaffected by variability in nectar production rates. Repeated sampling of marked flowers revealed no correlation between their nectar standing crops and production rates. These findings support the role of reward variance in reducing pollinator visits, but suggest that plants are not in complete control of this variability. Rather, plant-generated variability can be modified by intensive foraging activity of pollinators. Such pollinator control over nectar variability is likely to reduce the selective advantage of plant-generated reward variation.

AB The conservation importance of estuaries is often measured by bird numbers, but monitoring numbers is not necessarily a reliable way of assessing changes in site quality. We used an individual-based model, comprised of fitness-maximising individuals, to assess the quality of the Humber estuary, UK, for 9 shorebirds; dunlin Calidris alpina, common ringed plover Charadrius hiaticula, red knot Calidris canutus, common redshank Tringa totanus, grey plover Pluvialis squatarola, blacktailed godwit Limosa limosa, bar-tailed godwit L. lapponica, Eurasian oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata. We measured site quality as predicted overwinter survival. The model accurately predicted the observed shorebird distribution (if non-starving birds were assumed to feed on any prey or patch on which intake rate equalled or exceeded their requirements), and the diets of most species. Predicted survival rates were highest in dunlin and common ringed plovers, the smallest species, and in Eurasian oystercatchers, which consumed larger prey than the other species. Shorebird survival was most strongly influenced by the biomass densities of annelid worms, and the bivalve molluscs Cerastoderma edule and Macoma balthica. A 2 to 8 % reduction in intertidal area (the magnitude expected through sea level rise and industrial developments) decreased predicted survival rates of all species except the dunlin, common ringed plover, red knot and Eurasian oystercatcher. This paper shows how an individual-based model can assess present-day site quality and predict how site quality may change in the future. The model was developed using existing data from intertidal invertebrate and bird monitoring schemes plus new intertidal invertebrate data collected over 2 winters. We believe that individual-based models are useful tools for assessing estuarine site quality.

AB We studied morphological relationships within three guilds of gerbillid rodents in Israel. We found a nonrandom pattern of overdispersed means (community-wide character displacement) for upper incisor widths among the species in these three guilds. Upper tooth-row lengths, condylo-basal skull lengths, and tooth-row surfaces displayed similar patterns. We also studied seed-size selection by two well-studied gerbil species, which have previously been found to compete, in order to test whether specializing on husking seeds of different sizes as a mechanism of coexistence may underlie the morphological patterns. The seed-size selection experiments took place in two large aviaries with artificial lighting simulating full-moon nights, which is when predation risk is perceived as high. Seeds of different sizes (commercial seeds in one experiment and husked wheat particles in the other) mixed with sand were offered in trays. The larger Gerbillus pyramidum took significantly larger commercial seeds and marginally larger wheat particles than the smaller Gerbillus allenbyi. The patterns attest to ecomorphological convergence at the guild level; we previously demonstrated size structuring in several North American heteromyid rodent guilds, and we now report similar size structuring among Israeli gerbillid guilds. The occurrence of convergent community structure strongly indicates general rules governing ecological communities or guilds.

DE coral reefs; Red Sea; Eilat; mass transport; fluorescent tracers;
   pollution
AB Over the last decades, damage to coral reefs from pollution and over-exploitation has accelerated alarmingly. The coral reefs of Eilat are currently undergoing such severe deterioration, and it has been suggested that pollution may be responsible. The Eilat pollution sources are located 5-8 km north of the coral reefs, and it is hypothesised that the pollutants reach the reef sites by current-derived mass transport. This study aimed to test this hypothesis by determining possible occurrence of mass transport from the pollution sites to the reefs, and to determine the pathways and modes of transported pollutants. We also wished to test the applicability of the 'fluorescently-labelled tracer' method, as a reliable tool for assessing mass transport in coastal marine environments. The results reveal that particulate matter from pollution sites reaches the remote coral reefs of Eilat, both as bedload and suspension-load particles. Estimates suggest that the minimum velocity of fine particles (5-10 mu m), as suspension load, is 0.4km per day; while the coarse particle velocity (100-200 mu m), as bedload, is an order of magnitude lower, i,e, 0.04 km per day. The results show that fluorescently-labelled tracers are a reliable and highly sensitive tool for assessing mass transport in marine environments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Life history characters (body size of adults, egg diameter, egg sac length and breadth) of nineteen species of central European cyclopoid copepods were measured and sexual size dimorphism (adult female length x adult male length(-1)), relative egg size (egg weight x body weight(-1)), weight of adult females and of eggs, egg sac shape (egg sac length x egg sac breadth(-1)), and reproductive effort (clutch weight produced per female weight per day) were calculated to detect trends in life history strategies.
   2. Typical planktonic species exhibited the lowest reproductive effort. Among planktonic species, the value for egg sac shape increased with clutch size.
   3. Large species and small species exhibited different trends in life history characters. Large species had larger clutches, larger eggs, and a greater sex size dimorphism than small species. However, small species had a greater relative egg size.
   4. Large species live in cold water and reproduce during the spring bloom of phytoplankton where the production of large clutches with relatively small eggs is advantageous. Reserves are unnecessary for juveniles because food is abundant. Small species generally are most abundant during the warm season, when conditions are less predictable, and relatively large eggs, possibly provided with reserves, are advantageous.

AB A major challenge in rangeland ecology is understanding diverse responses of diversity to grazing, what factors determine these responses and what their relative importance is. Numerous site-level studies have explored grazing-diversity relations, but meta-analyses of these empirical results at a global scale are scarce. Our goals were to estimate the mean effect of grazing on plant richness and to assess the relative importance of different variables at a global scale. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 259 comparisons of plant richness in grazed vs. ungrazed sites from 96 published studies. Then, we performed analyses of subgroup, meta-regression and correlation for testing the relative roles of regional and local variables (e.g. evolutionary history of grazing, aridity, stocking rate, etc.).
   Globally, grazing significantly increased plant richness compared to grazing exclusion, especially in wet grasslands. The effect of evolutionary history of grazing was insignificant, which cannot support the major perception behind Milchunas-Sala-Lauenroth (MSL) model. Aridity, vegetation type, and stocking rate were three important variables that together explained 41 % of the global variation in plant richness. The roles of stocking rate and duration of grazing exclusion were revealed only when aridity and vegetation type were added to the analyses, which showed a stronger effect of stocking rate in wet areas but a stronger effect of the duration of grazing exclusion in dry areas. Changes in plant richness were significantly correlated with changes in soil carbon and nitrogen, both showing hump-shaped patterns.
   Our findings substantiate that scholars may improve existing theories (e.g. the MSL model, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis) through further expounding the interactions between grazing variables and aridity and vegetation type. Rangeland managers need to devise local-scale grazing strategies for conserving plant diversity according to site-specific conditions, rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all solution.

AB It has been suggested that larger species of mammals tend to become long-faced when they diverge in size during an evolutionary radiation. However, whether this allometric pattern, reminiscent of ontogenetic changes in skull proportions, is indeed a rule has yet to be thoroughly tested. Using similar to 6000 adult specimens from 14 phylogenetically well separated and ecomorphologically distinctive lineages, 11 orders, and all superorders of the placentals, I tested each group for positive craniofacial allometry (CREA). The evidence supporting CREA is overwhelming, with virtually all analyses showing proportionally longer faces in bigger species. This corroborates previous studies in other groups, consolidates CREA as a pervasive morphological trend in placental evolution and opens important research avenues for connecting micro- and macro-evolution. If found in even more lineages of non-placental mammals, confirmed in birds, and possibly discovered in other tetrapods, CREA could become one of the most general rules of morphological evolution in land vertebrates.

AB Soils are crucial in regulating ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling, and supporting plant growth. To a large extent, these functions are carried out by highly diverse and dynamic soil microbiomes that are in turn governed by numerous environmental factors including weathering profile and vegetation. In this study, we investigate geophysical and vegetation effects on the microbial communities of iron-rich lateritic soils in the highly weathered landscapes of Western Australia (WA). The study site was a lateritic hillslope in southwestern Australia, where gradual erosion of the duricrust has resulted in the exposure of the different weathering zones. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to investigate soil bacterial community diversity, composition and functioning. We predicted that shifts in the microbial community would reflect variations in certain edaphic properties associated with the different layers of the lateritic profile and vegetation cover. Our results supported this hypothesis, with electrical conductivity, pH and clay content having the strongest correlation with beta diversity, and many of the differentially abundant taxa belonging to the phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Soil water repellence, which is associated with Eucalyptus vegetation, also affected beta diversity. This enhanced understanding of the natural system could help to improve future crop management in WA since the physicochemical properties of the agricultural soils in this region are inherited from laterites via the weathering and pedogenesis processes.

AB 1. The human population is rapidly urbanizing, and the negative impacts of urban cover on biodiversity and ecosystem function are expected to increase. Trophic dynamics have been hypothesized to change with urbanization, with consequences for biodiversity and function. Here, I review recent progress in this area by focusing on how urbanization affects dietary sources, trophic interactions and the functional ecology of synanthropic species.
   2. Urbanization affects primary autochthonous production in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by replacing and fragmenting natural areas with impervious cover, increasing nutrient supply, changing hydrological regimes, and altering the composition and seasonality of primary producers. The responses of primary production differ between climatic regions or across hydrological regimes.
   3. Urbanization can also change the availability of subsidies (autochthonous vs. allochthonous resources) because many urban species feed on human food (anthropogenic subsidies) and because of changes in the plant composition and physical characteristics of riparian zones.
   4. Urbanization can change the composition of consumers by decreasing the abundance of apex predators, releasing mesopredators, as well as the introduction of non-native omnivores.
   5. Few direct experiments have been conducted on trophic interactions in urban ecosystems. They broadly suggest that urbanization weakens herbivory and predation, but that it might increase competition between synanthropic and urbanophobic species. However, the outcomes of these interactions are highly context-specific.
   6. The reliance of synanthropic species on anthropogenic subsidies appears to be an important aspect of urban trophic ecology. However, more research is needed to understand how dietary flexibility, especially in relation to anthropogenic subsidies, contributes to the physiology and population dynamics of synanthropes.
   7. Urbanization can dramatically change trophic dynamics in the urban ecosystem with implications for biodiversity patterns, management and conservation. However, it is clear that a broader and more mechanistic understanding of the urban food webs is needed. This can be accomplished through inclusion of functional trophic metrics in monitoring efforts, the use of stable isotope food web metrics, the use of multi-trophic-level experiments and a more detailed study of the functional ecology of synanthropes.

AB The applicability of macroecological rules to patterns in body size varies between taxa. One of the most examined is Bergmann's rule, which states that body size increases with decreasing temperature and increasing latitude, although the rule is not universal and the proposed mechanisms underpinning it are multifarious and lack congruence. This study considers the degree to which Bergmann's rule applies to the Southern Ocean mesopelagic fish community. We studied patterns in body size, temperature, and latitude across a 127 latitudinal gradient within the Scotia-Weddell sector. Intraspecific Bergmann's rule was found to apply to 8 of the 11 biomass-dominant species in the family Myctophidae. The rule was also apparent at an interspecific level. Our study suggests that greater attainable body size in this community is a necessary attribute to reach colder regions further south. The adherence of these taxa to Bergmann's rule enables such species to act as sentinels for identifying the drivers and consequences of ocean warming for the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

AB Understanding how desertification takes place in different ecosystems is an important step in attempting to forecast and prevent such transitions. Dryland ecosystems often exhibit patchy vegetation, which has been shown to be an important factor on the possible regime shifts that occur in arid regions in several model studies. In particular, both gradual shifts that occur by front propagation, and abrupt shifts where patches of vegetation vanish at once, are a possibility in dryland ecosystems due to their emergent spatial heterogeneity. However, recent theoretical work has suggested that the final step of desertification - the transition from spotted vegetation to bare soil - occurs only as an abrupt shift, but the generality of this result, and its underlying origin, remain unclear. We investigate two models that detail the dynamics of dryland vegetation using a markedly different functional structure, and find that in both models the final step of desertification can only be abrupt. Using a careful numerical analysis, we show that this behavior is associated with the disappearance of confined spot-pattern domains as stationary states, and identify the mathematical origin of this behavior. Our findings show that a gradual desertification to bare soil due to a front propagation process can not occur in these and similar models, and opens the question of whether these dynamics can take place in nature.

AB Blood flukes of the family Spirorchiidae are significant pathogens of both free-ranging and captive marine turtles. Despite a significant proportion of marine turtle mortality being attributable to spirorchiid infections, details of their life cycles remain almost entirely unknown. Here we report on the molecular elucidation of the complete life cycle of a marine spirorchiid, identified as Amphiorchis sp., infecting vermetid gastropods and captive hatched neonate Caretta caretta in the Oceanografic Aquarium, in Valencia, Spain. Specimens of a vermetid gastropod, Thylaeodus cf. rugulosus (Monterosato, 1878), collected from the aquarium filtration system housing diseased C. caretta, were infected with sporocysts and cercariae consistent with the family Spirorchiidae. We generated rDNA sequence data [internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and partial 28S rDNA] from infections from the vermetid which were identical to sequences generated from eggs from the serosa of the intestine of neonate C caretta, and an adult spirorchiid from the liver of a C. caretta from Florida, USA. Given the reliability of these markers in the delineation of trematode species, we consider all three stages to represent the same species and tentatively identify it as a species of Amphiorchis Price, 1934. The source of infection at the Oceanografic Foundation Rehabilitation Centre, Valencia, Spain, is inferred to be an adult C. caretta from the western Mediterranean being rehabilitated in the same facility. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this Amphiorchis sp. is closely related to other spirorchiids of marine turtles (species of Carettacola Manter & Larson, 1950, Hapalotrema Looss, 1899 and Learedius Price, 1934). We discuss implications of the present findings for the control of spirorchiidiasis in captivity, for the better understanding of epidemiology in wild individuals, and the elucidation of further life cycles.

AB Habitat fragmentation can create significant impediments to dispersal. A technique to increase dispersal between otherwise isolated fragments is the use of corridors. Although previous studies have compared dispersal between connected fragments to dispersal between unconnected fragments, it remains unknown how dispersal between fragments connected by a corridor compares to dispersal in unfragmented landscapes. To assess the extent to which corridors can restore dispersal in fragmented landscapes to levels observed in unfragmented landscapes, we employed a stable-isotope marking technique to track seeds within four unfragmented landscapes and eight experimental landscapes with fragments connected by corridors. We studied two wind-and two bird-dispersed plant species, because previous community-based research showed that dispersal mode explains how connectivity effects vary among species. We constructed dispersal kernels for these species in unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments by marking seeds in the center of each landscape with N-15 and then recovering marked seeds in seed traps at distances up to 200 m. For the two wind-dispersed plants, seed dispersal kernels were similar in unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments. In contrast, dispersal kernels of bird-dispersed seeds were both affected by fragmentation and differed in the direction of the impact: Morella cerifera experienced more and Rhus copallina experienced less long-distance dispersal in unfragmented than in connected landscapes. These results show that corridors can facilitate dispersal probabilities comparable to those observed in unfragmented landscapes. Although dispersal mode may provide useful broad predictions, we acknowledge that similar species may respond uniquely due to factors such as seasonality and disperser behavior. Our results further indicate that prior work has likely underestimated dispersal distances of wind-dispersed plants and that factors altering long-distance dispersal may have a greater impact on the spread of species than previously thought.

AB Over the last decades, mass developments by the filamentous conjugating green alga Mougeotia have been followed in three large peri-alpine lakes (Lake Geneva, Lake Garda, Lake Maggiore) and in the sub-tropical Lake Kinneret. The aim of this study is to highlight annual and interannual patterns of Mougeotia biomass in the studied lakes and select key environmental parameters that may favour and maintain its mass development. Our results confirm former studies that planktic Mougeotia favours meso-oligotrophic conditions and becomes dominant when annual mean total phosphorus concentrations in the epilimnion fall below 20 A mu g l(-1). This triggering factor has effect with interactions of other environmental circumstances such as the water column stability. Physiological and morphological features of the taxon make it a successful competitor under stratified conditions. Results also showed that in three out of the four studied lakes, the annual peak was higher when the annual population development started earlier. Focusing on Lake Geneva, depth and strength of the thermocline, as well as wind speed in the beginning of summer that can cause nutrient replenishment and mix the epilimnion are key factors in the blooming of the taxon.

AB A fundamental goal in ecology is to understand distribution and abundance of species. Peripheral populations inhabiting the trailing-edge of a species' distribution may carry considerable ecological and evolutionary value yet being most threatened under predicted climate change scenarios. However, the nature of species distributional limits and the ecological and genetic implications of living at low latitude rear edges remain unclear. The assumption that population abundance declines towards range edges, where environmental selective pressure increases, is the basis of a wide range of ecological and evolutionary predictions. Empirical data have provided contrasting evidence about the consequences of living at low latitude distributional limits, raising concerns regarding their generality and highlighting the need for combined multidisciplinary tests. Here, we provide a long-term, comprehensive evaluation of latitudinal patterns in genetic diversity, demographic, morphological and life history traits in the marine macroalga Fucus guiryi.
   The center to edge transition was mirrored by increasing water and air temperature gradients, with sea surface temperature of coldest months being the most relevant influence on F. guiryi traits. Overall, we identified a strong correlation between ecological data, collected over one year at bimonthly intervals, and distance to the range center. We found decreasing population and individual size towards distributional margins. Similarly, reproductive capacity, threshold size for reproduction, density of reproductive population and recruitment rates showed a core to edge reduction. Temporal variability of individual reproductive effort and recruitment rates did not conform to the general pattern. In contrast, population genetic data did not show a core-edge gradient, as gene diversity and allelic richness were not significantly lower at edge populations, contradicting predictions of higher drift and bottlenecks for smaller edge populations.
   The contrasting support provided by genetic and ecological data highlights the need to combine multiple and cross-disciplinary evidence for a comprehensive understanding of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms linked to species ranges.

AB The field of ethorobotics holds promise in aiding fundamental research in animal behaviour, whereby it affords fully controllable and easily reproducible experimental tools. Most of the current ethorobotics studies are focused on the behavioural response of a selected target species as it interacts with a biologically-inspired robot in controlled laboratory conditions. In this work, we first explore the interactions between two social fish species and a robotic fish, whose design is inspired by salient visual features of one of the species. Specifically, this study investigates the behavioural response of small shoals of zebrafish interacting with a zebrafish-inspired robotic fish and small shoals of mosquitofish in a basic ecological context. Our results demonstrate that the robotic fish differentially influences the behaviour of the two species by consistently attracting zebrafish, while repelling mosquitofish. This selective behavioural control is successful in spatially isolating the two species, which would otherwise exhibit prey-predator interactions, with mosquitofish attacking zebrafish.

AB Climate warming has been linked to an apparent general decrease in body sizes of ectotherms, both across and within taxa, especially in aquatic systems. Smaller body size in warmer geographical regions has also been widely observed. Since body size is a fundamental determinant of many biological attributes, climate-warming-related changes in size could ripple across multiple levels of ecological organization. Some recent studies have questioned the ubiquity of temperature-size rules, however, and certain widespread and abundant taxa, such as diatoms, may be important exceptions. We tested the hypothesis that diatoms are smaller at warmer temperatures using a system of geothermally heated streams. There was no consistent relationship between size and temperature at either the population or community level. These field data provide important counterexamples to both James' and Bergmann's temperature-size rules, respectively, undermining the widely held assumption that warming favours the small. This study provides compelling new evidence that diatoms are an important exception to temperature-size rules for three reasons: (i) we use many more species than prior work; (ii) we examine both community and species levels of organization simultaneously; (iii) we work in a natural system with a wide temperature gradient but minimal variation in other factors, to achieve robust tests of hypotheses without relying on laboratory setups, which have limited realism. In addition, we show that interspecific effects were a bigger contributor to whole-community size differences, and are probably more ecologically important than more commonly studied intraspecific effects. These findings highlight the need for multispecies approaches in future studies of climate warming and body size.

AB Phytoplankton concentration in Lake Kinneret (Israel) has varied up to 10-fold in space and time, with horizontal patches ranging from a couple of kilometres to a basin scale. Previous studies have used a 1D model to reproduce the temporal evolution of physical and biogeochemical variables in this lake. The question that arises then is how appropriate is a 1D approach to represent the dynamic of a spatially heterogeneous system, where there are non-linear dependencies between variables. Field data, a N-P-Z model coupled to both a 1D and a 3D hydrodynamic model, a 1D diffusion-reaction equation and scaling analysis are used to understand the role of spatial variability, expressed as phytoplankton patchiness, in the modelling of primary production. The analysis and results are used to investigate the effect of horizontal variability in the forcing and in the free mechanisms that affect the growth of patterns. The study shows that the use of averaged properties in a 1D approach may produce misleading results in the presence of localised patches, in terms of both concentration and composition of phytoplankton. The reason lies in the fact that the calibration process of ecological parameters in the 1D model appears to be site and process specific. That is, it depends on the pattern's characteristics and the underlying physical processes causing them. And this is a critical point for the success of numerical simulations under spatial variability. In this study, it is also shown that a length scale based on diffusion and growth rate of phytoplankton could be used as a criterion to assess the appropriateness of the 1D assumption.

AB Hypolimnetic electron budgets were developed for sulfate-rich, eutrophic Onondaga Lake, New York, for the summer stratification periods of 16 years (1989-2004) to describe seasonal, long-term, and interannual changes in hypolimnetic metabolism. A mass balance approach was applied to the hypolimnion to estimate the consumption of electron acceptors (e.g., O-2, NO3-) and production of reduced by-products (e.g., H2S, CH4) associated with the decomposition of organic matter. The stoichiometry of the associated redox reactions supported calculation of electron transfer in the hypolimnion and partitioning of the contributions of various metabolic pathways. In 12 of the 16 study years SO42-reduction was the most important decomposition pathway, accounting for an average of 44% of the electron transfer in the hypolimnion. Aerobic decomposition (28%), methanogenesis (19%), and denitrification (9%) were also quantitatively important mineralization processes. The relative importance of the various decomposition pathways to overall hypolimnetic metabolism varied widely in response to an abrupt decrease in organic carbon deposition in 1987, incomplete spring turnover in 1993, and improved nitrification treatment at a contributing wastewater treatment facility in 2004. Changes in the importance of the different decomposition pathways were generally consistent with the thermodynamic constraints that regulate the spatial and temporal patterns of redox processes in aquatic sediments. On average, the discrepancy between observed dissolved inorganic carbon accumulation and that calculated from the four redox pathways was 14%; potential causes for this discrepancy include storage of reduced forms of particulate organic carbon and metabolic by-products in the sediment.

AB Size-frequency distributions (SFDs) have been used to assess the ecological status of different populations in a variety of ecosystems and recently have become widely used to examine reef corals. SFDs may reflect the response of time-varying influences of the environment, including the intensity and frequency of disturbances and the degree of environmental degradation. Here we elucidate the biases that can arise in the application of popular and traditional sampling methods (e.g. quadrat, belt-transect, and line-intercept). We show that these biases on the estimated SFD arise due to boundary effects of the sampling units. Incorrect evaluations of SFDs may lead to biased estimations of the ecological status of coral populations and may result in, among other things, erroneous nature reserve management policies. Our analysis is based on analytical calculations, simulations, and field observations. We have developed simple mathematical corrections, which provide unbiased estimations for previously collected data acquired by these widely used methods. In addition, we offer alternative sampling methods that do not suffer from these shortcomings. Eliminating these types of sampling errors will not only provide better assessments of the status of a given coral reef, but will also make way for more precise comparisons among coral reefs in different regions. Although we discuss the biases of SFDs in regard to reef coral populations, the work is equally relevant in other ecological contexts.

AB On the basis of land use maps, remote sensing techniques and GIS a spatial model was established to determine landscape types in Slovenia, specifically core areas of the primary forest and spatial structure of agricultural areas with intensive agricultural production. Forest and forested landscapes in Slovenia encompass 72% of the country's surface area. Using the spatial model, open space without forest patches, hedgerows and remnants of natural vegetation was observed in 44% of the area designated as farmland with intensive agricultural production. Pomurje is the sole Slovenian macroregion in which agricultural landscape still prevails. Most forest patches and forest fragments in the central part of the Pomurje macroregion are isolated and have a minor depth of interior forest area. They represent the ecological infrastructure for sustainable management of the cultural landscape. Despite the low level of forest cover in the macroregion (27%), just 52% of the area of agricultural and urban land is located more than 150 m from forest edges, hedgerows, and remnants of the former natural vegetation. Human corridors, urban centers, and smaller, scattered settlements also affect the stability and processes sustained by these landscape elements. It is in such cases that this spatial model may prove to be an efficient tool for spatial planning and for assisting in the coordination of different land users. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB The role of stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity in foraging systems is investigated. We formulate a spatially explicit model which describes the behaviour of grazing animals in response to local information using simple stochastic rules. In particular the model reflects the biology in that decisions to move to a new location are based on visual assessment of the sward height in a surrounding neighbourhood, whilst the decision to graze the current location is based on the residual sward height and olfactory assessment of local faecal contamination. It is assumed that animals do not interact directly, but do so through modification of, and response to a common environment. Spatial heterogeneity is shown to have significant effects including reducing the equilibrium intake rate and increasing the optimal stocking density, and must therefore be taken into account by resource managers. We demonstrate the relationship between the stochastic spatial model and its non-spatial deterministic counterpart, and in the process derive a moment-closure approximation to the full process, which can be regarded as an intermediate, or pseudo-spatial model. The role of spatial heterogeneity is emphasized, and better understood by comparing the results obtained from each approach. The relative efficiency of random and directed searching behaviour in spatially heterogeneous environments is explored for both clean and contaminated pastures, and the impact of faecal avoidance behaviour assessed.

AB Recently, there has been much debate surrounding the importance of sperm limitation to the population dynamics and evolution of life-history traits of free-spawning marine invertebrates. The debate is hampered by a lack of measures of fertilisation success from natural spawning events We observed the natural spawning of the intertidal anemone Oulactis mucosa during a low tide in SE Australia. The fertilisation success of individual females was assessed, as well as the degree of spawning synchrony among and within rockpools. We found that fertilisation success was extremely variable among females; females spawning in rockpools containing spawning males had much higher fertilisation success than females in pools without males. Spawned gametes remained in a viscous matrix throughout the low tide, and the movement of sperm among pools appeared to be minimal. Consequently, isolated females had very low rates of fertilisation success, and spawning synchrony in all-female pools strongly depended on the distance to the nearest neighbouring pool containing a spawning male. We suggest that spawning at low tide may minimise the problems associated with gamete dilution, but also results in poor communication among spawning individuals and thus limited genetic exchange at reproduction and low rates of synchrony.

AB Recent studies have provided detail of the mechanisms by which plants and animals interact, but attempts to apply this knowledge to understand function at the scale of whole fields or grazed ecosystems can be fraught with difficulties. Faced with a plethora of detail, and yet demands to make models more comprehensive, modellers face pressure to revert to simplified accounts for what are assumed to be well-established biological phenomena, for example, for describing plant growth and intake, but this raises the risk; that important insights may be lost, or that the analyses may face errors of scaling.
   The predictions of a previously described spatial model are compared with those of a non-spatial rendition of the same model to identify the differences in predictions and the sources of these differences. In particular, the use of the conventional empirical growth functions and their interaction with temporal and spatial scaling errors are examined. The comparison exposed how substantial Errors could be made in predicting yield and stability under grazing. It is proposed that such errors might be avoided by ensuring that the functional responses used capture the insights of more detailed studies, and by recognizing the difficulties of scaling-up from the level of processes to the field scale and beyond.

AB A small-scale, "no-use zone policy" has been implemented since 1992 at Eilat's Coral Nature Reserve (Northern Red Sea). Six years later, the status of this closed-to-the-public reef area was compared to two nearby open-to-the-public sites, by evaluating populations of the scleractinian coral Stylophora pistillata in the strolling zone (0.5-1.5 m depth). Results from the open sites show that: (1) Live coral cover was three times lower than at the closed site; (2) numbers of small colonies (recruits) were significantly higher than in the closed site, while numbers of medium and large size colonies (geometric mean radius, (r) over bar > 4.1 cm) per m(2) were significantly lower; (3) maximum (r) over bar was almost half than that in the closed site (9.6 cm versus 16.7 cm); (4) average number of broken colonies was three times higher than in the closed site, (5) significantly fewer colonies were partially dead. The latter result may reflect senescence processes in the large colonies of the closed site. Although colony breakage is reduced, it appears that the "no-use zone" policy is not sufficient for protecting small reef areas. The intense exploitation of Eilat's coral reef by the tourist industry requires' in addition to the conventional protective measures, the initiation of novel management solutions such as reef restoration by sexual and asexual recruits.

AB Pollination by deceit in Myristica insipida, a beetle-pollinated nutmeg, was hypothesized to operate on intersexual differences in Bower production and longevity, producing a daily fluctuation between floral display maxima and minima. Sticky traps were used to continuously monitor beetle activity. Flower production and naturally occurring intersexual differences in display were recorded. Male and female trees flowered in synchrony producing. daily display maxima at 1800-0600 and display minima at 1400-1800. Rewarding male trees produced three times the number of flowers of female trees, but the er longevity of female flowers reduced the intersexual difference in display maxima to a factor of two. There was no intersexual difference in display minima. Beetles were demonstrated to be sensitive to differences in both maximum and minimum displays on rewarding male trees, a necessary prerequisite for directional selection on display size. Beetle captures were significantly higher at male trees during floral display maxima, and no intersexual differences in capture rate occurred during floral display minima. However, capture rates at male trees did not decline as predicted, and the pattern of captures was consistent with crepuscular activity. Beetle captures at male and female trees were lower from 1800 to 0600 and 1000 to 1400, and higher from 0600 to 1000 and 1400 to 1800, but the differences were only significant at female trees. These data suggests that foraging errors are numerous, frequent, and the result of overall foraging activity.

ID HONEY BEES; NECTAR
AB The classification of food items into a selected set of categories can significantly enhance information processing by a foraging animal. The ability of bumblebees, Bombus flavifrons, to form simple categories of floral colours was tested. Bees recognized categories in a way that enhanced their ability to discriminate between rewarding and non-rewarding flowers. Bees also recognized novel members of learned categories. Both memorization and generalization based on similarity between floral types could be ruled out as the mechanisms underlying bees' behaviour. It is most likely that bees learned to attend to the stimulus that reliably identified members of a certain category; a similar mechanism may be commonly used by many other species including humans.

AB 1. The amount of overlap between the geographic ranges of closely related species is thought to depend, in part, on the extent to which similar species share the same habitat requirements and on the degree of competition between them.
   2. The amount of overlap between pairs of closely related species is compared with an expected amount, generated using a null model. Two data sets are used: Palearctic mammals and British mammals.
   3. Closely related species tend to overlap more than expected by chance, suggesting that species' distributions are more constrained by niche requirements than competition. Species that overlap less than expected are more similar in body size and vice versa, leading to the conclusion that competition may cause species with similar body sizes to reduce geographic range overlap.

AB The distribution pattern of corals and benthic space partitioning patterns on the fringing reefs of southern Taiwan were studied by the line-transect method. The bathymetric distribution of corals in the study area was basically homogeneous except on the protected reef slopes and the exposed reef fronts and terraces. Corals on protected reef slopes are mainly foliaceous, including Montipora foliosa, Merulina ampliata, Mycedium elephantotus, and Pachyseris speciosa, but the dominant species on a reef slope vary from site to site. The formation of the foliaceous coral community is possibly related to a complex of environmental factors, chance, and biological interactions. The reef fronts and submarine terraces of exposed areas are dominated by alcyonacean corals. The most abundant species are Sarcophyton trocheliophorum. S. crassocaule, and Lobophytum sarcophytoides; their distributions are relatively homogeneous. The formation of alcyonacean-dominated assemblages can be related to the special adaptive strategies of these corals. In regard to space partitioning patterns, the major space occupiers on those reefs exposed to storm disturbances are alcyonacean soft corals, scleractinian corals, and algae; on reefs protected from storms. scleractinian corals and algae dominate. Two conspicuous features of the study area are the high proportion of space occupied by algae and the abundant unoccupied space. The dense algal cover is possibly caused by sewage pollution and overfishing of the reef area. The unoccupied space is most likely related to the high frequency of typhoon disturbances.

AB A simulation study was conducted on the production potential under grazing of a perennial C4-species grassland. A model of plant growth governed by soil moisture availability and prevailing weather conditions was adapted to account for perenniality, C4 photosynthesis, intra-seasonal regrowth, and defoliation effects. Model behaviour was validated against a set of field data obtained from the Nacunan experimental site, Mendoza Province, Argentina. Primary production, defoliation effects and potential forage utilization as a consequence of different stocking rates and grazing systems were simulated for two consecutive years.
   The model indicated that where animals were grazed continuously, primary production was only a slightly reduced by relatively heavy grazing. This occurred because of the particular growth pattern of the vegetation which is characterized by pulses with relatively high growth rates over short periods. These growth rates are considerably higher than potential defoliation rates, even at relatively high animal densities. The effect of an intensive, short duration rotational grazing system compared to continuous grazing had only a small effect on the simulated primary production and on the total amount of utilized green herbage, even though these variables varied widely between subdivisions within a grazing rotation. It is concluded that the growth pattern of the grassland vegetation, determined mainly by the characteristics of the prevailing weather in the region, limits the utilization of the green leaf to about 11-14% of the annual herbage production when animals have to be maintained throughout the year on the grassland. The rest of the available forage must be consumed as dry feed. As a result, the primary productivity of such grasslands appears to have low sensitivity to fairly large variations in stocking rate and grazing management. These results explain some of the inconclusive and conflicting results of grazing trials, and so have significant implications for research policy and grazing management in semiarid environments similar to those studied in the region.

AB A phylogenetic meta-analysis of patterns and drivers of body size evolution across a global sample of paired island-mainland populations of terrestrial vertebrates shows that 'island rule' effects are widespread in mammals, birds and reptiles, but less evident in amphibians, which mostly tend towards gigantism.
   Island faunas can be characterized by gigantism in small animals and dwarfism in large animals, but the extent to which this so-called 'island rule' provides a general explanation for evolutionary trajectories on islands remains contentious. Here we use a phylogenetic meta-analysis to assess patterns and drivers of body size evolution across a global sample of paired island-mainland populations of terrestrial vertebrates. We show that 'island rule' effects are widespread in mammals, birds and reptiles, but less evident in amphibians, which mostly tend towards gigantism. We also found that the magnitude of insular dwarfism and gigantism is mediated by climate as well as island size and isolation, with more pronounced effects in smaller, more remote islands for mammals and reptiles. We conclude that the island rule is pervasive across vertebrates, but that the implications for body size evolution are nuanced and depend on an array of context-dependent ecological pressures and environmental conditions.

AB Species reintroductions - the translocation of individuals to areas in which a species has been extirpated with the aim of re-establishing a self-sustaining population - have become a widespread practice in conservation biology. Reintroduction projects have tended to focus on terrestrial vertebrates and, to a lesser extent, fishes. Much less effort has been devoted to the reintroduction of invertebrates into restored freshwater habitats. Yet, reintroductions may improve restoration outcomes in regions where impoverished regional species pools limit the self-recolonisation of restored freshwaters. We review the available literature on macroinvertebrate reintroductions, focusing on identifying the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that determine their success or failure. Our study reveals that freshwater macroinvertebrate reintroductions remain rare, are often published in the grey literature and, of the attempts made, approximately one-third fail. We identify life-cycle complexity and remaining stressors as the two factors most likely to affect reintroduction success, illustrating the unique challenges of freshwater macroinvertebrate reintroductions. Consideration of these factors by managers during the planning process and proper documentation - even if a project fails - may increase the likelihood of successful outcomes in future reintroduction attempts of freshwater macroinvertebrates.

AB Aim Variation in body size across animal species underlies most ecological and evolutionary processes shaping local- and large-scale patterns of biodiversity. For well over a century, climatic factors have been regarded as primary sources of natural selection on animal body size, and hypotheses such as Bergmann's rule (the increase of body size with decreasing temperature) have dominated discussions. However, evidence for consistent climatic effects, especially among ectotherms, remains equivocal. Here, we test a range of key hypotheses on climate-driven size evolution in squamate reptiles across several spatial and phylogenetic scales. Location Global. Time period Extant. Major taxa studied Squamates (lizards and snakes). Methods We quantified the role of temperature, precipitation, seasonality and net primary productivity as drivers of body mass across ca. 95% of extant squamate species (9,733 spp.). We ran spatial autoregressive models of phylogenetically corrected median mass per equal-area grid cell. We ran models globally, across separate continents and for major squamate clades independently. We also performed species-level analyses using phylogenetic generalized least square models and linear regressions of independent contrasts of sister species. Results Our analyses failed to identify consistent spatial patterns in body size as a function of our climatic predictors. Nearly all continent- and family-level models differed from one another, and species-level models had low explanatory power. Main conclusions The global distribution of body mass among living squamates varies independently from the variation in multiple components of climate. Our study, the largest in spatial and taxonomic scale conducted to date, reveals that there is little support for a universal, consistent mechanism of climate-driven size evolution within squamates.

AB Body size latitudinal clines have been widley explained by the Bergmann's rule in homeothermic vertebrates. However, there is no general consensus in poikilotherms organisms in particular in insects that represent the large majority of wildlife. Among them, bees are a highly diverse pollinators group with high economic and ecological value. Nevertheless, no comprehensive studies of species assemblages at a phylogenetically larger scale have been carried out even if they could identify the traits and the ecological conditions that generate different patterns of latitudinal size variation. We aimed to test Bergmann's rule for wild bees by assessing relationships between body size and latitude at continental and community levels. We tested our hypotheses for bees showing different life history traits (i.e. sociality and nesting behaviour). We used 142 008 distribution records of 615 bee species at 50 x 50 km (CGRS) grids across the West Palearctic. We then applied generalized least squares fitted linear model (GLS) to assess the relationship between latitude and mean body size of bees, taking into account spatial autocorrelation. For all bee species grouped, mean body size increased with higher latitudes, and so followed Bergmann's rule. However, considering bee genera separately, four genera were consistent with Bergmann's rule, while three showed a converse trend, and three showed no significant cline. All life history traits used here (i.e. solitary, social and parasitic behaviour; ground and stem nesting behaviour) displayed a Bergmann's cline. In general there is a main trend for larger bees in colder habitats, which is likely to be related to their thermoregulatory abilities and partial endothermy, even if a 'season length effect' (i.e. shorter foraging season) is a potential driver of the converse Bergmann's cline particularly in bumblebees.

AB Although a broad diversity of eukaryotic and bacterial taxa reside on rock surfaces where they can influence the weathering of rocks and minerals, these communities and their contributions to mineral weathering remain poorly resolved. To build a more comprehensive understanding of the diversity, ecology and potential functional attributes of microbial communities living on rock, we sampled 149 tombstones across three continents and analysed their bacterial and eukaryotic communities via marker gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that geographic location and climate were important factors structuring the composition of these communities. Moreover, the tombstone-associated microbial communities varied as a function of rock type, with granite and limestone tombstones from the same cemeteries harbouring taxonomically distinct microbial communities. The granite and limestone-associated communities also had distinct functional attributes, with granite-associated bacteria having more genes linked to acid tolerance and chemotaxis, while bacteria on limestone were more likely to be lichen associated and have genes involved in photosynthesis and radiation resistance. Together these results indicate that rock-dwelling microbes exhibit adaptations to survive the stresses of the rock surface, differ based on location, climate and rock type, and seem pre-disposed to different ecological strategies (symbiotic versus free-living lifestyles) depending on the rock type.

AB The coastline of Qatar is a rich mosaic of productive and diverse ecosystems including mangrove forests, intertidal mudflats (sabkha), seagrass beds, and coral reefs. These ecologically interconnected ecosystems contain a substantial proportion of Qatar's total biodiversity, and support an estimated 97% of the >US$ 67 million in annual commercial fisheries, the highest value resource sector after petroleum. The extreme environmental conditions that characterize Qatar has led to fauna that are robust compared with other regions, but makes them highly sensitive to further pressure from anthropogenic stress. These vulnerable ecosystems have come under increasing pressure in recent decades as a result of dramatic expansion of coastal development, and threats to these ecosystems are likely to accelerate in the coming years as Qatar's economy and population continue to grow. Although environmental regulation had historically lagged behind the rapid pace of development, in recent years Qatar's leadership has aggressively expanded environmental management as a result of the growing awareness of the importance of coastal ecosystems. While these improvements are encouraging, management remains challenged by its current sectorial, project-driven focus. Ecosystem-based management (EBM) offers an opportunity to overcome these challenges by integrating impacts from across all major activities in multiple sectors and considering their cumulative effects on ecosystem services and products. While an EBM approach would require modest reprioritizing of existing processes and attention to addressing deficiencies in data needed to support decision making, it has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of coastal zone management. The article closes by summarizing a recently initiated research project on coral reefs and seagrass beds in Qatar which can serve as a model for development of the EBM approach for other coastal ecosystems in Qatar.

AB Translocations, the human-mediated movement and free-release of living organisms, are increasingly used as conservation tools in imperiled terrestrial ecosystems. Marine ecosystems, too, are increasingly threatened, and marine restoration efforts are escalating. But the methods and motivations for marine restoration are varied, so the extent to which they involve conservation-motivated translocations is unclear. Because translocations involve considerable risks, building on previous experience to establish and implement best practice guidelines for policy application is imperative. We conducted a global literature review to determine what marine conservation translocation experience exists. Our review indicates marine conservation translocations are widespread and increasingly common. Reinforcements and reintroductions predominate, but precedent for assisted colonizations and ecological replacements also exists. In 39 years, 487 translocation projects were conducted to conserve over 242 marine species or their ecosystems. Most projects involved coastal invertebrates (44%) or plants (30%). Few species were of conservation concern according to the IUCN Red List, likely reflecting the leading objective for most (60%) marine conservation translocations, which was ecosystem rather than species recovery. With currently no standard metrics for evaluating translocation success or ecosystem function, we recommend future projects follow the relevant IUCN guidelines and identify specific targets to measure the efficacy of translocations.

AB 1. Individual plants provide a habitat patch for foragers where the sought-after resources (e. g. leaves, fruits and seeds) are clustered in locally dense aggregations. Characteristics of these resources often vary greatly even within individual plants, which is known as within-plant or subindividual variation. To best describe properties of the patch (individual plants), the higher moments of trait-value distributions must be included in addition to the mean values. However, the question whether differences in within-plant variability of a given trait influence the foraging behaviours of consumers has been mostly untested.
   2. To test the hypothesis that differences in within-plant variation of traits can influence the patch selection behaviour of seed consumers, we used the mean, coefficient of variation (CV) and skewness of within-plant distributions of two Quercus serrata (Thunb) seed traits (weight and tannin content) as descriptors of plant phenotypes. We then examined the relationships between these descriptors and patch selection by the wood mouse Apodemus speciosus, where individual Quercus trees formed a foraging patch for seed removal.
   3. We collected 8594 seeds from 26 individual trees in a forest in northern Japan. We then measured their weight and tannin content, marked and returned them to the locations where they were found, and traced their fates in relation to seed removal by the wood mouse. Tannin content was nondestructively estimated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
   4. There was notable within-plant variation in seed weight and tannin content. Generalized additive modelling revealed that trees with a large mean and CV of seed weight and those with a small CV and skewness of tannin content had a high frequency of seed removal.
   5. These results highlight the importance of considering the within-plant distribution of seed trait values, in addition to the mean trait values of individual seeds, when describing plant phenotypes. The inclusion of these data is essential to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes at work in plant-animal interactions.

AB QuestionsWhat is the community-level consequence of biotic processes, in particular the importance of facilitation, in determining patterns of diversity in alpine plant communities of the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains? Does facilitation intensity change with environmental severity, and are these changes due to environmental severity or nurse trait effects?
   LocationEleven alpine plant communities dominated by cushion plants in the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains, within the mountain system of south-central China.
   MethodsWe determined plant species richness and abundance in habitats created by cushions and cushion-free areas, and assessed the cushion effects on species richness and abundance with rarefaction curves and the relative interaction index, respectively. We examined the relationship between cushion effects on diversity and habitat severity and tested if changes in the net cushion effects along the severity gradient were due to a change in the performance of species without cushions (environmental severity effect) and/or with cushions (nurse trait-mediated effect).
   ResultsThe presence of cushion plants increased species richness and abundance in most studied plant communities. The net facilitation effect of cushions increased with increasing habitat severity, an effect that could be attributed mainly to a reduction in species richness in cushion-free areas with increasing severity. However, the changes in magnitude of facilitation of particular cushion species growing in high and low severity habitats could be attributed to both environmental severity and neighbour trait effects. Despite the overall positive effect of cushion plants on plant species richness, not all cushion species contributed to higher species richness. The deviation of individual cushion species from the general pattern of increasing facilitation with increasing severity indicated the species specificity of facilitation depends on the traits of nurse species.
   ConclusionThe presence of cushion plants generally increased species richness in alpine plant communities of the Himalayan Hengduan Mountains, with the importance of the cushion effect increasing with habitat severity due to a buffering effect by cushions of the negative effect of habitat severity on species richness observed in cushion-free areas. This indicates the pivotal role of facilitative interactions among plant species in supporting high diversity in these severe environments.

AB Clonal plants grow by the production of semi-autonomous modules (ramets), and form complex branching structures which may provide communication/resource flow channels between the units. These characteristic features have made clonal plants a challenging subject for spatial modelling. We review the advance of ideas and new directions in theoretical research since the last review (Oborny and Cain, 1997). We place clonal growth models into a general framework of spatial population dynamic models, comparing individual ramets of a clone with individuals in a non-clonal population. We discuss three specificities of clonal spreading: (1) ramets can be physiologically integrated through the network of branching structures; (2) formation of new ramets occurs by the growth of these branching structures which can be directional, following architectural rules; and (3) formation of new ramets can be adjusted to the environment by phenotypic plasticity. We review methods by which these traits have been implemented into models. We summarize model predictions, for the spatial structure and fitness of clonal plants, and link these predictions with existing empirical data. Emphasis is given to the contributions that theoretical studies could provide for experimental studies in the field.
   We emphasize the following recent major developments: (i) a much better understanding of emergent consequences of various clonal growth rules over broad spatial and temporal scales has been reached. (ii) Links have been found to other complex systems. For example, a key problem of integration vs. splitting of connecting structures has been shown to be closely related to a problem in percolation theory. (iii) Interactions between physiological integration, architectural growth and plastic responses have been demonstrated; research on these interactions has generally shown a large degree of contingency in the effects of these traits. Finally, we outline some areas for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB The functional response, that is the relationship between the food intake rate of a forager and the availability of food items, has been subject to numerous investigations in ruminants. In horses however, the functional response has been poorly studied despite of the importance of grazed forage in horse nutrition and the increasing role of horses in the management of grasslands in Europe. Large differences in body size can be found in adult horses of different breeds and intake rates are commonly affected by body size and mouth morphology in mammalian herbivores. This study describes the functional response of horses using, for the first time, natural swards offering a wide range of biomass (from 82 to 513 gDM m(-2), i.e. heights from 3 cm to 63 cm) and varying in quality (NDF: 53-68%), and animals of different body sizes (ponies: 253 kg, saddle horses: 602 kg, heavy horses: 953 kg). Instantaneous intake rate was the product of bite size measurements on sward trays and bite rate values obtained on the same swards while horses were grazing at pasture. Using the Spalinger and Hobbs [Spalinger, D.E., Hobbs, N.T., 1992. Mechanisms of foraging in mammalian herbivores: new model of functional response. Am. Nat. 140,325347] model developed for mammalian herbivores, we found that Type II functional responses (i.e. asymptotic curve) provided a satisfactory fit to the intake rate by horses of contrasting body sizes on the range of biomass tested. As has been found in ruminants, handling time (i.e. the time needed to crop and to process a mouthful) increased linearly with bite size in the three sizes of horses. The maximum processing rate increased with body size, indicating that smaller horses are more constrained when bite size increases. Taking into account the fibrousness of swards did not improve the estimation of handling time which means that horses were relatively unaffected by the range of fibrousness in our study.

AB The effects of manufactured carbon black (CB) nanoparticles on reproduction and early development of the marine brown algae Fucus serratus were studied. Results obtained indicated that effects of CB on sperm concentration and fertilization, body axis alignment, germination and rhizoid elongation were primarily physical. CB nanoparticles added to sperm suspension and embryo cultures, formed large agglomerates that removed sperm from suspension and reduced fertilization success at 100 mg l(-1). Correct alignment of the polar axis was reduced at 50 mg l(-1). From EM imaging there was no clear evidence of CB nanoparticle uptake in the zygotes. Instead zygotes were covered by agglomerates of CB nanoparticles that may have shaded for incident light that is crucial for alignment of the polar body axis. Germination and rhizoid elongation, both independent of light, were unaffected by CB nanoparticles.

AB Rates of recruitment, growth and survival during the early life stages of stony corals may strongly impact community structure on tropical reefs, yet sparse information is available on these processes. We assessed juvenile coral dynamics on coral reefs near Eilat, northern Red Sea. Rates of recruitment among stony-coral genera were similar at sites in close proximity (< 200 m), but not at a more distant site (2 km), which differed in substratum type and reef morphology. We observed 42 to 173 juvenile coral colonies m(-2) of reef substratum, a much higher abundance than previously reported from reefs in the Caribbean Sea, but potentially similar to abundance on other Indo-Pacific reefs that are known to have higher coral recruitment than Caribbean reefs. Growth rates of juvenile corals were similar among sites and genera, but varied significantly with season. Juvenile mortality varied significantly among reef sites in some coral genera, and was particularly high for individuals of Stylophora spp., weedy corals that also had high rates of recruitment of juveniles, and thus rapid population turnover. Growth and mortality rates of corals at these sites were within values recorded for other reef locations worldwide. We conclude that on shallow reefs in the northern Red Sea, relative abundances of juvenile coral genera depend mainly on variation in their recruitment patterns, and do not vary significantly with rates of juvenile growth or mortality.

AB The sustainability and resilience of an Asian typical steppe grazing ecosystem was assessed by determining thresholds and stable states with an ecosystem simulation model. This analysis used the Savanna model to simulate spatial climate, vegetation, and livestock grazing dynamics, at 14 different stocking rates (5.5-59.8 AUY km(-2)). Grazing effects on vegetation were assessed, including effects on primary production, vegetation composition, and root biomass. Simulations were run for 100 years: 50 years to examine sustainability and 50 years to examine resilience of the system. Results showed that a grazing intensity (1-g/u; g = biomass in grazed area, u = biomass in ungrazed area) of 0.49 was sustainable for this particular system. This region was resilient to grazing up to the intensity of 0.49, where the system remained dominated by herbaceous production. Grazing intensities higher than 0.49, in combination with low precipitation events, resulted in decreased herbaceous net primary production and root biomass, and increased shrub net primary production and root biomass. Herbaceous vegetation was unable to gain a competitive advantage over shrubs in areas where grazing intensities were above 0.49; consequently, the system shifted to a stable shrub-dominated state that could not return its original composition even without further grazing.

AB Lake Bardawil is the only oligotrophic hypersaline lagoon along the Mediterranean coast of Egypt. Its ecological significance is increasing due to the progressive degradation of comparable wetlands in the region. The aim of this study is to analyse the structure and life forms of the vegetation along the lake before the execution of the North Sinai Agricultural Development Project (NSADP) which will threaten the ecosystem of the lake. A data set of 150 stands was analysed using multivariate procedures (TWINSPAN, DCA and CCA), to classify the lake's vegetation, and to determine the relationship between the plant community structure and the environmental factors. The classification and ordination resulted in a clear demonstration of nine vegetation groups associated with four habitat types: submerged sea grasses, salt marshes and sabkhahs, eastern and middle calcareous dunes, and western non-calcareous dunes. The first axis of the CCA-ordination separates the salt marshes and sabkhahs species from those of the sand dunes along the soil salinity, water table depth, cations, and pH gradients. CaCO3 and soil texture showed highly significant correlation with the second axis of CCA which was an important predictor for the psammophytic species distribution. The life forms ranged from hydrophytes (sea grasses) to phanerophytes with the dominance of therophytes and chamaephytes. Geophytes and chamaephytes dominate the saline habitats, while therophytes and hemicryptophytes dominated the sandy dunes. Eventhough the eastern section of the lake (Lake Zaraniq) was declared as a RAMSAR site, Lake Bardawil needs urgent management to prevent its pollution by the new land use system.

AB Restoration ecology plays an important role in nature conservation policy in Europe today. it establishes the scientific basis for restoring ecosystems altered or destroyed by man to a more "natural" state. The goals of restoration ecology can generally be described in terms of increased biodiversity, enhanced water retention capacity, avoidance of soil erosion, etc. In practice, however, a discrepancy exists between the high ideals of restoration goals and reality, where one often encounters limiting factors. These Limiting factors can include the conflict between different restoration goals, the unpredictability of restoration goals owing to long-term effects and stochastic events, the insufficient social acceptance of landscape changes during restoration processes, and the use of restoration processes themselves (e.g., undisturbed succession, certain management measures like impoverishment of fertilized areas) as restoration goals in place of a certain resource quality (such as species composition, population sizes, water quality). Two examples from southern Germany show that restoration goals in European cultural landscapes can only be implemented successfully when they are integrated into the respective land use systems.

AB Biodiversity of small mammals has been used as an indicator of disturbance in a natural ecosystem. Small mammal community structure was investigated on eight transects in the Willem Pretorius Nature Reserve. The low species richness and diversity of small mammals, and the high proportion of Mastomys coucha in all habitats, indicate a high level of disturbance in the reserve. Possible reasons for this disturbance are discussed together with methods for monitoring and measuring small mammal diversity in Free State ecosystems. This study was also the first study to quantify habitat-specific patterns in terms of Shannon-diversity in the Free State. Such indices are essential to describe and compare mammalian faunas and are increasingly being used in inter alia impact assessments.

A distinction is drawn between generic models which are usually simple formulations applicable to whole classes of parasite and specific models which are often more complex and designed to address questions concerning a particular species. Most of the models considered employ a deterministic framework. Four main groups are considered: generic models of trichostrongylid infection of domestic ruminants, specific models of trichostrongylid infection of domestic ruminants, specific models of experimental laboratory infections of rodents, and a specific model of nematode infections in wildlife.

AB Circular economy can play an important role towards sustainable business management and it can be seen all throughout an organization. Although the current literature regards the circular economy as a guide for more sustainable business models, it is not clear the main implications to key business areas. Therefore this study aimed to present the key impacts of circular economy practices within different business areas that help guide a sustainable management of businesses. To that end, it was identified, by means of a systematic review of the existing literature, the business areas impacted by circular economy practices within an organization. The business areas identified were strategic planning, cost management, supply chain management, quality management, environmental management, process management, logistics and reverse logistics, service management, and research and development, allowing a discussion on the main contributions of the circular economy to each area. A key-impact map was provided summarizing the most influential changes in each area that assist in the management of businesses towards greater sustainability. It is important that organizations understand and accurately internalize circularity principles within their strategic plan. On that note, adopting a circular thinking might enable an organization to obtain more sustainable (economic) results while reducing impacts.

AB Aim Mountains and islands are both well known for their high endemism. To explain this similarity, parallels have been drawn between the insularity of "true islands" (land surrounded by water) and the isolation of habitats within mountains (so-called "mountain islands"). However, parallels rarely go much beyond the observation that mountaintops are isolated from one another, as are true islands. Here, we challenge the analogy between mountains and true islands by re-evaluating the literature, focusing on isolation (the prime mechanism underlying species endemism by restricting gene flow) from a dynamic perspective over space and time. Framework We base our conceptualization of "isolation" on the arguments that no biological system is completely isolated; instead, isolation has multiple spatial and temporal dimensions relating to biological and environmental processes. We distinguish four key dimensions of isolation: (a) environmental difference from surroundings; (b) geographical distance to equivalent environment [points (a) and (b) are combined as "snapshot isolation"]; (c) continuity of isolation in space and time; and (d) total time over which isolation has been present [points (c) and (d) are combined as "isolation history"]. We evaluate the importance of each dimension in different types of mountains and true islands, demonstrating that substantial differences exist in the nature of isolation between and within each type. In particular, different types differ in their initial isolation and in the dynamic trajectories they follow, with distinct phases of varying isolation that interact with species traits over time to form present-day patterns of endemism. Conclusions Our spatio-temporal definition of isolation suggests that the analogy between true islands and mountain islands masks important variation of isolation over long time-scales. Our understanding of endemism in isolated systems can be greatly enriched if the dynamic spatio-temporal dimensions of isolation enter models as explanatory variables and if these models account for the trajectories of the history of a system.

AB Dispersal is a fundamental process that facilitates population and range expansion by providing a mechanism for colonization and metapopulation linkages. Yet quantifying the dispersal process, particularly long-distance dispersal events, has been inherently difficult due to technological and observational limitations. Additionally, dispersal distance calculated as the straight-line distance between initiation and settlement fails to account for the actual movement path of the animal during dispersal. Here, we highlight six long-distance dispersal events, representing some of the longest dispersal distances recorded for red foxes. Cumulative dispersal movements ranged from 132 to 1036 km and occurred within both sexes (1 female, 5 males). With one exception, dispersal events ranged from 7 to 22 days and tended to be directed north-northwest. Importantly, cumulative movements were up to five times longer than straight-line distances, with two foxes traveling an additional 114 and 256 km before returning to, and settling in, areas previously encountered during dispersal. This suggests a role of habitat assessment and homing behavior during dispersal and indicates that the capacity and potential for dispersal are not limiting factors to either sex in a red fox population. Dispersal capacity should thus be considered regarding transboundary management and disease control of red fox populations.

AB In this paper, we perform spatiotemporal bifurcation analysis in a ratio-dependent predator prey model and derive explicit conditions for the existence of non-constant steady states that emerge through steady state bifurcation from related constant steady states. These explicit conditions are numerically verified in details and further compared to those conditions ensuring Turing instability. We find that (1) Turing domain is identical to the parametric domain where there exists only steady state bifurcation, which implies that Turing patterns are stable non-constant steady states, but the opposite is not necessarily true; (2) In non-Turing domain, steady state bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation act in concert to determine the emergent spatial patterns, that is, non-constant steady state emerges through steady state bifurcation but it may be unstable if the destabilising effect of Hopf bifurcation counteracts the stabilising effect of diffusion, leading to non-stationary spatial patterns; (3) Coupling diffusion into an ODE model can significantly enrich population dynamics by inducing alternative non-constant steady states (four different states are observed, two stable and two unstable), in particular when diffusion interacts with different types of bifurcation; (4) Diffusion can promote species coexistence by saving species which otherwise goes to extinction in the absence of diffusion.

AB AimsFacilitation has been reported in a wide range of plant communities, with evidence of positive interactions between beneficiary and nurse plants shifting during their ontogenetic development. This study explored the hypothesis that shrubs of Juniperus communis subsp. nana (thereafter Juniperus) play a crucial role in the successional sequence of plant communities acting as nurse for different species, but only after reaching a certain size. In addition, we examined whether plant-plant interaction changes during ontogenesis of these shrubs in the presence of contrasting disturbance regimes in terms of substrate stability.
   LocationSibillini National Park, central Italy. The vegetation is semi-natural dry grasslands (92/43/EEC Habitats Directive: Habitat 6210 - Festuco-Brometalia).
   MethodsField measurements were carried out to assess the effects of Juniperus on (1) the distribution of co-existing vascular species, (2) the above- and below-ground microclimate, and (3) changes in soil fertility and hydrology.
   ResultsThe capacity of Juniperus shrubs to facilitate heterospecific plants considerably increases during its ontogenetic development, i.e. small shrubs mainly compete for resources with local vegetation, whereas large shrubs act as nurse plants for herbaceous and especially for woody species. The facilitation effect was slight, albeit significantly higher in the disturbed area than in the more stable one. Juniperus was able to promote the formation of an island of fertility under its canopy by accumulating a considerable amount of organic matter, N, P, Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+ in a few decades. Juniperus shrubs improve soil hydrological properties and mitigate the daily range of soil temperature, reducing the exposure of co-existing plants to high temperatures and water loss through soil evaporation, particularly during the growing periods in spring and summer.
   ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that biogenic amelioration of soil quality, coupled with the mitigation of below-canopy microclimatic conditions, control the establishment and growth of co-existing plants during Juniperus shrub development.

AB Passage performance of brown trout (Salmo trutta), Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus bocagei), and northern straight-mouth nase (Pseudochondrostoma duriense) was investigated in a vertical slot fishway in the Porma River (Duero River basin, Spain) using PIT telemetry. We analysed the effects of different fishway discharges on motivation and passage success. Both cyprinid species ascended the fishway easily, performing better than the trout despite their theoretically weaker swimming performance. Fishway discharge affected fish motivation although it did not clearly influence passage success. Observed results can guide design and operation criteria of vertical slot fishways for native Iberian fish.

AB Management strategies in rotational grazing systems differ in their level of complexity and adaptivity. Different components of such grazing strategies are expected to allow for adaptation to environmental heterogeneities in space and time. However, most models investigating general principles of rangeland management strategies neglect spatio-temporal system properties including seasonality and spatial heterogeneity of environmental variables. We developed an ecological-economic rangeland model that combines a spatially explicit farm structure with intra-annual time steps. This allows investigating different management components in rotational grazing systems (including stocking and rotation rules) and evaluating their effect on the ecological and economic states of semi-arid grazing systems. Our results show that adaptive stocking is less sensitive to overstocking compared to a constant stocking strategy. Furthermore, the rotation rule becomes important only at stocking numbers that maximize expected income. Altogether, the best of the tested strategies is adaptive stocking combined with a rotation that adapts to both spatial forage availability and seasonality. This management strategy maximises mean income and at the same time maintains the rangeland in a viable condition. However, we could also show that inappropriate adaptation that neglects seasonality even leads to deterioration. Rangelands characterised by higher inter-annual climate variability show a higher risk of income losses under a non-adaptive stocking rule, and non-adaptive rotation is least able to buffer increasing climate variability. Overall, all important system properties including seasonality and spatial heterogeneity of available resources need to be considered when designing an appropriate rangeland management system. Resulting adaptive rotational grazing strategies can be valuable for improving management and mitigating income risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Large earthen mima-like mounds, occur over vast areas globally, including south-western Africa, where they are called heuweltjies. Heuweltjies are commonly believed to be produced by fossorial fauna (termites and mammals), although it is also possible that they are the consequence of vegetation stabilising soil against erosion and/or trapping aeolian sediment. We sampled mound presence/absence in South Africa and analysed environmental correlates with mound distribution. Mounds mostly occur in sparse (0.1 < NDVI < 0.5) semi-arid Mediterranean-climate Succulent Karoo vegetation at modest elevations (<1000 m) with relatively high average annual' wind speeds. These correlates are consistent with aeolian deposition of sediment in vegetation patches, but not with a termite-induced pattern. We analysed the spatial characteristics of mounds at 23 sites and found that over-dispersion is strongest and the size of mounds smallest closest to neighbouring mounds, indicating competitive interactions between mounds. Large inter-mound distances (ca. 40 m) make it unlikely that spacing is a direct consequence of root-based inter-plant competition. Rather, spacing is likely to be related to the influences of neighbouring mounds on aeolian sediment accretion. We suggest that the mounds arose in the Mediterranean climate zone at a time of greater aridity than currently. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biomonitoring studies, based on pollutant accumulation analyses in tree leaves, allow evaluating the impact caused by air-dispersed pollutants on ecosystems, providing useful data, complementary to those obtained by instrumental monitoring. In particular, leaves of sclerophylls present morphological characteristics, such as the presence of hairs and of a tick cuticle, making them particularly useful in bioaccumulation studies. The first aim of this research was to compare heavy metal (HM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) leaf accumulation capabilities of two Mediterranean tree species. The second aim was to evaluate the impact of a cement plant and/ or of other anthropogenic activities occurring in industrial and urban areas on HM and PAH depositions. For these purposes, holm oak (Quercus ilex L.) and olive (Olea europaea L.) leaves collected along a transect industrial-urban-remote sites in southern Italy were employed. A different accumulation degree was observed for the two species. For HMs, Q. ilex leaves had the highest concentrations. The results showed that the influence of the cement plant emissions on pollutant concentrations was substantial in the area closer to clinker production and storage with the highest Pb, Ni, V, Cr, Fe, indeno(1,2,3-c, d) pyrene, benzo(g, h, i) perylene and benzo(a) anthracene leaf concentrations. However, Q. ilex leaves showed high HM and PAH concentrations also in the urban site, in relation to vehicular traffic emissions and depositions. The comparison of the results of the present study with those from the literature indicates that the overall air quality of the studied sites is not particularly compromised, also in proximity of the cement production. The use of holm oak should be preferred in biomonitoring due to its wider distribution compared to O. europaea.

AB Reintroduction is an increasingly important tool to restore local extinctions and ecological interactions. Evaluating the success of reintroduction projects allows conservationists to learn from previous experience. Here we report on the reintroduction of agoutis, Dasyprocta leporina, to a Brazilian Atlantic Forest reserve in order to (1) determine the short-term status of the reintroduction; (2) describe and evaluate the management procedures that contributed to reintroduction success; and (3) identify the fruits and seeds consumed and buried by the agoutis, as an indication of their role in restoring ecological processes. We captured and tagged 21 adult individuals from a semi-captive population and reintroduced four males and seven females. One male died and almost all individuals lost weight (range=0-620 g; n=11) during quarantine (median=133 days; range=67-243 days; n=20). Six males and three females died, but the others gained weight during acclimatization (range=150-260 g; n=5). Individuals abandoned the food supplement up to 87 days after release, establishing home-ranges at least three times larger than in natural populations of agoutis. The estimated annual survival rate was 0.83, and 10 nature-born cubs were observed. The reintroduction was considered successful in the short-term. Among the main recommendations for future reintroductions, we suggest the reduction of quarantine and the maintenance of acclimatization periods, with structural improvements for both. Agoutis were seen eating fruits and seeds of 10 species and burying seeds of three of them. The buried seeds are from zoochoric large-seeded trees, thus enhancing recruitment in a disperser-impoverished forest.

AB The red-finned blue-eye is the only pseudomugilid fish known from inland Australia and it is found only within an isolated cluster of Great Artesian Basin springs on Edgbaston Reserve in central-western Queensland. Surveys conducted in early 2009 revealed that red-finned blue-eye was present in four individual springs and that invasion of the spring complex by alien eastern gambusia was the most likely factor contributing to local extirpations. Athree-year project commenced in the same year, with the twin aims of investigating methods for removing gambusia from springs and relocating small populations of red-finned blue-eye to fish-free springs. Gambusia removal with rotenone has been successful in a trial spring at Edgbaston and aquatic invertebrates have not been adversely affected. From a total of seven relocation events conducted in the same period, red-finned blue-eye populations have persisted in three. The results indicate that gambusia removal and red-finned blue-eye relocation are both suitable methods for red-finned blue-eye conservation, and as the fish is both endangered and declining, these methods and other strategies such as captive breeding should be implemented to prevent species extinction.

   DISTRIBUTIONS; DEMOGRAPHY
AB Dispersal is a factor of great importance in determining a species spatial distribution. Short distance dispersal (SDD) and long distance dispersal (LDD) strategies yield very different spatial distributions. In this paper we compare spatial spread patterns from SDD and LDD simulations, contrast them with patterns from field data, and assess the significance of biological and population traits.
   Simulated SDD spread using an exponential function generates a single circular patch with a well-defined invasion front showing a travelling-wave structure. The invasive spread is relatively slow as it is restricted to reproductive individuals occupying the outer zone of the circular patch. As a consequence of this dispersal dynamics, spread is slower than spread generated by LDD. In contrast, the early and fast invasion of the entire habitat mediated by power law LDD not only involves a significantly greater invasion velocity, but also an entirely different habitat occupation. As newly dispersed individuals soon reach very distant portions of the habitat as well as the vicinity of the original dispersal focus, new growing patches are generated while the main patch increases its own growth absorbing the closest patches. As a consequence of both dispersal and lower density dependence, growth of the occupied area is much faster than with SDD.
   SDD and LDD also differ regarding pattern generation. With SDD, fractal patterns appear only in the border of the invasion front in SDD when competitive interaction with residents is included. In contrast, LDD patterns show fractality both in the spatial arrangements of patches as well as in patch borders. Moreover, values of border fractal dimension inform on the dispersal process in relation with habitat heterogeneity. The distribution of patch size is also scale-free, showing two power laws characteristic of small and large patch sizes directly arising from the dispersal and reproductive dynamics.
   Ecological factors like habitat heterogeneity are relevant for dispersal, although its importance is greater for SDD, lowering the invasion velocity. Among the life history traits considered, adult mortality, the juvenile bank and mean dispersal distance are the most relevant for SDD. For LDD, habitat heterogeneity and changes in life history traits are not so relevant, causing minor changes in the values of the scale-free parameters.
   Our work on short and long distance dispersal shows novel theoretical differences between SDD and LDD in invasive systems (mechanisms of pattern formation, fractal and scaling properties, relevance of different life history traits and habitat variables) that correspond closely with field examples and were not analyzed, at least in this degree of detail, by the previously existing models.

AB The diet of the golden jackal (Canis aureus) was studied in 2002 and 2003 in Park Britannia (ca. 4000 ha) in central Israel. The aim of the study was to understand the kinds of anthropogenic food that allow jackals to be present at a high density. The scats (396 in total) were classified by season: summer (June September) or autumn (October November) as well as by origin from either the southern or northern part of the study area, which experience different levels of human pressure. The main food category was ungulates (39.4% frequency of occurrence), 80% of which were domestic animals - which we assume were mostly consumed as carrion. Other common food types included fruit (31.3%), birds (30%), small mammals (23.5%) and invertebrates (21.2%), while garbage was found in only 9.1% of the scats. Biomass of the jackal diet was dominated by ungulates (67.3%), with domestic ungulates consumed mostly as carrion, comprising 84% of the total. Jackal diet did not differ by season or level of human pressure. However, there was remarkable micro-scale variability in food composition as the summer jackal diet differed significantly among the dens. Our results suggest that the high availability of domestic animal carcasses due to the local carrion disposal system may be responsible for the present jackal density in Israel.

AB Coexistence of woody and herbaceous plants may be governed by a complex set of direct and indirect interactions, whose relative importance have been rarely assessed. We experimentally studied woody species establishment in a mixed plant community by disentangling the potential role of such biotic interactions and the effect of environmental variations on them. Seedling establishment of the common eastern Mediterranean shrub species Sarcopoterium spinosum was investigated under different rainfall and light conditions, combined with the effect of the presence of adult shrubs and annual neighbors. We predicted that seedlings will be directly affected by competition with annuals with increasing water availability, while direct effects of adult shrubs will be positive via amelioration of water stress. Indirect effects were expected beneath shrub canopies due to reduced water stressed and light availability for both annuals and shrub seedlings, which may intensify competition between annuals and shrub seedlings. To test these predictions we performed field and garden experiments in which we combined manipulation of shrub and annual presence with manipulations of water availability and light conditions to simulate the effect of shrub canopy. In contrast to our prediction, shrub seedling establishment was not facilitated but inhibited by adult shrubs because of light limitation. As expected, annuals had direct negative effects on shrub seedlings under wet conditions, which shifted to neutral or positive effects under dry conditions. Thus, interactions among shrubs and annuals, and in particular the release from competition during drought years, leads to a counterintuitive positive effect of drought on shrub seedling establishment. Our findings point to the importance of experimentally studying multidimensional interactions for coexistence of different life forms and to the underestimated role of light for success in water-limited ecosystems.

AB Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in sedimentation of particulate organic material (POM) was studied in a large subtropical lake, and its export from the upper mixed layer was quantified. Sedimentation fluxes were measured over 4 yr with traps deployed in pelagic and littoral areas, the benthic boundary layer (BBL), and the lake interior. Analysis of fluxes and composition of collected material showed that traps deployed at the lake periphery and in the BBL notably overestimate the export flux of newly produced POM. The best estimation of the primary production (PP) export from the upper mixed layer was achieved when traps were deployed in the quiescent hypolimnion, where the effect of lake boundaries is negligible. The proportion and composition of POM exported from the upper productive stratum was dependent on lake thermal and chemical structure and on the dominant phytoplankton species. The dynamics of photopigments (chlorophyll and beta-carotene) collected in hypolimnetic traps reflected the composition and abundance of phytoplankton in the upper mixed stratum. Despite large variation in algal community composition, the ratio of POM sedimentation flux to PP (export ratio) changed only slightly (average similar to 20%) throughout the stratified period. The observed temporal and spatial variability of sedimentation flux in response to ambient conditions was influenced by secondary processes (resuspension at the lake boundaries and oversampling under turbulent conditions) as intensely as by the actual export of POM.

AB Both local and regional processes may contribute to community diversity and structure at local scales. Although many studies have investigated patterns of local or regional community structure, few have addressed the extent to which local community structure influences patterns within regional species pools. Here we investigate the role of body size in community assembly at local and regional scales in Ctenotus lizards from arid Australia. Ctenotus has long been noted for its exceptional species diversity in the Australian arid-zone, and previous studies have attempted to elucidate the processes underlying species coexistence within communities of these lizards. However, no consensus has emerged on the role of interspecific competition in the assembly and maintenance of Ctenotus communities. We studied Ctenotus communities at several hundred sites in the arid interior of Australia to test the hypothesis that body sizes within local and regional Ctenotus assemblages should be overdispersed relative to null models of community assembly, and we explored the relationship between body size dispersion at local and regional scales. Results indicate a striking pattern of community-wide overdispersion of body size at local scales, as measured by the variance in size ratios among co-occurring species. However, we find no evidence for body size overdispersion within regional species pools, suggesting a lack of correspondence between processes influencing the distribution of species phenotypes at local and regional scales. We suggest that size ratio constancy in Ctenotus communities may have resulted from contemporary ecological interactions among species or ecological character displacement, and we discuss alternative explanations for the observed patterns.

DT Article
ID OPTIMIZATION; MODEL; WIND; ORIENTATION; DEPARTURE; MIGRANTS; STATE; FAT
AB Optimality models are frequently used in studies of long distance bird migration to help understand and predict migration routes, stopover strategies and fuelling behaviour in a spatially varying environment. These models typically evaluate bird behaviour by focusing on a single optimization currency, such as total migration time or energy-use, without explicitly considering trade-offs between the involved objectives. In this paper, we demonstrate that this classic single-objective approach downplays the importance of variability in bird behaviour. In the light of these considerations, we therefore propose to use a full multi-criteria optimization method to isolate the set of non-dominated, efficient or Pareto optimal solutions. Unlike single-objective optimization where there is only one combination of bird behaviour maximizing fitness, the Pareto solution set represents a range of optimal solutions to conflicting objectives. Our results demonstrate that this multi-objective approach provides important new ways of analyzing how environmental factors and behavioural constraints have driven the evolution of migratory behaviour.

TI Allocating time across multiple texts: Sampling and satisficing
SO HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
LA English
DT Article
ID PERSPECTIVE; STRATEGIES; MEMORY; CHOICE
AB We report two studies investigating readers' ability to allocate limited time adaptively across online texts of varying difficulty. In both studies participants were asked to learn about the human heart and were free to allocate time to 4 separate online texts about the heart but did not have enough time to read them all thoroughly. Of particular interest was whether readers attempted to select the best text for them (by sampling the texts before reading) or to monitor texts while reading them and continue reading any text judged good enough (a satisficing strategy). We argue that both strategies can be considered adaptive, depending on properties of readers, texts, and tasks. Experiment I tested readers with a range of background knowledge and allowed them either 7 or 15 min study time. It showed that participants were adaptive in how they allocated their time in that more knowledgeable readers spent more time reading more difficult texts. Satisficing was a much more common strategy than sampling. Experiment 2 showed that providing outline overviews of each text dramatically increased the number of participants using a sampling strategy so that it became the modal strategy. However, this change in strategy had no effect on learning. Outline overviews presumably changed readers' perception of the ease with which relevant dimensions of text quality can be judged.

AB 1. Ecosystem alterations can affect the abundance, distribution and diversity of plants and animals, and thus potentially change the relative strength of bottom-up (the plant resource) and top-down (natural enemies) trophic forces acting on herbivore populations.
   2. The hypothesis that alterations of the forest ecosystem associated with precommercial thinning have contributed to the increased severity of outbreaks of Neodiprion abietis (Harris), a sawfly defoliator, through the reduction of trophic forces acting on N. abietis larvae, was tested using exclusion techniques.
   3. The relative contributions to N. abietis larval mortality of bottom-up and top-down forces both increased with increasing levels of defoliation and were both reduced by thinning. The reduction of bottom-up and top-down forces caused a 58% mean increase in N. abietis larval survival in thinned compared with untreated stands, which is less than would be expected by the sum of the effects of thinning on each source of mortality. Evidence indicates that the partly compensatory, partly additive nature of the mortality associated with trophic forces in the system under study is responsible for this discrepancy.
   4. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show the impact of ecosystem alterations on the balance between bottom-up and top-down forces acting on an eruptive herbivore population along a gradient of host-plant defoliation, and how this can lead to increased outbreak severity. It is stressed that accurate estimates of the relative contributions of bottom-up and top-down forces to mortality cannot be obtained if the additive or compensatory nature of the mortality associated with these trophic forces is overlooked.

AB The precautionary approach calls for both target and limit reference points (TRPs and LRPs, respectively) and notes the vulnerability of developing fisheries to excess effort. LRPs should reflect a population's ability to continue to persist, which depends on lifetime egg production (LEP) and current abundance. The unique characteristics of sea urchin fisheries, such as (i) tight ecological coupling, (ii) their being roe fisheries, (iii) protection of juveniles under adult spine canopies, and (iv) broadcast spawning, can influence their management. Most North American sea urchin fisheries developed rapidly. Their reference points include (i) several LRPs and TRPs based on the logistic or surplus production model, (ii) a unique TRP involving direct monitoring of the bathymetric position of their macro phyte food, and (iii) an LRP based on the fraction of natural, unfished LEP. The dominant effect of fishing down and serial depletion on catch and effort data from developing sea urchin fisheries adversely affects fits to the logistic model. Reference points based on tight ecological coupling will be useful only where food webs are simple and one-dimensional. Sea urchin fisheries developed in the future should consider the fraction of natural LEP as an LRP and attempt to limit early excess fishing capacity.

   LIZARDS; SPRINT SPEED; TRADE-OFFS; COST; EVOLUTION; BURDEN; GROWTH
AB Reduction in locomotor performance during pregnancy is a potential cost of reproduction for female lizards and snakes. Most previous studies have suggested that reduced locomotor performance is a direct result of carrying a physical burden (the clutch). However, recent studies suggest that physiological changes associated with pregnancy can also cause a reduction in locomotor performance, particularly in viviparous species with prolonged gestation. I measured locomotor performance of the Northern Death Adder (Acanthophis praelongus), a viviparous, semiaquatic ambush foraging snake from tropical Australia. Swimming speeds of males and nonreproductive females were very similar, but late-term gravid females swam 30% more slowly than nonreproductive animals. Females with enlarged oviductal follicles carried physical burdens similar in size to those carried by gravid females but did not have impaired locomotor performance. Swimming speed of gravid females was unrelated to two measures of relative clutch mass. These results support the hypothesis that physiological changes during late pregnancy contribute to the decrement in locomotor performance during pregnancy. Because locomotor performance was uncorrelated with the level of reproductive investment, survival costs during pregnancy may be less important than previously thought, particularly if physiological costs during pregnancy render females vulnerable to starvation or predation following parturition. Additional field studies are needed to clarify the nature of survival costs in natural populations and their consequences for the evolution of squamate life histories.

AB Scientists observe nature, search for generalizations, and provide explanations for why the world is as it is. Generalizations are of two kinds. The first are descriptive and inductive, such as Boyle's Law. They are derived from observations and therefore refer to observables (in this case, pressure and volume). The second are often imaginative and form the axioms of a deductive theory, such as Newton's Laws of Motion. They often refer to unobservables (e.g. inertia and gravitation). Biology has many inductive generalizations (e.g. Bergmann's Rule and 'all cells arise from preexisting cells') but few, if any, recognized universal laws and virtually no deductive theory. Many biologists and philosophers of biology have agreed that predictive theory is inappropriate in biology, which is said to be more complex than physics, and that one can have nonpredictive explanations, such as the neo-Darwinian Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection. Other philosophers dismiss nonpredictive, explanatory theories, including evolutionary 'theory', as metaphysics. Most biologists do not think of themselves as philosophers or give much thought to the philosophical basis of their research. Nevertheless, their philosophy shows in the way they do research. The plethora of ad hoc (i.e. not universal) hypotheses indicates that biologists are reluctant inductivists in that the search for generalization does not have a high priority. Biologists test their hypotheses by verification. Theoretical physicists, in contrast, are deductive unifiers and test their explanatory hypotheses by falsification.
   I argue that theoretical biology (concerned with unobservables, such as fitness and natural selection) is not scientific because it lacks universal laws and predictive theory. In order to make this argument, I review the differences between verificationism and falsificationism, induction and deduction, and descriptive and explanatory laws. I show how these differ with a specific example of a successful and still useful (even if now superseded as explanatory) deductive theory, Newton's Theory of Motion. I also review some of the philosophical views expressed on these topics because philosophers seem to be even more divided than biologists, which is not at all helpful.
   The fact that biology does not have predictive theories does not constitute irrefutable evidence that it cannot have them. The only way to falsify this philosophical hypothesis, however, is to produce a predictive theory with universal biological laws. I have proposed such a theory, but it has been presented piecemeal. At the end of this paper, I bring the pieces together into a deductive theory on the evolution of life history traits (e.g. clutch size, mating relationships, sexual size dimorphism).

ID GASTROPODS
AB Vermetidae are a small family of warm-water sessile gastropods capable of building upright tubes (feeding-tubes) to take advantage of the water now. Laboratory and field experiments carried out on some Mediterranean species (Vermetus triquetrus, Vermetus granulatus and Serpulorbis arenaria) suggest that these structures function as exploratory tubes built not only to receive a better water flow but mainly to avoid obstacles. In fact, vermetids experimentally exposed in situ to different hydrodynamic conditions do not produce them, but do so in the presence of an obstacle, such as thalli during the massive spring algal growth. This strategy allows them to compete for a virtual space, not directly occupied by the vermetid itself but necessary to spread its mucous net. This interpretation may improve the inference of paleo-environmental events from shell morphology. When building a feeding-tube, vermetids first cut off a portion of the shell on the side towards which they prepare to turn, using their radula, and then produce a new tube formed by short segments, at different angles; till they have reached the desired direction. This process is confirmed by the presence of scars on the shell, composed by a succession of lamellae. The regular distribution of these scars on fossil Petaloconchus intortus, which lived in soft substrates, may be interpreted as a response to periodical anoxic crises or an increase in the sedimentation rates, Their great morphological plasticity makes vermetids close to colonial or modular animals. Thanks to their capability of expressing more than one growth-form, and of re-moulding their shell, they successfully compete for substrate space and are key-stone species in fringe habitats.

AB Heterotrophic nitrogen-fixation (acetylene reduction) was measured during decomposition (under dark conditions) of Rhizophora mangle L. and Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn leaf litter. Nitrogen-fixation rates in leaf litter increased following 24 d incubation, then decreased after similar or equal to 44 d for both species. Maximum rates of 66.2 and 64.6 nmol C2H4 g(-1) dry wt h(-1) were reached by R. mangle and A. germinans leaf litter, respectively. Higher fixation rates of leaf litter were associated with an increase in water content and sediment particles on leaf surfaces of both species. Rates of nitrogen fixation by diazotrophs attached to sediment particles were not significantly different from zero. With additions of D-glucose, ethylene production rates increased by factors of 625-, 34- and 7-fold for sediment, R. mangle and A. germinans leaf litter, respectively, compared to rates prior to enrichment. These organically enhanced rates of nitrogen fixation on leaves could be accounted for by increased activity associated with attached sediment particles and not the leaf material. Total phenolics [reported as tannic acid equivalent (TAE) units] decreased nitrogen-fixation rates when added to D-glucose-enriched sediment at >20 mg TAE l(-1). Phenolic compounds could explain the initial lag in rates of nitrogen fixation during leaf-litter decomposition of R. mangle (initial content of 110.8 mg TAE g(-1) dry wt), but not of A. germinans (initial content of 23.4 mg TAE g(-1) dry wt). The higher phenolic content and reportedly lower carbon substrate of R. mangle did not result in species-specific differences in either the magnitude or temporal pattern of nitrogen fixation compared to A. germinans leaf litter. We conclude that the availability of organic substrates leached from the leaf litter along with colonization by the heterotrophic diazotrophs las indicated by sediment accumulation) controls nitrogen-fixation rates in a similar manner in the leaf litter of both species.

AB The complex life history of many amphibians has been designed to take advantage of the resources of two completely different habitats. The aquatic free-living amphibian larva is different from the terrestrial adult regarding morphology, physiology and behavioural patterns. Therefore, in the life-time of an individual amphibian, two discontinuous growth stanzas are exhibited. The sigmoid growth model fits well with both stanzas. The rapid growth of the larval amphibian can be described by the double exponential Gompertz equation, whereas the slow growth process of the transformed amphibian can be described by the von Bertalanffy growth model. The bulk of amphibian growth occurs in the terrestrial phase and is not independent of size, age, sex and environmental conditions. The endocrine regulation of growth in amphibians is unique in the sense that the mechanism of pituitary action is different in aquatic and terrestrial phases.

AB Grafting of adult sponge fragments (Chalinula sp.) led to isograft fusion and allograft nonfusion in both parabiotic and implant grafts.  We conclude that adult Chalinula sp. individuals discriminate between self and nonself, and fuse only isogeneic fragments.  In the laboratory, however, larvae and early juveniles fuse.  Larvae used in the experiments were probably genetically different, even if they were asexually reproduced.  These results indicate that the capacity for fusion between allogeneic individuals disappears during ontogenesis in this sponge.  In some cases, multichimeras were formed when up to five larvae fused to yield a single sponge.  All 37 chimeras metamorphosed and survived during 17 days of observation.  Possible mechanisms for the formation of sponge chimeras during early development are discussed, as are the costs and benefits of chimera formation at juvenile versus adult stages.  We propose that, if fusion exists in the field, it occurs between kin larvae.

AB Microhabitat use and diet of a small mammal community comprising seven species were investigated in the southern Kalahari, South Africa.  The rodents (six species:  Gerbillurus paeba, Rhabdomys pumilio, Aethomys namaquensis, Mus indutus, Saccostomus campestris, Desmodillus auricularis) were primarily herbivorous and the single elephant shrew Elephantulus intufi was largely insectivorous, indicating limited partitioning along a trophic axis.  The two most abundant rodent species G. paeba and R. pumilio differed in their periods of activity as well as their use of the horizontal foraging microhabitat, indicating temporal and spatial resource partitioning.  The remaining rodent species were nocturnal, beneath-shrub foragers.

AB In a rapidly changing world, quantifying ecosystem resilience is an important challenge. Historically, resilience has been defined via models that do not take spatial effects into account. These systems can only adapt via uniform adjustments. In reality, however, the response is not necessarily uniform, and can lead to the formation of (self-organised) spatial patterns - typically localised vegetation patches. Classical measures of resilience cannot capture the emerging dynamics in spatially self-organised systems, including transitions between patterned states that have limited impact on ecosystem structure and productivity. We present a framework of interlinked phase portraits that appropriately quantifies the resilience of patterned states, which depends on the number of patches, the distances between them and environmental conditions. We show how classical resilience concepts fail to distinguish between small and large pattern transitions, and find that the variance in interpatch distances provides a suitable indicator for the type of imminent transition. Subsequently, we describe the dependency of ecosystem degradation based on the rate of climatic change: slow change leads to sporadic, large transitions, whereas fast change causes a rapid sequence of smaller transitions. Finally, we discuss how pre-emptive removal of patches can minimise productivity losses during pattern transitions, constituting a viable conservation strategy.

AB Pelagic gillnet (driftnet) fisheries account for some 34 % of Indian Ocean tuna catches. We combined published results from 10 bycatch sampling programmes (1981-2016) in Australia, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan to estimate bycatch rates for cetaceans across all Indian Ocean tuna gillnet fisheries. Estimated cetacean bycatch peaked at almost 100 000 ind. yr(-1) during 2004-2006, but has declined by over 15% since then, despite an increase in tuna gillnet fishing effort. These fisheries caught an estimated cumulative total of 4.1 million small cetaceans between 1950 and 2018. These bycatch estimates take little or no account of cetaceans caught by gillnet but not landed, of delayed mortality or sub-lethal impacts on cetaceans (especially whales) that escape from gillnets, of mortality associated with ghost nets, of harpoon catches made from gillnetters, or of mortality from other tuna fisheries. Total cetacean mortality from Indian Ocean tuna fisheries may therefore be substantially higher than estimated here. Declining cetacean bycatch rates suggest that such levels of mortality are not sustainable. Indeed, mean small cetacean abundance may currently be 13% of pre-fishery levels. None of these estimates are precise, but they do demonstrate the likely order of magnitude of the issue. Countries with the largest current gillnet catches of tuna, and thus the ones likely to have the largest cetacean bycatch are (in order): Iran, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Oman, Yemen, UAE and Tanzania. These 9 countries together may account for roughly 96% of all cetacean bycatch from tuna gillnet fisheries across the Indian Ocean.

AB Microrganisms such as cyanobacteria have been often considered as exhibiting wide distribution mainly driven by environmental heterogeneity. Recently, however, new findings have evoked the role of previously neglected processes, such as dispersal limitation, determining the distribution of a wide range of microorganisms, including cyanobacteria. Here, we reviewed the biogeographic patterns of cyanobacteria with focus on molecular data and the evidences from the published literature for the processes driving these patterns. Also, considerations are made about concept of species, discordances in the taxonomic concepts, and level of taxonomic resolution, and how these affect the biogeographic study of cyanobacteria. From a overview, it can be observed that both environmental and historical factors are important to structure cyanobacteria diversity across time and space. Moreover, different species may exhibit significant differences in their distribution patterns, from possibly cosmopolitan species to other endemic species. However, distribution patterns are closely dependent on the concept of species, besides the taxonomic resolution, spatial and environmental scales, and the biases of the molecular methodologies applied in the studies. Thus, efforts to broaden sampling and sequencing of unknown and less-known species, as well as geographic regions and habitats poorly exploited, are crucial for a better understanding of cyanobacteria biogeography.

AB Background: Bergmann's rule proposes that animals in cold habitats will be larger than those in warm habitats. This prediction has been tested thoroughly at the intraspecific level, but few studies have investigated the hypothesis with interspecific data using phylogenetic comparative approaches. Many clades of mammals have representatives in numerous distinct biomes, making this order highly suitable for a large-scale interspecific assessment of Bergmann's rule. Here, we evaluate Bergmann's rule within 22 mammalian families-with a dataset that include similar to 35 % of all described species-using a phylogenetic comparative approach. The method is based on an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution that allows for joint estimation of adaptation and constraints (phylogenetic inertia) in the evolution of a trait. We use this comparative method to investigate whether body mass evolves towards phenotypic optima that are functions of median latitude, maximum latitude or temperature. We also assess the closely related Allen's rule in five families, by testing if relative forelimb length evolves as a function of temperature or latitude.
   Results: Among 22 mammalian families, there was weak support for Bergmann's rule in one family: A decrease in temperature predicted increased body mass in Canidae (canids). We also found latitude and temperature to significantly predict body mass in Geomyidae (pocket gophers); however, the association went in the opposite direction of Bergmann's predictions. Allen's rule was supported in one of the five examined families (Pteropodidae; megabats), but only when forelimb length evolves towards an optimum that is a function of maximum latitude, not median latitude or temperature.
   Conclusions: Based on this exhaustive assessment of Bergmann's rule, we conclude that factors other than latitude and temperature are the major drivers of body mass evolution at the family level in mammals.

AB A previous molecular study has revealed that the Mediterranean reef-building vermetid gastropod Dendropoma petraeum comprises a complex of at least four cryptic species with non-overlapping ranges. Once speciic genetic differences were detected, 'a posteriori' searching for phenotypic characters has been undertaken to differentiate cryptic species and to formally describe and name them. The name D. petraeum (Monterosato, 1884) should be restricted to the species of this complex distributed around the central Mediterranean (type locality in Sicily). In the present work this taxon is redescribed under the oldest valid name D. cristatum (Biondi, 1857), and a new species belonging to this complex is described, distributed in the western Mediterranean. These descriptions are based on a comparative study focusing on the protoconch, teleoconch, and external and internal anatomy. Morphologically, the two species can be only distinguished on the basis of non-easily visible anatomical features, and by differences in protoconch size and sculpture. On the other hand, some differences between species are evident in features of the intracapsular larval development: the number and size of the egg capsules brooded per female at the same time, the number of egg/embryos per eggs capsule, egg diameter and type of intracapsular nutrition.

AB Whereas humans are risk averse for monetary gains, other animals can be risk seeking for food rewards, especially when faced with variable delays or under significant deprivation. A key difference between these findings is that humans are often explicitly told about the risky options, whereas non-human animals must learn about them from their own experience. We tested pigeons (Columba livia) and humans in formally identical choice tasks where all outcomes were learned from experience. Both species were more risk seeking for larger rewards than for smaller ones. The data suggest that the largest and smallest rewards experienced are overweighted in risky choice. This observed bias towards extreme outcomes represents a key step towards a consilience of these two disparate literatures, identifying common features that drive risky choice across phyla.

AB Model studies suggest that semiarid ecosystems with patterned vegetation can respond in a nonlinear way to climate change. This means that gradual changes can result in a rapid transition to a desertified state. Previous model studies focused on the response of patterned semiarid ecosystems to changes in mean annual rainfall. The intensity of rain events, however, is projected to change as well in the coming decades. In this paper, we study the effect of changes in rainfall intensity on the functioning of patterned semiarid ecosystems with a spatially explicit model that captures rainwater partitioning and runoff-runon processes with simple event-based process descriptions. Analytical and numerical analyses of the model revealed that rainfall intensity is a key parameter in explaining patterning of vegetation in semiarid ecosystems as low mean rainfall intensities do not allow for vegetation patterning to occur. Surprisingly, we found that, for a constant annual rainfall rate, both an increase and a decrease in mean rainfall intensity can trigger desertification. An increase negatively affects productivity as a greater fraction of the rainwater is lost as runoff. This can result in a shift to a bare desert state only if the mean rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of bare soil. On the other hand, a decrease in mean rainfall intensity leads to an increased fraction of rainwater infiltrating in bare soils, remaining unavailable to plants. Our findings suggest that considering rainfall intensity as a variable may help in assessing the proximity to regime shifts in patterned semiarid ecosystems and that monitoring losses of resource through runoff and bare soil infiltration could be used to determine ecosystem resilience.

AB For any reintroduction it is important to maximise the probability of released individuals establishing in the target area (settling and surviving to breed). Factors influencing establishment have typically been studied at single sites, making it impossible to assess factors that vary at the site level (e.g. connectivity) or quantify unpredictable variation among sites. Using data from 14 reintroductions of the North Island robin (Petroica longipes) to native forest reserves, we show how Bayesian modelling can be used to identify general drivers of establishment and to account for site-to-site variation when making predictions for new sites. High landscape connectivity and high rat tracking rates (a density index) at reintroduction sites were key factors associated with lower individual establishment probabilities. Habitat similarity between source and release sites was also important, as robins sourced from native forest had higher establishment than those from exotic pine forest. Previous predator experience appeared to affect establishment in sites with mammalian predators, as founders sourced from sites with these predators had higher establishment than those from other sites. Our approach can be applied to a wide range of species that are being reintroduced to multiple sites, providing guidance on source and release site selection, efficacy of management interventions, and the numbers of individuals to release to achieve desired initial population sizes. The results are not only applicable to these particular species, but can be used to predict site suitability for reintroductions of species with similar dispersal behaviour or other ecological characteristics.

SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

DT Review
ID LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY; SUSTAINABILITY; FUTURE
AB Attracting professionals from diverse disciplines, the ecosystem services conceptual framework with integrative character strives to provide a solution to the drastic decline of the natural resources of our planet. Nonetheless, losses of ecosystem services accelerate more rapidly than ever. As humans interact with nature, increasing their global presence in both scale and intensity, the need for a new macroeconomic world emerges. This world should be based on an integration of nature and society (nature-societal) or society and ecosystems (socio-ecosystem), which will facilitate the transition toward sustainable ecosystem services management. Achieving this new macroeconomic economic paradigm would require redesigning a new thought process that embraces ecosystem services as precious goods, rather than unlimited and free, unappreciated resources. Market and government are not sufficient for this new macro-economics, in which ecosystem services are its main content. We suggest an integrated set of market, government, and human values to manage ecosystem services, as traditional, narrow, economic, political and scientific solutions alone do not adequately address the sustainable use of natural ecosystems. Culture, created from human values which, to a certain extent, can be influenced or directed, has the capacity to influence the interactions between nature, social and economic systems. The ancient Chinese philosophy of 'unity of man with nature' provides principles which can guide and develop human values into a new, positive force with the potential to harmoniously manage sustainable ecosystem services.

AB With increasing reports of overexploitation of wild plants for timber and non-timber forest products, there has been an increase in the number of studies investigating the effect of harvest on the dynamics of harvested populations. However, most studies have failed to account for temporal and spatial variability in the ecological conditions in which these species occur, as well as variability in the patterns of harvest intensity. In reality, local harvesters harvest at variable rather than fixed intensity over time. Here we used Markov chains to investigate how different patterns of harvesting intensity ( summarized as return time to high harvest) affected the stochastic population growth rate (lambda(s)) and its elasticity to perturbation of means and variances of vital rates. We studied the effect of bark and foliage harvest from African mahogany Khaya senegalensis in two contrasting ecological regions in Benin. Khaya populations declined regardless of time between harvests of high intensity. Moreover, lambda(s) increased with decreasing harvesting pressure in the dry region but, surprisingly, declined in the moist region toward lambda(s) = 0.956. The stochastic elasticity was dominated by the stasis of juveniles and adults. The declining growth rate with decreasing harvest pressure in the moist region was mainly driven by the declining mean survival rates of juveniles and adults. Our results suggest that modeling the temporal variability of harvest intensity as a Markov chain better mimics local practices and provides insights that are missed when temporal variability in harvest intensity is modeled as independent over time and drawn from a fixed distribution.

AB The concept of thresholds is applied broadly in ecology to both processes and states that exhibit step-like behavior. Thresholds are observed in parameters, equilibrium states, and in states over time, but presence or absence of thresholds at any of these levels does not provide information about the occurrence of thresholds at the other levels. Here we explore the relationship between thresholds and theory of multiple stable states. We present a 2-species Lotka-Volterra model of competition to illustrate that thresholds and hysteresis-like behavior are possible in linear systems. A grazing model is presented to show that multiple stable states are possible without thresholds in the underlying processes. The concept of thresholds within the context of multiple stable states is reviewed in an attempt to resolve some of the confusion that stems from the different meanings of thresholds.

AB Translocation outcomes for mobile species can be affected by post-release movement of individuals, yet few population reintroduction and supplementation projects consider propensity to move as a selection criterion when selecting individuals to release or sites for release. We investigate the influence of release age (juvenile or subadult), the size of the release group and the size of the wild population at the release site on movements of Critically Endangered kaki (black stilt) Himantopus novaezelandiae. Over 460 subadult and juvenile kaki have been released during 12 years at nine sites in the Waitaki Basin, New Zealand, with the aim of supplementing specific sub-populations. Among the survivors that reached breeding age, 32% of released kaki ended up away from their release sites, i.e. away from the subpopulations they were intended to augment and 15% of these birds were in unmanageable areas where monitoring cannot take place. Kaki released as juveniles (2-3 months) made more long moves and moved further from the release site during 2 months post-release. The presence of conspecifics affected behaviour after release: released birds were more likely to remain closer to the release site when the size of the wild population at the release site was large, and kaki released in larger groups were more likely to make more longer moves. Despite initial differences in mobility, long-term monitoring revealed equal proportions of 2-year old survivors that had been released as juveniles and subadults returning and being observed consistently at release sites, emphasizing the value of long-term monitoring in informing release strategies for population restorations.

AB Incorporating public or local preferences in landscape planning is often discussed with respect to the difficulties associated with accurate representation, stimulating interest and overcoming barriers to participation. Incorporating sectoral and professional preferences may also have the same degree of difficulty where conflicts can arise. Planning theory calls for inclusiveness and collaboration, ideally egalitarian, and analysis of the process often uses case study scenarios that may offer examples for practice and further research. Much of the literature takes case studies in urban landscapes as the starting point for discussion and little is known of the collaborative process in rural landscapes, especially damaged landscapes such as those that may occur after extreme resource extraction. In this paper, we use industrially mined, or 'cutaway', peatlands as illustrative examples of the remaining 'scarred' landscapes. Using narratives of 'knowledge-holders' as iterative examples, we explore the perspectives of key actors within scarred landscape after-use planning. It is shown that though there is agreement that community 'stakes' are important, there are conflicts relating to the exact level of collaboration or to the extent that it is necessary at all. Traditional sectoral approaches predominate with community level narratives following established pathways. The prevailing rationalities revolve around protectionism and differing opinions of knowledge. Where a policy vacuum exists in relation to after-use of damaged landscapes, the resulting conflict may be an impediment to non-tokenistic stakeholder collaboration. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
ID REPRODUCTIVE EFFORT; BUMBLE BEES; BEHAVIOR; ANIMALS; AGE
AB Learning is probably a major contributor to fitness in most animals yet it has not been well integrated into life history research. To quantify the role of learning in shaping lifetime patterns of performance, we must measure learning in natural settings as well as in controlled experimental conditions. As a part of a long-term project measuring the relative contributions of learning, physiology, and effort to observed patterns of lifetime performance, I quantified the foraging success of worker honeybees in the wild. Bees exhibited a four-fold increase in the net rate of food delivery to the colony over their first 4 d as foragers. The major contributors to that pattern were decreases in departure weights and increases in arrival weights. Combined with previous research, this study suggests that learning is the major contributor to the observed increases in lifetime performance, whereas age-specific changes in physiology and effort have a significant though lesser role.

AB Granivory (seed feeding) evolved in many animal groups. Field observations hint at the existence of granivory in terrestrial isopods (Crustacea: Isopoda: Oniscidea), for which it was previously unknown. In this paper granivory in terrestrial isopods is addressed for the first time, focusing on (i) seed acceptance in the presence of plant litter and (ii) size as a constraint for acceptance and consumption. In a laboratory choice experiment, Armadillidium vulgare consumed seeds of Capsella bursa-pastoris and Poa annua when plant litter was present. In a no-choice experiment, seeds of seven plant species were offered to four isopod species giving 13 combinations in total [A. vulgare (seven species of seeds), Oniscus asellus (two), Porcellio scaber (two), and Porcellionides pruinosus (two)]. The tested isopods differed in their acceptance (proportion of individuals consuming seeds) and consumption (both number and amount of seeds eaten) of seed species. Size as a constraint was demonstrated in A. vulgare offered Cirsium arvense seed, since the probability that this large seed was eaten increased with body size of the isopod. In the other 10 seed-isopod pairs, seed consumption increased linearly with isopod body size. Granivory is thus widespread in terrestrial isopods, although the tendency to eat seeds differs between species.

AB Rodents form a vital component of Free State ecosystems and monitoring them may be a relatively quick and inexpensive method of indicating healthy or unhealthy ecosystem functioning. Using removal trapping, we have studied rodent seasonal abundance, species richness, Shannon diversity, and evenness of rodents in four habitats in the Tussen-die-Riviere Nature Reserve, inspected the most successful sampling method for these habitats, and report on their community structure and how it is related to an Ecological Index (approximate to EI value of grassland). Both species richness and Shannon diversity increased significantly with EI value. The indicator species Mastomys coucha occurred at all plots, but contributed the largest proportion of the total captures (ca. 80%) at the plot with lowest EI value. Other results important for small mammal monitoring and collecting are that trap success and species richness was highest in autumn. This study also confirms that four days and nights continuous trapping is essential for the effective sampling of rodent communities in Free State grasslands. Our results partially support expectations that the number of specialist species increases with succession, M. coucha dominance acts as an indicator of habitat disturbance, rodent species richness conforms to Tilman's hump-shaped curve model, and adds to a baseline of diversity indices in a variety of grassland habitats.

AB Nineteen exclosures on sagebrush steppe and shadscale rangelands, varying in age from 18 to 38 years, were sampled for plant species richness, plant composition, indicators of soil erosion, ground cover, vegetative cover, and herb-low shrub layer screening cover. Features within the exclosures were compared with adjacent sites of the same size that were open to grazing by livestock and wildlife. Species richness typically was slightly greater inside p exclosures than in adjacent grazed sites (median = 2 more species inside exclosures), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.16). Similarity of plant community composition between exclosures and adjacent grazed sites ranged from 45% to 82%. Evidences 4 soil movement, soil pedestals, and soil flow patterns were all more pronounced outside exclosures than inside (P less than or equal to 0.02), even though many sites were on flat to mild slopes (median slope = 12%). Meta-analysis of the 19 exclosure sites indicated that grazing exclusion resulted in less bare ground cover compared with adjacent grazed sites (P less than or equal to 0.05). The effect of grazing exclusion on visible soil surface cryptogams was significant (P less than or equal to 0.05), with generally greater cover inside exclosures. Cryptogam cover differences between grazed sites and exclosures tended to increase with the number of years of grazing exclusion (r = 0.64, P = 0.046). Pseudoroegneria spicata, a principal livestock forage, averaged greater basal cover inside exclosures than outside on 4 of 10 sites where it occurred, although no exclosure sites had greater P spicata cover on grazed sites. Meta-analysis of the 10 sites indicated that grazing exclusion resulted in greater P spicata cover compared with adjacent grazed areas (P less than or equal to 0.05). Poa secunda, a short-growing grass that initiates growth early in the spring and is not important livestock forage, averaged greater basal cover outside exclosores on 5 of 15 sites where it occurred. Meta-analysis of the 15 sites indicated a significant treatment effect (P less than or equal to 0.05), with greater Poa secunda basal cover outside exclosures. Grazing exclusion resulted in greater screening cover in the herb-low shrub layer (0-0.5 m height; P less than or equal to 0.05). These results indicate that despite improved livestock grazing management over the past half century, livestock grazing still can limit the potential of native plant communities in sagebrush steppe ecosystems, and that the health of semiarid ecosystems can improve with livestock exclusion in the absence of other disturbances. A few exclosure sites were similar for the measured parameters, suggesting that these sites were ecologically stable and that exclusion of livestock grazing was not sufficient to move succession toward more pristine conditions, at least within the time periods studied. Managed disturbance such as fire or mechanical brush treatments may be necessary to restore herb productivity on these ecologically stable sites.

AB An integrated study of the early Messinian reef complex cropping out along the eastern coast of the Salento Peninsula (southern Italy), including stratigraphy, facies analysis and paleoecological aspects, is here presented. Fourteen facies types belonging to three main facies associations (back reef and shelf, shelf-edge, slope) have been recognized. They document a wide spectrum of depositional environments, reef building organisms and growth fabrics, in response to depth and other environmental factors in different parts of the reef complex.
   The biotic structure of the reef is also described and discussed in detail. It consists of different types of reef building organisms and of their bioconstructions (mainly Porites coral reefs, Halimeda bioherms and vermetidmicrobial "trottoirs"), that differ in composition and structure according to their position on the shelf edge-to-slope profile.
   Results indicate that the reef complex of the Salento Peninsula has strong similarities with the typical early Messinian reefs of the Mediterranean region. However, the recognition of some peculiar features, i.e. the remarkable occurrence of Halimeda bioherms and of vermetid-microbial "trottoirs", gives new insights for better understanding reef patterns and development of the reef belt during the Late Miocene in the Mediterranean.

AB 1. We used the composition of nest middens to describe the extent of dietary partitioning in an exceptionally diverse assemblage of harvester ants in the Kakadu region of northern Australia. Eight of the >15 harvester species known from adjacent 30 x 30-m plots, comprising four species of Meranoplus and two species each of Monomorium and Pheidole, maintained conspicuous nest middens.
   2. All these eight harvester species are monomorphic (or functionally so in the context of seed collection), with total body length ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 mm. The two species of Monomorium are column foragers, whereas the others apparently forage solitarily. Nests averaged 0.1 m(2), but were highly patchy both within and between plots.
   3. Seed fragments from a total of 33 plant species were identified from 50 middens sampled during the end of the wet season, with up to 19 seed species recorded from a single midden. Seed species diversity was greatest in middens of Meranoplus minimus, Monomorium sp. 1 (rothsteini group) and Pheidole sp. 1 (mjobergi group), and least in middens of the diversus group of Meranoplus.
   4. Despite a high overall diversity of seed species, each harvester species collected primarily two or three seed species (with one exception, all grasses), and there was virtually no overlap in these species between harvesters. The pronounced dietary separation of harvester species was demonstrated by multivariate analysis of midden composition.
   5. The extent to which differential seed selection is determined by intrinsic preferences, vs. interactions between, harvester species is unknown, nor is it clear why the diversity of harvester ants is so high. However, it is likely that differential seed selection plays a significant role in species coexistence.

AB Near-surface sediments from two sections in the Nahal Zeelim delta of the Dead Sea (Israel) with low total organic carbon contents of 0.4-0.8% were studied by molecular and isotopic organic geochemical techniques to determine the origin of the extractable lipid components. The molecular investigation showed most of the material in this extremely hypersaline environment to be of terrestrial origin. This was indicated by a dominance of 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3 beta-ol and 24-ethylcholesta-5,22-dien-3 beta-ol in the sterol distribution as well as an abundance of angiosperm triterpenoids like beta-amyrin, alpha-amyrin, lupeol and their oxidized derivatives. The n-alkane distribution patterns are very similar in all samples studied and typical of an origin from epicuticular waxes of higher land plants. This is corroborated by delta(13)C values of the n-alkanes between -28.1 and -33.6 parts per thousand. The even-over-odd carbon number predominance of the long-chain fatty acids (C-20-C-30) and their range of delta(13)C values (-27.3 to -31.3 parts per thousand) are also in accordance with an origin from C-3 terrestrial plants. The pronounced C-13 depletion of the short-chain fatty acids (C-14-C-18) further substantiates the dominance of terrestrial plant material in the sediments and highlights the limited importance of autochthonous biomass in the Dead Sea water. The n-alcohol distribution patterns show a strong even-over-odd carbon number preference and, compared to the n-alkanes, are enriched in C-13 by 2-5 parts per thousand, which suggests a small contribution of aquatic organic matter particularly to the short-chain homologues. indications for a supply from autochthonous organisms to the sedimentary organic matter were derived from the high amounts of phytol with delta(13)C values between -22.8 and -19.7 parts per thousand, the isotopic composition of cholesterol (-23.9 to -21.9 parts per thousand) and low concentrations of 24-methyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol and 24-ethyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol. They are attributed to the only primary producer in the Dead Sea described so far, i.e. the unicellular green alga Dunaliella parva. In addition, the archaean cell walls of halophilic bacterial communities like Halorubrum sodomense are represented by significant amounts of bis-O-phytanylglycerol (-22.3 to -23.0 parts per thousand).

AB The effects of 10 yr of military training exercises on vegetation structure were assessed across plant communities that differed in physiognomy and soil texture at Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site (PCMS), Colorado, after release from previous grazing management. Covariate analyses aided in separating temporal trends due to both release from grazing and imposition of training disturbance from the direct effect of training. The shift in land use had both synergistic and antagonistic impacts on successional trajectories of communities, and on horizontal and vertical structural heterogeneity. Vegetation basal cover declined with increasing intensity of disturbance by tracked vehicles, but release from grazing arts additively in this ecosystem, Litter cover increased following release from grazing, even though it declined with increasing levels of disturbance. Vehicular maneuvering generally reduced woody life forms in tall-height classes to a greater extent than short-height classes. Low growing cacti were susceptible to crushing. Species and functional group responses to vehicular disturbance were sometimes dependent on community type, Long-lived perennials declined, but were replaced by short-lived perennials in only the shrub-grassland community. Annuals and exotics did not show relationships with intensity of disturbance, though some weed species increased. Community-wide species dissimilarity did not show large shifts, and patterns in species diversity or richness were not related to intensity of disturbance. The PCMS appears to be in a transient stage where release from grazing has had as much or more impacts as did the imposition of military training. Fine textured soils may be more susceptible to the cumulative effects of vehicular loads.

AB 1. This study uses descriptive data to examine the shift in dominance in the rotifer community in summer from Keratella cochlearis to Anuraeopsis fissa in a shallow eutrophic lake. Population density and egg ratio were estimated from May to September for these small loricate rotifers, as well as the soft-bodied Filinia longiseta and Polyarthra spp., to compare rates of population increase, birth and death.
   2. Keratella cochlearis was succeeded by A. fissa in late May, perhaps as a result of the shorter egg development times of the latter at temperatures > 15 degrees C, and species-specific responses to food and predation. Population variables suggest that the decline of K. cochlearis was the result of a food shortage which caused a decrease in reproduction and increased mortality.
   3. High population densities of A. fissa and Polyarthra spp. were associated with low egg ratios, birth rates and rates of increase within a species, suggesting intraspecific competition. The egg ratios of the two soft-bodied rotifers were strongly intercorrelated in the study period, although their diets supposedly differ. The egg ratios of A. fissa showed positively correlated fluctuations with the abundance of diatoms.
   4. Short periods of higher rates of increase of A. fissa conferred advantage to this rotifer and manifested in its dominance. The mean birth rates of A. fissa and F. longiseta were twice as high as for K. cochlearis. Furthermore, death rates of loricate and soft-bodied rotifers were similar and high, which suggests that food shortage similarly increased death rates, or that predation may be sometimes substantial for soft-bodied and loricate species, or both.
   5. Predation was probably not an important factor in steering the seasonal succession in the lake. A difference in abilities of the studied rotifers to exploit resources seems more important. Perhaps temperature is also a factor, but the specifics remain unclear and await more experimental work.

AB Standing biomass and production of crustacean zooplankton was measured from ten full-lake sampling cruises on Lake Malawi during 1992-3. Stage-specific development rates and dry weights were measured in the laboratory for the dominant species. Mean total standing biomass estimates for the whole lake ranged from 0.9 to 2.4 g dry wt m(-2). Overall mean biomass for the two years was 1.6 g dry wt m(-2). Total production estimates for the three dominant copepod species ranged from 66 to 210 mg dry wt m(-2) d(-1), with an average annual production of 49 g dry wt m(-2) y(-1). Maximum biomass and production rates were recorded in the south of the lake, although for copepods this was not marked and there was little consistency in their horizontal distribution. Cladocerans, however, were almost always more prevalent in the extreme south of the lake than elsewhere. The temporal pattern of zooplankton production showed marked seasonal variation, with maximum production after the onset of the S. E. trade winds and associated with increases in phtyoplankton abundance.

AB The swimming behavior of Daphnia pulex was compared between two temperatures (5 and 25 degrees C), with two acclimation protocols, using three-dimensional video techniques. Our hypotheses, based on Stokes' law and metabolic considerations, predicted large changes in swimming behavior. However, free-swimming individuals did not follow Stokes' law. They sank slower than predicted, having increased their sinking rate by similar to 23% from 5 to 25 degrees C. Anesthetized Daphnia followed Stokes' law, showing an increase in sinking rate of 70% over the temperature range. The Q(10) values of all swimming behaviors were between 0.91 and 1.11 (which are significantly less than Q10 values for metabolic rates) and were nearly uniform over a 20 degrees C range. Our results also indicate that acclimation to different temperatures for 1 h is sufficient to minimize acclimation effects.

AB The nutritional suitability of Ceratium furcoides for Eudiaptomus gracilis, Mesocyclops leuckarti, Thermocyclops oithonoides and Cyclops abyssorum was studied by observing ingestion and assimilation. The dinoflagellate was ingested by female adults of all species. The calanoid copepod E. gracilis could not utilize Ceratium; mortality was high and no egg production was observed when Ceratium was the only food source. Mortality was low for the adult cyclopoids on this food and reproduction indicated that Ceratium was assimilated. The first two copepodite instars of M. leuckarti were not able to handle Ceratium, while older stages preyed on them. The dinoflagellate was not ingested by female M. leuckarti when its densities were low. Advanced copepodite stages of C. abyssorum developed into adults on a diet of Ceratium only. Mesocyclops leuckarti females ingested Ceratium when offered a mixed food source of Ceratium and the rotifer Brachionus rubens, but the rotifer was positively selected, even if its density was low. The results show that Ceratium provides a suitable food source for advanced copepodite instars and adult cyclopoid copepods, although it is not a preferred food source.

AB Combined intensive-extensive (CIE) pond system composed of four 500-m3 intensive ponds and a 1.4-ha lagoon was studied.  Water was circulated between the intensive and extensive components.  The average hydraulic residence time in the intensive ponds was 5 h.  The role of nitrification was studied in the CIE system.  It was shown that the nitrifying bacteria are not active in the system even though the conditions for nitrification seem favorable:  the substrate for nitrification, ammonia, was always present and a high oxygen level was found in the intensive ponds.  Nitrification started only following a 24-h lag period and progressed exponentially, in samples taken from the ponds and incubated in the laboratory with continual shaking.  It was concluded that, due to the rapid flushing of the system, nitrifying bacteria are not able to adjust to the optimal conditions for nitrification existing in the intensive ponds.  Efficient nitrification in the intensive ponds was achieved by increasing the hydraulic residence time in the ponds, as flushing rate was slowed.

AB The distribution of living colonies of the calcareous hydrozoan Millepora complanata and broken and reattached millepore fragments was examined in m2 quadrats along line transects on fringing reefs at Barbados, West Indies. Of the broken fragments 35 % reattached, but survival was not found to be size-dependent, in contrast to reports of breakage in Scleractinia. The number of reattached fragments was positively correlated with the total number of fragments and with the number of quadrats containing millepore colonies. It is proposed that fragmentation has a selective advantage because of the high survival rate of fragments and that there should be an advantage to increasing colony size in the population because the risk of breakage increases with colony size.

AB Aim Clutch size is a key life-history trait. In lizards, it ranges over two orders of magnitude. The global drivers of spatial and phylogenetic variation in clutch have been extensively studied in birds, but such tests in other organisms are lacking. To test the generality of latitudinal gradients in clutch size, and their putative drivers, we present the first global-scale analysis of clutch sizes across lizard taxa. Location Global. Time period Recent. Major taxa studied Lizards (Reptilia, Squamata, Sauria). Methods We analysed clutch-size data for over 3,900 lizard species, using phylogenetic generalized least-square regression to study the relationships between clutch sizes and environmental (temperature, precipitation, seasonality, primary productivity, insularity) and ecological factors (body mass, insularity, activity times, and microhabitat use). Results Larger clutches are laid at higher latitudes and in more productive and seasonal environments. Insular taxa lay smaller clutches on average. Temperature and precipitation per se are unrelated to clutch sizes. In Africa, patterns differ from those on other continents. Lineages laying small fixed clutches are restricted to low latitudes. Main conclusions We suggest that the constraint imposed by a short activity season, coupled with abundant resources, is the main driver of large-clutch evolution at high latitudes and in highly seasonal regions. We hypothesize that such conditions - which are unsuitable for species constrained to laying multiple small clutches - may limit the distribution of fixed-clutch taxa.

AB The body size of an animal is probably its most important functional trait. For arthropods, environmental drivers of body size variation are still poorly documented and understood, especially in tropical regions. We use a unique dataset for two species-rich, phylogenetically independent moth taxa (Lepidoptera: Geometridae; Arctiinae), collected along an extensive tropical elevational gradient in Costa Rica, to investigate the correlates and possible causes of body-size variation. We studied 15 047 specimens (794 species) of Geometridae and 4167 specimens (308 species) of Arctiinae to test the following hypotheses: 1) body size increases with decreasing ambient temperature, as predicted by the temperature-size rule; 2) body size increases with increasing rainfall and primary productivity, as predicted from considerations of starvation resistance; and 3) body size scales allometrically with wing area, as elevation increases, such that wing loading (the ratio of body size to wing area) decreases with increasing elevation to compensate for lower air density. To test these hypotheses, we examined forewing length as a proxy for body size in relation to ambient temperature, rainfall, vegetation index and elevation as explanatory variables in linear and polynomial spatial regression models. We analysed our data separately for males and females using two principal approaches: mean forewing length of species at each site, and mean forewing length of complete local assemblages, weighted by abundance. Body size consistently increased with elevation in both taxa, both approaches, both sexes, and also within species. Temperature was the best predictor for this pattern (-0.98 < r < -0.74), whereas body size was uncorrelated or weakly correlated with rainfall and enhanced vegetation index. Wing loading increased with elevation. Our results support the temperature-size rule as an important mechanism for body size variation in arthropods along tropical elevational gradients, whereas starvation resistance and optimization of flight mechanics seem to be of minor importance.

AB Animal lifespan is determined by extrinsic and intrinsic factors causing mortality. According to the evolutionary theories of senescence, when mortality pressures are low, animals delay reproduction. This enables species to grow more slowly and, consequently, natural selection can act against harmful mutations in adulthood, thereby increasing lifespans. To test predictions of these theories we assembled a dataset on the maximum longevities and relevant ecological variables of 1320 reptilian species. Correcting for phylogeny, we modelled the link between reptile longevity and factors such as body size, microhabitat, activity period, insularity, annual temperature, temperature seasonality, elevation and clutch size that we hypothesized will affect extrinsic mortality rates and hence lifespan. Body mass explained a small proportion of the variance in reptile longevity. Species living on islands, and in colder and more seasonal environments, lived longer. Observed maximum longevity was positively associated with the number of individuals used to estimate it. Our results suggest that species exposed to reduced extrinsic and intrinsic mortality pressures (lower predation, lower metabolic rates and shorter activity periods) live longer. Sampling more individuals increases the chances of finding older specimens and should be corrected for when studying maximum longevity.

AB AimBergmann's rule remains unexplored in marine mammals. We first examine at a global extent whether these organisms show the same interspecific pattern reported for terrestrial mammals and then evaluate the influence of current environmental conditions and human impacts on the observed patterns.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe used range maps to document interspecific body size gradients and examined six environmental and human-based hypotheses. We analysed the data using a comparative cross-species method and a spatially explicit assemblage approach at three different grain sizes (200 km x 200 km, 400 km x 400 km and 800 km x 800 km). The associations between hypothesis-linked predictors and body size were analysed through simple and multiple regressions that controlled for both spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation.
   ResultsWe detected clear global latitudinal body size gradients, following a Bergmannian pattern (i.e. increasing size polewards). Consistently across methodological approaches (cross-species and assemblage analyses) and grain sizes, sea surface temperature is the best predictor. Spatially, the temperature-size relationship is stronger in the Southern than in the Northern Hemisphere. Pinniped body sizes are critically constrained by temperature world-wide whereas cetacean size clines show a weaker, albeit dominant, association with temperature.
   Main conclusionsAs in terrestrial mammals, our findings show that ambient temperature better explains interspecific body size patterns in cetaceans, and especially pinnipeds, world-wide. Large-bodied species are favoured in colder environments, in accordance with Bergmann's rule and the heat conservation hypothesis. However, our analyses also reveal a relevant role for salinity and primary productivity in migratory cetacean species. The large body sizes of baleen whales are essential for migration, for survival during fasting periods and minimizing the effects of temperature variation. This finding highlights the importance of spatially and phylogenetically explicit deconstructive approaches, considering alternative hypotheses to the traditional physiological mechanism, to gain a better understanding of Bergmann's rule.

AB Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) are obligate shallow-water dolphins that occur exclusively in the near-shore waters of the Indian Ocean, from South Africa to the Bay of Bengal. They have a narrow habitat preference, restricted distribution and do not appear very abundant across any part of their range. There is no estimate of total species abundance; all populations that have been quantitatively evaluated have been small in size, usually fewer than 200 individuals. Fishing, dredging, land reclamation, construction blasting, port and harbour construction, pollution, boat traffic and other coastal development activities all occur, or are concentrated within, humpback dolphin habitat and threaten their survival. Although data are far from sufficient to make a rigorous quantitative assessment of population trends for this species, the scale of threats is large enough over a significant enough portion of the range to suspect or infer a decline of at least 50% over three generations, which qualifies it for listing on the IUCN Red List as Endangered. The issue primarily responsible is incidental mortality in fisheries, but the loss and degradation of habitat is likely a contributing factor. None of the threats have been adequately addressed in any part of the species' range, even though threat levels are increasing virtually everywhere.

AB Many mathematical models have been proposed to explain the emergence of vegetation patterns in arid and semiarid environments, but only a few of them take into account the heterogeneity in the system properties. Here we present a rigorous study of the effects of heterogeneous soil-water diffusivity on vegetation patterns, using two mathematical models. The two models differ in the pattern-forming feedback that they capture; one model captures the infiltration contrast between vegetated and bare-soil domains, whereas the other model captures the increased growth rate of denser vegetation due to an enhanced ability to extract water from the soil. In both models, the most significant effect of the heterogeneity on the soil-water diffusivity is the increased durability of patterned vegetation to a reduced precipitation rate. An additional effect is that the heterogeneity makes the desertification process, namely, the transition from a spotted vegetation pattern to a bare-soil state, more gradual than in the homogeneous system. Our findings suggest that the heterogeneity cannot be neglected in the study of critical transitions in heterogeneous ecosystems and, particularly, in the study of the desertification process due to climate changes or anthropogenic disturbances.

AB There is considerable intraspecific variation in metabolic rates and locomotor performance in aquatic ectothermic vertebrates; however, the mechanistic basis remains poorly understood. Using pregnant Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata), a live-bearing teleost, we examined the effects of reproductive traits, pectoral fin use and burst-assisted swimming on swimming metabolic rate, standard metabolic rate ((M) over dot(O2std)) and prolonged swimming performance (U-crit). Reproductive traits included reproductive allocation and pregnancy stage, the former defined as the mass of the reproductive tissues divided by the total body mass. Results showed that the metabolic rate increased curvilinearly with swimming speed. The slope of the relationship was used as an index of swimming cost. There was no evidence that reproductive traits correlated with swimming cost, (M) over dot(O2std) or U-crit. In contrast, data revealed strong effects of pectoral fin use on swimming cost and U-crit. Poecilia reticulata employed body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming at all tested swimming speeds; however, fish with a high simultaneous use of the pectoral fins exhibited increased swimming cost and decreased U-crit. These data indicated that combining BCF swimming and pectoral fin movement over a wide speed range, presumably to support swimming stability and control, is an inefficient swimming behaviour. Finally, transition to burst-assisted swimming was associated with an increase in aerobic metabolic rate. Our study highlights factors other than swimming speed that affect swimming cost and suggests that intraspecific diversity in biomechanical performance, such as pectoral fin use, is an important source of variation in both locomotor cost and maximal performance.

AB The Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) is a small, abundant shorebird that breeds primarily in sub-Arctic to mid-Arctic habitats across the Nearctic and winters principally along the northern and central coasts of South America. No subspecies have been described and little is known concerning their genetics. However, birds show a cline in bill length across the Arctic, with longest bills in the east and shortest in the west. There appear to be several 'steps' in the cline, suggesting a division into eastern, central and western breeding populations. Since females average longer bills than males in a breeding population, there is considerable overlap of bill lengths at migration staging areas. Based on bill length patterns and sightings and recoveries of marked individuals, most western breeders migrate south through the prairies, along with some birds from central Arctic populations. The remaining central Arctic breeders, and all eastern Arctic birds, migrate south through the north Atlantic Coast of North America, particularly the Bay of Fundy. Western Arctic breeders appear to winter farther west in South America than eastern breeders, although there is considerable mixing among populations in French Guiana and Guyana. In spring, birds from the eastern Arctic migrate north through the U.S. Atlantic coast, including Delaware Bay. Central and western Arctic breeders primarily migrate north through the interior of North America. Therefore, central Arctic breeders in particular demonstrate an elliptical migration pattern.

AB Plant facilitation (positive plant-plant interactions) strongly influences biodiversity, structure, and dynamics in plant communities, and the topic has received considerable attention among ecologists. Most studies of facilitation processes by shrubs have been conducted at small spatial scales between shrubs and their neighboring species. Yet, we know little about whether facilitation processes by shrubs at a small scale (i.e., a patch scale) also work at a larger scale (i.e., a site scale) in terms of the maintenance of biodiversity. Here, we report that the facilitative effects of shrubs on plant diversity at a larger scale can be explained by changing ecological stoichiometry. The soil fertility showed unimodal shape along shrub cover gradient, suggesting that the facilitative effects of a shrub do not necessarily increase as the shrub develops. The unimodal shape of dependence of plant species richness on shrub cover probably was generated by the unimodal dependence of soil fertility on shrub cover. Soil nutrient enrichment by shrubs shifted low N:P ratios of plant communities with low levels of shrub cover to more balanced N:P ratios at intermediate levels of shrub cover. At the peak N:P ratio along the gradient in shrub cover, the maximum species richness and functional richness were observed, which was consistent with the unimodal relationship predicted by the resource balance hypothesis. Thus, our findings showed that facilitation processes by shrubs at a patch scale also work at a larger scale in terms of the maintenance of biodiversity. Because observed larger-scale facilitation processes are enhanced at some intermediate levels of shrub cover, this study offers practical insight into the need for management practices that allow some intermediate levels of grazing by livestock for optimizing the role of larger-scale facilitation processes in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in arid and semi-arid rangelands.

AB The current state of health of the coral reefs in the northern Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea), notably the Eilat reefs, is under debate regarding both their exact condition and the causes of degradation. A dearth of earlier data and unequivocal reliable indices are the major problems hinder a clear understanding of the reef state. Our research objective was to examine coral-algal dynamics as a potential cause and an indication of reef degradation. The community structure of stony corals and algae along the northern Gulf of Aqaba reveal non-seasonal turf algae dominancy in the shallow Eilat reefs (up to 72%), while the proximate Aqaba reefs present negligible turf cover (<6%). We believe that turf clominancy can indicate degradation in these reefs, based on the reduction in essential reef components followed by proliferation of perennial turf algae. Our findings provide further evidence for the severe state of the Eilat coral reefs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reproductive value hypothesis predicts that if residual reproductive value declines as a female ages, then young females should allocate less of available energy to current fecundity and more to future reproduction; whereas, older females should allocate more of available energy to current fecundity and less to future reproduction (i.e. survival). We test the prediction that older female Gambusia affinis exhibit higher levels of allocation to reproduction (i.e. fecundity) and consequently experience greater decline in escape performance (survival cost) during pregnancy compared to young females. Old females had relatively larger clutch wet masses and clutch wet mass increased more during pregnancy compared to young females. Correspondingly, old females exhibit a significant decline in escape velocity over the course of pregnancy; whereas young females show no change in escape velocity throughout pregnancy. Old females have higher escape velocities early in pregnancy and their performance only declines to about the level of performance of young females by the end of pregnancy. Thus, although old females exhibit a greater decline in performance they are better able to ameliorate the cost of decreased performance.

AB Models can be used to direct the management of population spread for the control of invasives or to encourage species of conservation value. Analytical models are attractive because of their theoretical basis and limited data requirements, but there is concern that their simplicity may limit their practical utility. We address the applied use of simple models in a study of a declining annual herb, Rhinanthus minor. We parameterized a population-spread model using field data on demography and dispersal for four management systems: grazed only (GR), hay-cut once (H1), hay-cut twice (H2), and hay-cut with autumn grazing (HG). Within a replicated experiment we measured spread rates of introduced R. minor populations over eight years. The modeled and measured spread rates were very similar in terms of both patterns of management effects and absolute values, so that in both cases HG > H2, H1 > GR. The treatments affected both dispersal and demography (establishment and survival) and so we used decomposition approaches to analyze the major causes of differences in population spread. Increased dispersal under hay-cutting was more important than demographic changes and accounted for similar to 70% of the differences in spread rate between the hay-cut and grazed-only treatments. Furthermore, management effects on the tail of the dispersal curve were by far the most critical in governing spread. This study suggests that simple models can be used to inform practical conservation management, and we demonstrate straightforward uses of our model to predict the impacts of different management strategies. While simple models can give accurate projections, we emphasize that they must be parameterized with high-quality data gathered at the appropriate spatial scale.

AB An excitable model of fast phytoplankton and slow zooplankton dynamics is considered for the case of lysogenic viral infection of the phytoplankton population. The phytoplankton population is split into a susceptible (S) and an infected (1) part. Both parts grow logistically, limited by a common carrying capacity. Zooplankton (Z) is grazing on susceptibles and infected, following a Holling-type III functional response. The local analysis of the S-I-Z differential equations yields a number of stationary and/or oscillatory regimes and their combinations. Correspondingly interesting is the behaviour under multiplicative noise, modelled by stochastic differential equations. The external noise can enhance the survival of susceptibles and infected, respectively, that would go extinct in a deterministic environment. In the parameter range of excitability, noise can induce prey-predator oscillations and coherence resonance (CR). In the spatially extended case, synchronized global oscillations can be observed for medium noise intensities. Higher values of noise give rise to the formation of stationary spatial patterns.

AB The body size of animals is affected by several factors, including ambient temperature and food availability. Ambient temperature is often negatively related to body size (Bergmann's rule) whereas an improved diet, especially during growth, has a positive effect. Animals commensal with man commonly exploit additional food sources (e.g. garbage dumps), thereby increasing their food supply. Using museum material, we studied morphological variation in skull size (and thus body size) among Spanish red foxes. Four measurements were taken of each skull and were related to the habitat from which the foxes were collected (agricultural and non-agricultural), and to latitude as a proxy for ambient temperature. The skull size of foxes collected in agricultural areas during the late 20th Century was significantly larger than that of those from non-agricultural areas, and was negatively related to latitude, thus contradicting Bergmann's rule. We suggest that increased food availability from animal husbandry is the cause for the observed increase in skull size (and thus body size). (c) 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

AB To quantitatively examine the diurnal, or tidal, effects on dugong behavior, we employed passive acoustic observation techniques to monitor the animals. Automatic underwater sound monitoring systems for dugongs (AUSOMS-D) were deployed on the sea floor at depths of about 5 in south of Talibong Island, Thailand. The AUSOMS-D recorded underwater sound in stereo at a sampling frequency of 44.1 kHz for more than 116 consecutive hours. Dugong calls were automatically detected by newly developed software with a detection rate of 36.1% and a false alarm rate of 2.9%. In total, 3453 calls were detected during the 164 h of recording. The autocorrelation of the call rate indicated an attendance cycle of about 24 or 25 h, and the most frequent vocalizations were observed from 0300 to 0500 h. The calculated bearings of the sound sources, i.e., dugongs, were used as an indicator to track the relative numbers of dugongs during the monitoring periods. (c) 2006 Acoustical Society of America.

AB In this study, we extend a model of daily dryland dynamics by parameterizing a modified version of a minimalistic annual model to examine how the statistical structure of annual rainfall and grazing intensity interact to influence dryland vegetation. With a Monte Carlo approach, an ensemble outcome provides a statistical description of likely dryland vegetation dynamics responding to variations in rainfall structure and grazing intensity. Results suggest that increased rainfall variability decreases the average and increases the variability of grass cover leading to more frequent degradation of the grass resource. Vegetation of drier regions is found to be more sensitive to interannual variability in rainfall. Concentrating this variability into an organized periodic mode further decreases the mean and increases the variability of grass cover. Hence, a shift toward lower, more variable, or more inter-annually correlated annual rainfall will likely lead to a general decrease in the grass resource and increased dryland vulnerability to degradation.
   Higher grazing intensity or lower annual rainfall both lead to more frequent and longer duration degradation of the grass condition. We note an interesting interaction in the response of grass biomass to grazing intensity and rainfall variability, where increased rainfall variability leads to longer duration degradation for low grazing, but shorter periods of degradation for high grazing. Once grass reaches a degraded condition, we find that woody vegetation strongly suppresses recovery even if successive rainfall is high. Overall, these findings suggest that the projected increase in interannual rainfall variability will likely decrease grass cover and potentially lead to more frequent, longer lasting degradation of dryland vegetation, particularly if enhanced rainfall variability is concentrated in long period (e.g. decadal) modes.

AB A large-scale experiment using 1-ha plots was done to control invasive Mediterranean annual grasses, primarily Bromus spp., in farmlands abandoned for 20 years in southern California. Treatments were a grass-specific herbicide, and herbicide plus dethatching. Dethatching was done to improve the contact of herbicide with newly growing grass seedlings, and to remove litter that may potentially affect germination of native annuals. Native annuals had increased richness in response to grass control, but had low cover in all but two of six years when precipitation was adequate. Dethatching did not improve forb response. Two exotic species of Erodium were the greatest beneficiaries of exotic grass control, but the positive response of native forbs in spite of Erodium dominance suggests a competitive hierarchy of less intense interaction between the native forbs and Erodium than between native forbs and exotic grasses. After five years, grasses began to recover from the herbicide treatments, indicating the need for periodic management of exotic grasses to maintain richness and cover of native forbs. Shrubs that occur on adjacent hills did not recolonize during these six years, suggesting that the valley bottoms may have always been forblands rather than shrublands. The study shows that restoration can be used to rediscover the former vegetation of long-disturbed landscapes.

AB Changes in the size-structure of populations of the mushroom coral Fungia fungites were quantified at two reefs during four annual surveys. Exposure to disturbance was predicted to affect the size and frequency of life history stages of polyps at each reef and their variability through time. The Mainland reef experienced frequent and intense disturbances, primarily as exposure to cyclones and substantial sedimentation, which were comparatively absent from the East Lewis reef. Disturbance to the Mainland reef was evident in the smaller size of polyps, and the many parent polyps, asexual buds, and polyp skeletons, which were all absent from the East Lewis reef. Over three years, the number and area cover of polyps at the Mainland reef decreased to 9% and 3% of their initial values respectively, compared with 73% and 36% at East Lewis. The size-structure of polyps at East Lewis remained comparatively stable; whereas, the abundance of all life history stages at the Mainland reef had high but variable rates of decline each year. Changes in the size-structure of polyps at the Mainland reef indicated it was exposed to levels of disturbance that it had not experienced, and would not recover from, for many years.

AB The broadcast spawning reproductive strategy relies on turbulent-stirring processes in the flow to bring together gametes previously released by adult males and females. The subsequent fertilization rate depends on the product of co-occurring concentrations of egg and sperm. Turbulent mixing produces a strong average dilution in these concentrations, suggesting that an increase in turbulence would reduce the average local fertilization rate. However, turbulent dilution occurs at time scales that may be long compared to those associated with fertilization. Therefore, the instantaneous structure of egg and sperm filaments at shorter time scales must be considered. In this paper, a mechanism is proposed whereby coherent turbulent structures in the velocity field cause coalescence between high-concentration filaments of egg and sperm, significantly enhancing the average fertilization rate. Simple analytical and numerical models are used to demonstrate how the mechanism works, and to make qualitative estimates of its effect on the resulting fertilization rate. The results suggest that the efficiency of broadcast spawning is a consequence of features in the instantaneous turbulent field, and that this efficiency is not captured by models that consider only time-averaged features of the flow.

AB We describe the spatial pattern of variation in body size, body shape, and adult population age structure of the Italian treefrog (Hyla intermedia). By means of a non-parametric test of matrix association (the Partial Mantel Test), we investigate the role of climate and geography in explaining the patterns of phenotypic variation. Body size is the most important source of morphometric variation, both at intra- and inter-populational levels. Body shape, despite its secondary role in explaining variation, still maintains high discriminative power among populations. Age structure differs significantly among populations, since body size correlates positively to age, these differences partly explain geographic variation of body size. The patterns of variation in both age and body size are congruent with climate variation, suggesting causal relationship. However, we find no evidence for adaptive explanations and suggest that climate-induced demographically differential survivorship might be the proximate cause responsible for the associations observed. Unlike body size, body shape varies congruently with the pattern of between-population geographic distances, which we show to be highly correlated with their genetic distances, thus suggesting isolation by distance as the proximate cause of the association.

AB Information on intra-specific variation in pollinator-attracting floral traits provides clues to selective pressures imposed by pollinators. However, these traits also reflect constraints related to floral phenology or morphology. The specific weevil pollinator Derelomus chamaeropsis of the dioecious Mediterranean dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis is attracted by volatile compounds that leaves, and not flowers, release during anthesis. Production of these olfactory cues is thus probably not constrained by any other floral function. This provides the opportunity to study variation of a "floral" trait that is not produced by a floral organ. We studied volatile compounds emitted by leaves of 12 individual C. humilis over the whole flowering season. The quantity of volatile compounds emitted by leaves reached a maximum when plants required pollinator visits. The relationship between odour emission and floral phenology was slightly different between male and female plants, probably reflecting differences in the exact time at which females and males benefit from pollinator visitation. Male plants produced higher quantities of volatile compounds than females. Odour composition was highly variable among individuals but did not differ between male and female plants. In this system, female C. humilis are pollinated by deceit and pollinators should be selected to avoid visiting them. The absence of sexual difference in blend composition may thus prevent pollinators from discriminating between male and female plants.

AB 1. Desert gerbilline rodents consume mainly plant material, in particular seeds. However, seeds are less available following winter rains than in summer and many rodents shift their diets from predominantly seeds to ones containing more vegetation. This shift results in a proportionately greater preformed water intake and, as these rodents do not drink, an increase in the water influx to field metabolic rate ratio (WI : FMR; mi kJ(-1)). Thus, this ratio is indicative of the food consumed, being low when gerbils are consuming seeds and high when consuming green vegetation.
   2. Smaller animals are more dependent on a highly digestible, high energy diet such as seeds and are more vulnerable to extreme air temperatures than are larger animals. It was predicted that: (1) gerbils consume less seeds in winter than in summer but the difference between seasons in seed intake is less pronounced in smaller than in larger rodents; and (2) smaller gerbils are more sensitive to extreme air temperatures than are larger gerbils. To examine these hypotheses, two coexisting desert gerbils, Gerbillus henleyi (8-12 g) and Meriones crassus (50-110 g), were studied. 3. It was predicted that: (1) the WI : FMR ratio would be greater in winter than in summer in both species, but the proportionate increase would be smaller in G. henleyi than in M. crassus; and (2) energy expenditure would be greater in winter than in summer in both species, but the proportionate increase would be greater in G. henleyi than in M. crassus. To test these predictions, winter and summer water influx and field metabolic rates in these species were measured under free-living conditions using doubly labelled water.
   4. The WI : FMR ratio in summer was 0.048 in G. henleyi and 0.069 in M. crassus, indicating that G. henleyi was consuming proportionately more seeds than M. crassus. In winter, the ratio was 0.052 in G. henleyi, indicating that there was little change in dietary composition and that this species was still consuming mainly seeds. In contrast, the ratio in M. crassus rose to 0.127, indicating a shift to a diet containing more green vegetation. The relatively higher seed intake by G. henleyi than M. crassus in both seasons and the small, if any, seasonal change in seed intake in G. henleyi agrees with the hypothesis of body size and seed intake in gerbils. Winter FMR increased over summer FMR in both species, as predicted; however, the expected greater increase in G. henleyi relative to M. crassus did not occur. The winter FMR was 1.52 times the summer FMR in G. henleyi and 1.53 times the summer FMR in M. crassuss.

AB This paper describes the development of a model for estimating herbage production from rainfall and evapotranspiration in rangelands and its calibration using a vegetation cover index derived from remotely-sensed data. The model operates on a time unit of 1 month and has a maximum of three calibration parameters: a water use efficiency term, a cover depletion rate and a term describing the percentage of tree and shrub cover present. The model can represent variability at the whole landscape level and is well-suited to calibration. Parameter values derived when the model is inverted show variations which can logically be associated with differences in land condition and grazing pressure. These parameter values make it possible to model differences in herbage production in a particular area under different rainfall conditions and in response to changes in land condition or the level of grazing.

AB The spatial pattern of recruitment and seedling survival was studied in an ant-dispersed sedge (Carex pilulifera L.) in a forest clearing in Denmark.  Seedlings were generally more aggregated than juvenile and adult plants.  Recruitment distances were skewed towards larger values.  While 72% plants of presumably ant-dispersed origin survived for 5 years, only 13% auto-dispersed plants were still alive, predominantly as persistent seedlings.  The survivorship showed a negative exponential decrease (Deevey type II) with an expected half-life of 17 months for auto-, and 10 years for ant-dispersed plants.  Growth-rate and fecundity were significantly larger for ant-dispersed plants than for auto-dispersed plants.  Computer simulation was used to test three different dispersal models and two mortality types on the recruitment pattern observed in the field.  The simulations confirmed the importance of ant dispersal for recruitment, but gave no conclusive evidence for evaluating recruitment from ant-nests.  High mortality levels, comparable to observed predation levels, were needed to simulate field conditions.  Density-dependent mortality proved more powerful than distance-dependent mortality in the simulations.  Results are discussed in the context of current hypotheses of seed dispersal.  While the directed dispersal hypothesis could not be rejected, results were generally more favourable to the escape hypothesis.

AB A rural landscape is the result of the interaction among natural elements and human activities which takes place in time and space. It represents a non-renewable resource that can provide incomparable information on the general state of the environment. The rapid transformations that are taking place in the last century push towards the implementation of monitoring actions able to take into account the various components of the land use, including their concurrent time evolution as well.
   We performed an analysis of temporal transformations of a rural landscape using an open-source GIS approach that allowed for mainstreaming of the main features of this rural landscape, i.e. land use patterns, naturalness dynamics, landscape diversity and visual quality. These four parameters have been selected since they represent those which most affect the processes at the base of the environmental planning and management of a rural landscape. The survey has been carried out over a period of 138?years, using historical maps, interpretation of aerial photos and implementing digital cartography, that have been retrieved with reference to a study area located in the Basilicata Region (southern Italy), which is considered a territory with an high rural - i.e., both natural and agricultural - landscape value.
   This methodology has allowed for the examination of the landscape from different points of view, experimenting the performance of a multi-temporal and inter-disciplinary analysis. The main results show - since the landscape has been completely transformed by man in terms of land use - that the areas covered in the past by forest have been transformed into agricultural areas, as opposed to some areas where re-naturalisation processes have taken place. Starting from this first analysis, the implemented methodology, based on a multidisciplinary approach, has enabled to identify the transformations which have greatly influenced the time evolution of the study area. The resulted assessment of land use patterns, landscape diversity, naturalness dynamics and visual quality of this study area, thus enables suitable strategies for the restoration of the local rural ecosystems.

AB Birds and mammals are the only vertebrates which receive comprehensive attention in studies of dispersal of fleshy-fruited plant species. However, recently the importance of fleshy fruit in the diet of lizards (order Squamata: suborder Sauria), and their role as seed dispersers have been recognized in a number of studies, especially in studies from arthropod-poor habitats, such as oceanic islands. Here, we revisit the evidence of fruit-eating lizards on a global scale in order to test if fruit consumption is more common on islands than expected by chance. We constructed a database of 470 lizard species (from a global count of 6,515 species), that have been reported to consume fleshy fruits. This set of lizards belong to 27 families with Scincidae (N = 78 species), Gekkonidae (69), and Dactyloidae (55) having more frugivorous species than other lizard families. We found that 62.4% of these lizards inhabit islands, whereas only one third (35.3%) of all lizard species inhabit islands. These values support the presence of an "insular phenomenon," however; we also tested if this biogeographical pattern might be driven by body size and evolutionary history of lizards. Thus, we looked for any phylogenetic signals in the distributions of lizard body size, island-presence, and frugivory and calculated phylogenetically corrected correlations among the three variables on a global subset of 2,417 lizard species for which we had detailed phylogenetic information. Both lizard body size and island-presence were weakly influenced by phylogeny; whereas, frugivory was not. In addition, we found that (1) body size and frugivory were weakly positively correlated; (2) body size and island-presence were uncorrelated; and (3) island-presence and frugivory were strongly positively correlated. Thus, we conclude that the main driver of frugivory on islands is the specific island environment and not lizard body size per se. Islands are said to be poor in arthropods and predators, and this may force/allow island lizards to forage for additional food sources, such as fleshy fruits. We also suggest that modern lizards as well as their ancestors may potentially play an important role to many plants as seed dispersers. However, we do not known how tight the correlation is between frugivory and seed dispersal. Thus, lizards repeatedly inspire us to ask new ecological and evolutionary questions.

AB Analysing the effect water temperature has on Daphnia magna is essential in anticipating the impact climate change will have on this freshwater zooplanktonic keystone species. While many authors have followed this line of research, few have covered an extensive temperature range or complex temperature change scenarios. Global warming is mostly associated with increased extreme temperature events, such as heat waves, as well as earlier and more intense thermal stratification. Both of these events may directly influence D. magna fitness, especially in those populations performing diel vertical migration (DVM). We analysed the effect water temperatures, ranging from 11 to 29 degrees C, have on the filtration capacity (FC) of D. magna, to anticipate the effects of acclimation, temperature change rate (TCR) and potential reversibility of responses to such conditions. Results show that sudden temperature changes have an immediate negative impact on the FC of D. magna and is more severe at higher temperatures and higher TCRs. However, D. magna individuals have shown themselves to be capable of quasi-acclimating to temperatures ranging from 11 to 25 degrees C in around a week and achieving much higher FCs; albeit never reaching the optimal FC achieved at 20 degrees C. That said, 29 degrees C is lethal for D. magna individuals within approximately five days. Finally, non-optimal temperature acclimated individuals can recover maximal FC within 2-4 days of the optimal long-term acclimation temperature (20 degrees C) being re-established, thus proving temperature responses to be reversible.

AB In many parts of the world, shorelines of estuaries are being modified because of increasing urban infrastructure. Consequently, habitats are being lost and replaced by other, artificial habitats, or are being severely modified in deleterious ways. Management of these changes requires recognition of the types of changes that are being made to estuarine shorelines, what sorts of impacts they cause and what sorts of managerial intervention are possible or desirable. Because experimentation in these managed habitats is in its early stages, it is important to provide sound ecological advice based on realistic hypotheses about consequent ecological changes. Wherever possible, management should be evaluated by well-planned experiments, involving analyses of changes in managed areas compared with changes in appropriate control areas. Where the goals of managerial action are the recovery of assemblages of species, what happens in managed areas should also be compared by equivalence tests with what happens in reference areas or relative to pre-defined ecological measures of what would constitute recovery. Here, different types of altered habitats, impacts, ecological changes and purposes of management are discussed. The needs for and nature of different types of hypotheses, experiments and analyses are reviewed with reference to relevant examples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB AimTo test whether intra- and interspecific patterns in body mass along elevational gradients follow Bergmann's rule for a subset of tropical montane passerines.
   LocationTropical elevational gradients in New Guinea, Borneo, Peru and Costa Rica.
   MethodsI used linear regressions to assess intraspecific patterns in body mass along elevational gradients in common New Guinean passerines (2697 mist-netted individuals of 21 species). I then evaluated interspecific patterns using two data sets. First, I investigated differences in body mass in species pairs of elevational replacements, closely related species with minimal overlap along elevational gradients (species pairs; New Guinea: n=45, Borneo: n=22, Peru: n=58 and Costa Rica: n=30). Second, I used a comparative phylogenetic approach to test whether species' mid-point elevations predicted their masses within entire passerine avifaunas found along single elevational gradients (species; New Guinea: n=184, Peru: n=529 and Costa Rica: n=220).
   ResultsNew Guinean passerines exhibited minimal intraspecific variation in mass along elevational gradients. In two species, lower elevation individuals had significantly larger masses than upper elevation conspecifics. In species pairs of elevational replacements, there was no trend for upper elevation species to have larger masses than lower elevation species. Overall, species pairs tended to have positive mass disparities (mass of upper elevation species/mass of lower elevation species). However, contrary to predictions of Bergmann's rule, mass disparity was unrelated to elevational overlap. When considering entire passerine avifaunas along single elevational gradients, species' masses were uncorrelated with their mid-point elevational distributions.
   Main conclusionsI found little evidence that tropical montane passerines have larger body masses at higher elevations where temperatures are colder. This lack of pattern was consistent across evolutionarily independent avifaunas of different biogeographical regions. These results suggest mean temperature is not a generally important driver of body size evolution in tropical montane passerines.

AB Aim Body size variation in animal assemblages is a widely addressed pattern in biogeographical studies, and is affected by both environmental gradients and phylogenetic constraints. However, no study has yet explored to what extent the association between body size variation and environmental gradients across broad spatial scales is influenced by the biogeographical distribution of different phylogenetic lineages. In this study, we discriminate the influences of environmental variables and phylogenetic community composition on body size variation in South American sigmodontine rodents.
   Location South America.
   Methods We computed the mean body mass of sigmodontine species cooccurring in 1 x 1 degrees cells across South America. For each cell we recorded mean values for three environmental variables. We characterized the phylogenetic composition of sigmodontine assemblages within each cell using phylogenetic fuzzy-weighting and principal coordinates of phylogenetic structure (PCPS). We then partitioned out the influence of environmental factors and the phylogenetic community composition on mean body size.
   Results Mean body size variation was mostly explained by shared influence of phylogenetic community composition (PCPS) and environmental factors (68%), while exclusive influence of PCPS was low (19%), and of environment was even lower (0.47%). Increases in body size were related to increases in annual mean temperature, and the influence of environment on body size was mediated by the distribution of sigmodontine lineages across South America.
   Main conclusions Environment alone was not sufficient to explain body size variation in sigmodontine assemblages. Rather, environmental gradients interacted with historical processes to determine body size variation in the Neotropical assemblages. These results have implications for the way we think of body size gradients across species assemblages, because any gradient in a trait may be a result of differences in the biogeographical distribution of lineages across space, which should be considered in an explicit context.

AB Six percent of the world's coral reefs occur around the Arabian Peninsula, providing a valuable ecological, economic and scientific resource for the nations bordering its shores. We provide the first region-wide assessment of the current status and historical trends in coral reef research, focusing on research in the Red Sea, Arabian Sea, and Arabian Gulf. In total, 633 regional reef publications have been produced since the 1930s, covering a wide variety of themes and taxa. Our results show a great deal of commonality in regional reef research, but also highlight important differences in research among the various seas as well as knowledge gaps that represent opportunities for future research. A regionally-integrated approach to future research is essential. There is a growing need for large-scale research to guide management of reefs and their stressors, as these operate at much larger scales than the national borders within which most research currently occurs.

AB The Mediterranean region is a climatic transitional zone between the subtropical/monsoon regime and the temperate westerlies and is subject to forces acting upon the global climate system. Much knowledge about its climate over the last millennium is derived from terrestrial records, whereas changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and in the dissolved inorganic carbon pool (DIC) are poorly known. We present continuous high-resolution reconstructions of SSTand delta C-13(DIC) in the eastern Mediterranean (EM) Sea, as inferred from oxygen and carbon isotope records from the skeletons of the reef builder gastropod Dendropoma sp. Spanning the past millennium, the SST reconstruction reveals a 250 year persistent warming trend during which the twentieth century was the warmest on record. Coupled with a distinct trend of C-13(DIC) depletion and superimposed upon decreased primary production, this climate reconstruction reflects a new state of the EM over the Anthropocene era that exceeds the natural variability of the last millennium.

AB Pinus pinea (L.) is one of the most valuable species used in the Tunisian reforestation programme, with about 21 000 ha of plantations. In the coming decades the oldest of these stands will begin their regeneration stage. However, little is known about the factors that control the natural regeneration of this species. It is reputed to be a strict shade-intolerant species and so needs light to regenerate satisfactorily. Regeneration can also be influenced by understorey vegetation and litter, both correlated with light availability. The aim of this study was to quantify the respective importance of these three factors in P. pinea regeneration. Live seedlings were counted in 90 plots (500 m(2) each) in three forests of P. pinea located in the coastal dunes in north Tunisia, and related to light availability, biomass of understorey vegetation and litter. In addition, the influence of litter was experimentally manipulated by creating 1 m(2) regenerating areas free of litter, with a light litter layer or the natural thickness. The density of 1-year-old pine seedlings was controlled mainly by litter biomass, whereas light availability increased the growth of older seedlings. Understorey vegetation did not appear to play a significant role in P. pinea regeneration in these Mediterranean climatic conditions. Management for natural regeneration of P. pinea should include scarification to reduce litter thickness and heavy thinning to significantly increase light availability.

AB This study aimed to determine the amount and composition of dust fall in semi-urban areas in Selangor, Malaysia from mid-July to mid-October 2010. The dust fall samples (a combination of dry and wet deposition) through rainwater were collected using polyethylene bottles on a monthly basis so as to determine the concentration of total solids, soluble and insoluble solids from eight monitoring stations. The concentration of cations (Ca2+, K+ and Mg2+) and heavy metals (Pb, Fe, Zn, Al, Cr and Cd) were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) while the concentration of anions (F-, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-) in the rainwater was determined through ion chromatography (IC). Results showed that the average concentration of total solids in the dust fall (131.50 +/- 71.95 mg/m(2)/day) below the value of 133 mg/m(2)/day as recommended by the Malaysian Department of the Environment. The dominant anion in rainwater was found to be SO42- followed by NO3-, Cl- and F-, and the dominant cation was Ca2+, followed by K+ and Mg2+. Zn was recorded as the dominant heavy metal in rainwater followed by Fe, Al, Pb, Cd and Cr. This study suggests that sea salts, earth crust and anthropogenic activities such as motor vehicles were the main sources of dust fall in the study areas.

AB Broadcast-spawning benthic invertebrates synchronously release sperm and eggs from separate locations into the surrounding flow, whereupon the process depends on structured stirring by the flow field (at large scales), and sperm motility and taxis (at small scales) to bring the gametes together. The details of the relevant physical and biological aspects of the problem that result in successful and efficient fertilization are not well understood. This review paper includes relevant work from both the physical and biological communities to synthesize a more complete understanding of the processes that govern fertilization success; the focus is on the role of structured stirring on the dispersal and aggregation of gametes. The review also includes a summary of current trends and approaches for numerical and experimental simulations of broadcast spawning.

AB Population manipulations such as translocation are becoming increasingly important tools in the management of rare and declining species. Evaluating the effectiveness of such manipulations requires comprehensive monitoring of population processes, including dispersal, survivorship, and reproduction. We investigated the mating system of a translocated population of gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) established through multiple releases, which occurred primarily during 1987-1994. During 2006-2007, we sampled and genotyped 27 candidate males (candidate sires), 34 candidate females (candidate dams), and 121 offspring from 19 clutches at five polymorphic microsatellite loci to determine the relative frequency of multiple paternity and to estimate individual reproductive success. Multiple paternity was detected in 57% of clutches genotyped, and females of single-sire clutches and females of multiple-sire clutches were of similar size. Reproductive success varied among male tortoises, and successful sires were significantly larger than males to which no offspring were attributed. Among successful sires, previously established males sired a disproportionate number of the offspring sampled, despite being significantly smaller than subsequently released males. The high variance in individual reproductive success and the apparent reproductive advantage associated with prior residence observed in this gopher tortoise population has important implications for the design of future translocation projects.

AB We studied morphological and allozymic variation in populations of Japanese salamanders, Hynobius boulengeri and H. steinegeri. Adult H. boulengeri showed sexual dimorphism, and juveniles differed greatly from adults in many morphological characters. From the results of multivariate analyses of morphological characters, the populations were divided into four groups: (1) H. boulenged from Honshu, (11) H. boulengeri from Shikoku, (111) H. boulengeri from the Sobo-Katamuki Mountains of Kyushu and H. steinegeri, and (IV) H. boulengeri from the Amakusa Islands and the Osumi Peninsula. Phenotypic relationships among the four groups were identical to relationships clarified by allozymic analyses, except for group IV, which was included in group III in the allozyme tree. Some morphometric characters were significantly correlated with environmental variables. We consider H. stejnegeri to be a valid species based on its unique color pattern, morphometric characters, and allelic composition, even though it was nested within group III of H. boulengeri by both morphological and allozymic analyses. We propose that group I from Honshu and group 11 from Shikoku should be treated as H. boulengeri sensu stricto and H. hirosei, respectively. Resolving the taxonomic status of the remaining populations of groups III and IV from Kyushu requires further study.

AB Laboratory experiments were undertaken to examine fertilization success in the intertidal prosobranch limpets Patella ulyssiponensis and Patella vulgata. Alkalization of eggs (10 min in pH 9.0 sea water) prior to fertilization trials improved fertilization rates greatly. Fertilization success was found to be a function of sperm concentration, gamete age and contact time. Sperm concentration needed for optimum fertilization success in vivo ranged between 10(5) and 10(7) sperm ml(-1) for both species although at higher concentrations the number of normally developing trochophore larvae decreased. For P. vulgata, sperm longevity (at a concentration of 10(6) sperm ml(-1)) did not exceed 6 h, whereas eggs of both species were fertilizable for up to 12 h. Maximum fertilization success occurred after 15-30 min gamete contact time. The Vogel et al. (Math Biosci 58:189-216, 1982) fertilization kinetics model is developed to allow for non-complete fertilizations under optimal sperm concentrations, and a new parameter fitting technique is developed to improve estimates of fertilization success for short gamete contact times.

AB Female flowers of some dioecious species are known to develop stamens with sterile pollen, a sexual system known as cryptic dioecy. A convincing hypothesis explaining this phenomenon is that stamens in female flowers attract pollinators and so ensure seed production. However, because this hypothesis has rarely been tested experimentally, we tested it in a cryptically dioecious species, Actinidia polygama (Sieb. et Zucc.) Planch. ex Maxim. Our findings show that pollinators do not show a consistent preference based on the sex of the flowers, and that the removal of stamens from female flowers results in a significant reduction in the frequency of insect visits and fruit production. These results strongly support the pollinator attraction hypothesis in A. polygama. Given the evident role of stamens in female flowers in A. polygama reproduction, we discuss why cryptic dioecy is a rare phenomenon.

AB Translocation of species for conservation purposes is a key element of many recovery programs. While the benefits of translocations seem obvious, potential negative effects have been described. For endangered beach mice (Peromyscus polionotus ssp.), repopulation of native, unoccupied habitat using translocated individuals has been extremely successful. Once populations are established, concerns over founder effects and isolation have led to proposals for continued secondary translocations. Unfortunately, little information is available to help formulate protocols for these actions. To test the effectiveness of translocation, the fates of 18 translocated Choctawhatchee beach mice (Peromyscus polionotus allophrys) were followed as they attempted to integrate into an established population. We found that translocated groups, repeated for two seasons, tended to use larger homeranges and significantly more burrows than did resident mice. The monthly (31 day) survival rate of resident mice was 3:4 times greater than for translocated individuals. We hypothesize that differential predation pressure was directly linked to the failure of mice to integrate successfully into the existing population. Given our results, we must advise caution and that additional knowledge be obtained before translocations are used to supplement existing populations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB The nature of the association between two species may vary depending on population abundances, age or size of individuals, or environmental conditions. Interactions may switch between beneficial and detrimental depending on the net balance of costs and benefits involved for each species. We study the repercussion of the ecological setting on the outcomes of conditional or variable interactions by means of a model that incorporates density-dependent interaction coefficients; that is, interaction alpha-functions. These characterize the responsiveness and sensitivity of the association to changes in partner's abundance, and can take positive and negative values. Variable outcomes - and transitions between them - are categorized as homeo- or allo-environmental, that is, occurring under the same ecological setting, or not, respectively. Bifurcation analyses show that these dynamics are moulded by ecological factors that are: intrinsic to the nature of the association ( concerning the sensitivity of the interaction), and extrinsic to the association itself ( the quality of the environment referred to each species alone). The influence of these factors may be conflicting; consequently, the dynamics involve catastrophic events. In a facultative variable association, stable coexistence is expected when environmental conditions are adverse; otherwise, the exclusion of one species is the likely outcome. Remarkable situations as the switching of victim-exploiter roles illustrate the theoretical perspective.

AB We developed an individual-based, spatially explicit population-dynamics model to explore the effects of temperature, fishing pressure, and reserve size on red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) populations at two of the northern Channel Islands off the coast of California. The model locations represent the "warm" Santa Cruz Island, which has a fishing history of declining abalone stocks, and the "cold" San Miguel Island, which has a history of stable catches. We investigated the effects of three temperature scenarios for 100-year periods on the behavior of each population. In the first scenario we used the real temperature environment (sea surface temperature, SST) from the last 100 years; results showed a decline in both model populations over the last 20 years, with and without fishing. In the second scenario model runs using an SST time series generated from current conditions at the islands showed that in the absence of larval connectivity the warm population would go extinct within 75 years regardless of fishing level. The final SST scenario involved a range of constant, potential SSTs that could occur in the future; abalone populations persisted when the SST was between 11degreesC and 16degreesC.
   The influence of temperature on the model populations and the latitudinal range of suitable SST suggest a northward migration of the real red abalone range as SST increases over the next 100 years. Efforts to rebuild or protect populations for the future should consider which West Coast regions would provide suitable red abalone habitat given rising ocean temperatures.

AB Despite numerous, generally unsuccessful attempts to reintroduce threatened Australian mammals, the factors leading to their failure have not been fully clarified, although predator control would appear to be of paramount importance. An experimental approach was taken in attempting to establish a population of bridled nailtail wallabies ih an area of apparently suitable habitat and low fox density, but on the edge of the species' former range. The 133 wallabies released since late 1996 comprised four groups captive-bred animals, wild caught from the single remaining wild population, animals that were captive bred and acclimatised at the translocation site in a 10 ha predator-proof enclosure, and animals which had been bred in the enclosure. Survival was highest in those bred in the enclosure and highly variable among captive-bred animals. Survival estimates for wild recruits suggested the population would maintain a positive rate of increase under prevailing environmental conditions. Spotlighting surveys suggested the population had increased to approximately 400 animals by late 1999. Above average rainfall during 1996-1999 and no apparent predation suggests caution in describing the translocation as a success. Ongoing monitoring is critical, because it A uncertain ho v the population will cope with drought and inevitable predation events, and whether the population will expand and persist outside of limited preferred habitat.

In this review, I show that clutch enlargement invariably leads to greater rates of nest predation, egg damage, and hatching failure, and that these three costs of incubation are sufficient to limit clutch size among most species of waders.

TI IS SATISFICING AN ALTERNATIVE TO OPTIMAL FORAGING THEORY
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID QUALITY TRADE-OFFS; MORTALITY RISK
AB Ward (1992; Oikos 63: 312-317) recently argued that optimal foraging theory suffers from a lack of alternative models and suggested that satisficing might serve as such an alternative. We disagree with both premises and argue that the optimal foraging approach generates multiple alternative and testable hypotheses within its own logical framework. Conversely, satisficing can only be defined in ways that are either trivial or a subset of optimal foraging. Satisficing fails as a coherent alternative (o optimality because its predictions are not testable and therefore cannot be refuted. Ward also cited one result from our earlier work with ants as evidence for satisficing in nature. We show, however, that when our work is examined in its entirety, ant colonies actually forage in a manner that appears to maximize colony growth rather than to satisfy a minimum requirement.

AB Understanding the processes that underpin adaptive evolutionary shifts within major taxonomic groups has long been a research directive among many evolutionary biologists. Such phenomena are best studied in large monophyletic groups that occupy a broad range of habitats where repeated exposure to novel ecological opportunities has happened independently over time in different lineages. The gekkonid genus Cyrtodactylus is just such a lineage with approximately 300 species that range from South Asia to Melanesia and occupy a vast array of habitats. Ancestral state reconstructions using a stochastic character mapping analysis of nine different habitat preferences were employed across a phylogeny composed of 76% of the known species of Cyrtodactylus. This was done in order to ascertain which habitat preference is the ancestral condition and from that condition, the transition frequency to more derived habitat preferences. The results indicate that a general habitat preference is the ancestral condition for Cyrtodactylus and the frequency of transitioning from a general habitat preference to anything more specialized occurs approximately four times more often than the reverse. Species showing extreme morphological and/or ecological specializations generally do not give rise to species bearing other habitat preferences. The evolution of different habitat preferences is generally restricted to clades that tend to occur in specific geographic regions. The largest radiations in the genus occur in rocky habitats (granite and karst), indicating that the transition from a general habitat preference to a granite or karst-dwelling life style may be ecologically uncomplicated. Two large, unrelated clades of karst-associated species are centered in northern Indochina and the largest clade of granite-associated species occurs on the Thai-Malay Peninsula. Smaller, independent radiations of clades bearing other habitat preferences occur throughout the tree and across the broad distribution of the genus. With the exception of a general habitat preference, the data show that karst-associated species far out-number all others (29.6% vs. 0.4%-10.2%, respectively) and the common reference to karstic regions as "imperiled arcs of biodiversity" is not only misleading but potentially dangerous. Karstic regions are not simply refugia harboring the remnants of local biodiversity but are foci of speciation that continue to generate the most speciose, independent, radiations across the genus. Unfortunately, karstic landscapes are some of the most imperiled and least protected habitats on the planet and these data continue to underscore the urgent need for their conservation.

AB Tropical high mountains are hosting important hot spots of biodiversity on small mostly remote areas. Recently, these precious ecosystems are under threat from land use change and climate change coupled with other local drivers of biodiversity loss. Along the East African Afroalpine ecosystems, area above the treeline have experienced long-term spatial isolation and extreme climatic conditions (climatic factors such as low mean temperature, diurnal freeze-thaw cycles and other energy-related factors) which lead to the formation of "Sky Island" like ecosystems that are rich in endemics and unique. The Bale Mountains of Ethiopia are home to the largest tropical alpine plateau in Africa, with no spacious high summits that provide space for upward shift of species. Here, we studied plant species diversity and distribution patterns and tested potential future impacts of climate change induced warming on those patterns. This study is based on distribution data acquired from nested circular plots along an elevational gradient ranging from 2000m asl to the highest elevation (4385 m asl). We find hump shaped species richness patterns on both aspects, i.e. the dry north-eastern and the wet monsoon exposed south-western escarpment. In addition, the proportion of endemic species increases monotonically towards the summit on all slopes. Based on our data and literature, we project future climate impact for three regional warming scenarios (+2 degrees C, + 3 degrees C and + 4 degrees C). We quantify the future range of 114 endemic plant species based on their current occurrence records applying a lapse rate of 0.6 degrees C per 100 m of elevation. We find that future climate change would significantly alter species distribution patterns with pronounced impact on the unique ecosystems and endemic species restricted to the afroalpine plateau. Very likely this will be leading to the extinction of many endemic species. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Around the world, climate change has impacted many species. In this study, we used bioclimatic variables and biophysical layers of Central Asia and the Asian Highlands combined with presence data of brown bear (Ursus arctos) to understand their current distribution and predict their future distribution under the current rate of climate change. Our bioclimatic model showed that the current suitable habitat of brown bear encompasses 3,430,493 km(2) in the study area, the majority of which (>65%) located in China. Our analyses demonstrated that suitable habitat will be reduced by 11% (378,861.30 km(2)) across Central Asia and the Asian Highlands by 2,050 due to climate change, predominantly (>90%) due to the changes in temperature and precipitation. The spatially averaged mean annual temperature of brown bear habitat is currently -1.2 degrees C and predicted to increase to 1.6 degrees C by 2,050. Mean annual precipitation in brown bear habitats is predicted to increase by 13% (from 406 to 459 mm) by 2,050. Such changes in two critical climatic variables may significantly affect the brown bear distribution, ethological repertoires, and physiological processes, which may increase their risk of extirpation in some areas. Approximately 32% (1,124,330 km(2)) of the total suitable habitat falls within protected areas, which was predicted to reduce to 1,103,912 km(2) (1.8% loss) by 2,050. Future loss of suitable habitats inside the protected areas may force brown bears to move outside the protected areas thereby increasing their risk of mortality. Therefore, more protected areas should be established in the suitable brown bear habitats in future to sustain populations in this region. Furthermore, development of corridors is needed to connect habitats between protected areas of different countries in Central Asia. Such practices will facilitate climate migration and connectivity among populations and movement between and within countries.

AB Movement of organisms is an important activity that has ecological and evolutionary implications, including individual reproductive success and survival, population growth and persistence, local adaptation, and gene flow. Expression of movement behavior has traditionally been termed dispersal and measured relative to home ranges. This simplistic approach belies the complexity of the process. Movement of freshwater stream fish has been at times viewed as predominantly restricted in nature, but recent research challenges this paradigm since some distribution of movement exists in every population. A better research approach is to understand the drivers that promote or limit movement. Drivers of movement can be categorized as extrinsic ecological factors (context dependent), e.g., habitat quality, habitat variability, and the presence of predators, and intrinsic traits of the fish (condition dependent), such as body size and condition. One intrinsic trait that has received relatively little attention is the inherent personality to be sedentary or mobile, and how this interacts with the suite of traits and behaviors to drive movement. Future movement behavior research should focus on the interaction of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers to better understand the evolutionary and ecological implications of movement.

AB This study evaluated the relationship between the indices known as the Reef Health Index (RHI) and two-dimensional Coral Health Index (2D-CHI) and different representative metrics of biological, ecological and functional diversity of fish and corals in 101 reef sites located across seven zones in the western Caribbean Sea. Species richness and average taxonomic distinctness were used to asses biological estimation; while ecological diversity was evaluated with the indices of Shannon diversity and Pielou's evenness, as well as by taxonomic diversity and distinctness. Functional diversity considered the number of functional groups, the Shannon diversity and the functional Pielou's evenness. According to the RHI, 57.15% of the zones were classified as presenting a "poor" health grade, while 42.85% were in "critical" grade. Based on the 2D-CHI, 28.5% of the zones were in "degraded" condition and 71.5% were "very degraded". Differences in fish and coral diversity among sites and zones were demonstrated using permutational ANOVAs. Differences between the two health indices (RHI and 2D-CHI) and some indices of biological, ecological and functional diversity of fish and corals were observed; however, only the RHI showed a correlation between the health grades and the species and functional group richness of fish at the scale of sites, and with the species and functional group richness and Shannon diversity of the fish assemblages at the scale of zones. None of the health indices were related to the metrics analyzed for the coral diversity. In general, our study suggests that the estimation of health indices should be complemented with classic community indices, or should at least include diversity indices of fish and corals, in order to improve the accuracy of the estimated health status of coral reefs in the western Caribbean Sea.

AB The Abrolhos reefs are the largest and the richest coral reefs of Brazil, where corals, crustose coralline algae (CCA), and vermetids are the main reef-building organisms. In the Abrolhos Archipelago, the vermetid Dendropoma irregulare (d'Orbigny, 1842) associated with the CCA Porolithon pachydermum (Foslie) Foslie, represents a significant portion of the reef edges. This study aimed to analyze the seasonal influence of the substrate and hydrodynamic exposure to vermetid D. irregulare settlement, and to verify if the biological cues might be acting in the vermetid settlement. Seasonal in situ settlement experiments were performed, testing different substrata (live coralline algae, dead coralline algae, and artificial substrate) in three study sites (Mato Verde, Caldeiros, and Siriba) and a seasonal exposure index was calculated. We found that P. pachydermum enhance settlement of D. irregulare in the Abrolhos reefs. The vermetid settlements were significantly higher on (1) substrates with live CCA, and (2) in the presence of substrates with live CCA cues. The highest vermetid settlements, which best reveal the positive effect of substrate cues (live coralline algae), were observed at Siriba during summer and autumn-winter, being more than twice that recorded in Mato Verde. It is suggested that features associated with live coralline surfaces may attract the settlement of the juvenile vermetid. This study revealed a significant positive correlation between settlements of the vermetid on live CCA and the degree of exposure to hydrodynamics, where the highest densities were observed in a moderate condition of exposure. Responses to the preferential settlement on live coralline algae surfaces in the present study are probably due to a complex of cues acting simultaneously, which includes the physical (hydrodynamics) and biological cues (biofilms). This study provides the first attempt to examination of the settlement factors of the vermetids, contributing to the role that live coralline may play as "nursery habitats" in the Abrolhos Archipelago. Because of its ability to induce settlement of the crawling juvenile vermetid, CCA play a fundamental role in the life cycle of many marine invertebrates, including D. irregulare.

AB The objective of the present study was to analyze the distribution of manatees, dolphins and sea turtles off northeastern Brazil through aerial surveys, relating them to specific habitats and human activities, with emphasis on marine protected areas (MPAs). Surveys were conducted between January and April 2010 at 150 m altitude and 140 km h(-1), using two independent observers. Strip transects were flown in a zigzag pattern. Transects covered 4026 km in more than 27 flight hours. A total of 36 sightings of manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus, 41 individuals), 28 of dolphins (Delphinidae, 78 individuals, including 10 Sotalia guianensis) and 256 of sea turtles (Cheloniidae, 286 individuals) were recorded. Manatees and sea turtles displayed solitary habits, while dolphins were commonly seen in groups. Manatees were positively correlated with sea turtles, probably due to their preference for sheltered shallow habitats with favorable conditions for foraging and resting. Furthermore, manatees showed a positive relationship with mangrove estuaries, and medium-sized coastal cities probably due to the intense urban development in many estuarine areas. Manatees and sea turtles were also positively correlated with boats, showing a severe threat for these species. Density of manatees was significantly higher within MPAs with preserved mangrove estuaries than in non-protected areas, while dolphins and sea turtles were observed in high densities MPAs with coral reefs. The elevated density of these organisms shows the vital importance of protecting and adequately managing unique ecosystems to ensure a sustainable future for the populations of severely threatened species.

AB A long-term record dating back to the 1960s indicates that Peridinium gatunense, an armored dinoflagellate, dominated the phytoplankton of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel) until the mid-1990s, with a relatively stable spring bloom. However, since 1996, these blooms became irregular, failing to develop in 10 out of the past 16 years. During the later period, a significant correlation (R (2) = 0.605, P = 0.013) was found between annual peak P. gatunense biomass and riverine inflow volume. In-lake surveys showed that patches of high P. gatunense densities were associated with water enriched with fresher inflowing Jordan River water. Supplementing laboratory cultures of P. gatunense with Hula Valley water stimulated its growth relative to un-enriched controls. A likely explanation to the recent irregular blooms of this dinoflagellate is a hydrological modification that was made in the catchment in the mid-1990s, preventing Hula Valley water from reaching Lake Kinneret in most years-except for exceptionally wet years. We propose that until the mid-1990s, the Jordan River water enriched Lake Kinneret with a growth factor (a microelement and/or organic compound) originating in the Hula Valley, which in recent years has arrived in sufficient quantities to support a bloom only in high-rainfall years.

AB In 2009 and 2010 16 Norwegian Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) were reintroduced to Knapdale, Scotland as part of a 5-yr reintroduction trial (Scottish Beaver Trial). Despite numerous reintroduction programs throughout Europe there is no published information concerning recommended health surveillance during beaver reintroduction and only one publication describing causes of mortality. We describe the establishment of a health surveillance program based on International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and governmental guidelines, and report preliminary results based on the fecal and blood samples following the completion of the first stage of reintroduction. Animals underwent at least one general anesthetic to allow collection of fecal and blood samples and a thorough clinical examination. No bacterial enteric pathogens such as Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis were isolated, nor were Giardia spp. or Cryptosporidium spp. However, numerous helminths including Travassosius rufus and Stichorchis subtriquetrus were detected. Five animals were positive for Leptospira antibodies. This included Leptospira saxkoebing, Leptospira canicola, Leptospira copenhageni, Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae, Leptospira autumnalis, and Leptospira javanica. The highest loss of animals (20%) was during the statutory 6-mo rabies quarantine period. No common cause of death was determined. The rabies quarantine conditions were waived for four remaining animals, three of which were introduced to the wild successfully. The authors recommend the shortest possible quarantine period when introducing beavers, but allowing for the minimum recommended IUCN 35 days to allow for implementation of the initial stage of the health surveillance program, examination of animals, sample collection, and processing.

AB Weed seed predation has the potential to limit weed population growth within agricultural fields. Its success depends in part on the ability of predators to detect weed patches and respond in a direct density-dependent way to increasing weed seed densities. To test for density-dependent responses, an experiment was conducted in north-eastern Germany in four winter wheat fields during October 2008 and 2009. Zero, 1000, 2500 and 5000 seeds m(-2) of Lolium multiflorum were applied to four adjacent 15 m x 15 m plots in each field. Seed predation was measured in 20 randomly located trays per plot that were accessible to all predators (eight per plot) or excluded vertebrates (12 per plot). Seeds were exposed in the field for 18 days. Remaining seeds were recovered from the soil and counted. In addition, 20 seed cards were randomly placed in each plot, half of them with vertebrate exclosure cages. Seeds on cards were counted every other day. Seed predators were identified. Predation rates measured by trays were low (32.7% per 18 days) and may have been caused by low densities of predators. Vertebrates responded in a direct density-dependent way to increasing seed densities, whereas the response of invertebrates was density independent. Seed predation from seed cards confirmed the density-dependent responses obtained using trays. Seed predators only needed a few days to detect and preferably exploit the high density plots. Weed seed patches are likely to persist in fields where invertebrates are the main predators, while they could be better controlled where granivorous rodents predominate.

AB Long-distance dispersal (LDD) may contribute disproportionately to range expansions, the creation of new evolutionary lineages, and species persistence in human-dominated landscapes. However, because data on the individual consequences of dispersal distance are extremely limited, we have little insight on how LDD is maintained in natural populations. I used six years of spatially explicit capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data to test the prediction that individual performance increases with dispersal distance in the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus. Dispersal distance was total distance moved along the 1-km study stream, ranging from 0 to 565 m. To quantify individual performance, I used CMR estimates of survival and individual growth rates based on change in body length. Survival and growth rates increased significantly with dispersal distance. These relationships were not confounded by pre-dispersal body condition or by ecological gradients along the stream. Individual benefits of LDD were likely caused by an increase in the upper limit of settlement site quality with dispersal distance. My results do not support the view that the fitness consequences of LDD are unpredictable and instead suggest that consistent evolutionary mechanisms may explain the prevalence of LDD in nature. They also highlight the value of direct CMR data for understanding the individual consequences of variation in dispersal distance and how that variation is maintained in natural populations.

AB Sustainability of agricultural landscapes depends largely on land-use practices. As one of the most productive and widespread agricultural soils, loess is often deep and easily eroded, posing grand challenges for environmental sustainability around the world. One prime example is the Loess Plateau of China, which has been cultivated for more than 7500 years. Based on long-term data sets, this study demonstrates that the dominant agricultural practice, winter wheat cropping, continues to be the primary driver for the massive soil erosion and landscape modifications on the Loess Plateau. This traditional farming system is asynchronous with the dynamic rhythm between natural vegetation and climate in the region. In particular, the long summer fallow period for winter wheat fields is concurrent with the heavy-rainstorm season, which greatly accelerates soil erosion. Our finding indicates that common land-use practices that have lasted for thousands of years in China are not environmentally sustainable. Agriculture in this region has relied primarily on the continuous "mining'' of the soil for the past several thousand years but does not have a one-thousand-year future because of myriad environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with soil erosion. To contain soil erosion and promote sustainability on the Loess Plateau, therefore, a change in the agricultural regime is needed to make sure that current and future agricultural practices follow the vegetation-climate rhythm. In addition, to achieve environmental, economic, and social sustainability in this region, multifunctional land-use planning is required to increase landscape diversity and functions (e.g., proper arrangement of crop fields, orchards, and protected areas).

AB Between 1999 and 2007, more than 2,600 adult Pacific lampreys Entosphenus tridentatus (formerly Lampetra tridentata) were reintroduced to the Umatilla River, where they had been extirpated by poisoning, from nearby locations in the Columbia River consistent with the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources guidelines. Reintroduced adult Pacific lampreys were able to find suitable spawning habitat, construct nests, and deposit viable eggs (81-93% mean egg viability per nest). Their larvae were able to feed and grow. Median lengths for age 0+, 1+, and 2+ larvae were 19, 63, and 109 mm, respectively. Mean density of larvae in survey plots increased over time from 0.08 to 6.56 larvae/m(2). Geographical distribution of larvae in the river increased downstream, but larvae failed to become established in the lower Umatilla River where water flows were regulated for irrigation. Annual abundances of trapped, recently metamorphosed, out-migrating larvae increased during the study from nearly zero to 180,000, but not in all years, which suggests that many might not be surviving migration to the Columbia River, possibly because of irrigation withdrawals. Abundances of trapped, returning adult lamprey also increased from 2003 to 2006, which corresponded with the period when adult lampreys that were the progeny of reintroduced lampreys were expected to return, but long-term monitoring is necessary to confirm that increases were the result of the reintroduction. Our results also demonstrated that even if presumptive causes of extirpation were known and removed before reintroduction, success is not guaranteed. Reintroduction not only assists in redistributing animals to parts of their historical range, but in conjunction with monitoring, it may be essential to identify additional limiting factors that were unknown at reintroduction.

AB Vermetids area poorly known family of reef-building gastropods characterized by an extremely irregular growth of the shell. Vermetid reefs are known from the Badenian (Middle Miocene) to present-day and their main importance is related to their use as sea-level indicators, strictly associated to the intertidal or immediate subtidal zone. During their evolution, two different vermetid genera have been recognized as reef-builders: Petaloconchus was the major component of vermetid reefs until the Holocene when, for still unknown reasons, it was almost completely replaced by Dendropoma. In the Mediterranean Basin. Petaloconchus reefs have been frequently found in close association to Late Miocene coral bioconstructions. New finding of Petaloconchus reefs within the slope facies of the Salento Messinian reef complex (southern Italy), together with new data from late Tortonian-early Messinian reefs of Crete (Greece) provide further information on the palaeoecology of these peculiar bioconstructions. Stratigraphical and sedimentological contexts of Salento and Crete vermetid reefs have been described. together with an account of their size, shape and inner structure. Biotic (vermetids, serpulids, bryozoans and coralline algae) and abiotic components (early marine cements and intra-reef sediment) have been identified by microfacies analysis, and their percentage-abundance has been reported. These data allow the description of vermetid reefs from two different depositional settings: along the shelf edge and, for the first time, within the coral reef slope. Shelf-edge and slope Petaloconchus reefs show the same inner structure and composition, but they differ by their shape, by the density of the framework, and by the relative proportion of the associated reef-building organisms (serpulids, bryozoans and coralline algae). Additional information on their palaeobathymetric setting have been acquired from the presence of other reef-building biota (Porites corals and Halimeda green algae) which occur in close proximity to slope vermetid reefs, together with observations on some anatomical feature of Petaloconchus shells. Results clearly indicate for Petaloconchus reefs a palaeobathymetric range spanning from the upper subtidal zone down to 30-50 m of depth. The present study confirms vermetid reefs as important tools for the reconstructions of ancient sea-level, but great attention has to be paid to the identification of the main reef-building vermetid. Actually, while a great number of present-day Dendropoma reefs can be associated to the mean sea-level, Late Miocene vermetid reefs from Salento and Crete indicate for Petaloconchus bioconstructions a wider palaeobathymetric range.

AB In this study we examine the relevance and dynamics of views on nature in nature and landscape planning.
   In our conceptual framework we distinguish between three views on nature: a wilderness, an arcadian and a functional valuation approach to nature, each related to specific ecological, aesthetic and ethical perspectives. In our empirical studies we consider the role of the three views in a number of Dutch nature and landscape projects and in nature and landscape policy. We study the importance of different styles and levels of governmental decision-making using various methods, including computer-assisted text analyses, interviews, questionnaires and gaming experiments.
   Our results show that all three valuation approaches can be found. Although the wilderness approach and the functional approach are becoming more popular, the arcadian approach is most influential in the Netherlands, especially on the regional level. All stakeholders agree to a certain extent with all approaches but most with the arcadian valuation. It can be questioned whether this implies a sharing of values or a practical compromise. We found that, although a consensual style of decision-making does not lead to a common valuation, it has an important impact by creating better conditions for understanding and negotiations, and eventually for agreement.

AB 1. Most life-history models assume a trade-off between reproductive investment and parental survival. Several studies have documented reproductive costs in terms of reduced locomotor performance in terrestrial habitats. However, few studies have determined the reproductive costs of pregnancy in aquatic environments, or compared pregnancy-induced locomotor costs among habitats. This knowledge gap is important because many organisms rely on multiple habitat types during pregnancy.
   2. We compared sexual differences in maximum locomotor velocity and the relative impacts of pregnancy on locomotor performance in aquatic and terrestrial environments for a semi-aquatic snake (Seminatrix pygaea). In addition, because most life-history models predict a direct trade-off between reproductive investment and reproductive costs, we quantified the relationship between reproductive investment and postpartum increase in velocity for both habitat types.
   3. Both males and non-pregnant females always swam faster than they crawled, but males were significantly faster for their size than were non-pregnant females. These results mirror sexual differences known to exist in other snakes, but differ in that the degree of sexual divergence in velocity does not vary with habitat for S. pygaea.
   4. Pregnancy significantly reduced both crawling and swimming velocity. Moreover, pregnancy impaired crawling velocity significantly more than swimming velocity. The mean (+/- 1 SE) percentage increases in crawling and swimming velocity after parturition were 72.8 +/- 21.6 and 59.4 +/- 12.8%, respectively. There was a direct trade-off between reproductive investment and aquatic locomotor impairment: snakes that invested more in offspring experienced larger decreases in swimming velocity. However, evidence for such a trade-off in the terrestrial habitat was weaker.
   5. Our results demonstrate that the cost of reproduction for semi-aquatic organisms may differ between aquatic and terrestrial habitats in complex ways. Swimming may be more effective than crawling for escaping predators during pregnancy, because swimming results in faster velocities and is less impaired by pregnancy However, the assumption of a direct trade-off between reproductive investment and locomotor impairment may be stronger for swimming performance compared with crawling performance.

AB A dynamical ecosystem model with three variables, living biomass, wilted biomass and available soil wetness, is developed to examine the vegetation-soil water interaction in semi-arid areas. The governing equations are based on the mass conservation law. The physical and biophysical processes are formulated with the parameters estimated from observational data. Both numerical results and qualitative analysis of the model as well as observational data indicate that the maintenance of a grassland requires a minimum precipitation (or equivalently, a minimum moisture index), and the grassland and desert ecosystem can coexist when precipitation is within a range above this threshold. Sensitivity studies show that these numerical results are robust with respect to model parameters and the transformation functions. It is also found that the wilted vegetation plays a very important role in shaping the transition between grassland and desert. By using the theories of an attractor basin and multiple equilibrium states, the conditions for grassland maintenance and the strategy of grazing are also analysed.

AB The study reported here is part of an ongoing effort to establish sensitive and reliable biomonitoring markers for probing the coastal marine environment. Here, we report comparative measurements of a range of histological, cellular and sub-cellular parameters in molluscs sampled in polluted and reference sites along the Mediterranean coast of Israel and in the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea. Available species enabled an examination of conditions in two environmental 'compartments': benthic (Donax trunculus) and intertidal (Brachidontes pharaonis, Patella caerulea) in the Mediterranean; pelagic (Pteria aegyptia) and intertidal (Cellana rota) in the Red Sea. The methodology used provides rapid results by combining specialized fluorescent probes and contact microscopy, by which all parameters are measured in unprocessed animal tissue. The research focused on three interconnected levels. First, antixenobiotic defence mechanisms aimed at keeping hazardous agents outside the cell. Paracellular permeability was 70-100% higher in polluted sites, and membrane pumps (MXRtr and SATOA) activity was up to 65% higher in polluted compared to reference sites. Second, intracellular defence mechanisms that act to minimize potential damage by agents having penetrated the first line of defence. Metallothionein expression and EROD activity were 160-520% higher in polluted sites, and lysosomal functional activity (as measured by neutral red accumulation) was 25-50% lower. Third, damage caused by agents not sufficiently eliminated by the above mechanisms (e.g. single-stranded DNA breaks, chromosome damage and other pathological alterations). At this level, the most striking differences were observed in the rate of micronuclei formation and DNA breaks (up to 150% and 400% higher in polluted sites, respectively). The different mollusc species used feature very similar trends between polluted and reference sites in all measured parameters. Concentrating on relatively basic levels of biological organization-the molecular and cellular level-the parameters measured may have the capacity not only for biomonitoring environmental quality, but also for early warning.

AB The metaphysiological modelling approach relates aggregated population dynamics to biomass gained from resources consumed, relative to physiological attrition and mortality losses. A GMM (Growth, Metabolism and Mortality) formulation was applied to the interactive dynamics of herbivore-vegetation systems. taking into account seasonality in resource production. heterogeneity in resource quality, adaptive responses by consumers to this variability, and nutritional influences on mortality losses. In transforming the intake or functional response to changing resource availability to a biomass gain response, allowance was made for constraints on daily digestive capacity, and for changing diet quality as resources became depleted over the seasonal cycle. Because of the steeply saturating form of the intake response, the output dynamics was inherently unstable in a constant environment with a single, uniform resource, for realistic parameter values. Stabilization resulted when resources were heterogeneous and herbivores adjusted their resource selection abaptively over the course of the year. This mechanism caused the gain response to diverge from the intake response, due to changing diet quality over the annual cycle. In seasonally varying environments, no equilibrium between resource production and consumption persists. Nevertheless, dynamic stability can emerge from the adaptive responses of consumers to spatial and temporal variability in resource availability and quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB In the present paper we compare, on the basis of morphometrical characters and acoustical properties of the advertisement calls, a sample of 158 male green toads (Bufo viridis complex) collected in 12 breeding populations of south Kazakstan and north Kyrgyzstan. The samples of three populations resulted in only diploid loads (2n=22), those of eight populations in only tetraploid toads (2n=44) whereas in one locality diploid, tetraploid and many triploid toads were collected. Diploid toads show significantly larger body size and proportionally larger head and shorter limbs than both tetraploids and triploids, whereas no evident morphometrical differences were observed between triploids and tetraploids. Diploid advertisement calls have spectral and temporal properties that significantly differ From those of both triploid and tetraploid advertisement calls. In particular, diploids produce significantly longer calls with higher pulse-rates and lower Frequencies than those of tetraploids. We address the question of the factors that could be responsible for these differences and we discuss four hypotheses: (1) the direct effect of polyploid mutation, (2) genetic drift, (3) reproductive character displacement and (4) environmental selection.

The results of experiments to determine the effect of exposure to air on the metabolism of Stylophora pistillata (Esper, 1797) revealed that: (1) maximum gross photosynthesis (p(gmax)) is 3.6 times higher in water than in air; (2) an indicator of photoadaptation (I-k) does not reveal ally difference between water and air; (3) the difference between submerged and aerial respiration is not statistically significant; (4) aerial photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves display lower initial slopes (alpha) than aquatic P-I curves; (5) there is no calcification in air.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID STOCKS; SYSTEMS; FLUCTUATIONS
AB A common surplus production model incorporating a nonlinear rate of predation yields multiple, stable equilibria and, when forced with autocorrelated variability, has been invoked to qualitatively describe rapid ''flips'' in marine fish abundances. In this paper, I used optimal control theory and stochastic dynamic programming to obtain optimal harvesting policies for populations described by this model. Multiple, locally optimal stock sizes may exist with a management goal of sum of discounted yield, whereas a single optimum occurred with the goal of sum of discounted economic rent. The optimal policy for a population forced with autocorrelated variability and fluctuating between high and low equilibria required conservative (exploitative) behavior during poor (good) environmental conditions with high stocks and rebuilding of low stocks. Simulation of various harvest strategies applied to such a population revealed that, with a management goal of sum of discounted yield and a discount rate of 2.5%, the optimal policy provided more than twice the mean annual benefits as a constant fishing rate policy. The large differences in optimal policies for the management goals of sum of discounted yield and sum of discounted economic rent provide motivation to consider carefully what objectives should be sought from highly fluctuating fish stocks.

AB Comparative studies of granivory intensity across different arid and semi-arid regions of the world have assumed homogeneity of conditions over large geographical areas, despite the existence of evident heterogeneities at local and regional scales. For South America, previous evidence from the Monte desert, Argentina, showed that granivory intensity is low compared with other continents and that seed removal rates by taxon (granivore ranking) are in decreasing order: ants > birds = small mammals. In this work, we examined the assumed generality of this pattern for another South American region, the Chilean matorral. We studied the differences between sparse and dense habitats of the matorral in granivory intensity throughout the year. Although total seed removal did not differ between habitats, differences among granivores did occur. Ants were the most important seed removers in both habitats, although they did not differ from birds in the sparse habitat. Further, ants were the most important seed consumers during summer, but their seed removal rare is almost negligible the rest of the year. Birds maintained an intermediate rate of seed consumption through the year. Granivory intensity by small mammals was very low in both habitats during the whole year. The granivore ranking obtained for the Chilean matorral was: ants > birds > mammals, in dense habitat; and ants = birds > mammals, in sparse matorral. Ant abundance is correlated with seed removal throughout the year. This relationship was not found in the other taxa. We discuss possible causes for the differences among habitats, taxa, and seasons, as well as distinct granivore rankings from different continents.

SO CORAL REEFS
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE; FLORIDA
AB Aerial exposure of patch reef corals occurred in Tarut Bay, western Arabian Gulf, (Saudi Arabia) between December 1991 and May 1992, and coincided with extreme low spring tides (below the predicted lowest astronomical tide-LAT). Colonies of Acropora and Stylophora occurring at the highest levels on the tops of patch reef platforms were most affected by the low tides. Corals fully exposed to air suffered total mortality, whereas those not fully exposed suffered tissue damage to their upper parts. Exposure occurred during winter months when air and water temperatures are at their lowest in the gulf. Coupling of extremely low spring tides with wind-induced negative surges (below LAT) are not regular events but are not infrequent. Cold temperatures and exposure may act in concert to produce disproportionate mortalities of reef flat corals in the shallow coastal areas of eastern Saudi Arabia. It is highly unlikely that the Gulf War oil spill played any role in the observed damage to reef corals in the Gulf in 1992.

AB We investigated the relationship between brood size and social dominance during the brood-rearing period in Lesser Snow Geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) by experimentally manipulating food availability to create high-biomass food patches. A total of 128 social interactions were subsequently observed in experimental areas; the rate of interactions was significantly higher in experimental high-biomass plots (9.6 hr(-1)) than in control, low-biomass, areas (0.4 hr(-1)).
   During social interactions families (pairs with one or more goslings) were always dominant over pairs without goslings. However, there was no clear dominance hierarchy among families in relation to brood size. Neither aggressiveness (the number of interactions initiated) nor the proportion of successful interactions varied consistently with brood size. We conclude that, during brood rearing, dominance ranking is determined more by individual variation in aggressiveness of adult (parent) birds, rather than by any ''motivational'' effect of offspring or by brood size per se.
   Geese fed longer in the high biomass plots (mean 19.2 min per visit) than in control plots (2.9 min), and birds ''defended'' high biomass areas: 32% of all interactions involved a social unit inside the experimental plot driving off a social unit which was trying to enter the plot from outside. This suggests that geese derived benefits from monopolization of good quality food patches. The behavior of foraging geese varied in relation to food availability: birds took fewer steps per minute during both feeding and non-feeding bouts in the experimental plots and females, but not males, had shorter feeding bouts in experimental plots, i.e., they adopted the vigilant head-up posture more frequently. We suggest that the benefits of utilizing high biomass food patches during brood-rearing include higher intake rates, decreased energetic costs of foraging and reduced predation risk through increased vigilance behavior by parents and greater cohesion of the family unit.

AB Because common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., henceforth Ambrosia) has negative effects on human health, it is a common focus for management, which would benefit from a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which the species spreads. Road systems are known to be invasion corridors, but the conduit function of vehicles for the rapid spread of Ambrosia along roads and for population extension along roadside verges has not yet been demonstrated convincingly. To quantify the effect of different traffic volumes on the dispersal and population extension of Ambrosia, we used two approaches: First, by combining field experiments along roads with records of the seed rain around single plants, we simulated a combined dispersal kernel that revealed the interactions between primary dispersal and traffic-mediated secondary dispersal. Second, we recorded the seedling recruitment around isolated roadside populations over 2 years to determine how traffic-related parameters affect population extension. The longest traffic-mediated dispersal distances exceeded those of primary dispersal by about one order of magnitude. Traffic volume had a significant positive effect on dispersal distances and on the lateral deposition of seeds on the road verge. Seedling recruitment around isolated roadside populations was significantly higher in the driving direction than against, but only at the distance where the major seed rain of traffic-mediated dispersal is to be expected according to the combined dispersal kernel (3-15 m). Synthesis and applications. This study isolates the effects of road traffic from confounding mechanisms (e.g. mowing machinery, propagule pressure from infested fields) on common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) invasions. Results demonstrate the traffic-mediated dispersal in Ambrosia invasions as a routine and predictable process that facilitates population extension in the direction of traffic along roadsides, depending on traffic volume. This highlights the importance of prioritizing mowing along high use roads and mowing of isolated populations to prevent seed abscission and further spread of common ragweed.

AB Coral reefs worldwide face an uncertain future with many reefs reported to transition from being dominated by corals to macroalgae. However, given the complexity and diversity of the ecosystem, research on how regimes vary spatially and temporally is needed. Reef regimes are most often characterised by their benthic components; however, complex dynamics are associated with losses and gains in both fish and benthic assemblages. To capture this complexity, we synthesised 3,345 surveys from Hawai'i to define reef regimes in terms of both fish and benthic assemblages. Model-based clustering revealed five distinct regimes that varied ecologically, and were spatially heterogeneous by island, depth and exposure. We identified a regime characteristic of a degraded state with low coral cover and fish biomass, one that had low coral but high fish biomass, as well as three other regimes that varied significantly in their ecology but were previously considered a single coral dominated regime. Analyses of time series data reflected complex system dynamics, with multiple transitions among regimes that were a function of both local and global stressors. Coupling fish and benthic communities into reef regimes to capture complex dynamics holds promise for monitoring reef change and guiding ecosystem-based management of coral reefs.

AB Sustainability remains an undeniable, yet obscure, destination for humanity to reach. Although progress has been made, there remains no agreed upon method for spatial scientists, nor landscape and regional planners to use during sustainable development assessments. Furthermore, limited examples exist that investigate relationships between-landscape form (e.g. urban configuration) and population dynamics (e.g. number of settlements)- and a local measure of sustainable development. Using a recently published local sustainable development index (LSDI) for Moldova, a regional spatial analysis was created to further elucidate strengths and weaknesses of index-based assessments of sustainable landscape function. Using a one-to-many relationship, sixty-six landscapes were joined to 399 mean LSDI sample locations for the quantitative spatial assessment (n = 399). A rarity of this study was that it employed the Eastern School of Geography's "landscape units" for Moldova during geospatial data aggregation and spatially enabled regression. Moran's I scatterplot and spatial correlogram were used to visualize spatial autocorrelation dynamics of LSDI. Three local conditional autoregressive (CAR) models were made, with all explaining over 70% of LSDI variation. The two strongest positive predictors of LSD] were city population density and road intersection density, while the two most consistent negative were settlement density and distance between urban land cover patches (ENN_AM). Findings suggest index-based landscape valuations could suffer from spurious inferential correlations when landscape-calculated sub-metrics (i.e., proportion agricultural land) are included within evaluation indices. This phenomenon complicates the interpretation of results during regional analyses, thus potentially hindering sustainable development planning and policy responses across spatial scales.

AB We conducted a panel study to investigate seasonal variations in concentrations of airborne PM2.5 and PM10 and the effects on respiratory health in a community near a cement factory; in Chilanga; Zambia. A panel of 63 and 55 participants aged 21 to 59 years from a community located at the edge of the factory within 1 km and a control community located 18 km from the factory respectively; were followed up for three climatic seasons July 2015 to February 2016. Symptom diary questionnaires were completed and lung function measurements taken daily for 14 days in each of the three climatic seasons. Simultaneously, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in ambient air were monitored at a fixed site for each community. Mean seasonal concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 ranged from 2.39-24.93 g/m(3) and 7.03-68.28 g/m(3) respectively in the exposed compared to the control community 1.69-6.03 g/m(3) and 2.26-8.86 g/m(3). The incident rates of reported respiratory symptoms were higher in the exposed compared to the control community: 46.3 vs. 13.8 for cough; 41.2 vs. 9.6 for phlegm; 49.0 vs.12.5 for nose; and 13.9 vs. 3.9 for wheeze per 100 person-days. There was a lower performance on all lung indices in the exposed community compared to the control; overall the mean FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) and FVC (forced vital capacity) predicted percentage for the exposed was six and four percentage points lower than the control. Restriction of industrial emissions coupled with on-going monitoring and regulatory enforcement are needed to ensure that PM (airborne particulate matter) levels in the ambient air are kept within recommended levels to safeguard the respiratory health of nearby community residents.

AB We investigated how density and aggregation influence crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci reproductive success, using an empirically-tuned, individual-based simulation model that incorporates spatial and temporal biological stochasticity associated with spawning, and a kinetics model of fertilisation that explicitly incorporates the probability of polyspermy. Greater aggregation of individuals relieved Allee fertilisation dynamics, particularly at low densities, leading to higher rates of successful monospermic fertilisation and allowing populations to produce many more zygotes. This is likely more important to smaller, rather than larger, populations, due to limited and more variable reproductive success. In higher density populations a fertilisation optimum was observed at moderate levels of aggregation, above which monospermic fertilisation plateaued or even declined. This was likely due to 2 factors: the spatial dynamics of gamete plume dispersal and polyspermic fertilisation. Comparison of in situ natural spawning aggregation with model results indicates a cost-benefit equilibrium may exist between aggregation and reproductive success, and that relief from mechanisms limiting aggregation (for example, decreased relative predator abundance) may permit increased aggregation resulting in greater fertilisation and zygote production. We propose an Allee threshold of 3 starfish ha(-1) (for starfish of a mean diameter 345 mm), below which reproductive capacity is greatly reduced regardless of aggregation level. These preliminary findings posit aggregation as a key factor in outbreak formation that may feasibly be incorporated into preventative management strategies to detect and define incipient outbreak conditions and to mitigate subsequent risk.

AB AimHuman activities have led to hundreds of species extinctions and have narrowed the distribution of many of the remaining species. These changes influence our understanding of global macroecological patterns, but their effects have been rarely explored. One of these patterns, the Bergmann's rule, has been largely investigated in macroecology, but often under the assumption that observed patterns reflect natural processes. We assessed the extent to which humans have re-shaped the observable patterns of body mass distribution in terrestrial mammals, and how this has altered the macroecological baseline.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsUsing a comprehensive set of ecological, climatic and anthropogenic variables, we tested several alternative hypotheses to explain the body mass pattern observed in terrestrial mammals' assemblages at a one-degree resolution. We then explored how model predictions and the Bergmann's latitudinal pattern are affected by the inclusion of human impact variables and identified areas where predicted body mass differs from the expected due to human impact.
   ResultsOur model suggests that median and maximum body mass predicted in grid cells would be higher, and skewness in local mass distributions reduced, if human impacts were minimal, especially in areas that are highly accessible to humans and where natural land cover has been converted for human activities.
   Main conclusionsOur study provides evidence of the pervasive effects of anthropogenic impact on nature and shows human-induced distortion of global macroecological patterns. This extends the notion of shifting baseline, suggesting that when the first macroecological investigations started, our understanding of global geographic patterns was based on a situation which was already compromised. While in the short term human impact is causing species decline and extinction, in the long term, it is causing a broad re-shaping of animal communities with yet unpredicted ecological implications.

AB Shifts in habitat use and distribution patterns in dolphins are often concerns that can result from habitat degradation. We investigated how potential changes to a habitat from human activity may alter dolphin distributions within Lingding Bay in the Pearl River Estuary, China, by studying the relationship between fish choruses, vessel presence and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) detection rates. Analyses revealed temporal and spatial variation within fish choruses, vessel presence and dolphin detection rates. After accounting for any temporal autocorrelation, correlations between fish choruses and dolphin detection rates were also found; however, no relationship between fish choruses and vessel presence or dolphin detection rates and vessel presence were observed. Furthermore, fewer dolphins were detected at sites where fish activity was less intense. Thus fish activity, rather than vessels, may be a key factor influencing the distribution of the dolphins within the estuary. These findings emphasize the risk of potential shifts in habitat use for Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins due to detrimental changes to prey availability and dolphin feeding grounds from human activity, such as overfishing and coastal developments, within the estuary. This is a critical conservation issue for this dolphin population that is facing intense anthropogenic pressure.

AB Functional diversity (FD) has become a principal concept for revealing mechanisms driving community assembly and ecosystem function. Multiple assembly processes, including abiotic filtering, competition and multi-trophic relationships, operate simultaneously to structure FD. In water-limited plant communities, FD is likely to reflect trade-offs between drought resistance vs. disturbance resistance and competitive ability. We propose a mathematical mechanistic model for understanding the organization and function of water-limited plant communities. The approach captures the interplay between abiotic filtering, below- and above-ground competition and disturbance. We exploit this powerful model to uncover mechanisms underlying changes in functional diversity along stress gradients. Our approach links biomass production and FD to environmental conditions through plant resource capture ability. Functional groups are defined along a single trade-off axis according to investment in capturing light (shoot) vs. water (root). Species growth rate is determined dynamically by the species traits, water availability and grazing stress. We derive biomass production, functional diversity and composition along precipitation and grazing gradients. Model's results revealed several regimes structuring FD along the precipitation gradient: Struggle for water' at low precipitation, competition for water' at intermediate precipitation and competition for light' at high precipitation. We observed a shift in grazing effect on FD from negative at very low precipitation, to positive at higher precipitation. Unimodal FD-grazing intensity relationship was observed under high precipitation, while under low precipitation, FD decreased moderately with increasing grazing intensity.Synthesis. Our model showcases how fundamental tradeoffs in plant traits may drive functional diversity and ecosystem function along environmental gradients. It offers a mechanism through which novel understandings can be obtained regarding the interplay between water stress, below- and above-ground competition and disturbance intensity and history. We discuss further model testing possibilities as well as required empirical work.

AB In this study, we determined the driving key factor determining variability in bacterial community structures in soils at two unvegetated alpine glacier forefields with different bedrock geology (calcareous and siliceous). We further assessed the resistance and resilience capacities of the bacterial communities through reciprocal soil transplantations. Sterilized and unsterilized soils were incubated locally (home') or transplanted (away') for 15 months (July 2011-October 2012) and sampled regularly during the snow-free seasons. Changes in bacterial community structures were determined through fingerprinting of the 16S rRNA gene and correlated with several environmental factors. This study demonstrates that bacterial community structures at our field sites were shaped by distinct mineralogical soil properties. Soil moisture and pH appeared to not be the major driving key factors. Calcareous soil was more selective to bacteria, thus diversity was higher in siliceous soils as a positive effect of its more diverse mineralogical composition. Bacterial community in the calcareous soil exhibited stronger resistance to transplantation than the community in the siliceous soil. In fact, siliceous soil was more easily invaded by extrinsic taxa. Bacterial communities of both soil types were equally resilient at home, although different resilience patterns were observed between calcareous and siliceous soils incubated away.

AB We used skeletochronology to determine the ages of 249 (93 females, 108 males and 48 juveniles) odorous frogs (Odorrana grahami) from four locations covering an altitudinal span of 1030-1860 m in Sichuan Province, western China. We found distinct lines of arrested growth (LAGs) from excised toe bone for 242 individuals, and each LAG was assumed to represent one year of age. In disagreement with Bergmann's rule, body size of four O. grahami populations did not change clinally along the 830 m altitudinal gradient. Average adult SVL and age differed significantly among populations in females, but not in males. For both sexes, age did not predict body size. When removing the effects of age, we found significant inter-population differences in body size only for males. Post-metamorphic growth rates in males were highest from the lowest altitude, whereas growth rates of females were highest at high altitudes. Our findings suggest that, apart from age, ecological factors such as trophic resources or predation further shape body size differences between populations and sexes.

AB Harmful cyanobacterial blooms are of increasing global concern and their prediction and management requires an improved understanding of the controlling factors for cyanobacterial growth and dominance. In Lake St Charles, the drinking water supply for Quebec City, Canada, harmful cyanobacterial blooms were first recorded in autumn 2006. Our aims were to define the temporal and spatial variations in the cyanobacterial community structure of this reservoir and to address the hypothesis that interannual variability in cyanobacterial biomass and species composition is mainly controlled by nutrients, temperature and water column stratification. Over five consecutive summers (20072011), the north basin had consistently higher concentrations of bloom-forming cyanobacteria than the south basin, and there were striking variations within and among years in total biomass and species composition. Correlation analysis underscored the contrasting environmental controls on different taxa of colonial cyanobacteria. Anabaena flos-aquae biovolume was correlated with surface temperature, water column stability (Schmidt index) and water residence time whereas Microcystis aeruginosa was highly correlated with total phosphorus and to a lesser extent with total nitrogen (TN), heat accumulation (degree-days above 20C) and precipitation. Aphanocapsa/Aphanothece correlated significantly only with TN. These results also imply the sensitivity of high through-flow reservoir ecosystems to interannual variations in environmental forcing.

AB The N:P stoichiometry of a water body is one of the most commonly used indicators of its nutrient status and algal growth. However, in a dynamic aquatic ecosystem the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton is highly variable and depends on environmental conditions and key microbial interactions that influence their growth, such as grazing pressures and the microbial loop. Here we determine the influence of the nutrient-dependent microbial interactions between zooplankton, phytoplankton and bacteria on the ecological stoichiometry at different trophic levels and how they relate to water column properties. A 1D hydrodynamic-ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) was applied to Lake Kinneret (Israel) for examining how the internal nutrient ratios of several phytoplankton functional groups correlate with nutrient ratios within the water column, and further explore how the microbial loop shapes the patterns of stoichiometry within the food web by testing two microbial loop configurations. The results showed that the average internal N:P ratios of the phytoplankton community followed their total carbon biomass patterns, and that seasonal patterns of simulated dissolved inorganic N to total P (DIN:TP) ratios in the water column were a useful indicator for reflecting the bulk phytoplankton N:P stoichiometry as compared with total N to total P (TN:TP) ratios and dissolved inorganic N to dissolved inorganic P (DIN:DIP) ratios. However, the internal N:P ratio patterns of individual phytoplankton groups did not necessarily correlate with DIN:TP ratio patterns in the water column. This was because different microbial processes regulate nutrient flows to individual phytoplankton groups. Our simulations with the microbial loop highlight the ability of bacteria to regulate phytoplankton stoichiometry. These results provide an improved mechanistic understanding of the food web in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Desert seed-harvester ants, genus Pogonomyrmex, are central place foragers that search for resources collectively. We quantify how seed harvesters exploit the spatial distribution of seeds to improve their rate of seed collection. We find that foraging rates are significantly influenced by the clumpiness of experimental seed baits. Colonies collected seeds from larger piles faster than randomly distributed seeds. We developed a method to compare foraging rates on clumped versus random seeds across three Pogonomyrmex species that differ substantially in forager population size. The increase in foraging rate when food was clumped in larger piles was indistinguishable across the three species, suggesting that species with larger colonies are no better than species with smaller colonies at collecting clumped seeds. These findings contradict the theoretical expectation that larger groups are more efficient at exploiting clumped resources, thus contributing to our understanding of the importance of the spatial distribution of food sources and colony size for communication and organization in social insects.

AB P>1. Competition is thought to be a major influence on community assembly, ecology and evolution; presence of competitors may cause divergence in traits related to resource use (character displacement).
   2. Such traits, however, often vary clinally, and this phenomenon may be independent of the presence or absence of competing species.
   3. The presence of such clines can either obscure the effects of competition, or create an impression that competition is operating when, in fact, it is not.
   4. We corrected for clinal variation while testing for character displacement in two well-studied weasel (Mustela) guilds, in the Nearctic and the west Palaearctic.
   5. Without accounting for clines, our results agreed with previous studies suggesting character displacement in these guilds.
   6. However, when we corrected for clines, predictions of competition theory were not met - and often we obtained evidence for character convergence in sympatry.
   7. This may suggest that the nature of the resource base may be more important than interspecific competition in shaping morphology and size in these carnivores.
   8. Our results highlight the need to account for geographic variation when studying character displacement and cast some doubt on prevailing ideas regarding the effect of competition on morphological evolution.

AB Patterns of intraspecific geographic variation in morphology and behaviour, when examined in a phylogenetic context, can provide insight into the microevolutionary processes driving population divergence and ultimately speciation. In the present study, we quantified behavioural and phenotypic variation among populations from genetically divergent regions in the Central American treefrog, Dendropsophus ebraccatus. Our fine-scale population comparisons demonstrated regional divergence in body size, colour pattern frequencies, and male advertisement call. None of the characters covaried with phylogenetic history or geographic proximity among sampled populations, indicating the importance of highly localized selection pressures and genetic drift in shaping character divergence among isolated regions. The study underscores how multiple phenotypic characters can evolve independently across relatively small spatial scales.

AB 1. We used first-order kinetic parameters of biological oxygen demand (BOD), the constant of aerobic decomposition (k) and the asymptotic value of BOD (BODult), to characterise the lability of organic carbon pools in six lakes of different trophic state: L. Naroch, L. Miastro and L. Batorino (Belarus), L. Kinneret (Israel), L. Ladoga (Russia) and L. Mendota (U.S.A.). The relative contributions of labile and refractory organic carbon fractions to the pool of total organic carbon (TOC) in these lakes were quantified. We also determined the amounts of labile organic carbon within the dissolved and particulate TOC pools in the three Belarus lakes.
   2. Mean annual chlorophyll concentrations (used as a proxy for lake trophic state) ranged from 2.3 to 50.6 mu g L-1, labile organic carbon (OCL = 0.3BOD(ult)) from 0.75 to 2.95 mg C L-1 and k from 0.044 to 0.14 day(-1).
   3. Our data showed that there were greater concentrations of OCL but lower k values in more productive lakes.
   4. In all cases, the DOC fraction dominated the TOC pool. OCL was a minor component of the TOC pool averaging about 20%, irrespective of lake trophic state.
   5. In all the lakes, most (c. 85%) of the DOC pool was refractory, corresponding with published data based on measurements of bacterial production and DOC depletion. In contrast, a larger fraction (27-55%) of the particulate organic carbon (POC) pool was labile. The relative amount of POC in the TOC pool tended to increase with increasing lake productivity.
   6. Long-term BOD incubations can be valuable in quantifying the rates of breakdown of the combined particulate and dissolved organic carbon pools and in characterising the relative proportions of the labile and recalcitrant fractions of these pools. If verified from a larger number of lakes our results could have important general implications.

AB The functional gene amoA was used to compare the diversity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the water column and sediment-water interface of the two freshwater lakes Plusssee and Schohsee and the Baltic Sea. Nested amplifications were used to increase the sensitivity of amoA detection, and to amplify a 789-bp fragment from which clone libraries were prepared. The larger part of the sequences was only distantly related to any of the cultured AOB and is considered to represent new clusters of AOB within the Nitrosomonas/Nitrosospira group. Almost all sequences from the water column of the Baltic Sea and from 1-m depth of Schohsee were related to different Nitrosospira clusters 0 and 2, respectively. The majority of sequences from Plusssee and Schohsee were associated with sequences from Chesapeake Bay, from a previous study of Plusssee and from rice roots in Nitrosospira-like cluster A, which lacks sequences from Baltic Sea. Two groups of sequences from Baltic Sea sediment were related to clonal sequences from other brackish/marine habitats in the purely environmental Nitrosospira-like cluster B and the Nitrosomonas-like cluster. This confirms previous results from 16S rRNA gene libraries that indicated the existence of hitherto uncultivated AOB in lake and Baltic Sea samples, and showed a differential distribution of AOB along the water column and sediment of these environments.

AB Epidemic chytrid fungal infection of Peridinium gatunense, the major bloom-forming dinoflagellate in Lake Kinneret, Israel, is reported for the first time. The fungus, identified as Phlyctochytrium sp. based on morphological and life cycle characteristics, was first observed in December 2000. It rapidly developed into an epidemic, coinciding with a 1000-fold decline in Peridinium density within 9 days of the initial observation of the chytrid. In August 2001 a second fungal epidemic occurred, which was again associated with a Peridinium population crash. In 2002-2003 less dramatic fungal epidemics were recorded, infection prevalence was low and the Peridinium population did not crash. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that healthy Peridinium cells are not prone to fungal infection, mostly stressed or dead cells were infected. In other words, Phlyctochytrium is a saprophyte, possibly a facultative parasite of Peridinium. Probably another pathogen was responsible for the observed bloom crashes and the saprophytic Phlyctochytrium was a secondary parasite, infecting the already moribund cells. The emergence of fungal epidemics in Lake Kinneret could be interpreted as an early signal of ecosystem response to increasing anthropogenic stress.

AB Honeybee workers (foragers) are risk averse to variability in volume of reward when measured by conditioning of the proboscis extension response, and the level of risk aversion depends on the coefficient of variation of the variable distribution. Since drones do not forage on flowers, they may not have been under selection for risk-sensitive choice behaviour. We compared risk sensitivity of workers and drones and their ability to discriminate between the reward volumes used in the risk sensitivity experiments. Both castes discriminated better between 0 and 0.4 mu l than between 0.4 and 1.2 mu l, consistent with Weber's law of relative discrimination. Workers discriminated between both volume pairs better than drones, and workers showed greater risk aversion than drones. This is the first demonstration of caste-specific differences in risk sensitivity. These differences do not appear to be the result of differences in energy budgets, since both castes were on positive energy budgets. Levels of risk aversion were consistent with the coefficient of variation model. We calculated the relative associative strengths of subjects to the reward volumes from their choice proportions in the discrimination tests. The relative associative strengths of workers were greater than those of drones, and in both castes the relative associative strength of 0.4 mu l relative to 0 mu l was greater than that of 1.2 mu l relative to 0.4 mu l. Owing to Jensen's inequality, the decreasing functions of differences in relative associative strengths could explain differences in degree of risk aversion between the castes. Our findings are consistent with both mechanistic and functional explanations. (c) 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Dead Sea is a severely disturbed ecosystem. Its water level has been decreasing at a rate of nearly I m per year during the last decade due to anthropogenic intervention in its water balance. Since the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan was established in 1994, a proposal for the construction of a water carrier, the "Peace Conduit," between the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) and the Dead Sea is being investigated. This water carrier is intended to mitigate damaging processes that currently occur in the Dead Sea and its surrounding area. The difference in elevation of about 416 m could be exploited. for seawater desalination by reverse osmosis. To examine the possible effects of the mixing of Dead Sea brines with seawater and seawater concentrates an the Dead Sea as an ecosystem, we have set up simulation experiments under field conditions in experimental ponds at Sedom, in which Dead Sea water was diluted with Red Sea water. The main components of the Dead Sea biota are the unicellular green alga Dunaliella and several types of red halophilic Archaea. Phosphate is the limiting inorganic nutrient. Massive Dunaliella blooms developed, accompanied by dense communities of red halophilic Archaea, in some of the experimental ponds, imparting a brown-red coloration to the brines. The extent of biological development depended on the extent of dilution and on phosphate availability. The results of the simulation experiments show that biological phenomena and their impact on the Dead Sea ecosystem should be taken into consideration during the planning of the "Peace Conduit."

AB In this study, the rates of tissue regeneration and recovery from injuries that emulated the bites of either butterfly or parrotfish on colonies of Montastraea annularis exposed to different sedimentation regimesp were determined. Two small reef patches were chosen close to key Dos Mosquises, north of the Venezuelan mainland. Sixteen colonies (8 treatments + a single replicate) were artificially damaged at each patch and their recovery was monitored for three months by photographic means. The lesions were inflicted using two different techniques: scratching the polyps with a hard-nylon brush to resemble parrotfish (Scaridae) damages (Lesions Type 1) or jetting out the tissue with a syringe to simulate butterflyfish (Chaetondontidae) bites (Lesions Type 2). The diameter of the wounds ranged from 5 (small lesion) to 8 cm (large lesions) and both kinds were inflicted on the top and bottom of the colonies, with a single replicate for each treatment. The main factors affecting the recovery of the colonies' surface were lesion features (type, position and size), turbidity and chiefly, the sedimentation rate. While lesion recovery was slow where sedimentation and resuspension rates were high, tissue regeneration was improved under low sedimentation and resuspension conditions. Moreover, lesions located at the bottom of colonies regenerated completely, whereas sediments frequently covered top lesions and limited their recovery. More than 60% of the colonies with small lesions recovered almost completely in less than 90 days, whereas those with larger injuries frequently showed extensions of their damage and increased mortality. Tissue-only lesions (LT2) regenerated two to three times faster than those involving both tissue and skeletal damage (LT1). Other variables not controlled in this syudy, such as diseases, encrusting organisms overgrowth and herbivory introduced further variability to the regeneration rates.

AB Changing climate may impact wildlife populations in national parks and conservation areas. We used logistic and non-linear matrix population models and 35 years of historic weather and population data to investigate the effects of climate on the population dynamics of elk in Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), Colorado, U.S.A. We then used climate scenarios derived from Hadley and Canadian Climate Center (CCC) global climate models to project the potential impact of future climate on the elk population. All models revealed density-dependent effects of population size on growth rates. The best approximating logistic population model suggested that high levels of summer precipitation accelerated elk population growth, but higher summer minimum temperatures slowed growth. The best approximating non-linear matrix model indicated that high mean winter minimum temperatures enhanced recruitment of juveniles, while high summer precipitation enhanced the survival of calves. Warmer winters and wetter summers predicted by the Hadley Model could increase the equilibrium population size of elk by about 100%. Warmer winters and drier summers predicted by the CCC Model could raise the equilibrium population size of elk by about 50%. Managers of national parks have relied on effects of weather, particularly severe winters, to regulate populations of native ungulates and prevent harmful effects of overabundance. Our results suggest that these regulating effects of severe winter weather may weaken if climate changes occur as those that are widely predicted in most climate change scenarios.

AB 1. Grassland management must be based on an understanding of key species' responses to various grazing regimes to achieve both production and conservation objectives. An experiment was designed to investigate several population processes that may potentially (i) contribute to the decline of Triticum dicoccoides (wild wheat) in intensively grazed grasslands, and (ii) promote the persistence of wild wheat in these grazing regimes.
   2. The experiment was conducted in natural Mediterranean grassland on the Korazim Plateau in northern Israel in the 1991-92 growing season. Nursery-grown seed of two morphologically distinct wild wheat genotypes were sown in plots with defined mulch applications and clipping regimes.
   3. Mulch application did not affect seedling emergence or establishment, but it did reduce tiller number per plant and ear size compared with plants grown without mulch. The detrimental effects of mulch on plant performance throughout the growing season indicated that both radiation and nitrogen limitations may have contributed to growth suppression. Mulch application reduced wheat biomass to a greater extent than that of interspecific competitors. The negative response indicated that mulch removal by intensive grazing during the dry season was unlikely to contribute to the decline of wild wheat in response to intensive livestock grazing.
   4. Both vegetative and reproductive performance of wild wheat increased by 50% in response to a reduction of interspecific competition following defoliation of neighbouring plants. A single severe clipping of vegetative wheat plants in defoliated neighbourhoods did not affect plant survival or tiller number, but did reduce ear and spikelet numbers and vegetative and reproductive biomass, compared with unclipped wheat plants. The positive wheat response to the reduction of interspecific competition almost exactly compensated for the negative effect of direct clipping on wheat fitness, and may thus contribute to the persistence of wheat populations.
   5. A second severe clipping of wheat plants in the reproductive growth phase severely reduced plant survival to reproduction, reproductive biomass, and seed quantity and quality in those plants that did become reproductive. One-half of the ears initiated following late-season clipping did not emerge from the flag leaf and produced mostly thin seed with reduced germinability.
   6. Geniculate genotypes exhibited greater grazing tolerance and reproductive performance than the erect genotypes in response to the second severe clipping. An increase in the relative abundance of geniculate genotypes in intensively grazed communities may provide an important persistence mechanism for wild wheat populations.
   7. An integrated estimate of wild wheat fitness, calculated as the mean reproductive output per seed sown, was < 1 in plants clipped during the later phase of reproductive growth. This indicates that wheat populations would experience local extinction if this defoliation regime were continued for several successive years.
   8. Management prescriptions to conserve this key annual species must focus on the reduction or deferment of late-season grazing during the reproductive growth phase to ensure population persistence.

AB The spatial and temporal compositions of rodent communities in habitats of the Badia region of north-east Jordan were investigated between 1996 and 1997. Live grid-trapping and spot-lighting techniques were employed to estimate rodent densities. Sixteen environmental variables including soil content, vegetation cover and relief were recorded within the study sites. TWINSPAN was used to derive six habitat classes based on the similarity of their rodent communities. These were hammada, harrat, marab, wadi and two types of sand dunes. The derived classifications were similar to the original categorization of habitat types based on ground-truthed observations of the sites selected from satellite imagery. Multivariate statistical analyses (TWINSPAN and DECORANA) revealed three major rodent groups in relation to local habitat types: (1) petrophiles: Gerbillus dasyurus, Acomys russatus and Meriones tristrami; (2) open hammada-dwelling species: Jaculus jaculus, Gerbillus henleyi and Meriones crassus; (3) psammophiles: Meriones libycus, Gerbillus nanus and Gerbillus cheesmani. Species richness was highest in marabs and lowest in red sand dunes. Species diversity (Hill's index) was highest in sand dunes and lowest in red sand dunes. Rodent biomass was highest in sand dunes and lowest in wadis. CANOCO showed rodent community composition to be correlated with vegetation parameters and soil content. TWINSPAN grouping and DECORANA ordination of rodent species provides some evidence for habitat preference, size disparity and competition as mechanisms of resource partitioning facilitating coexistence.

AB In a previous report, the authors found significant population variation in the calls of cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) that could not be explained by geographic variation in body size alone. Here we extend that work by investigating intraspecific population variation in the morphological characteristics underlying acoustic communication in male cricket frogs from several sites in Texas. We measured the volumes of laryngeal and auditory components responsible for the generation or reception of species-specific vocalizations in male frogs from eight populations. We found significant differences among populations in body size, as well as all the laryngeal and ear components we measured. With the exception of vocal cord and extracolumella volumes, the volumes of these anatomical structures differ among populations independently of body size as determined by a covariate analysis with snout-vent length as the covariate. Call dominant frequency differs among populations in a clinal pattern and head width, arytenoid cartilage, vocal cord and dilator muscle volume show a similar pattern when the residuals of the regression of morphological component on SVL are assessed for this trend. The results show that both larynx and ear structures can change in size independently of body size, yielding significant geographic variation in the behavioral and physiological expressions of the acoustic communication system underlying mate choice.

AB An estimated 80% Of redheads (Aythya americana) winter On the Laguna Madre of south Texas and Mexico and feed almost exclusively on shoalgrass (Halodule wrightii) rhizomes. Shoalgrass abundance has decreased by 60% over the past 30 years, and because the effects of shoalgrass loss on wintering redheads are unknown, we initiated a study to define habitat selection criteria and document the effect of wintering redheads on shoalgrass in the lower Laguna Madre, Texas. Redheads consumed an average of 75% of shoalgrass rhizome biomass at collection sites each winter. When rhizome biomass was grazed to a mean biomass of less-than-or-equal-to 0.18 g dry mass/core (approximately 10 g dry mass/M2), shoalgrass did not recover to its previous level the following growing season. Thirty-three percent of the sites (10) were grazed below 0.18 g dry mass/core during both years of the study, while 64% (19) were grazed below 0.18 g during 1 or the other of the 2 winters. Ramet number was positively correlated (P < 0.001, r2 = 0.54) with rhizome biomass; however, this relationship was influenced by grazing intensity. Heavy grazing reduced the amount of rhizome attached to each ramet compared with ungrazed ramets. Grazing had no effect on root biomass (P = 0.388), rhizome moisture content (P = 0.553), or soil magnesium, phosphorous, and potassium (P = 0.102, 0.499, 0.162, respectively). Redhead presence increased (P = 0.042) soil nitrogen levels. Foraging areas selected by redheads within the lower Laguna Madre had lower (P = 0.026) salinities (24 ppt) than areas not selected (35 ppt). Redheads did not select foraging areas in relation to crude protein levels in rhizomes. Shoalgrass habitat in the Laguna Madre should be protected from further losses and enhanced where possible.

AB Vegetation changes in Sahel have been pardy explained by overgrazing. Some authors have queried the importance of herbivory as a cause of succession in arid areas, but this requires a differentiation between life-forms. In this study abundances of phanerophytes and chamaephytes were estimated on 30 hills on an arid mountain plateau in eastern Sahel, influenced by mist from the Red Sea. Their relative abundances were compared with a similar study in 1953 when the area was partly protected against browsing. Significant spatial and temporal trends were found by ordination techniques. Succession from an open woodland to a very open shrubland was revealed. Hardwood trees suitable for fuel and other plants of direct commercial value decreased. Plants with small, sclerophyllous leaves, and/or toxic chemicals increased. The changes are attributed to an increased human population and intensified browsing. These biotic factors interacted with drought periods. Species that also grow in the surrounding Sahelian transition zone were relatively more stable than those with a disjunct distribution in the region, which occur in die area of more moist regional climate found in the Ethiopian highland.

AB 1. Range condition is discussed in relation to livestock grazing based on changes in plant composition, primary production, soil stability, and the influence of climate and fire.
   2. Differences in floristic composition were observed and were attributed to factors other than livestock grazing.
   3. Primary production was relatively high and correlated positively with rainfall.
   4. Generally, soil erosion was moderate but severe where cropping limited grazing to small areas.
   5. Range condition was accordingly classified as good to fair.
   6. To improve condition, it was recommended that pastoral lands must be protected from cropping and that range management based on traditional practices should be developed to include controlled burning.

AB Dispersal is a fundamental ecological process, yet demonstrating the occurrence and importance of long-distance dispersal (LDD) remains difficult, having rarely been examined for widespread, non-coastal plants. To address this issue, we integrated phylogenetic, molecular dating, biogeographical, ecological, seed biology and oceanographic data for the inland Urticaceae. We found that Urticaceae originated in Eurasia c. 69 Ma, followed by >= 92 LDD events between landmasses. Under experimental conditions, seeds of many Urticaceae floated for > 220 days, and remained viable after 10 months in seawater, long enough for most detected LDD events, according to oceanographic current modelling. Ecological traits analyses indicated that preferences for disturbed habitats might facilitate LDD. Nearly half of all LDD events involved dioecious taxa, so population establishment in dioecious Urticaceae requires multiple seeds, or occasional selfing. Our work shows that seawater LDD played an important role in shaping the geographical distributions of Urticaceae, providing empirical evidence for Darwin's transoceanic dispersal hypothesis.

AB Semi-arid ecosystems are often spatially self-organized in typical patterns of vegetation bands with high plant cover interspersed with bare soil areas, also known as tiger bush'. In modelling studies, most often, straight planar slopes were used to analyse vegetation patterning. The effect of slope steepness has been investigated widely, and some studies investigated the effects of microtopography and hillslope orientation. However, at the larger catchment scale, the overall form of the landscape may affect vegetation patterning and these more complex landscapes are much more prevalent than straight slopes. Hence, our objective was to determine the effect of landform variation on vegetation patterning and sediment dynamics. We linked two well-established models that simulate (a) plant growth, death and dispersal of vegetation, and (b) erosion and sedimentation dynamics. The model was tested on a straight planar hillslope and then applied to (i) a set of simple synthetic topographies with varying curvature and (ii) three more complex, real-world landscapes of distinct morphology. Results show banded vegetation patterning on all synthetic topographies, always perpendicular to the slope gradient. Interestingly, we also found that movement of bands - a debated phenomenon - seems to be dependent on curvature. Vegetation banding was simulated on the slopes of the alluvial fan and along the valley slopes of the dissected and rolling landscapes. In all landscapes, local valleys developed a full vegetation cover induced by water concentration, which is consistent with observations worldwide. Finally, banded vegetation patterns were found to reduce erosion significantly as compared to other vegetation configurations. (c) 2018 The Authors.

AB Although the integration of sustainability, ecology, and design has been recognized as necessary by scientists and practitioners, most transdisciplinary frameworks are not inclusive of the worldviews, paradigms, aims, processes, and components necessary for sustainability. Landscape sustainability science helps to focus scientist, scholar, practitioner, and stakeholder efforts toward sustainability at a pivotal level; however, collaboration and progress have been slow. Significant potential exists for design to be an integrative and transformational methodology toward landscape sustainability, yet it has not fulfilled this ambitious role. In this paper, we first build a case for regenerative development, a development and design methodology based on an ecological worldview, as an integrative platform for a new paradigm. This new paradigm, which we call regenerative landscape development, has the potential to thoroughly catalyze a shift toward regenerative sustainability. We then detail this new paradigm as a process that could continually enhance the capacities of living systems to increase health, well-being, and happiness. Next, to illustrate regenerative development in practice, we provide brief case studies of projects in Vina del Mar, Chile and Juluchuca, Guerrero, Mexico. Finally, we propose future recommendations and precautions in the construction of regenerative landscape development as a new paradigm. If fully understood, embraced, and realized, regenerative development holds incredible potential for a sustainable future.

AB The specific patterns of land use change that can be observed in many economically developed countries have fundamental implications on landscape structure and geomorphological processes. Areas characterized by widespread erosion such as badlands are often sensitive to anthropic modifications and of large interest in the analysis of the topographic determinants of land use change. This work aims to analyse the land use and landscape structure changes occurred in a Mediterranean landscape by analysing historical maps and infer the underlying processes that contribute to the pattern of change. First we carried out a comparative examination"of three historical image datasets (1820, 1954,2005) through overlay image processing and cross-classification analysis. Then we analysed the relationships between the detected land-use transformations and topographic parameters. Finally we determined the landscape structure change patterns through the use of GIS-based landscape metrics. The results showed how the study areas have experienced significant land use changes, mainly due to the abandonment of traditional rural systems. We found semi-natural areas distribution to be closely connected with terrain-shaping processes. The processes that underlie the multi:temporal landscape structure change have produced an overall increase of the landscape complexity. The work is one of the first attempts to use historical cartographic data to quantitatively assess changes in land use and landscape structure in the Mediterranean area. The proposed integrated methodology can support decision-making in landscape planning and may represent a useful tool to define effective strategies for biodiversity conservation.

AB This study presents the analysis of the emission, transport, dispersion, and concentration of particulate matter emitted from a large industrial complex dedicated to the manufacture of cement in the town of Malagueno, province of Cordoba (Argentina), using the USEPA's (Environmental Protection Agency) AERMOD model. The model was applied for 224 industrial and background emission sources (8 stacks, 3 limestone quarries, 13 material storage piles, 18 agricultural fields and 182 paved and unpaved segment roads). The application of the model was validated with Total Suspended Particulate matter (TSP) measured at two monitoring sites, where samples were collected for 62 consecutive days in winter. The maximum TSP values obtained at both monitoring sites (748 and 1100 mu g m(-3)) were well above the suggested WHO guidelines. The results obtained showed the impact of this industrial activity on local particulate matter concentrations, from which unpaved industrial roads and stockpiles were the most influential emission sources, directly affecting two of the closest neighborhoods in the area. Future studies will include the accumulation of heavy metals and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in TSP samples, the environmental risk assessment for exposure of the Malagueno population and the source apportionment of these pollutants.

AB Eutrophication has impacted water bodies around the world. Knowledge on how to manage and restore these systems is urgently needed in order to maintain adequate water quality. However, causes and consequences of eutrophication may differ among lakes located in tropical and temperate regions. The eutrophication process is better understood for temperate lakes due to the availability of a larger number of studies and longer time-series of data sets. In tropical regions, long-term studies are rare, but could exemplify the particularities of eutrophication speed under conditions of higher temperatures. The purpose of this work was to analyze the evolution of the eutrophication process in an urban tropical reservoir, using a 15-year time series (with occasional interruptions). The dataset comprised monthly sampling of several environmental variables and the phytoplankton community. We found a continuous process of water quality deterioration, mainly related to increasing levels of nutrient and phytoplankton biomass, as well as decreasing water transparency, even after the installation of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The ongoing eutrophication resulted in a steep trend of increasing cyanobacteria biomass that turned from a seasonal appearance into more persistent blooms in the most recent decades, while the relative contribution of other algal phyla to total phytoplankton biomass declined, which resulted in a loss of phytoplankton diversity. Phosphorus was the major determinant of the persistent blooms. Even though nitrogen concentrations were very high in this system, they were not significantly correlated with phytoplankton or cyanobacteria biomass. Total-P concentrations increased about three times during the study period, indicating that the reservoir did not respond to recent restoration efforts. The average water temperature, always sufficiently high to allow phytoplankton growth all year round, is an additional factor that makes tropical reservoirs especially sensitive to eutrophication. In contrast to temperate systems, the constantly favorable temperatures in the tropics may facilitate the persistence and dominance of cyanobacteria in the plankton community.

AB The number of threatened species continues to increase due to a range of anthropogenic disturbances, and many species continue to decline increasing their risk of extinction. Translocation is a widely used management technique to establish new populations to reduce the risk of extinction. There are, however, a range of issues to be considered. For example, for some species the donor population may be impacted by translocation, for other species it must be decided whether to translocate adults or juveniles to establish new populations. The question then becomes who do you move? The endangered Macquarie perch in south-eastern Australia is continuing to decline, with the recent Millennium Drought (1997-2010) and associated events (e.g., bushfires) contributing to dramatic local declines and the need for emergency responses. Successful historic translocations of this species involved adult fish, however the removal of significant numbers of adult fish may now impact source populations and alternative translocation approaches needed investigating. The use of sub-adult or juvenile fish, that would be expected to experience higher mortality, may be an approach to establishing new populations which would have less severe impacts on source populations. However, the number of fish required, frequency of translocation and likelihood of population establishment are unknown. This study outlines the development of a population model to assist in trialling translocation scenarios for establishing new populations of Macquarie perch. The model predicts that translocations of young-of-year fish (age 0+) is unlikely to be successful unless similar to 600 females are released annually for five years. If translocating yearling (age 1+) fish, annual translocations of >100 females is required to achieve success, with stocking for at least five consecutive years required. If the frequency of recruitment failure or magnitude of Allee effects increases, then translocations of increased numbers of yearlings or prolonged stocking (10 years) is required to achieve success. The addition of small numbers of adult fish in combination with yearlings decreases the number of yearlings required, and increases the chance of success under more stressful scenarios.

AB Placentae show considerable diversity in a number of nonmammalian, viviparous organisms, including amphibians, reptilian sauropsids, teleost fish, and chondrichthyes. However, the evolutionary processes driving the evolution of placenta are still debated. In teleost fishes, the genus Poeciliopsis (Poeciliidae) offers a rare opportunity for studying placental evolution: extensive placentation has evolved three independent times within the last 750,000 years and there is substantial interspecific variation in the degree of embryonic, maternal nutrient provisioning and development of the placenta. In poeciliids, the placenta is composed of a hypertrophied maternal follicular epithelium apposed to a highly vascularized embryonic pericardial sac. To better understand placental evolution, we have undertaken a comprehensive comparative study of the maternal follicle in eight closely related Poeciliopsis species that span the range in postfertilization, embryonic, maternal nutrient provisioning (from lecithotrophs, to moderate matrotrophs, to extensive matrotrophs). Using light and scanning electron microscopy, we found that the species that provide extensive postfertilization maternal nutrient provisioning (extensive matrotrophs) have thicker follicles and more extensive folding of the follicular epithelium compared to the lecithotrophs and moderate matrotrophs. Follicle sections and histology revealed that epithelial folds of the extensive matrotrophs are comprised primarily of cuboidal and columnar cells and are richly supplied with capillaries. Among the extensive matrotrophs, enhancements of follicle traits corresponded with increases in the level of maternal nutrient provisioning. Hypertrophied maternal follicles with richly vascularized folds can serve to increase the surface area and, thus, facilitate the transfer of substances between the mother and developing embryo. Finally, we found egg envelopes in the lecithotrophs and moderate matrotrophs, but not in the extensive matrotrophs. Morphological studies, like this one, can provide a better understanding of the natural variation in the structure and functioning of maternal and offspring traits associated with matrotrophy and, thus, insights into the processes driving placental evolution.

AB The recycling of organic material through bacteria and microzooplankton to higher trophic levels, known as the 'microbial loop', is an important process in aquatic ecosystems. Here the significance of the microbial loop in influencing nutrient supply to phytoplankton has been investigated in Lake Kinneret (Israel) using a coupled hydrodynamic-ecosystem model. The model was designed to simulate the dynamic cycling of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus through bacteria, phytoplankton and zooplankton functional groups, with each pool having unique C : N : P dynamics. Three microbial loop sub-model configurations were used to isolate mechanisms by which the microbial loop could influence phytoplankton biomass, considering (i) the role of bacterial mineralisation, (ii) the effect of micrograzer excretion, and (iii) bacterial ability to compete for dissolved inorganic nutrients. The nutrient flux pathways between the abiotic pools and biotic groups and the patterns of biomass and nutrient limitation of the different phytoplankton groups were quantified for the different model configurations. Considerable variation in phytoplankton biomass and dissolved organic matter demonstrated the sensitivity of predictions to assumptions about microbial loop operation and the specific mechanisms by which phytoplankton growth was affected. Comparison of the simulations identified that the microbial loop most significantly altered phytoplankton growth by periodically amplifying internal phosphorus limitation due to bacterial competition for phosphate to satisfy their own stoichiometric requirements. Importantly, each configuration led to a unique prediction of the overall community composition, and we conclude that the microbial loop plays an important role in nutrient recycling by regulating not only the quantity, but also the stoichiometry of available N and P that is available to primary producers. The results demonstrate how commonly employed simplifying assumptions about model structure can lead to large uncertainty in phytoplankton community predictions and highlight the need for aquatic ecosystem models to carefully resolve the variable stoichiometry dynamics of microbial interactions.

AB Bergmann''s rulean increase in body size with latitudecorrelates with latitudinal declines in ambient temperature and predation risk, but relatively few studies simultaneously explore the relative importance of these factors. Along temperate Atlantic shorelines, the isopod Idotea balthica from high latitudes are 53% longer on average than isopods from low latitudes. When reared at 6 degrees degrees--24 degrees degrees C, juveniles increased growth and development rates with temperature. Because the increase in growth rate with temperature outstripped increases in development rate, female size at maturity increased with temperature. This thermal sensitivity of growth cannot account for the latitudinal pattern in body size. Within temperature treatments, females from low latitudes reached sexual maturity at younger ages and at a smaller size than did females from higher latitudes. This shift in life-history strategy is predicted by latitudinal declines in predation pressure, which we tested using field-tethering experiments. Overall, isopods at low latitudes had a 44% greater mortality risk from daytime predators relative to isopods at higher latitudes. We conclude that a latitudinal gradient in predation risk, not temperature, is principally responsible for Bergmann''s rule in I. balthica. Increases in body size during future warming of oceans may be constrained by local patterns of predation risk.

AB Overfishing and land-derived eutrophication are major local threats to coral reefs and may affect benthic communities, moving them from coral dominated reefs to algal dominated ones. The Central Red Sea is a highly under-investigated area, where healthy coral reefs are contending against intense coastal development. This in-situ study investigated both the independent and combined effects of manipulated inorganic nutrient enrichment (simulation of eutrophication) and herbivore exclosure (simulation of overfishing) on benthic algae development. Light-exposed and shaded terracotta tiles were positioned at an offshore patch reef close to Thuwal, Saudi Arabia and sampled over a period of 4 months. Findings revealed that nutrient enrichment alone affected neither algal dry mass nor algae-derived C or N production. In contrast, herbivore exclusion significantly increased algal dry mass up to 300-fold, and in conjunction with nutrient enrichment, this total increased to 500-fold. Though the increase in dry mass led to a 7 and 8-fold increase in organic C and N content, respectively, the algal C/N ratio (18 +/- 1) was significantly lowered in the combined treatment relative to controls (26 +/- 2). Furthermore, exclusion of herbivores significantly increased the relative abundance of filamentous algae on the light-exposed tiles and reduced crustose coralline algae and non-coralline red crusts on the shaded tiles. The combination of the herbivore exclusion and nutrient enrichment treatments pronounced these effects. The results of our study suggest that herbivore reduction, particularly when coupled with nutrient enrichment, favors non-calcifying, filamentous algae growth with high biomass production, which thoroughly outcompetes the encrusting (calcifying) algae that dominates in undisturbed conditions. These results suggest that the healthy reefs of the Central Red Sea may experience rapid shifts in benthic community composition with ensuing effects for biogeochemical cycles if anthropogenic impacts, particularly overfishing, are not controlled.

AB Weight-induced mobility reductions can have dramatic fitness consequences and winged animals are especially sensitive to the trade-off between mass and locomotion. Data on how natural weight fluctuations influence a flying insect's ability to take off are scarce. We therefore quantified take-off flight ability in Pieris napi butterflies in relation to reproductive status. Take-off flight ability (velocity and take-off angle) under suboptimal temperature conditions was recorded with a 3D-tracking camera system and was predicted to decrease with relatively larger weight loads. Our results show that relatively larger weight loads generally reduce flight speed in male butterflies and lower take-off angles in females. However, despite having a lower wing loading, mated male butterflies flew slower than unmated males. Our study suggests that retention of weight loads associated with reproduction impairs insect flight performance.

AB Two different methods of establishing high-density spawner sanctuaries for bay scallop (Argopecten irradians irradians) restoration were evaluated over 2 years at a site in Northwest Harbor, East Hampton, New York, USA. Hatchery-reared scallops, which had been overwintered at nearby sites, were free-planted directly to the bottom in late March/early April at an initial target density of 94-128 scallops/m(2). In addition, scallops were stocked in off-bottom culture units consisting of three vertically stacked 15-mm mesh ADPI (R) bags at densities of 50, 100, or 200 scallops/bag (=117,234, or 468 scallops/m(2)), respectively. Survival of scallops differed significantly by year, planting method, and scallop source. Survival of free-planted scallops was generally lower than caged scallops. Better survival of free-planted scallops in 2005 versus 2006 likely reflected the presence of luxuriant eelgrass beds in 2005, which were absent in 2006. Survival of scallops in ADPI bags was not appreciably related to stocking density. Shell growth was highest for free-planted scallops; in cages, growth was somewhat better at 50 versus 200 scallops/bag. Wet weights of epibionts were significantly higher in caged versus free-planted scallops. Reproductive condition of scallops stocked at 50/bag was usually higher than at 200/bag. Both free-planting and off-bottom systems yielded high densities of adult bay scallops at the time of spawning, which ensures a higher probability of successful fertilization of spawned eggs and thus a greater potential for success of restoration efforts.

AB The Trexler-DeAngelis model shows that placentas are most likely to evolve in environments with consistent, high levels of resource availability. An assumption imperative to the model is that placental species abort embryos in low food conditions. However, a previous experimental test of this assumption using the northern clade of Poeciliopsis showed no evidence for abortion. To distinguish between the alternatives that placental species either sacrifice body condition to maintain reproduction when resources are restricted, or that the previously documented pattern of resource allocation is a function of other life-history correlates of placentation rather than placentation alone, we perform a similar experiment on the southern clade of Poeciliopsis. The southern clade has the opposite relationship between life-history traits and placentation as seen in the northern clade. Our results mirror those from the northern clade, indicating that reproductive mode, rather than life history, dictates the pattern of resource allocation. These results add to the difficulties of explaining placental evolution within the constraints of the Trexler-DeAngelis model by restricting the range of resource conditions in which placental species can outcompete nonplacental species. They also lend support to hypotheses that suggest parent-offspring conflict in utero drives the evolution of the placenta.

AB Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are successful colonisers of lake littoral habitats and they interact strongly with littoral benthos. Previous research suggests that localised areas colonised by zebra mussels may be hotspots of nitrogen (N) cycling.
   The effects of zebra mussels on nitrification and denitrification rates were examined approximately every other month for 1 year in Gull Lake, Michigan, U.S.A. Littoral sediment was collected from an area free of zebra mussels and distributed into shallow trays; rocks colonised with zebra mussels were placed in half of the trays, while uncolonised rocks were placed in the remaining trays. After an incubation period of 6-8 weeks in the lake, sediment and zebra mussels were collected from the trays, replaced with new sediment and zebra mussels, and placed in the lake for the next interval. In the laboratory, sediment nitrification and denitrification rates were measured for each tray.
   Sediment nitrification rates did not increase in the presence of zebra mussels; instead nitrification rates were sensitive to changes in water temperature and increased with increasing exchangeable sediment ammonium. In contrast, denitrification rates increased in sediment trays with zebra mussels in the winter when nitrate (NO3-) availability was high and when Chara did not grow in the trays.
   Sediment denitrification was NO3--limited in all seasons, regardless of zebra mussel treatment. However, sediment in the presence of zebra mussels responded less to NO3- addition, suggesting that NO3- limitation of denitrification can be reduced by zebra mussel activity. Zebra mussels have a seasonally variable impact on sediment denitrification rates, and this may translate into altered seasonal patterns of N cycling in localised areas of lakes where they are particularly abundant.

AB 1. Where competition with established vegetation limits plant recruitment, fires create open conditions which can allow invasive species to establish. However, facilitation theory suggests that destruction of vegetation will restrict germination and survival. These hypotheses were tested in a long-term study of establishment by Pinus sylvestris - a globally important invasive - on English temperate heaths.
   2. Pine seeds were sown at 10 sites which represented replicated stages of heath recovery after fire: from bare soil to dense, tall vegetation.
   3. Seedling emergence varied among stages from 3% to 36% and was closely related to vegetation density, increasing with lower shrub height. The same pattern was evident within sites where seedlings emerged mostly at sowing locations with little or no vegetation. 4. Yearly seedling survival showed a quadratic relationship with vegetation density over the first 4 years; with extremely high (> 95%) mortality in both very open and very dense conditions, but low mortality (< 30%) under intermediate cover. Over the subsequent 5 years seedling mortality did not differ among stages or with vegetation density.
   5. The initial conditions after fire constrain invasion because high emergence is countered by high mortality. However, the moderate shrub density during the first decade post-fire enhances P. sylvestris seedling survival and so promotes invasion. Invasibility is low in dense mature heath, but becomes high as shrubs collapse in degenerate heath which increases seedling emergence and survival.
   6. Synthesis. This study provides evidence that facilitation can occur in temperate regions, and that the plant interactions within a heathland community are a balance of competition and facilitation. This balance is governed by vegetation structure and plant ontogeny. Dominance of competition in more dense vegetation and for seedling emergence changed to facilitative effects in less dense vegetation and for older seedlings.

AB Understanding the processes that shape artificial reef (AR) communities is critical if these are to be implemented for reef restoration or enhancement purposes. A study of the post-recruitment survival of coral colonies transplanted onto a 19-year-old AR and its adjacent natural reef (NR) was carried out at Eilat (Red Sea) in order to test the hypothesis that differences in benthic communities between the two reefs are derived from differential survival processes. Transplanted miniature coral colonies were monitored in situ on both reef types. It was found that the survival of those of the soft coral Dendronephthya hemprichi on the AR was nearly double that of those transplanted onto the NR. Similarly, survival of nubbins of the stony coral Pocillopora damicornis on the AR was over three-fold greater than on the NR. We suggest that the observed differential survival resulted from the unique suites of environmental conditions at the two habitats, mainly in terms of sedimentation load and current velocities, yet not from differences in substratum type (artificial vs. natural). The results demonstrate the role played by survival processes in shaping coral assemblages on ARs and NRs, and indicate that post-recruitment survival must be considered when designing ARs for restoration or enhancement purposes.

AB 1. It is well established that pollen-mediated gene flow among natural plant populations depends on a complex interaction between the spatial distribution of pollen sources and the short- and long-distance components of pollen dispersal. Despite this knowledge, spatial isolation strategies proposed in Europe to ensure the harvest purity of conventional crops are based on distance from the nearest genetically modified (GM) crop and on empirical data from two-plot experiments. Here, we investigate the circumstances under which the multiplicity of pollen sources over the landscape should be considered in strategies to contain GM crops.
   2. We simulated pollen dispersal over eighty 6 x 6 km simulated landscapes differing in field characteristics and in amount of GM and conventional maize. Pollen dispersal was modelled either via a Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG, currently used for European coexistence studies) or a bivariate Student (2Dt) kernel. These kernels differ in their amount of short- and long-distance dispersal. We used linear models to analyse the impact of local and landscape variables on impurity rates (i.e. proportion of seeds sired by pollen from a transgenic crop) in conventional fields and quantified their increase due to dispersal from other than the closest GM crops.
   3. The average impurity rate over a landscape increased linearly with the proportion of GM maize over that landscape. The increase was twice as fast using the NIG kernel and was governed by the short-distance dispersal component.
   4. Variation in impurity rates largely depended on the distance to the closest GM crop and the size of the receptor field. However, impurity rates were generally underestimated when only dispersal from the closest GM field was considered.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Distance to the closest GM crop had most impact on impurity rates in conventional fields. However, impurity rates also depended on intermediate- to long-distance dispersal from distant GM crops. Therefore, isolation distances as currently defined will probably not allow long-term coexistence of GM and conventional crops, especially as the proportion of GM crops grown increases. We suggest strategies to account for this impact of long-distance dispersal.

AB Mellitochory, seed dispersal by bees, has been implicated in long-distance dispersal of the tropical rain forest tree, Corymbia torelliana (Myrtaceae). We examined natural and introduced populations of C. torelliana for 4 years to determine the species of bees that disperse seeds, and the extent and distance of seed dispersal. The mechanism of seed dispersal by bees was also investigated, including fruit traits that promote dispersal, foraging behaviour of bees at fruits, and the fate of seeds. The fruit structure of C. torelliana, with seed presented in a resin reward, is a unique trait that promotes seed dispersal by bees and often results in long-distance dispersal. We discovered that a guild of four species of stingless bees, Trigona carbonaria, T. clypearis, T. sapiens, and T. hockingsi, dispersed seeds of C. torelliana in its natural range. More than half of the nests found within 250 m of fruiting trees had evidence of seed transport. Seeds were transported minimum distances of 20-220 m by bees. Approximately 88% of seeds were dispersed by gravity but almost all fruits retained one or two seeds embedded in resin for bee dispersal. Bee foraging for resin peaked immediately after fruit opening and corresponded to a peak of seed dispersal at the hive. There were strong correlations between numbers of seeds brought in and taken out of each hive by bees (r = 0.753-0.992, P < 0.05), and germination rates were 95 +/- 5%. These results showed that bee-transported seeds were effectively dispersed outside of the hive soon after release from fruits. Seed dispersal by bees is a non-standard dispersal mechanism for C. torelliana, as most seeds are dispersed by gravity before bees can enter fruits. However, many C. torelliana seeds are dispersed by bees, since seeds are retained in almost all fruits, and all of these are dispersed by bees.

AB We investigated risk sensitivity with harnessed honey bees in a proboscis-extension conditioning paradigm. We conditioned each subject to turn its head and extend its proboscis towards one of two presented odors; one odor was associated with a constant reward and the other with a variable reward that was either low or high, with probabilities P and (1-P), respectively. Reward values and probabilities were set so that the expected value of the variable alternative was equal to that of the constant one. We performed six experimental conditions in which variability was in reward volume and three conditions in which variability was in reward concentration. The experiments were designed to systematically test the effect of various parameters that describe the reward distributions on levels of risk sensitivity. Risk aversion was greatest when variability was in reward volume, and the variable distribution included zero rewards and had a high coefficient of variation (CV = s.d./mean). The variance itself did not affect risk sensitivity. Subjects were risk indifferent when the variable distribution did not include zero rewards, however these distributions were positively skewed. The independent effects of zero rewards and distribution skew remain to be tested. Subjects were risk indifferent in conditions where variability was in reward concentration, but concentration range was limited and these distributions did not include zero rewards and were skewed. We conclude that risk aversion to variability in reward amount is a robust phenomenon for some reward distributions. A systematic evaluation of the effect of various reward distribution parameters on choice behavior should complement functional and mechanistic approaches.

AB We studied the algal community of the Great Salt Plains (GSP), an expansive (65 km(2)) salt flat situated in north-central Oklahoma, USA that has been designated as the Salt Plains Microbial Observatory (SPMO) by the National Science Foundation. The GSP offered a unique opportunity to study a terrestrial, hypersaline algal community that experiences wide-ranging environmental conditions. We were able to show that ammonium-N, rather than salinity, was the most important predictor of total algal biomass. However, salinity was found to be a significant controlling variable in diatom distribution at the GSP, where diatom abundance was negatively correlated with porewater salinity concentrations. Overall, chlorophytes (likely dominated by Dunaliella spp.) were the most abundant algal group at the consistently hypersaline (> 300 ppt) south site. Diatom and cyanobacterial biomass were on average highest at the central site, which experienced greater fluctuations in salinity. While taxonomic diversity was limited to three algal groups (chlorophytes, diatoms, and cyanobacteria), the salinity preferences and halotolerance ranges of isolated strains were quite variable. Although porewater salinities at the GSP are commonly near saturation (> 300 ppt), the large majority of isolates had halotolerance ranges below 150 ppt. This suggests that algae at the GSP rarely achieve maximum growth rates, and could only do so when intermittent rain events reduce salinity to optimal levels. Because the vast majority of our strains were isolated from salt-saturated soil samples, maintaining viability (rather than growth efficiency) appears to be the most successful adaptation to the extreme conditions at the GSP.

AB Major ecological forces affecting diel activity patterns include predation, competition, resource dynamics, and ambient conditions. In this work we studied if, how, and why the nocturnal activity patterns of two gerbil species differed with respect to site, habitat, season, and inter-specific competition. The study system included two gerbil species-Gerbillus pyramidum and G. andersoni allenbyi in a sandy landscape composed of three habitats-shifting, semi-stabilized, and stabilized sand habitats. Conforming to previous studies, in the semi-stabilized sand habitat clear temporal partitioning in activity times occurred, with G. pyramidum being active earlier in the night and G. a. allenbyi being active in the later part of the night. As shown in previous studies in a different, more xeric site, removal of G. pyramidum demonstrated that this activity pattern is the result of interference competition by the latter on the former. Nocturnal activity pattern differed between habitats and seasons. Temporal partitioning occurred in the semi-stabilized sand habitat where both gerbil species were common. In the shifting sand habitat, G. pyramidum activity pattern was similar to that in the semi-stabilized sand habitat, but at a lower level. In the stabilized sand habitat where G. a. allenbyi occurred alone, its activity was the highest among the three habitats and was fairly constant throughout the night. Temporal partitioning occurred in the fall and early summer, but not in the early spring. The roles of predation risk, competition and resource dynamics in determining the gerbils' temporal activity together with their implications for community structure, are discussed.

AB Reversible phenotypic changes, such as those observed in nutritional organs of long-distance migrants, increasingly receive the attention of ornithologists. In this paper we review the cost-benefit studies that have been performed on the flexible gizzard of Red Knots Calidris cunutus. By varying the hardness of the diet on offer gizzard mass could experimentally be manipulated, which allowed quantification of the energetic costs and benefits as a function of gizzard size. These functions were used to construct an optimality model of gizzard mass for Red Knots on migration and during winter. Two possible currencies were assumed, one in which Knots aim to balance their energy budget on a daily basis (satisficers), and one in which Knots aim to maximise their daily energy budget (net rate maximisers). The model accurately predicted variation in gizzard mass that we observed (1) between years, (2) within years, and (3) between sites. Knots maintained satisficing gizzards during winter and rate-maximising gizzards when fuelling for migration. The model-exercise revealed the importance of digestive constraints and quality of prey in the life of Knots.

AB The reefs of the Lakshadweep suffered a mass mortality of coral in 1998, in the wake of an El Nino event of unprecedented severity. In 2002, we conducted a broadscale benthic survey of six atolls in this group to check if there were geographic trends in recovery patterns across the archipelago. Four years after the mass mortality, live coral cover was relatively low on most atolls, and thin algal turfs dominated the benthos. Clear benthic differences were apparent between eastern and western aspects of reefs, pointing to the importance of local hydrodynamic conditions in determining recovery rates. Where recovery was the most apparent, it was dominated by fast-growing and bleaching-resistant coral genera. Despite the apparent lack of recovery at many sites, the reef system did not show signs of having suffered a phase shift' to a macroalgal state. High herbivorous fish abundance was likely responsible in controlling macrophyte levels, and may be crucial for further benthic recovery in these reefs.

They are bounded by a multiple-layered velamen, responsible for rapid water uptake, water loss reduction, osmotic and mechanical protection. In the cortex area, thin-walled idioblasts contain numerous raphides of calcium oxalate in their large vacuole with a distinctive tonoplast. Wide morphological variations are observed among the raphide cross sections. Electron-dense compounds penetrate the raphide surface and raphide groove. Raphides seem to be vital for the protection of the root tuber parenchyma from herbivores. The cells of uniseriate endodermis are heavily thickened possessing a few plasmodesmata. The vascular cylinder is 20-28-arch and the root xylem consists of vessels in short radial rows, alternating with clusters of phloem cells. The presence of cells, which contain soluble polysaccharides in their large vacuole, is conspicuous after employing the Schiff's reagent. Exodermis cells and all cell walls, especially the thick ones of the endodermis, are also stained. Numerous parenchyma cells, especially those around vascular bundles are stained intensely, when exposed to Sudan Black B. These cells occurring as solitary idioblasts abundantly accumulate oil. Electron-dense remnants are evident within the vacuoles of the storage cells especially near the vascular tissue. The morphological features of A. aestivus root tubers and the major part of the total plant biomass are responsible for the species' occurrence and frequent dominance in a wide array of arid environments. A. aestivus possessing root tubers is proved to be very efficient in storing water during the long summer drought, less susceptible to climatic stress and well synchronized with the climatic fluctuations of the Mediterranean environment.

AB We assessed seed predation by vertebrates and invertebrates in three fire-frequency treatments (<1 year, -4 years, and >4 years since fire) and in three topographic positions (upland, limestone breaks, and lowland) in tallgrass prairie. Two types of seed trays, one for vertebrates and one for invertebrates, were placed in each treatment during each nocturnal and diurnal period. Vertebrates removed significantly more seeds than did invertebrates. Fire frequency and topographic position affected seed removal by both vertebrates and invertebrates. Seed removal by invertebrates was influenced negatively by fire; the greatest seed removal occurred in uplands and lowlands in unburned prairie. Vertebrates removed the most seeds in burned prairie and in lowlands and limestone breaks. Time of day also influenced seed removal by vertebrates, as nocturnal vertebrates (assumed to be rodents) removed more seeds than diurnal vertebrates. Abundance of rodents, however, did not predict accurately seed removal in fire treatments or topographic positions, as rodents removed fewer seeds than expected in prairie that had not been burned in >4 years and in lowlands. This pattern likely was due to the presence of a well-developed plant litter layer in both unburned and lowland habitats, which reduces the likelihood of a rodent locating seeds.

AB Investigation of gender specialization in plants has led to several theories on the evolution of sexual dimorphism: reproductive compensation, based on enhanced reproductive efficiency with gender specialization (flowers should be larger on dioecious plants); Bateman's Principle, based on sex-specific selection (display for pollinator attraction in males and seed set in females); and intersexual floral mimicry, based on mimicry of a reward-providing gender by a non-reward providing gender (reduced dimorphism in dioecious plants due to increased spatial separation of male and female flowers). These theories were evaluated in Ecballium elaterium, which contains two subspecies, elaterium (monoecious) and dioicum (dioecious). Our results show that flowers of the dioecious subspecies are larger and allocate more to reproductive organs than do flowers of the monoecious subspecies. Both subspecies are sexually dimorphic (male flowers larger than female flowers). Variance in flower size among populations is greater in the dioecious subspecies. Finally, there is sufficient genetic variation to enable ongoing response to selection; genetic correlation constraints on independent response of female and male flowers may be stronger in the monoecious subspecies. Our findings provide support for aspects of all three theories, suggesting that the evolution of floral dimorphism is based on a complex interplay of factors. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.

AB The reutilisation of Dunaliella salina carotenogenesis medium, after microalgal biomass separation by centrifugation, was assessed. The wastewater had an NaCl concentration between 174 g dm(-3) and 254 g dm(-3) and an average total organic matter concentration of 1540 mg dm(-3) ash-free dry weight, of which 41% (w/v) was glycerol. The biological treatment was established at laboratory scale and batch operations used halophilic bacteria from the wastewater itself. The wastewater was supplemented with NH4+, PO43-, K+ and Mg2+ ions to enhance growth. The effect of each ion added per se was initially investigated and a response surface methodology (RSM) used to identify the optimal conditions for maximisation of glycerol removal from the wastewater, which was considered to be the main objective. Addition of NH4+ ions alone achieved 79% glycerol removal compared with only 59% in the absence of supplement, after 8 days incubation. The combined addition of ions ([NaCl] =214g dm [Mg2+] = 114 mg dm(-3), [K+] = 131 mg dm(-3), [NH4+] = 113 mg dm(-3), [PO43-] = 40 mg dm(-3)) increased glycerol removal from the wastewater such that, after 2 days incubation, no residual glycerol was apparent in cultures. These ion combinations enabled the halophilic bacteria to efficiently remove glycerol from the wastewater and consequently reduce organic matter. This treated wastewater should be appropriate for reutilisation as a carotenogenesis medium for beta -carotene production from D salina. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Small mammal and bird assemblages were compared across fence-lines between one communal and three adjacent commercial range-lands in Namaqualand, South Africa. The communal area has twice the recommended stocking rate of sheep and goats, and has less perennial plant cover and more annual plants than neighbouring commercial rangelands. Commercial rangelands supported a larger and more diverse assemblage of small mammals and birds. Small mammal species composition on communal lands was a subset of that on adjacent commercial rangelands, with only one species equally abundant in both treatments. Diurnal mammals were scarce in communal rangelands, apparently due to the lack of cover for predator avoidance and herbivory. Management to maintain a diversity of small mammals requires a minimum level of effective cover. Bird richness and diversity was also reduced on communal rangelands, with many species, especially insectivores, less abundant. A few bird species, notably granivores, were more abundant on communal rangelands, probably because of the increase in annual plant cover. The absence of some large bird species regularly found in Namaqualand, but absent from both treatments (e.g., bustards), suggests that neither management practice is optimal. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB Aquatic invertebrates are usually larger at maturity when water temperatures are lower. For the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia, it has been suggested that a threshold size must be attained to initiate maturation, which results two instars later in the deposition of eggs into the brood chamber. This threshold size is believed to be independent of food. Here, we examine the effect of temperature on maturation threshold body-length in Daphnia magna. Daphnids were raised from birth to maturity under three constant-temperature regimes (12 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 22 degrees C), and two food-level conditions. Animals were measured daily, and a body-length based maturation threshold determined for each individual. We demonstrate that mean maturation threshold length is negatively correlated with ambient water temperature. Further, daphnids with a larger threshold length tended to be larger at maturity. A maturation threshold linked to body length suggests that reduced Variation in size at maturity is adaptive, even at the cost of additional variation in instar number or age at maturity.

AB Populations often exhibit abrupt changes in abundance associated with a smooth, continuous change in some component of their environment, with the abruptness usually attributed to inter-specific interactions or physical extremes. This paper presents a spatially explicit single-species population model in which intra-specific interactions alone are responsible for such an abrupt change. The essential mechanism involves cooperation in both colonization (through enhanced recruitment near other individuals) and mortality (protection through a ''safety-in-numbers'' interaction). Large fluctuations in population density would likely be observable near the transition region.

ID ISLAND; REEFS
AB Vermetid buildups, formed primarily of Dendropoma, are found in the coastal areas near Bodden Town and Great Bluff Estates on Grand Cayman. These gastropods are commonly encrusted by foraminifera (Homotrema rubum. Acervulina? sp.), coralline algae, and cyanobacteria. Spaces between the gastropods are filled with silt- to sand-sized sediment derived from the nearby lagoon. Bioerosion by echinoids, bivalves, worms, algae, and fungi substantially modified these buildups. C-14 dating of the gastropod shells suggests that the in situ buildups died during the period of 1625-1740 AD. The presence of vermetids at these localities on Grand Cayman is not consistent with the high-energy conditions in which these gastropods usually thrive. Today, there are no living vermetids at these localities and the active biological processes are bioerosion and encrustation. The demise of the in situ vermetid buildups during the period of 1625-1750 AD may have been related to changes triggered by the Little Ice Age. Alternatively, their demise may have been caused by a change in sea-level or a significant reduction in the wave energy that was impinging on the coastlines.

AB The mangal community fringing the Grand Cul-de-Sac Matin of Guadeloupe, French West Indies is composed of Rhizophora mangle (red), Avicennia germinans (black), and Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove).  These species form six discrete vegetation zones along a Canal Perrin transect.  A. germinans supports dense epicaulous crusts of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria which cover the bole and even the finest branchlettes.  Crusts on red and white mangrove were less dense.  Acetylene reduction activity (ARA) recorded for these previously unreported crusts ranged from 174 to 2012 nmol C2H4.mg ChLa-1.hr-1.  The ARA in the aerial strarum represents a potentially important source of nitrogen to this mangal community.  Preliminary data showed that the 42.3 g N.m-2.yr-1 biologically fixed by cyanobacteria growing epiphyrically on Avicennia in zone IV of the Canal Perrin Transect was 3.2 times greater than the total nitrogen budget of an Avicennia community in Southern Australia.  The rate-controlling effects of crust hydration and salinity on the ARA and the recovery rate of nitrogenase activity following a period of dehydration are reported.

AB There is a growing consensus that relatively few factors with broad applicability underlie changes in the structure of different plant communities along different environmental gradients. Direct comparisons of variation in community structure with respect to common abiotic factors along different environmental gradients would provide a test of this hypothesis. We illustrate this by quantifying patterns of species diversity and growth form along two gradients, a lakeshore and a mountainside. On both gradients, standing crop increased with productivity; light at the soil surface and bare ground decreased. The proportions of woody species, stemmed species, phanerophytes, and chamaephytes increased with productivity, whereas hemicryptophytes decreased. Regressions of species diversity and growth forms on number of growing days, for both gradients simultaneously, allowed each variable to be described by the same regression formula for both gradients, even though the lakeshore spanned 67 cm in altitude and the mountainside 495 m. These results demonstrate statistically significant vegetation-environment correlations in a range of state variables in spite of the fact that these two gradients appear fundamentally different.

AB Stone surfaces are extreme environments that support microbial life. This microbial growth occurs despite unfavourable conditions associated with stone including limited sources of nutrients and water, high pH and exposure to extreme variations in temperature, humidity and irradiation. These stone-dwelling microbes are often resistant to extreme environments including exposure to desiccation, heavy metals, UV and Gamma irradiation. Here, we report on the effects of climate and stone geochemistry on microbiomes of Roman stone ruins in North Africa. Stone microbiomes were dominated by Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria but were heavily impacted by climate variables that influenced water availability. Stone geochemistry also influenced community diversity, particularly through biologically available P, Mn and Zn. Functions associated with photosynthesis and UV protection were enriched in the metagenomes, indicating the significance of these functions for community survival on stones. Core members of the stone microbial communities were also identified and included Geodermatophilaceae, Rubrobacter, Sphingomonas and others. Our research has helped to expand the understanding of stone microbial community structure and functional capacity within the context of varying climates, geochemical properties and stone conditions.

AB Fructans are fructose-based oligo-and polysaccharides derived from sucrose that occur in a plethora of Eubacteria and plants. While fructan-producing (fructanogenic) Eubacteria are abundant in hypersaline environments, fructan production by Archaea has never been reported before. Exopolysaccharides accumulated by various Archaea from the Halobacteria class (belonging to the genera of Halomicrobium, Haloferax and Natronococcus) originating from different locations on Earth were structurally characterized as either levans or inulins with varying branching degrees (10%-16%). Thus, we show for the first time in the literature that fructans are produced in all three domains of life, including Archaea. This proof of concept will not only provide insight into Archaeal glycans and evolution but it may also open new frontiers for innovative strategies to overcome the ever-increasing threat of excessive salinization.

AB The patch-leaving problem is a canonical foraging task, in which a forager must decide to leave a current resource in search for another. Theoretical work has derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have tested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy. Nevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect and noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how this process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical study, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions where the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the current patch and the overall environment. We solve the model for conditions where foraging decisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform simulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not met. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can represent different "strategies", for example an incremental, decremental, or counting strategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but differ in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is uncertain. To describe sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an energy-dependent marginal utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch residence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence accumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical framework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits underlying patch-leaving decisions.

AB The Khor Al-Adaid sabkha in Qatar is among the rare extreme environments on Earth where it is possible to study the formation of dolomitea carbonate mineral whose origin remains unclear and has been hypothetically linked to microbial activity. By combining geochemical measurements with microbiological analysis, we have investigated the microbial mats colonizing the intertidal areas of sabhka. The main aim of this study was to identify communities and conditions that are favorable for dolomite formation. We inspected and sampled two locations. The first site was colonized by microbial mats that graded vertically from photo-oxic to anoxic conditions and were dominated by cyanobacteria. The second site, with higher salinity, had mats with an uppermost photo-oxic layer dominated by filamentous anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (FAPB), which potentially act as a protective layer against salinity for cyanobacterial species within the deeper layers. Porewater in the uppermost layers of the both investigated microbial mats was supersaturated with respect to dolomite. Corresponding to the variation of the microbial community's vertical structure, a difference in crystallinity and morphology of dolomitic phases was observed: dumbbell-shaped proto-dolomite in the mats dominated by cyanobacteria and rhombohedral ordered-dolomite in the mat dominated by FAPB.

AB The validity of Bergmann's rule, perhaps the best known ecogeographical rule, has been questioned for ectothermic species. Here, we explore the interspecific version of the rule documenting body size gradients for anurans across the whole New World and evaluating which environmental variables best explain the observed patterns. We assembled a dataset of body sizes for 2761 anuran species of the Western Hemisphere and conducted assemblage-based and cross-species analyses that consider the spatial and phylogenetic structure in the data. In accordance with heat and water-related explanations for body size clines, we found a consistent association of median body size and potential evapotranspiration across the New World. A relevant role of water availability also emerges, suggesting the joint importance of body size for thermoregulation and hydroregulation in anurans. Anurans do not follow a simple Bergmannian pattern of increasing size towards high latitudes. Consistent with previous regional findings, our Hemisphere-wide analyses detect that the geographic variation in anuran body sizes is highly dependent on a trade-off between heat and water balance. The observed size-climate relationships possibly emerge from the interplay between thermoregulatory abilities and the benefits inherent to reduced surface-to-volume ratios in larger species, which decrease the rates of evaporative water loss and favour heat retention. Our results also show how temperature becomes important for species that are directly in contact with the substrate and water, like burrowing and terrestrial anurans, while arboreal species exhibit a body size cline linked with potential evapotranspiration.

AB We document and evaluate the use of metapopulation management to conserve a declining population of 217 cheetahs in 40 subpopulations. Metapopulation management resembles a natural metapopulation, but dispersal success, demographic rescue effects and genetic viability are enhanced by moving suitable individuals to selected habitat fragments. Unfortunately, history and results of metapopulation management are rarely published. Cheetahs, extirpated from 85% of South Africa, were reintroduced from Namibian and South African ranches into fenced reserves. During 1965-2009 343 cheetahs were reintroduced, yet reserves held only 289 in 2009. Then translocations of free-roaming cheetahs were halted, and numbers dropped to 217 on 40 reserves by 2012. A metapopulation project was launched, and key conservation problems indentified from interviews and records. Thirty-five percent of reserves had no breeding cheetahs, 13% were inbreeding, fence quality was erratic, 3% of cheetahs were sold into captivity annually, and 28% of cheetah mortalities were anthropogenic. Lions accounted for 31% of mortality, perhaps elevated by lion-inexperienced cheetahs and high lion densities. These problems were addressed, and cheetahs were translocated between reserves. Although the median reserve size was only 125km(2) holding four cheetahs, and 80% of reserves were privately owned, in 6years the metapopulation grew by 51% to 328 cheetahs on 51 reserves, while genetic diversity was managed and monitored. Thus, using metapopulation management, low density species and associated key processes, including carnivory or mega-herbivory, can be conserved in relatively small reserves in regions withdensehuman populations precluding natural gene flow.

AB This article analyzes the process of forest fragmentation of a floodplain landscape of the Lower Amazon over a 30-year period and its implications for the biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services to the riverine population. To this end, we created a multi-temporal forest cover map based on Landsat images, and then analyzed the fragmentation dynamics through landscape metrics. From the analyses of the landscape and bibliographic information, we made inferences regarding the potential impacts of fragmentation on the biodiversity of trees, birds, mammals and insects. Subsequently, we used data on the local populations' environmental perception to assess whether the inferred impacts on biodiversity are perceived by these populations and whether the ecosystem services related to the biodiversity of the addressed groups are compromised. The results show a 70% reduction of the forest habitat as well as important changes in the landscape structure that constitute a high degree of forest fragmentation. The perceived landscape alterations indicate that there is great potential for compromise of the biodiversity of trees, birds, mammals and insects. The field interviews corroborate the inferred impacts on biodiversity and indicate that the ecosystem services of the local communities have been compromised. More than 95% of the communities report a decreased variety and/or abundance of animal and plant species, 46% report a decrease in agricultural productivity, and 19% confirm a higher incidence of pests during the last 30 years. The present study provides evidence of an accelerated process of degradation of the floodplain forests of the Lower Amazon and indicate substantial compromise of the ecosystem services provision to the riverine population in recent decades, including reductions of food resources (animals and plants), fire wood, raw material and medicine, as well as lower agricultural productivity due to probable lack of pollination, impoverishment of the soil and an increase of pests.

AB Deforestation and forest fragmentation are contributing to declines in crop pollinator populations worldwide. Several studies have examined the impact of forest proximity on plant pollination ecology, but concentrated on single crop species. However, it can be more informative to investigate multiple crop and pollinator species in a community, because different pollinator groups may respond differently to forest distance. We evaluated flower visitor diversity, visitation frequency, and fruit set for three crop species (rambutan, durian and mango) in 10 pairs of mixed fruit orchards. Each pair consisted of one orchard near to (< 1 km) and one orchard far from (> 7 km) the forest edge. Rambutan fruit set was significantly influenced by distance to forest. The main visitors of rambutan flowers were stingless bees. In contrast, the dominant visitors to durian and mango flowers were nectarivorous bats and flies, respectively, and the fruit set of these crops were not significantly influenced by distance to forest. However, durian fruit set was negatively affected by distance to the nearest cave inhabited by nectarivorous bats. This study demonstrates that both caves and forests can be important pollinator sources for agricultural crops, and that the dispersal success of pollinators is related to isolation from source habitats. Maintaining forest patches and limestone karsts may provide stepping stones across fragmented landscapes, and attract greater numbers of pollinators to agricultural areas.

AB The grasslands on the sandy soils of the eastern edge of the Namib Desert of Namibia are strikingly punctuated by millions of mostly regularly-spaced circular bare spots 2 to 10 m or more in diameter, generally with a margin of taller grasses. The causes of these so called fairy circles are unknown, but several hypotheses have been advanced. In October 2009, we set up experiments that specifically tested four hypothesized causes, and monitored these 5 times between 2009 and 2015. Grass exclusion in circles due to seepage of subterranean vapors or gases was tested by burying an impermeable barrier beneath fairy circles, but seedling density and growth did not differ from barrier-less controls. Plant germination and growth inhibition by allelochemicals or nutrient deficiencies in fairy circle soils were tested by transferring fairy circle soil to artificially cleared circles in the grassy matrix, and matrix soil to fairy circles (along with circle to circle and matrix to matrix controls). None of the transfers changed the seedling density and growth from the control reference conditions. Limitation of plant growth due to micronutrient depletion within fairy circles was tested by supplementing circles with a micronutrient mixture, but did not result in differences in plant seedling density and growth. Short-range vegetation competitive feedbacks were tested by creating artificially-cleared circles of 2 or 4 m diameter located 2 or 6 m from a natural fairy circle. The natural circles remained bare and the artificial circles revegetated. These four experiments provided evidence that fairy circles were not caused by subterranean vapors, that fairy circle soil per se did not inhibit plant growth, and that the circles were not caused by micronutrient deficiency. There was also no evidence that vegetative feedbacks affected fairy circles on a 2 to 10 m scale. Landscape-scale vegetative self-organization is discussed as a more likely cause of fairy circles.

AB Alongside well researched shifts in species' distributions and phenology, reduction in the body size of organisms has been suggested as a third universal response to contemporary climate change. Despite mounting evidence for declining body size, several recent reviews highlight studies reporting increases in body size or no change over time. This variability in response may derive from the geographic scale of contributing studies, masking species-level responses to broad-scale environmental change and instead reflecting local influences on single populations. Using museum specimens, we examine temporal patterns of body size of 24 Australian passerine species, sampling multiple populations across the geographic ranges of each species between 1960 and 2007. Generalised additive models indictated that the majority (67%) of species showed important inter-annual body size variation, and there was striking cross-species similarity in temporal size patterns. Most displayed near-linear or linear, unidirectional size trends, suggesting a pervasive and directional change in environmental conditions, consistent with climate change. For species showing linear size responses, the absolute rate of size change ranged between 0.016 and 0.114% of body size (wing length) per year, consistent with studies on other continents. Overall, 38% (9/24) of species showed temporal declines in body size and 21% (5/24) showed increases, consistent with the variability and direction of size responses thus far documented among populations; declining body size is a pervasive response to climate change but it is not universal.

AB Dusts are one of the main air pollutants emitted during cement manufacturing. A substantial part of these are breathable particles that are less than 10 mu m in diameter (PM10), which represent a potential threat for the health of the exposed population. This study aimed at evaluating the short-term effects of PM10 concentrations on the health of children, aged 6-14 years, who attended the schools in Fumane (Italy), in proximity (1.2 km) to a large cement plant. School absenteeism was used as a proxy indicator of child morbidity. Time series of daily school absences and PM10 concentrations were collected for 3 school-years from 2007 to 2010 (541 school-days, 462 children on average). The associations between PM10 concentrations and school absence rates in the same day (lag0) and in the following 4 days (lag1 to lag4) were evaluated using generalised additive models, smoothed for medium/long term trends and adjusted for day of the week, influenza outbreaks, daily temperature and rain precipitations. The average concentration of PM10 in the period was 34 (range: 4-183) mu g/m(3). An average 10 mu g/m(3) increase of PM10 concentration in the previous days (lag0-4) was associated with a statistically significant 2.5% (95%CI: 1.1-4.0%) increase in the rate of school absences. The highest increase in the absence rates (2.4%; 95%CI: 1.2-3.5%) was found 2 days after exposure (lag2). These findings provide epidemiological evidence of the acute health effects of PM10 in areas with annual concentrations that are lower than the legal European Union limit of 40 mu g/m(3), and support the need to establish more restrictive legislative standards.

AB This paper explores which physical landscape components relate to subjective landscape dimensions. The ways in which people describe their surrounding cultural landscape was analyzed through an assessment of their representations of it. A special focus was placed on assessing the role of land cover as a means to communicate landscape meanings regarding a specific geographical region. The methodological framework was built on the basis of a questionnaire survey, multivariate statistical analysis and mapping approaches. This research shows that there is a set of physical landscape components that relate to subjective landscape dimensions which can be disclosed through the assessment of social representations. Enhancing and safeguarding those physical landscape components associated with the subjective landscape dimensions are important aspects in both framing and targeting land cover/use policies and decision making. Results also suggest that land cover can be understood as an important asset for describing landscapes as more than 30% of respondents referred to it when asked to represent the case study region of Alentejo in southern Portugal. This might mean that in addition to objective ecological and biological functions, land cover is also an important asset for evaluating subjective landscape dimensions in line with place attachment and landscape identity. Finally, the ways in which the empirical material gathered here can be used to inform policy and planning are explored. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study of intraspecific variation of acoustic signals and its relationship with genetic divergence is important for understanding the origin of divergence in communication systems. We studied geographical variation in the acoustic structure of advertisement calls from five populations of the four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul, and its relationship with the genetic divergence among these populations. By analyzing temporal and spectral parameters of the advertisement calls, we report that the signals of northern, central, and southern populations have remarkable differences between them. A phylogeographical analysis from a mitochondrial DNA fragment demonstrated three phylogenetic groups coincident with those found with the bioacoustics analysis. Furthermore, bioacoustic and genetic distances show significant correlations after controlling for geographical distance. These results suggest that behavioural divergence among populations of P.thaul has a phylogenetic basis, supporting three evolutionary units within this species, as well as prompting the exploration of divergence processes in the sound communication system of this species.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 110, 142-155.

AB 1. We propose that the appearance and establishment of Nostocales (cyanobacteria) species of the genera Aphanizomenon and Cylindrospermopsis in the warm subtropical Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel) from 1994 was linked to changes in climate conditions and summer nitrogen (N) availability. 2. From 1994 to 2009, an increase in frequency of events of elevated water temperature (>29 degrees C) in summer, and to some extent a greater frequency of lower summer wind speed events, affected water turbulence and water column stratification, thus providing better physical conditions for the establishment of these populations. 3. In recent years, N-depleted conditions in Lake Kinneret in early summer have promoted the development and domination of Nostocales that could gain an ecological advantage owing to their N2-fixing capability. 4. Nitrogen fixation rates coincided both with heterocyst abundance and with Nostocales biomass. The N supplied to the lake via nitrogen fixation ranged from negligible quantities when Nostocales represented only a minor component of the phytoplankton community to 123 tonnes when Cylindrospermopsis bloomed in 2005. This high N2 fixation rate equals the average summer dissolved inorganic nitrogen load to the lake via the Jordan River.

AB Postrelease monitoring is an important aspect of reintroduction projects, one outcome of which is to allow an assessment of the initial success of the reintroduction, often measured by quantifying survival and reproduction rates. In long-lived species, accurate estimations of demographic parameters are difficult to obtain, and therefore assessment of reintroduction success in such species is challenging. To assess the initial success of a reintroduction program for the long-lived, slow-reproducing, and critically endangered western lowland gorilla Gorilla gorilla gorilla, we analyzed postrelease monitoring data from 2 reintroduced populations, in the Bateke Plateau region of the Republics of Congo and Gabon, to quantify several demographic parameters, and compared our results with published data on wild gorilla populations. Annual survival rate of the 51 released gorillas was 97.4%, 9 females gave birth to 11 infants at an annual birth rate of 0.196 births per adult female, and first-year survival of the infants was 81.8%. Annual birth rate within the reintroduced populations is not significantly different from that given for wild western gorilla populations, and other demographic parameters fall within the range of published data for wild gorilla populations. Our analysis illustrates that the reintroduction program has been successful in terms of the initial measures of postrelease survival and reproduction, and our quantitative data should facilitate the development of a population model that can predict the probability of population persistence and therefore provide an indication of longer-term reintroduction success.

AB Linking individual behavior to spatial population processes, may clarify the complex link between species distribution and landscape properties. We asked how shrubs affect beetles in drylands and tested if we could explain distribution patterns of beetles by individual response to shrub landscape. We studied patch preference of ground-dwelling beetles segregated in a two-phase mosaic landscape, composed of shrub-covered and open patches and hypothesized that species richness and abundance are higher under shrubs due to the ameliorated microclimatic conditions and greater food resources. Pitfall trapping showed that shrub patches were preferred in shrub poor ecosystem because there was more food available under shrubs and cooler temperatures. However, similar conditions resulted in shrub preference only in an arid ecosystem, whereas in a semi-arid ecosystem, with high cover of shrubs, we found more beetles in the open patches. Observations in beetle movement patterns explained the contradicting effects of shrub patches in the two ecosystems. Beetle movement was affected by shrubs' shading suggesting dependency on shrub structure rather than speciesdependency. Integrating analysis of beetle distribution in the population level with analysis of individual movement provides a robust framework for linking landscape properties to species behavior and distribution in a patchy landscape.

AB To explore the role that fish play in aquatic ecosystems, a hydrodynamic ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) was coupled to a novel fish population model. The coupled model (DYCD-FISH) combined two modelling approaches: a complex dynamic model and an individual-based model. The coupled model simulates fish growth population dynamics and predicts fish impacts on various ecosystem components, including nutrients and lower trophic levels. The model was employed to explore the role of the dominant fish in Lake Kinneret (Israel), Acanthobrama terraesanctae (Kinneret bleak, or in Hebrew, lavnun ha'kinneret; hereafter lavnun). Model results suggested that the lavnun has a significant impact (p < 0.05) on the magnitude of output variables including its prey food (the predatory and microzooplankton), major nutrients such as ammonium (NH4) and phosphate (PO4), and on several phytoplankton species, but not on the seasonality of any of the output variables. Since the model incorporates trophic levels from nutrients to fish, it revealed the nonlinear dynamic impacts of fish on different ecosystem components and in particular has led to quantitative insights into the relative influence of top-down control on water quality attributes. Besides being an ecosystem research tool, DYCD-FISH can also be employed as a fishery management tool, and in particular facilitate ecosystem-based fishery management.

AB In an effort to further our understanding of ecosystem structure on multiple temporal and biogeographic scales, the influence of competitive interactions in an invasive setting was explored in the fossil record. Using brachiopod morphology as a proxy for niche space occupation, the external shapes of three pairs of potentially competing brachiopod species were analyzed via three-dimensional baseline shape co-ordinates. Morphology of incumbents was compared before and after the Richmondian Invasion (Late Ordovician, Illinois Basin), and for each incumbent-invader pair: it was possible to differentiate the incumbents pre- and post-invasion; the incumbent became more morphologically different from the invader; and landmarks driving the morphological differences of two of the incumbents shift away from the invader in multidimensional morphospace. These results are consistent with character displacement, which supports the hypothesis that competition played a discernable role in the brachiopod community. This suggests that the use of morphometrics and morphospace occupation could provide a valuable tool for the exploration of ecological interactions in the geologic record, potentially providing novel interpretations of the effects of competition on community structure and evolution.

AB Mosaic freshwater landscapes exhibit tree-dominated patches -or tree islands-interspersed in a background of marshes and wet prairies. In the Florida Everglades, these patterned landscapes provide habitat for a variety of plant and animal species and are hotspots of biodiversity. Even though the emergence of patchy freshwater systems has been associated with climate histories, fluctuating hydrologic conditions, and internal feedbacks, a process-based quantitative understanding of the underlying dynamics is still missing. Here, we develop a mechanistic framework that relates the dynamics of vegetation, nutrients and soil accretion/loss through ecogeomorphic feedbacks and interactions with hydrologic drivers. We show that the stable coexistence of tree islands and marshes results as an effect of their both being (meta-) stable states of the system. However, tree islands are found to have only a limited resilience, in that changes in hydrologic conditions or vegetation cover may cause an abrupt shift to a stable marsh state. The inherent non-linear and discontinuous dynamics determining the stability and resilience of tree islands should be accounted for in efforts aiming at the management, conservation and restoration of these features.

ID LAKE KINNERET; DISTRIBUTIONS; EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; MODEL
AB Here we report the worldwide first results on long-term variability of marine phytoplankton taxonomic size structure based on traditional taxonomic size spectra (TTSS). The Plymouth Marine Laboratory monitoring database for station L4 was used to build annual TTSS patterns (1992-2005) and estimate their similarity with the help of hierarchical cluster analysis. Almost identical TTSS patterns were observed each year. While the height of the main peaks was slightly variable, their horizontal positions were unchanged. Whereas the above patterns resembled the phytoplankton TTSS established for the subtropical Lake Kinneret, the L4 spectrum size range was much broader and the distance between the main peaks approximately two times greater. The similarity level (Pearson r = 0.872-0.992) in TTSS pairs for station L4 was comparable to the estimates established at several lakes, while being much higher than in the inter-ecosystem (L4 and Kinneret) pairs (r = 0.317-0.578). Thus, the phenomenon of long-term consistency of phytoplankton taxonomic size structure, found previously at freshwater ecosystems, for the first time is confirmed for marine phytoplankton, which speaks in favor of much higher generality of this important structural property of aquatic communities. The TTSS multi-annual consistency can be helpful for long-term monitoring, environment protection and forecasting. The evident and permanent difference in the peak positions between ecosystems opens a way for additional analyses which can be helpful for the development of theoretical models. A set of plausible mechanisms, capable to produce and support the empirically obtained distribution patterns, is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Il s'agit d'un sujet large et important, compte tenu de l'echelle et des consequences economiques associees aux especes non indigenes, en Amerique du Nord et ailleurs. Les evaluations de risques et d'impacts demeurent difficiles a cause de la complexite et des interactions avec plusieurs facteurs responsables des invasions et de leurs consequences. Ces processus s'effectuent selon differentes echelles spatio-temporelles, et sont souvent influences et compliques par les activites humaines. Pour chaque composante d'une invasion ecologique (c.-a-d. arrivee, etablissement et diffusion), les auteurs passent en revue les approches generales pour la modelisation du phenomene ainsi que l'identification des donnees et les manques de connaissance. Avec la disponibilite accrue de diverses donnees spatiales et des capacites informatiques, les auteurs suggerent la possibilite de lier les modeles de chaque composante dans un cadre plus integre, permettant ainsi de mieux incorporer les interactions et les retroactions entre les composantes dans les efforts de modelisation des risques. On illustre cette approche en utilisant des exemples provenant du travail actuel sur le Sirex noctilio Fabricius, une guepe perce-bois envahissante relativement nouvelle dans l'est de l'Amerique du Nord.

AB Many herbivore populations fluctuate temporally, but the causes of those fluctuations remain unclear. Plant inducible resistance can theoretically cause herbivore population fluctuations, because herbivory may induce plant changes that reduce the survival or reproduction of later-feeding herbivores. Herbivory can also simply reduce the quantity of food available for later feeders and this, too, can cause population fluctuations. Inducible resistance and food limitation often occur simultaneously, yet whether they jointly facilitate or suppress herbivore fluctuations remains largely unexplored. We present models that suggest that food limitation and inducible resistance may have synergistic effects on herbivore population dynamics. The population-level response of the food plant to herbivory and the details of how inducible resistance affects herbivore performance both influence the resulting herbivore dynamics. Our results identify some biological properties of plant-herbivore systems that might determine whether or not cycles occur, and suggest that future empirical and theoretical population dynamics studies should account for the effects of both food limitation and inducible resistance.

AB Anisotropic clumped (patchy) dispersal of species is a widespread phenomenon in nature, however, its relevance for structuring communities and maintaining biodiversity is still a matter of debate. We used a spatially explicit simulation model to assess the effects of spatial aggregation through this dispersal strategy compared to isotropic clumped (local) dispersal on the diversity of a model community of sessile species. The species differed only in terms of their dispersal distance and no a priori trade-offs between dispersal and local competitive strength were assumed. We investigated spatially homogeneous and heterogeneous environments without and with temporally fluctuating reproduction success. In all cases patchy dispersal allowed the long-term coexistence of a variety of species-in contrast to local dispersal. In particular, patchy dispersal was found to decouple the mechanism of spatial aggregation from the dispersal distance. This supports species coexistence even in environments where local dispersal was a superior or inferior dispersal strategy. Thus, the specific way of spatial aggregation can be decisive for coexistence. Spatial aggregation independent of the dispersal distance is an attribute of dispersal offering new possibilities for trade-offs with life-history traits and with the dispersal distance itself.

AB Skull shape and size were investigated in 311 specimens of Apodemus sylvaticus (Linnaeus, 1758) and A. flavicollis (Melchior, 1834), using traditional and geometric morphometric approach. We searched for potential morphometric diagnostic criteria between these morphologically similar mice and we analyzed the interpopulation morphometric variation. Specific status of all individuals was identified by scoring four diagnostic allozyme markers. Discriminant analysis based on 16 cranial measurements as well as that based on landmark data for ventral side of the skull discriminated individuals with 99.7% accuracy. The classification functions useful for practical discrimination of unknown specimens are given. Our data showed neither clear intraspecific geographical pattern among studied populations nor evidence for character displacement in syntopic populations of A. sylvaticus and A. flavicollis.

AB The possibility that free-spawning marine organisms may be subject to fertilization failure at low population density (due to the effects of sperm dilution) has sparked much interest, but these effects have been demonstrated only in a few species that broadcast their eggs. Some egg-brooding species may overcome dilution effects by filtering low concentrations of sperm from seawater and fertilizing eggs throughout an extended period of time. We examined the effects of population density and size on fertilization in Botryllus schlosseri, a hermaphroditic colonial ascidian that free-spawns sperm, but broods eggs. We experimentally manipulated the size and density of mating groups and surveyed fertilization levels in natural populations that varied in density. Fertilization was not affected by variation in population size or density in either the experimental or natural populations. Near the end of the reproductive season, some eggs may have been fertilized too late to complete development, suggesting a temporal form of sperm limitation that has not been considered in other systems. We also detected greater variability in fertilization levels at lower population density. Nevertheless, these results suggest that caution must be used in extrapolating reported density effects on fertilization to all taxa of free-spawners; density effects may be reduced in brooders that have efficient sperm collection mechanisms.

AB Although many variants of the hawk-dove game predict the frequency at which group foraging animals should compete aggressively, none of them can explain why a large number of group foraging animals share food clumps without any overt aggression. One reason for this shortcoming is that hawk-dove games typically consider only a single contest, while most group foraging situations involve opponents that interact repeatedly over discovered food clumps. The present iterated hawk-dove game predicts that in situations that are analogous to a prisoner's dilemma, animals should share the resources without aggression, provided that the number of simultaneously available food clumps is sufficiently large and the number of competitors is relatively small. However, given that the expected gain of an aggressive animal is more variable than the gain expected by nonaggressive individuals, the predicted effect of the number of food items in a clump-clump richness-depends on whether only the mean or both the mean and variability associated with payoffs are considered. More precisely, the deterministic game predicts that aggression should increase with clump richness, whereas the stochastic risk-sensitive game predicts that the frequency of encounters resulting in aggression should peak at intermediate clump richnesses or decrease with increasing clump richness if animals show sensitivity to the variance or coefficient of variation, respectively.

AB Normative models of choice usually predict preferences between alternatives by computing their value according to some criterion, then identifying the alternative with greatest value. An important consequence of this procedure is captured in the economic concept of rationality, defined through a number of principles that are necessary for the existence of an ordinal scale of value upon which organisms base their choices. Violations of these principles, such as some recently reported breaches of transitivity and regularity in birds and honeybees, have strong implications for the understanding of decision mechanisms in humans and nonhumans alike. We investigated rationality in risky choice using European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris. Birds had to choose between two or three food sources, each associated with a different variance in delay to reward. In three experiments, starlings were strongly risk prone, showing regular and consistent preferences in binary and trinary choices. Preferences also satisfied weak and strong stochastic transitivity. Our results extend the generality of previous research in risk-sensitive foraging to situations where more than two alternatives are present and suggest that violations of rationality in risk-sensitive choices may be expressed only under restricted sets of conditions.

AB Under current climate change scenarios, numerous lakes are predicted to experience increases in maximum temperatures and in the timing, frequency and duration of heat waves. To investigate the effects of the magnitude and timing of thermal stress on zooplankton communities we compared the thermal responses and seasonal phenologies of two sympatric species, Epischura lacustris and Daphnia catawba. Thermal responses were measured in the laboratory as differences in demography of field animals at temperatures characteristic of temperate takes in spring, summer and autumn (15-30degreesC). Epischura lacustris had a significantly lower temperature tolerance than D. catawba, which appears to explain differences in their seasonal phenologies. Divergence in thermal tolerances and seasonal phenologies of these sympatric species strongly suggests that the response of the Zooplankton communi, in this lake to warming events will differ greatly with the timing and severity of the thermal stress. Similar effects are to be expected in other lakes containing these species and other zooplankton communities.

ID SYSTEMS
AB An experiment with beef cows grazing Mediterranean-type grassland was conducted to study the effect of grazing deferment at the beginning of the growing season on pasture productivity and animal performance under intensive herd management conditions. The grazing trial was composed of 4 treatments (deferred grazing at stocking rates of 0.83 and 0.67 cows per ha and continuous grazing at 0.67 and 0.5 cows per ha) replicated in 2 blocks and continued for 5 consecutive years. The herds were given low-energy supplemental feed during deferment and during the dry summer. At the intermediate stocking rate, at which both deferred and continuous grazing were compared, herbage production was significantly reduced by grazing during the 'deferment period' and;calf weaning weights without deferment were significantly lower than in the deferred grazing treatments. Weaned live weight per cow was significantly lowest in the continuous intermediate treatment. Weaned weight per hectare was greatest at the highest stocking rate (with deferment), Utilization of supplementary feed per unit weaned live weight was significantly greater in the deferred treatments, Only about a third of the herbage production was grazed, even at the heavy stocking rates, Herbage production varied more between years than between treatments. It is concluded that in the system studied, deferment with supplementary feeding becomes important for both animal and vegetation production as stocking rate approaches and exceeds 0.67 cows ha(-1). With deferment, herbage production during the main growing season can be maintained even under heavy grazing pressure. This result can be explained with a simple dynamic growth and grazing model.

   Female age and condition as well as nesting schedule may affect clutch size and chick survival, which both are important factors affecting the annual reproductive output. Clutch size and chick survival are often interrelated in altricial birds but in precocial species the interrelation is dubious. To study factors affecting clutch size and the survival of ducklings in the common goldeneye Bucephala clangula, we examined ringing-recovery data, supplied by ringers, from seven intensively studied goldeneye populations from different parts of Finland. Due to large sample sizes it was possible to distinguish the effects of interrelated variables, e.g. female age and hatching date. Clutch size was significantly associated with both female age and hatching date; first-time breeders and late breeders had small clutches. Clutch size was not associated with female condition. The recovery rate of ducklings was associated with hatching date (low in late broods) but not with female age, condition or brood size. The natal brood sizes of recruited female ducklings did not differ from annual averages, but the natal hatching date of recruited females was earlier and their mothers were older than annual averages in the populations into which the recruited females were born. The timing of nesting was the most important factor affecting the reproductive output of common goldeneye females in a given year.

AB Abundances of species of small mammal in typical southern-Valdivian, temperate rainforest decline and those of more xeric-adapted species of Patagonian steppe increase across a major environmental gradient in southern Chile. Despite heterogeneous and skewed distributions of all individual species across this transition, community characteristics including species richness, community evenness, biomass of trophic groups (animalivores, folivores, fungivores, granivores, omnivores), and total biomass of rodents do not change significantly across this gradient. Across this transition, local (ecological) processes evidently compensate for geographical (historical) constraints, yielding remarkably constant community dynamics. Species richness of small mammals in this region appears limited by availability of resources rather than the pool of species available to colonize a site.

ID INCUBATION; BEHAVIOR; EGG
AB The breeding biology of the Spur-winged Plover (Vanellus spinosus) was studied in an agricultural area in central Israel from 1989 through 1993. The breeding season extended from March to September. The average clutch size was 3.4 eggs and modal clutch size was four eggs. Clutch size declined slightly during the season. Eggs were laid at about two-day intervals. The average incubation period was 28 days, but it declined during the season in correlation with increased ambient temperatures and laying order. In four-egg clutches the last egg was incubated 3.4 days less than the first. Hatching of a four-egg clutch was asynchronous and lasted 1.9 days. Field hatchability was 86.4% of all eggs laid. In the laboratory, the highest hatching success (97.7%) occurred at an incubation temperature of 37.5 degrees C. Field experiments showed that in four-egg clutches incubation temperature was significantly higher, incubation periods tended to be shorter (but not significantly so), and hatching success was higher (but not significantly so) in comparison with artificially enlarged five-egg clutches. This lends some, but not unequivocal, support to the hypothesis that clutch size may be limited by incubation ability. However, females whose clutches were removed upon completion were capable of laying continuously without altering either clutch or egg size, suggesting that clutch size is not limited by egg-formation abilities.

AB Thirty-four vegetation clusters identified in the present study, after the application of TWINSPAN and DCA multivariate techniques, were assigned into 8 vegetation types, each of definite vegetation and habitat characters.  The suggested vegetation types are well segregated along the DCA axis one which reflects soil moisture, salinity (as indicated by EC values), fertility (as indicated by the organic matter and nitrogen contents) and species diversity gradients.  In general, soil moisture and soil fertility increase and species diversity decreases with the following sequence of vegetation types:  Echinops spinosissimus-Ononis serrata on inland sand dunes, Pancratium maritimum on coastal sand dunes, Halocnemum strobilaceum-Salsola kali in saline sand deposits, Atriplex halimus-Chenopodium murale along the terraces and slopes of drains, Arthrocnemum glaucum-Tamarix nilotica in salt marshes, Chenopodium murale along the slopes of drains, Phragmites australis along the littoral zones of drains, and Lemna gibba-Potamogeton crispus in the water zone.  This sequence reflects also a gradient of human interference, starting with the vegetation of the less disturbed habitats (sand dunes and saline sand deposits) and ending with the fully man-made habitats (drain zones).

TI Fire frequency, state change and hysteresis in tallgrass prairie
SO ECOLOGY LETTERS

DT Article
DE Alternative stable states; prescribed fire; regime shift; resilience;
   woody encroachment
AB Hysteresis is a fundamental characteristic of alternative stable state theory, yet evidence of hysteresis is rare. In mesic grasslands, fire frequency regulates transition from grass- to shrub-dominated system states. It is uncertain, however, if increasing fire frequency can reverse shrub expansion, or if grass-shrub dynamics exhibit hysteresis. We implemented annual burning in two infrequently burned grasslands and ceased burning in two grasslands burned annually. With annual fires, grassland composition converged on that of long-term annually burned vegetation due to rapid recovery of grass cover, although shrubs persisted. When annual burning ceased, shrub cover increased, but community composition did not converge with a long-term infrequently burned reference site because of stochastic and lagged dispersal by shrubs, reflecting hysteresis. Our results demonstrated that annual burning can slow, but not reverse, shrub encroachment. In addition, reversing fire frequencies resulted in hysteresis because vegetation trajectories from grassland to shrubland differed from those of shrubland to grassland.

AB Early warning signals (EWS) are statistical indicators that a rapid regime shift may be forthcoming. Their development has given ecologists hope of predicting rapid regime shifts before they occur. Accurate predictions, however, rely on the signals being appropriate to the system in question. Most of the EWS commonly applied in ecology have been studied in the context of one specific type of regime shift (the type brought on by a saddle-node bifurcation, at which one stable equilibrium point collides with an unstable equilibrium and disappears) under one particular perturbation scheme (temporally uncorrelated noise that perturbs the net population growth rate in a density independent way). Whether and when these EWS can be applied to other ecological situations remains relatively unknown, and certainly underappreciated. We study a range of models with different types of dynamical transitions (including rapid regime shifts) and several perturbation schemes (density-dependent uncorrelated or temporally-correlated noise) and test the ability of EWS to warn of an approaching transition. We also test the sensitivity of our results to the amount of available pre-transition data and various decisions that must be made in the analysis (i.e. the rolling window size and smoothing bandwidth used to compute the EWS). We find that EWS generally work well to signal an impending saddle-node bifurcation, regardless of the autocorrelation or intensity of the noise. However, EWS do not reliably appear as expected for other types of transition. EWS were often very sensitive to the length of the pre-transition time series analyzed, and usually less sensitive to other decisions. We conclude that the EWS perform well for saddle-node bifurcation in a range of noise environments, but different methods should be used to predict other types of regime shifts. As a consequence, knowledge of the mechanism behind a possible regime shift is needed before EWS can be used to predict it.

AB Vegetation patterns are a characteristic feature of semi-arid regions. On hillsides these patterns occur as stripes running parallel to the contours. The Klausmeier model, a coupled reaction-advection-diffusion system, is a deliberately simple model describing the phenomenon. In this paper, we replace the diffusion term describing plant dispersal by a more realistic nonlocal convolution integral to account for the possibility of long-range dispersal of seeds. Our analysis focuses on the rainfall level at which there is a transition between uniform vegetation and pattern formation. We obtain results, valid to leading order in the large parameter comparing the rate of water flow downhill to the rate of plant dispersal, for a negative exponential dispersal kernel. Our results indicate that both a wider dispersal of seeds and an increase in dispersal rate inhibit the formation of patterns. Assuming an evolutionary trade-off between these two quantities, mathematically motivated by the limiting behaviour of the convolution term, allows us to make comparisons to existing results for the original reaction-advection-diffusion system. These comparisons show that the nonlocal model always predicts a larger parameter region supporting pattern formation. We then numerically extend the results to other dispersal kernels, showing that the tendency to form patterns depends on the type of decay of the kernel.

AB Despite advances in our mechanistic understanding of ecological processes, the inherent complexity of real-world ecosystems still limits our ability in predicting ecological dynamics especially in the face of on-going environmental stress. Developing a model is frequently challenged by structure uncertainty, unknown parameters, and limited data for exploring out-of-sample predictions. One way to address this challenge is to look for patterns in the data themselves in order to infer the underlying processes of an ecological system rather than to build system-specific models. For example, it has been recently suggested that statistical changes in ecological dynamics can be used to infer changes in the stability of ecosystems as they approach tipping points. For computer scientists such inference is similar to the notion of a Turing machine: a computational device that could execute a program (the process) to produce the observed data (the pattern). Here, we make use of such basic computational ideas introduced by Alan Turing to recognize changing patterns in ecological dynamics in ecosystems under stress. To do this, we use the concept of Kolmogorov algorithmic complexity that is a measure of randomness. In particular, we estimate an approximation to Kolmogorov complexity based on the Block Decomposition Method (BDM). We apply BDM to identify changes in complexity in simulated time-series and spatial datasets from ecosystems that experience different types of ecological transitions. We find that in all cases, K-BDM complexity decreased before all ecological transitions both in time-series and spatial datasets. These trends indicate that loss of stability in the ecological models we explored is characterized by loss of complexity and the emergence of a regular and computable underlying structure. Our results suggest that Kolmogorov complexity may serve as tool for revealing changes in the dynamics of ecosystems close to ecological transitions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dental topography reflects diet accurately in several extant and extinct mammalian clades. However, dental topographic dietary reconstructions have high success rates only when closely related taxa are compared. Given the dietary breadth that exists among extant apes and likely existed among fossil hominins, dental topographic values from many species and subspecies of great apes are necessary for making dietary inferences about the hominin fossil record. Here, we present the results of one metric of dental topography, Dirichlet normal energy (DNE), for seven groups of great apes (Pongo pygmaeus pygmaeus, Pan paniscus, Pan troglodytes troglodytes and schweinfurthii, Gorilla gorilla gorilla, Gorilla beringei graueri and beringei). Dirichlet normal energy was inadequate at differentiating folivores from frugivores, but was adequate at predicting which groups had more fibrous diets among sympatric African apes. Character displacement analyses confirmed there is substantial dental topographic and relative molar size (M-1:M-2 ratio; length, width, and area) divergence in sympatric apes when compared to their allopatric counterparts, but character displacement is only present in relative molar size when DNE is also considered. Presence of character displacement is likely due to indirect competition over similar food resources. Assuming similar ecological conditions in the Plio-Pleistocene, the derived masticatory apparatuses of the robust australopiths and early Homo may be due to indirect competition over dietary resources between the taxa, causing dietary niche partitioning. Our results imply that dental topography cannot be used to predict dietary categories in fossil hominins without consideration of ecological factors, such as dietary and geographic overlap. In addition, our results may open new avenues for understanding the community compositions of early hominins and the formation of specific ecological niches among hominin taxa. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Proximate mechanisms underpinning between-individual variation in repeatedly expressed behaviours (animal personality) remain poorly understood. Recent theoretical models have focused on the concept of adaptive state-dependent behaviour, proposing that repeatable differences in behaviour emerge due to individual differences in repeatable state variables such as metabolic rate, age, sex or body size. Fewstudies have attempted to investigate the effect of state on personality empirically, and evidence for links between individual variation in state and personality remains equivocal. We used a captive colony of southern corroboree frogs, Pseudophryne corroboree, to (1) test for innate, temporally repeatable behavioural differences (animal personality) along the activity, exploration/avoidance and boldness/shyness behavioural axes, (2) test for behavioural syndromes (between-individual correlations between behavioural traits) and (3) determine whether behavioural traits are correlated with body size at the between-individual level. Individuals exhibited repeatable variation along all three behavioural axes, but between-individual correlations did not deviate from zero, providing no evidence for behavioural syndromes. Body size explained 40% of the between-individual variance in exploration behaviour, with larger frogs exhibiting greater mobility and travelling further in a novel environment. These associations indicate that there is potential for innate body size variation in P. corroboree to act as an important state variable underpinning repeatable between-individual behavioural differences. Future research may test this idea experimentally. Continued investigation of state-dependent individual behaviour in P. corroboree and other animals is likely to provide important insights into the proximate causes of animal personality.

AB Augmentations are used frequently to restore populations of conservation concern. Carnivores, in particular, are often targeted for augmentations, yet quantitative assessments of these efforts are rare. In Wisconsin, USA, American martens were reintroduced and subsequently augmented, yet remain state endangered. To evaluate this restoration effort, we sampled martens before and after augmentation, used genetic mark-recapture and parentage analyses to quantify stage-specific vital rates for each step of the augmentation, and assessed demographic viability with and without augmentation. Surprisingly, augmentation provided minimal genetic and demographic contributions, and persistence was instead driven by intrinsic population attributes such as recruitment. Our findings question augmentation as a primary restoration strategy for carnivores, and we urge conservation practitioners to focus on identifying and enhancing limiting population processes such as immigration and juvenile survival prior to using costly and controversial measures like augmentation.

AB The use of metals as biosignatures in the fossil stromatolite record requires understanding of the processes controlling the initial metal(loid) incorporation and diagenetic preservation in living microbialites. Here, we report the distribution of metals and the organic fraction within the lithifying microbialite of the hypersaline Big Pond Lake (Bahamas). Using synchrotron-based X-ray microfluorescence, confocal, and biphoton microscopies at different scales (cm-m) in combination with traditional geochemical analyses, we show that the initial cation sorption at the surface of an active microbialite is governed by passive binding to the organic matrix, resulting in a homogeneous metal distribution. During early diagenesis, the metabolic activity in deeper microbialite layers slows down and the distribution of the metals becomes progressively heterogeneous, resulting from remobilization and concentration as metal(loid)-enriched sulfides, which are aligned with the lamination of the microbialite. In addition, we were able to identify globules containing significant Mn, Cu, Zn, and As enrichments potentially produced through microbial activity. The similarity of the metal(loid) distributions observed in the Big Pond microbialite to those observed in the Archean stromatolites of Tumbiana provides the foundation for a conceptual model of the evolution of the metal distribution through initial growth, early diagenesis, and fossilization of a microbialite, with a potential application to the fossil record.

AB Organismal and community-wide responses of reef-building corals are documented before and after a severe cold-water thermal anomaly that occurred in 2010 in the Florida Keys, USA. In January 2010 seawater temperatures dropped far below the normal minima (to <11 degrees C), resulting in the largest documented coral mass mortality event ever recorded in the Florida Keys. Physiological measurements demonstrated species-specific thermal sensitivities to this environmental perturbation. Four common corals with narrow thermal tolerance, Acropora cervicornis, Orbicella annularis, O. faveolata, and Porites astreoides, sustained high mortality (>80%) on inshore reefs. In contrast, another common coral with a wide thermal tolerance, Siderastrea siderea, was not affected by this cold anomaly. We measured biomass, symbiotic algal densities (genus: Symbiodinium), chlorophyll a content, and maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II for reef-building corals on a seasonal basis before and after the 2010 cold anomaly. Our data document a clear correspondence between physiological response, biomass levels, and survivorship among these five scleractinian coral species. These physiological findings are mirrored by in-shore benthic community monitoring data, which show the dramatic loss of the three cold-sensitive species and continued survival of the cold-tolerant species. Finally, we document recruitment and survival rates of newly settled reef-building corals on four inshore reefs, which experienced high coral mortality during the 2010 cold-kill. Interestingly, both a cold-tolerant species, S. siderea, and a cold-intolerant species, P. astreoides, were the most abundant species recruiting to these postdisturbance reefs.

AB The response of dynamical systems to varying conditions and disturbances is a fundamental aspect of their analysis. In spatially extended systems, particularly in pattern-forming systems, there are many possible responses, including critical transitions, gradual transitions and locally confined responses. Here, we use the context of vegetation dynamics in drylands in order to study the response of pattern forming ecosystems to oscillating precipitation and local disturbances. We focus on two precipitation ranges, a bistability range of bare soil with a patterned vegetation state, and a bistability range of uniform vegetation with a patterned vegetation state. In these ranges, there are many different stable states, which allow for both abrupt and gradual transitions between the system states to occur. We find that large amplitude oscillations of the precipitation rate can lead to a collapse of the vegetation in one range, while in the other range, they result in the convergence to a patterned state with a preferred wavelength. In addition, we show that a series of local disturbances results in the collapse of the vegetation in one range, while it drives the system toward fluctuations around a finite average biomass in the other range. Moreover, it is shown that under certain conditions, local disturbances can actually increase the overall vegetation density. These significant differences in the system response are attributed to the existence of localized states in one of the bistability ranges. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although the study of coral reproduction has advanced tremendously over the last few decades, a particular gap exists in our knowledge of the reproductive modes of corals from 'mesophotic coral ecosystems' (MCEs) found at 30-150 m depth. Here, we report for the first time on the reproductive patterns, living cover, and survivorship under different light treatments of two scleractinian species from the MCEs of Eilat, Red-Sea: Alveopora allingi and A. ocellata. Both species are found exclusively within MCEs and are high in both abundance and relative cover. These species display a synchronous gametogenic cycles with consecutive oocyte growth and development. Peak of reproductive activity occurs in late summer (September-October), typified by accelerated oocyte growth, coinciding with the rise in seawater temperature. Estimates of fecundity show mean monthly maxima of 48.5 +/- 26.3 and 23.5 +/- 11.8 ( Mean +/- SE) oocytes per cm(2) for A. allingi and A. ocellata respectively, prior to spawning. A comparison of light and temperature regimes in the shallow vs. MCE environments is presented, and the response of these species to changes in these parameters is discussed. A call encouraging the much-needed studies on the sexuality and reproductive modes of MCE coral species is expressed.

AB Creating methods to achieve sustainable development is a global challenge faced by civilization in the 21st century. As an operational element of sustainability science, landscape sustainability science (LSS) plays an important role in the development of methods for sustainable development. Landscape services (LS) is a newly emerging concept associated with ecosystem services (ES) that exhibits great potential for promoting landscape sustainability research despite its nascent stage of development. In this article, the historical development of the LS concept is reviewed, and the special implications and advantages of LS relative to ES for landscape practices are further expanded. Furthermore, a sustainability-oriented LS conceptual framework specifically developed for the integration of LS and landscape sustainability research is proposed. We refer to this framework as the landscape service capability-flow-demand (LSCFD) framework. Finally, the prospects for the application of the new framework in landscape sustainability assessments are explored. By using LSCFD, we suggest that a distinction be made between landscape service capacity (LSC), landscape service flow (LSF), and landscape service demand (LSD). LSC refers to the long-term potential of a landscape for producing various types of materials, energy, information, conditions, and effectiveness that are valued by people. LSF refers to the transmission process for material, energy, information, conditions and effectiveness from a landscape to benefit people that occur either within or across the landscape. LSD is the societal dimension of LS and refers to the types and volume of material, energy, information, conditions, and effectiveness that a landscape's inhabitants need to satisfy their existence, livelihood, and development. Based on the LSCFD framework, landscape sustainability assessments can be performed by considering the following four areas: LSC sustainability, LSF sustainability, LSD sustainability, and the dynamic equilibrium relationships among the other three areas. Thus, various types of LS capabilities, integrated services capabilities, and the diversity and balance of LS demands should be evaluated. Additionally, analyzing the supplying regions of LS flow, spatial orientation of the population that benefits, transmission media, transmission mechanism, and transmission limiting factors is essential to explore the dynamic equilibrium relationships between LS capability, flow, and demand. The LSCFD concept framework of LS provides a method for implementing LSS into actual practice. In the context of global environmental changes and sustainable development, the LSCFD framework of LS will definitely contribute to future research.

AB Forecasting bifurcations such as critical transitions is an active research area of relevance to the management and preservation of ecological systems. In particular, anticipating the distance to critical transitions remains a challenge, together with predicting the state of the system after these transitions are breached. In this work, a new model-less method is presented that addresses both these issues based on monitoring recoveries from large perturbations. The approach uses data from recoveries of the system from at least two separate parameter values before the critical point, to predict both the bifurcation and the post-bifurcation dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated, and its performance evaluated under different levels of measurement noise, with two ecological models that have been used extensively in previous studies of tipping points and alternative steady states. The first one considers the dynamics of vegetation under grazing; the second, those of macrophyte and phytoplankton in shallow lakes. Applications of the method to more complex situations are discussed together with the kinds of empirical data needed for its implementation.

AB Body size (BS) varies in response to several selective pressures. In ectotherms, thermal inertia may affect thermoregulation, since larger BSs increase heat conservation as Bergmann originally stipulated for endotherms. However, Bergmann's rule is controversial in ectotherms. The heat balance hypothesis states that ectotherms' thermoregulatory capability is relevant for trends in BS. In cold climates, larger BSs would be advantageous for small thermoregulating ectotherms, by increasing heat conservation. However, BS implies a delaying effect on heating too; therefore, ectotherms may need another trait to compensate the later effect. Thermal melanism hypothesis posits that melanism increases heat gain, and may be adaptive for animals inhabiting cold climates. We propose that the higher solar radiation absorption from increased melanism may be such a compensatory trait. We expect BS and melanism to increase with latitude in response to seasonal temperatures and solar radiation. To test this, we studied the monophyletic Liolaemus goetschi group of lizard species across its 2200km (32-48 degrees S latitude) range. We used phylogenetically informed analyses to study geographic variation of BS and melanism (dorsal, ventral and total) in relation to temperatures, thermal amplitude, cloudiness and net solar radiation. Our results show that lizards' BS increases latitudinally in relation to thermal amplitude and temperature. Only ventral melanism varied latitudinally, but all melanism variables varied in response to cloudiness and net radiation. The relationship between BS and melanism was significant and positive in all cases. We suggest thermal inertia may be a fair candidate mechanism explaining geographic variation in BS (heat balance hypothesis), while melanism may influence heat gain according to the thermal melanism hypothesis. However, it remains unclear why latitudinal variation is related to ventral instead of dorsal melanism, and further investigation is needed to clarify the relationship between BS and melanism in light of cold climates.

AB The freshwater fauna (crustaceans, molluscs, fish) of many tropical islands in the Caribbean and Pacific share an amphidromous life-cycle, meaning their larvae need to develop in saline conditions before returning to freshwater as juveniles. This community dominates the freshwaters of much of the tropics, but is poorly known and at risk from development, in particular dam construction. Amphidromy can theoretically lead to dispersal between different freshwater areas, even to distant oceanic islands, via the sea. The extent and scale of this presumed dispersal, however, is largely unknown in the Caribbean. Recent genetic work in Puerto Rico has shown that many freshwater species have little or no population structure among different river catchments, implying high levels of connectivity within an island, whereas between-island structure is unknown. We used genetic techniques to infer the geographic scales of population structure of amphidromous invertebrates (a gastropod and a number of crustacean species) between distant parts of the Caribbean, in particular Puerto Rico, Panama and Trinidad. We found virtually no geographic population structure across over 2000km of open sea for these freshwater species. This implies that they are indeed moving between islands in sea currents as larvae, meaning that continued recruitment requires a continuum of healthy habitat from the freshwater to marine environment. We further discuss the role of amphidromy and suggest its ecological and biogeographic role may be more important than previously presumed. Resumen La fauna de agua dulce (crustaceos, moluscos, peces) de algunas islas tropicales en el Caribe y Pacifico comparte un ciclo de vida anfidromo, lo que significa que deben desarrollar sus larvas en condiciones salinas antes de volver al agua dulce como juveniles. Esta comunidad domina las aguas dulces de gran parte de los tropicos, pero es poco conocida y en riesgo de no poder continuar completando su ciclo vital, en particular, por a la construccion de represas. Debido a la relacion con el mar, este proceso de anfidromia teoricamente puede conducir a la dispersion entre las distintas areas de agua dulce a traves del el oceano, lo cual parece probable para islas oceanicas lejanas. Sin embargo, el alcance y la magnitud de esta aparente dispersion son desconocidos en el Caribe. Estudios geneticos recientes llevados a cabo en Puerto Rico mostraron que muchas especies de agua dulce tienen poca o ninguna estructura poblacional entre diferentes cuencas fluviales, lo que implica altos nivele de conectividad dentro de una isla, mientras que entre islas la estructura es desconocida. Nosotros utilizamos tecnicas geneticas para inferir las escalas geograficas de la estructura poblacional de invertebrados anfidromos (un gasteropodo y algunas especies de crustaceos) entre partes distantes del Caribe, en particular, Puerto Rico, Panama y Trinidad. No se encontro practicamente ninguna estructuracion geografica en las poblaciones separadas por mas de 2000km de mar abierto para estas especies de agua dulce. Esto implica que en realidad las diferentes poblaciones de estas especies estan en movimiento en forma de larvas entre islas mediante las corrientes marinas. La persistencia de un reclutamiento continuo de estas especies requiere la existencia de habitat saludable que mantenga la conexion entre los ecosistemas de agua dulce y marinos. Tambien discutimos el papel de la anfidromia y sugerimos que su papel ecologico y biogeografico puede ser mas importante de lo que se presume.

AB The effect of fishing on reproduction is typically quantified by computing the effects of changes in the species abundance and age structure on egg production. For broadcast spawners, reproduction also depends on the local spatial distribution of individuals. Broadcast spawners exhibit an Allee effect at low density: a decline in the fertilization of eggs, owing to increased distance between spawners. We present a method for assessing the likely impact of a fishery on broadcast spawners, based on gamete dispersion dynamics and individual spatial distributions. We use an individual-based model to simulate larval production over a range of uncertainties in dispersion characteristics. We illustrate our method for the red sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus franciscanus, fishery in northern California, USA. The density of red sea urchins varied over space (0.1-1.6.m(-2)), and indices of aggregation were highest at low densities. As gamete dispersion distances increased, larval production exhibited a more linear relationship with density. Average larval production in 1996-1998 was 33.8% of production near the inception of the fishery. After accounting for decreases in mean density, the fertilization Allee effect accounted for 21.7 +/- 4.1% of the decrease in larval production, and 45.2 +/- 21.7% if sea urchins were not aggregated.

AB The need to avert unacceptable and irreversible environmental change is the most urgent challenge facing society. Landscape ecology has the capacity to help address these challenges by providing spatially-explicit solutions to landscape sustainability problems. However, despite a large body of research, the real impact of landscape ecology on sustainable landscape management and planning is still limited. In this paper, we first outline a typology of landscape sustainability problems which serves to guide landscape ecologists in the problem-solving process. We then outline a formal problem-solving approach, whereby landscape ecologists can better bring about disciplinary integration, a consideration of multiple landscape functions over long time scales, and a focus on decision making. This framework explicitly considers multiple ecological objectives and socio-economic constraints, the spatial allocation of scarce resources to address these objectives, and the timing of the implementation of management actions. It aims to make explicit the problem-solving objectives, management options and the system understanding required to make sustainable landscape planning decisions. We propose that by adopting a more problem-solving approach, landscape ecologists can make a significant contribution towards realising sustainable future landscapes.

AB Few studies have considered how interactions between woody and herbaceous species change in direction or magnitude over time or with traits of the dominant woody species. We used a chronosequence approach to explore these interactions in a montane meadow in which Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. and Abies grandis (Dougl. ex. D. Don) Lindl. have established gradually over a period of >70 years. Effects of individual trees (18-73 years old) were quantified by comparing plant community structure and composition under and adjacent to each tree. Trees generally exerted negative effects on cover and richness of resident meadow species and positive effects on colonizing forest herbs. Despite the average decline of meadow species under the canopy, cover was elevated (compared with adjacent meadow) under 33% of trees - most often under younger Pinus. Cover (but not richness) of meadow species declined with tree age, but the rate and magnitude of this decline did not differ under Pinus or Abies. In contrast, the cover and richness of forest herbs increased steeply with age under Abies, but not under Pinus. Our results illustrate the potential for complex and sometimes unpredictable interactions between woody and herbaceous species. A dynamic view of these relationships is critical for understanding or predicting the consequences of woody plant establishment in grassland and other herb-dominated ecosystems.

AB The presence of the Mediterranean pond turtle Mauremys leprosa in the Ebre Delta (Catalonia, north-east Spain) is well documented after the late 1970s, when the first reptile distribution lists were published. Owing to the fact that the species was considered scarce, a reintroduction programme based on the release of individuals at sites with potential habitat suitability was launched. From 1999 to 2001, 234 turtles of different ages were released and subsequently monitored until 2007, in order to make a conservation diagnosis using five assessment criteria. These criteria were body condition, individual growth, reproduction, survival and population growth rate. Despite the relatively large number of turtles released, no viable population resulted from the programme. Assessment criteria suggested that: (1) released individuals showed good physical condition and satisfactory growth (the only positive results); (2) reproduction was almost absent; (3) local survival was reduced compared with that of Spanish wild populations of the species; (4) temporary emigration was high; (5) the growth rate of the population was negative. In conclusion, the results suggested that the habitat at the Ebre Delta marshes may not be favourable to the species, and that the scarce historical data record may indicate a relatively low-quality habitat; the few records may correspond to individuals dispersing from the river, a more suitable habitat. Thus, we conclude that historically scarce records may be the result of natural patchiness and heterogeneous distributions, and they are not necessarily a good indicator of relict, decimated populations. Good assessment criteria, as those proposed and used here, are necessary tools to assess results in reintroduction projects to recover endangered chelonian populations.

AB Honey bee foragers may collect nectar, pollen, water, or propolis, and their foraging specialization has been associated with several behavioral traits. By conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), we compared the performance of foragers that collected nectar, pollen, both nectar and pollen, or water in several learning and choice assays. Foragers were first tested in a three-trial olfactory associative learning assay. For further tests, we selected only good learners that responded in two out of three conditioning trials. One group was tested in an additional olfactory associative learning assay involving different reward volumes and concentrations. Another group was tested for risk sensitivity in a two-alternative forced-choice PER procedure and then in a latent inhibition (LI) assay. Levels of acquisition in olfactory associative learning were highest in pollen and water foragers, and better acquisition was associated with collection of heavier pollen loads and smaller and lighter nectar loads of lower sugar concentration. Among the good learners, pollen foragers still showed better acquisition than nectar foragers when rewarded with several volumes and concentrations of sucrose solution. Pollen and nectar foragers were equally risk averse, preferring a constant reward to a variable one, and choice was not affected by pollen load weight. Contrary to a previous study, pollen and nectar foragers were similarly affected by LI. We discuss possible explanations for the discrepancy between the two studies. Overall, our results suggest that differences between foraging groups in sensitivity to various stimuli may not correspond to differences in choice behavior.

AB Reintroductions often rely on captive-raised, naive animals that have not been exposed to the various threats present in natural environments. Wild animals entering new areas are timid and invest much time and effort in antipredator behavior. On the other hand, captive animals reared in predator-free conditions and in close proximity to humans may initially lack this tendency, but can reacquire some antipredator behavior over time. We monitored the changes in antipredator-related behaviors of 16 radio-collared Persian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) reintroduced to the Soreq Valley in Israel from 2 breeding facilities: one heavily visited by the public (The Biblical Zoo of Jerusalem, Israel) and the other with reduced human presence (Hai-Bar Carmel, Israel). We monitored each individual for up to 200 days after release, focusing on flush and flight distance, flight mode (running or walking), and use of cover. In addition, we compared fecal corticosterone (a stress-related hormone) from samples collected from known animals in the wild to samples collected in the breeding facilities. Reintroduced individuals from both origins exhibit increased flush distance over time; flush and flight distances were larger in individuals from Hai-Bar; use of cover increased with time, but was greater in Hai-Bar Carmel animals; corticosterone levels were significantly higher in fecal samples from reintroduced animals than in samples from captive animals; and Hai-Bar Carmel animals had an 80% survival rate over the 200 days, whereas no animals from the Biblical Zoo of Jerusalem survived. Reintroduced Persian fallow deer reacquired antipredator behaviors after the release, but the process was slow (months) and differences between conditions at the breeding facilities that were seemingly benign (e.g., number of visitors and other human related activities) influenced this process and consequently affected the success of the reintroduction. Captive breeding facilities for the purpose of reintroduction should minimize anthropogenic disturbances.

   its phytoplankton taxonomic size structure
SO JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY

   anthropogenic impact
ID LAKE KINNERET; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSEQUENCES; DYNAMICS
AB Due to the rapid and common deterioration of aquatic ecosystems, scientists and environmental protection organizations acutely need means capable of producing quantitative estimates for structural deformations of natural communities. Recently, very common biomass size spectra ignore community taxonomic composition, i.e., one of the most important kinds of biological information. Therefore, another very old, but rare in planktonology, method - the traditional taxonomic size spectrum (TTSS) - can be helpful. TTSS, a specific form of size-frequency distribution of taxonomic units, reveals repeating patterns of deep subalpine Logo Maggiore (Italy) phyloplankton taxonomic structure. The general TTSS pattern was safeguarded during 22 annual cycles (1984-2005), when many principal environmental characteristics were changed considerably during the lake oligotrophication. At the same time, the fine structure deformations of this pattern helped us divide the total oligotrophication process into several stages characterized by notable changes of TTSS peaks' proportions. These peak-height alterations were caused by pronounced changes in the species list and overall taxonomic diversity of the lake phytoplanklon. The average cell volume decline was found. It was significantly correlated with the total phosphorus descending trend This cell volume decline was produced by the addition of numerous species into the medium-and-small size fractions. Typical patterns of the stable and transitory stages were differentiated, which could be valuable for environmental protection and diagnostic applications. The central peak height difference between the stable and the transitory periods was statistically significant. Oligotrophication process decomposition into several more homogenous groups of years was supported by quantitative estimators produced by hierarchical cluster analysis. The highest level of the similarity measure (Pearson r) in pairs of annual TTSS was close to the respective estimates found for other lakes. Concomitantly, its minimal level, produced by a specific pair of abnormal years at the beginning and end of the studied process, was found previously only for pairs taken from two different ecosystems (Lakes Kinneret and Tahoe). This way, TTSS can be applied as a quantitative analysis means of the integral natural community structural evolution. Such tools are acutely needed for environmental management, monitoring, and theoretical ecology.

AB The stock index of the Iceland scallop (Chlamys islandica) in Breidafjordur on the west coast of Iceland has declined drastically in recent years. Total fishing mortality was very high throughout the study period from 1993 to 2003, a period characterized by a steady increase in summer sea surface temperature, in 2003 reaching the highest estimated level of the previous century. Between 1998 and 2005, estimates of chlorophyll a (food availability) fluctuated with periods of low chlorophyll followed by a reduction in muscle weight and high natural mortality. High levels of natural mortality were observed in the main fishing area in the southern part of Breidafjordur. There the stock index had been declining since 1994. Recruitment to the fishable stock was highly variable during the study period, with low recruitment towards the end of the 1990s. Subsequently the fishery has been on relatively few year classes, and the stock has been fragile because of several years of poor recruitment and high natural mortality. Consequently, the stock appeared unable to withstand the fishing pressure and declined to historically low levels, leading to a halt to fishing in 2004.

AB We used published data to calculate small-mammal species richness at 43 sites in North America to examine the response of species richness to increasing primary productivity. We estimated species richness for the entire community and for each of 4 functional groups (insectivore, granivore, herbivore, and omnivore). Total richness exhibited a significant unimodal relationship to increasing amounts of annual precipitation and was driven by granivores; this functional group exhibited the most pronounced decline in richness with high precipitation. We suggest that the decline in granivore richness is due to increased litter associated with increased productivity.

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS

DE resilience; stability; sustainability; pastures; beef
ID PERSISTENCE
AB In this paper we employ a simple dynamic simulation model to illustrate and extend the pasture envelope concept as an approach to characterising the stability, resilience and sustainability of pasture-based beef grazing enterprises. The pasture envelope is a form of phase diagram in which the trajectories over time of key biophysical variables such as pasture biomass and composition are graphed against critical thresholds established on the basis of pasture growth rates and livestock growth requirements. We extend the concept to incorporate key financial variables such as cash flow and critical financial thresholds. The model simulates a steer fattening enterprise based on a phalaris and sub-clover pasture in the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. The model incorporates pasture growth and senescence for the two pasture species with competition between the species for soil nutrients and light, preferential grazing of the two species by the livestock with livestock growth based on pasture consumption. The model incorporates a variety of decision rules for rotating livestock among multiple paddocks. The model did not simulate changes in soil nutrients. Scaling the seasonal growth pattern of the pasture species captured the influence of rainfall and temperature on pasture growth.
   Two sets of simulations were run to illustrate the use of the pasture envelope concept to explore the economic and biological stability and resilience of the pasture system. The first set was designed to explore the financial and biological stability of the enterprise and involved simulating the impact of different stocking rates and rotation period on pasture production and composition, and cash flow. The second set of simulations was designed more to explore the resilience of the enterprise and involved introducing shocks to the enterprise in the form of 'droughts' of varying strengths. This was achieved by, for example, reducing the maximum growth rate for both pasture species by 50% but maintaining the same seasonal pattern in the maximum growth rates of each species. The first simulation showed that at low stocking rates the enterprise was biologically stable, but cash flow was also low. Increasing stocking rates increased the cash flow, but also reduced the biological stability of the pasture until at very high stocking rates the pasture system collapsed. Changing the rotation period also affected the stability of the enterprise. In situations where the rotation period was very long, greater than 120 days (or 20 days/paddock), the biological system became unsustainable due to detrimental changes in pasture composition. The enterprise was somewhat resilient to drought at stocking rates less than 1 steer/ha. At stocking rates of I steer/ha, the enterprise was economically and biologically unsustainable in moderate or severe droughts. At a stocking rate of 1.25 steers/ha, the enterprise was unsustainable for droughts of any severity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Because the interests of mutualists are not perfectly aligned, conflicts between partners often arise, rendering mutualism unstable by allowing the evolution of cheating. The dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis is engaged in a nursery pollination mutualism with a specific weevil Derelomus chamaeropsis. In exchange for pollen dispersal, dwarf palms provide pollinators with food, shelter and egg-laying sites, but pollinators can develop only within male inflorescences. Here we show that weevils lay eggs in female inflorescences but processes associated with fruit development prevent larval development. The cost imposed by developing larvae probably differs between male and female plants, explaining why only females defend their inflorescences. Female palms thus cheat their pollinating weevil, and pollinators are expected to 'punish' (avoid) them. We found no evidence for such punishment: weevils visit female plants and the duration of visits to male and female inflorescences does not differ. Thus mutualists do not always co-operate and cheating may not be necessarily punished.

TI Dietary choices of siganid fish at Shiqmona Reef, Israel

DT Article
ID RED-SEA; LURIDUS
AB The diet of two Erythrean algivorous siganid fish, Siganus rivulatus and S. luridus, was studied off the Shiqmona vermetid reef, south of Haifa Bay, Israel, in conjunction with the spatial and seasonal variability in composition of the local algal community. The algae identified from the gut contents of reef-dwelling siganid populations indicate that both species feed on the vermetid reef platform, especially in spring. In June, green algae made up 66% of the gut contents of S. rivulatus, whereas brown algae made up 69% of the gut contents of S. luridus. In October, brown algae constituted 90% and 95% of the diet of S. rivulatus and S. luridus, respectively. This is the first record of S. rivulatus feeding on and selecting large amounts of this brown, coarse, leaf-like algae along the Mediterranean coast of Israel.
   During spring the food niche overlap (Renkonen's measure) was ca. 36%, whereas during autumn it was ca. 80%. The results suggest that in reef-dwelling siganids, weakening of dietary niche-partitioning occurs when the preferred algae are scarce.

AB We studied the rates of seed removal by different granivores, in different microsites, at different times, in a Patagonian shrub steppe in South America, Grainvory rates of exotic (Phalaris canariensis) and native (Mulinum spinosion) seed species were all order of magnitude lower than those reported for another cool desert from North America with comparable climatic conditions. Insects and rodents removed the greatest amount of seeds in comparison to birds. In general, there were no differences in seed removal across microsites, except at one sampling time (when rodents and insects removed more seeds from bare soil and beside tussocks in comparison to positions beside shrubs, while birds took similar amounts of seeds from all microsites). The length of the experiment differentially affected the granivory rate of different groups. Removal rates (per day) were significantly greater, arid exhibited lower variability, when seeds were left for a longer period of time in the field (a month) than for a few days. Insects were more efficient at finding the seeds rapidly and rodents at depleting them; birds could not find or deplete many seeds in short periods of time. Rates of granivory decreased slightly but significantly as the Summer progressed mainly due to a reduction of seed removal by birds and rodents but not by insects. Granivores removed an order of magnitude less native seeds than exotic seeds. These differences seemed to be related to palatability its M. spinosum seeds have more phenols, toxic concentrations of iron and copper, and lower dry matter digestibility, phosphorous, and nitrogen content, ill comparison to P. canariensis seeds.

AB Evidence is presented for the occurrence of alternative stable states in a wet calcareous dune slack on the Frisian island of Texel, The Netherlands. An early pioneer stage (0.5 ka m(-2) total standing crop) and a more productive later successional stage (2.9 kg m(-2)) occur side by side, with sharp boundaries between them. The pioneer vegetation has been recorded at the site for more than 62 yr. These features indicate the occurrence of a positive-feedback mechanism that has led to alternative stable states.
   Analyses of ground and surface water composition, and decalcification depths, indicated that hydrologically the study site can be characterized as a flow-through slack, with exfiltration of calcareous groundwater on one side and infiltration of surface water on the other side of the slack. These differences in hydrological conditions have led to distinct differences in environmental conditions within the dune slack. The occurrence of the two successional stages can, however, not be explained by differences in hydrological conditions since both stages occur side by side in the centre of the dune slack. It is, therefore, more likely that biotic interactions are the cause of the vegetation pattern. Three possible mechanisms for feedback processes are discussed: (1) enhanced nitrogen loss; (2) sulfide toxicity and (3) nutrient accumulation in internal cycle.

   ORIGIN; NUMBERS; EGGS
AB We present a simple analytical model to investigate the conditions for the evolution of obligate interspecific brood parasitism in birds, based on clutch size optimization, when birds can lay more eggs than their optimal clutch size. The results show that once intraspecific parasitism has appeared (i.e., females start to spread their eggs over their own and other nests) the evolutionarily stable number of eggs laid in its own nest decreases. Two possible ESSs exist: (1) either the evolutionarily stable number of eggs laid in its own nest is larger than zero, and a fraction of the total number of eggs is laid parasitically (i.e., intraspecific parasitism); and (2) either the evolutionarily stable number of eggs laid in its own nest is zero and all eggs are laid parasitically Since all females lay parasitically, this could favor the evolution of obligate interspecific brood parasitism. The key parameter allowing the shift from intraspecific to obligate interspecific parasitism is the intensity of density-dependent mortality within broods (i.e., nestling competition). Strong nestling competition, as in altricial species, can lead to an ESS where all eggs are laid parasitically: Altricial species are, therefore, predicted to evolve more easily toward obligate interspecific parasitism than precocial species. These predictions fit the observed distribution of brood parasitism in birds, where only one species out of 95 obligate interspecific parasites exhibits a precocial mode of development. Different nestling survival functions provided similar findings (i.e., obligate brood parasitism is more likely to evolve in altricial species), suggesting that these results are robust with respect to the main assumption of the model.

AB The irregular occurrence of high rates of nitrification (nitrification events) in the upper waters of a nitrogen polluted urban lake, Onondaga Lake. NY, during the fall mixing period is documented. The analysis is supported by eight years (1988-1995) of measurements of total ammonia (T-NH3) and oxidized forms of N (NOx) in the lake and its inflows, and dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature profiles. A tested system-specific mass balance model for N is used to estimate nitrification rates for these years, and a system-specific DO model is applied to demonstrate the impact of a nitrification event on the lake's oxygen resources for a single year. Rates of nitrification for different years ranged from near zero throughout the fall mixing interval (1994) to an average of about 0.18 d(-1) for one month (1995). The nitrification events cause major interannual variations observed in the pools of T-NH3 and NOx in the lake's upper waters in fall, and are probably responsible for the particularly severe lake-wide depletion of DO observed in certain years during this interval. Nitrification was the dominant loss process for T-NH3 and source for NOx in years that the events occurred. The exacerbating effect of the events on the oxygen resources of the lake needs to be accommodated in related remediation efforts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.

AB Occurrences of densely packed benthic organisms in extant reefs are of two types: 1) live-live interactions, where two living organisms interact, and 2) live-dead associations, where only one is alive and uses the other as a substrate. The latter are common in reef deposits due to biostratinomic feedback, i.e. dense skeletal accumulations provide hard substrates for clonal recruitment, thus facilitating greater frequency of live-dead encounters than in lower biomass level-bottom communities dominated by solitary organisms. Differentiating between these two types in ancient reefs is difficult, often impossible.
   Most live-live interactions among clones in extant reef communities involve competition for space. Clonal spatial competition is divisible into four types: 1) direct-aggressive: encrusting overgrowth; 2) indirect-passive: depriving neighbors of resources, chiefly sunlight, by growth above them; 3) stand-off: avoidance of competition by organisms adopting positions that avoid or minimize direct polyp/zooid contact; and 4) overwhelming: one clone/ species volumetrically or numerically overwhelms the other, meeting minimal resistance. Despite class-order level differences in taxa, our results indicate that extant analogs, based on the arrangement and distortion of skeletons, are valuable for recognizing live-live interactions in Silurian and Carboniferous reefs and interpreting the types of spatial competition represented.
   Comparison of overhead (plan) views of live-live coral competition in Polynesian reefs with vertical sections of Silurian and Carboniferous sponge-dominated reefs and biostromes suggests that direct-aggressive competition is more common among extant than among Paleozoic reef-builders. Stand-offs showing clone margin distortion and overwhelming with minor skeletal distortion are most common in our fossil examples and probably relate to the dominance of these reefs by sponges. Success by extant sponges in spatial competition is largely due to allelochemical deterrence which may explain the predominance of stand-off and overwhelming confrontations in fossil sponges rather than tentacle-mesentery based direct aggression among extant corals and bryozoans.

AB The effects of invertebrate predation on seasonal changes in abundance, species composition, and sizes of microcrustacea were examined in the littoral zone of a fishless lake (Jack Lake). Observational studies revealed that most epiphytic, benthic, and zooplanktonic copepods had two generations during the ice-free season, with maximum numbers of adults in June-july and October-November. Densities of most species of Cladocera peaked in June-July and September-October, with low numbers in August. Qualitative examination of cladoceran birth rates suggested that seasonal abundance was most affected by changes in population loss rates. Similar data in other studies have been interpreted as evidence of seasonal changes in predation mortality. Further examination of predator-prey relationships in Jack Lake, however, failed to provide evidence that invertebrate predators strongly affected littoral microcrustacea. Gut content analyses and abundance estimates indicated that copepods, tanypod chironomids, odonates, and water mites were the most important predators of littoral microcrustacea. With the exception of instar-4 Ablabesmyia sp., seasonal changes in the densities of these predators were not negatively correlated with microcrustacean abundance. Manipulations of densities of large odonates, small odonates, tanypod chironomids, and adult water mites in enclosures provided no evidence of strong predator effects on microcrustacean community structure. Taken together, the observational and experimental data suggested that the seasonal dynamics of littoral microcrustacea were not strongly affected by invertebrate predators.

AB Canopy-forming kelps are foundational species in coastal ecosystems, fixing tremendous amounts of carbon, yet we know little about the ecological and physiological determinants of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release by kelps. We examined DOC release by the bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, in relation to carbon fixation, nutrient uptake, tissue nitrogen content, and light availability. DOC release was approximately 3.5 times greater during the day than at night. During the day, N. luetkeana blades released an average of 16.2% of fixed carbon as DOC. Carbon fixation increased with light availability but DOC release did not, leading to a lower proportion of fixed carbon released as DOC at high light levels. We found no relationship between carbon fixation and DOC release rates measured concurrently. Rather, DOC release by N. luetkeana blades declined with marginal significance as blade tissue nitrogen content increased and with experimental nitrate addition, supporting the role of stoichiometric relationships in DOC release. Using a stable isotope (C-13) tracer method, we demonstrated that inorganic carbon is rapidly fixed and released by N. luetkeana blades as (DOC)-D-13, within hours. However, recently fixed carbon ((DOC)-D-13) comprised less than 20% of the total DOC released, indicating that isotope studies that rely on tracer production alone may underestimate total DOC release, as it is decoupled from recent kelp productivity. Comparing carbon and nitrogen assimilation dynamics of the annual kelp N. luetkeana with the perennial kelp Macrocystis pyrifera revealed that N. luetkeana had significantly higher carbon fixation, DOC production and nitrogen uptake rates per unit dry mass. Both kelp species were able to perform light-independent carbon fixation at night. Carbon fixation by the annual kelp N. luetkeana is as high as 2.35 kg C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), but an average of 16% of this carbon (376 g C center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) is released as DOC. As kelp forests are increasingly viewed as vehicles for carbon sequestration, it is important to consider the fate of this substantial quantity of DOC released by canopy-forming kelps.

AB Long-term phytoplankton community changes indicate the trophic status under nutrient regulation conditions in eutrophic lakes, although the modulatory role of climate change scenarios in their indicative function has been underestimated. Hence, we analyzed the relative contributions of nutrient and climate factors to interannual and seasonal variations in the phytoplankton biomass and composition from 1992 to 2017 in Meiliang Bay, Lake Taihu, China. Discrete phytoplankton communities from five periods were classified according to their interannual features. Variations in the phytoplankton community composition were observed during the five periods, and these variations included a shift from exclusive cyanobacterial dominance before 2008 to diatom-cyanobacterial codominance in 2008-2010 and from cyanobacterial dominance in 2011-2014 to cyanobacterial-diatom codominance in 2015-2017. The phytoplankton biomass pattern typically peaked in summer, although peaks also occurred in winter 2008-2010 and autumn 2011-2014. Additionally, the phytoplankton biomass increased by threefold from 2015 to 2017, which might have been related to rising air temperatures and greater light availability. The variance in the phytoplankton community was significantly explained by nutrient (ammonium, nitrate and phosphate) and climatic (air temperature and wind speed) factors. However, the explaining effect of the factors varied among the five periods: nutrients strongly impacted the community composition from 1992 to 2007, whereas climatic variables became more important modulators after 2007. These results reveal that climatic factors play importance roles in shaping the phytoplankton community and cyanobacterial blooms and suggest that differences in the roles between specific climatic conditions should be considered. Future declines in cyanobacterial blooms require further dual nitrogen and phosphorus reduction and longer recovery times under current climate change scenarios in this and possibly other shallow eutrophic lakes.

AB Fire corals of the hydrocoral genus Millepora provide an important ecological role as framework builders of coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic. Recent works have demonstrated the incongruence between molecular data and the traditional taxonomy of Millepora spp. based on overall skeleton growth form and pores. In an attempt to establish a reliable and standardized approach for defining species boundaries in Millepora, we focused on those from the Red Sea. In this region, three species are currently recognized: the fan-shaped branching M. dichotoma, the blade-like M. platyphylla, and the massive/encrusting M. exaesa. A total of 412 colonies were collected from six localities. Two mitochondrial marker genes (COI and 16S rDNA) were sequenced to obtain phylogeny reconstructions and haplotype networks. Eight morphological traits of pores and the nematocysts of both polyp and eumedusoid stages were measured to determine whether significant morphological differences occur among the three species. Both markers clearly resolved M. dichotoma, M. platyphylla, and M. exaesa as distinct, monophyletic lineages in the Red Sea. Nevertheless, they also revealed deep genetic breaks with Southwestern Indian Ocean populations of the three species. In the Red Sea, the three species were further distinguished based on their pore and nematocyst features. A discriminant analysis revealed dactylopore density, number of dactylopores per gastropore, dactylopore distance, and gastropore diameter as the most informative discriminative characters. The heteronemes, the large and small stenoteles of polyps, and the distribution of mastigophores of eumedusoids also showed significant interspecific differences. An integrated morpho-molecular approach proved to be decisive in defining species boundaries of Millepora supported by a combination of pore and nematocyst characters, which may be phylogenetically informative.

AB Conservation actions are critical to mitigating the growing number of threatened species worldwide. Previous studies show a consistent increase in one highly targeted type of conservation action: conservation translocation (i.e. the movement of species for conservation purposes). Will this trend continue? To gain insights into effectiveness and future trends, we examined past and proposed uses of conservation translocation in species recovery efforts in Canada, where species are assessed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada and given legal protection and recovery plans under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). Our review of 541 SARA listed species indicates 55 have already been translocated, 49 are recommended for translocation, and 99 are under consideration, suggesting at least a doubling in future conservation translocations. Overall, translocation was relevant to recovery efforts for 38% of SARA-listed species. Species in need of translocation overwhelmingly belong to the vascular plants, but relatively few plants have been translocated to date, suggesting capacity and expertise in plant propagation and transplantation will be important. Species listed as Endangered under SARA were most commonly translocated, but the effectiveness of translocations relative to other actions could not be assessed due to insufficient detail in Federal recovery documents. Our finding that conservation translocations are projected to increase substantially in Canada begs the question whether such trends will also occur in other countries, and whether alignment between conservation need, policy direction, scientific planning and financial commitments will be sufficient to meet such demand.

AB Aim: To test long-standing theory on the role of environmental conditions (both mean and predictability) in shaping global patterns in the egg sizes of marine fishes.
   Location: Global (50 degrees S to 50 degrees N).
   Time period: 1880 to 2015.
   Major taxa studied: Marine fish.
   Methods: We compiled the largest geo-located dataset of marine fish egg size (diameter) to date (n=1,078 observations; 192 studies; 288 species; 242 localities). We decomposed sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a time series into mean and predictability (seasonality and colour of environmental noise - i.e. how predictable the environment is between consecutive time steps), and used these as predictors of egg size in a Bayesian phylogenetic hierarchical model. We test four specific hypotheses based on the classic discussion by Rass (1941), as well as contemporary life-history theory, and the conceptual model of Winemiller and Rose (1992).
   Results: Both environmental mean and predictability correlated with egg size. Our parsimonious model indicated that egg size decreases by c. 2.0-fold moving from 1 to 30 degrees C. Environments that were more seasonal with respect to temperature were associated with larger eggs. Increasing mean chlorophyll-a, from 0.1 to 1 mg/m(3), was associated with a c. 1.3-fold decrease in egg size. Lower chlorophyll-a seasonality and reddened noise were also associated with larger egg sizes - aseasonal but more temporally autocorrelated resource regimes favoured larger eggs.
   Main conclusions: Our findings support results from Rass (1941) and some predictions from Winemiller and Rose (1992). The effects of environmental means and predictability on marine fish egg size are largely consistent with those observed in marine invertebrates with feeding larvae, suggesting that there are important commonalities in how ectotherm egg size responds to environmental change. Our results further suggest that anthropogenically mediated changes in the environment will have profound effects on the distribution of marine life histories.

ID SYSTEMS; DISEASE
AB The world's rural poor rely heavily on their immediate natural environment for subsistence and suffer high rates of morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. We present a general framework for modelling subsistence and health of the rural poor by coupling simple dynamic models of population ecology with those for economic growth. The models show that feedbacks between the biological and economic systems can lead to a state of persistent poverty. Analyses of a wide range of specific systems under alternative assumptions show the existence of three possible regimes corresponding to a globally stable development equilibrium, a globally stable poverty equilibrium and bistability. Bistability consistently emerges as a property of generalized disease-economic systems for about a fifth of the feasible parameter space. The overall proportion of parameters leading to poverty is larger than that resulting in healthy/wealthy development. All the systems are found to be most sensitive to human disease parameters. The framework highlights feedbacks, processes and parameters that are important to measure in studies of rural poverty to identify effective pathways towards sustainable development.

AB Modern phototrophic microbial mats are complex communities often used as analogs of major Precambrian ecosystems. Characterizing biotic, notably metabolic, interactions among different microbial mat members is essential to gain insights into the ecology and biogeochemistry of these systems. We applied 16S/18S rRNA metabarcoding approaches to characterize the structure of archaea, bacteria and protist communities from microbial mats collected along strong physicochemical (oxygen, salinity, temperature, depth) gradients in a shallow pond at the salar de Llamara (Chile). All mats were highly diverse, including members of virtually all known high-rank eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa but also many novel lineages. Bacterial candidate divisions accounted for almost 50% of sequences in deeper mats, while Archaea represented up to 40% of sequences in some mat layers. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed six novel deeply divergent archaeal groups, along abundant and diverse Pacearchaeota and Woesearchaeota. Multivariate statistical analyses showed that local environmental conditions strongly influenced community composition. Co-occurrence network structure was markedly different between surface mats located in the oxygenated zone and mats located in transition and anoxic water layers. We identified potential biotic interactions between various high-and low-rank taxa. Notably, a strong positive correlation was observed between Lokiarchaeota and the poorly known candidate bacterial division TA06.

AB Understanding landscape heterogeneity is essential for developing reliable landscape planning and design methods. Nevertheless, despite the many advances made in recent years regarding the analysis of landscape heterogeneity, methods that produce useful results that can be applied to design, planning and management schemes are still required. In this study, we explore the use of the Quadratic Entropy Index (Q) as a measure of landscape heterogeneity. Although the Q metric is derived from information theory, the inclusion of a dissimilarity component in the calculation enables analysis beyond the syntactic content of the information and the inclusion of semantic content. Adoption of a multiscale approach to the calculation fulfils the desirable characteristics for a heterogeneity measure, while also producing spatially-explicit results. Application of the index to three landscape areas in NW Spain with different characteristics clearly demonstrated the capacity of the index to differentiate levels of heterogeneity, and their dependence on scale, and to detect scale invariance. The close fit of Weibull II logistic regression enables prediction of pattern-scale relationships beyond the area of analysis. The findings show that Q is a potentially useful support tool for design, planning and management procedures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A major source of airborne pollution in arid and semi-arid environments (i.e. North Africa, Middle East, Central Asia, and Australia) is the fugitive particulate matter (fPM), which is a frequent product of wind erosion. However, accurate determination of fPM is an ongoing scientific challenge. The objective of this study is to examine (PM emissions from the loose Calcisols (i.e. soils with a substantial accumulation of secondary carbonates), owing to construction activities that can be frequently seen nowadays in arid urbanizing regions such as the Middle East. A two months field campaign was conducted at a construction site, at rest, within the city of Doha (Qatar) to measure number concentrations of PM over a size range of 0.25-32 mu m using light scattering based monitoring stations. The (PM emission fluxes were calculated using the Fugitive Dust Model (FDM) in an iterative manner and were fitted to a power function, which expresses the wind velocity dependence. The power factors were estimated as 1.87, 1.65, 2.70 and 2.06 for the four different size classes of particles <= 2.5, 2.5-6, 6-10 and <= 10 mu m, respectively. Fitted power function was considered acceptable given that adjusted R-2 values varied from 0.13 for the smaller particles and up to 0.69 for the larger ones. These power factors are in the same range of those reported in the literature for similar sources. The outcome of this study is expected to contribute to the improvement of PM emission inventories by focusing on an overlooked but significant pollution source, especially in dry and arid regions, and often located very close to residential areas and sensitive population groups. Further campaigns are recommended to reduce the uncertainty and include more (PM sources (e.g. earthworks) and other types of soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Didelphis albiventris and D. aurita are Neotropical marsupials that share a unique evolutionary history and both are largely distributed throughout South America, being primarily allopatric throughout their ranges. In the Araucaria moist forest of Southern Brazil these species are sympatric and they might potentially compete having similar ecology. For this reason, they are ideal biological models to address questions about ecological character displacement and how closely related species might share their geographic space. Little is known about how two morphologically similar species of marsupials may affect each other through competition, if by competitive exclusion and competitive release. We combined ecological niche modeling and geometric morphometrics to explore the possible effects of competition on their distributional ranges and skull morphology. Ecological niche modeling was used to predict their potential distribution and this method enabled us to identify a case of biotic exclusion where the habit generalist D. albiventris is excluded by the presence of the specialist D. aurita. The morphometric analyses show that a degree of shape discrimination occurs between the species, strengthened by allometric differences, which possibly allowed them to occupy marginally different feeding niches supplemented by behavioral shift in contact areas. Overlap in skull morphology is shown between sympatric and allopatric specimens and a significant, but weak, shift in shape occurs only in D. aurita in sympatric areas. This could be a residual evidence of a higher past competition between both species, when contact zones were possibly larger than today. Therefore, the specialist D. aurita acts a biotic barrier to D. albiventris when niche diversity is not available for coexistence. On the other hand, when there is niche diversification (e.g. habitat mosaic), both species are capable to coexist with a minimal competitive effect on the morphology of D. aurita.

AB Success of vertebrate translocations is crucial to improve efficacy and efficiency of conservation actions but it is often difficult to assess because negative results (failed translocations) are seldom published. We developed surveys and sent them to heads of conservation services in three major Spanish Mediterranean regions. The purpose of our surveys was to determine which methodological factor, that could easily be implemented in practice, was more influential for translocation success. These factors included the origin of translocated individuals (captive or wild) and translocation effort (propagule size and program duration). After analyzing 83 programs, corresponding to 34 different vertebrate species, by means of generalized linear mixed modelling, we found that 'origin' was more relevant for translocation success than 'effort', although we could not rule out some role of translocation effort. Variance in success of translocation programs involving individuals from wild sources was smaller and consequently results more predictable. Origin interacted with taxa so that success was higher when using wild birds and especially wild fish and mammals, but not when releasing reptiles. Hence, we suggest that, for any given effort, translocation results will be better for most vertebrate taxa if individuals from wild sources are used. When this is not feasible, managers should release captive-reared individuals for a long number of years rather than a short number of years.

AB This study compared prolonged swimming performance (U-crit) between male and female Danio rerio, and characterized how body shape was associated with this performance measure in each sex. When swimming in small (n=6) mixed-sex groups at 28 degrees C, males swam, on average, over 10cms(-1) faster than females despite being significantly smaller. Body shape was sexually dimorphic, with males and females exhibiting small, but statistically significant differences in most aspects of body shape. Body shape explained 18 and 43% of the variation in U-crit among males and females. In general, effects of body shape on swimming performance appeared to be sex limited, whereby different aspects of body shape affected performance in each sex, although the contribution of the distance between pelvic and anal fins to swimming performance was weakly sexually antagonistic.

AB Bergmann's rule-the tendency for body size to increase in colder environments-remains controversial today, despite 150 years of research. Considerable debate has revolved around whether the rule applies within or among species. However, this debate has generally not considered that clade-level relationships are caused by both intra-and interspecific effects. In this article, we implement a novel approach that allows for the separation of intra-and interspecific components of trait-environment relationships. We apply this approach to body size clines in two Caribbean clades of Anolis lizards and discover that their similar body size gradients are constructed in very different ways. We find inverse Bergmann's clines-high-elevation lizards are smaller bodied-for both the cybotes clade on Hispaniola and the sagrei clade on Cuba. However, on Hispaniola, the inverse cline is driven by interspecific differences, whereas intraspecific variation is responsible for the inverse cline on Cuba. Our results suggest that similar body size clines can be constructed through differing evolutionary and ecological processes, namely, through local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity (intraspecific clines) and/or size-ordered spatial sorting (interspecific clines). We propose that our approach can help integrate a divided research program by focusing on how the combined effects of intra-and interspecific processes can enhance or erode clade-level relationships at large biogeographic scales.

AB Geographical body size variation has long interested evolutionary biologists, and a range of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed patterns. It is considered to be more puzzling in ectotherms than in endotherms, and integrative approaches are necessary for testing non-exclusive alternative mechanisms. Using lacertid lizards as a model, we adopted an integrative approach, testing different hypotheses for both sexes while incorporating temporal, spatial, and phylogenetic autocorrelation at the individual level. We used data on the Spanish Sand Racer species group from a field survey to disentangle different sources of body size variation through environmental and individual genetic data, while accounting for temporal and spatial autocorrelation. A variation partitioning method was applied to separate independent and shared components of ecology and phylogeny, and estimated their significance. Then, we fed-back our models by controlling for relevant independent components. The pattern was consistent with the geographical Bergmann's cline and the experimental temperature-size rule: adults were larger at lower temperatures (and/or higher elevations). This result was confirmed with additional multi-year independent data-set derived from the literature. Variation partitioning showed no sex differences in phylogenetic inertia but showed sex differences in the independent component of ecology; primarily due to growth differences. Interestingly, only after controlling for independent components did primary productivity also emerge as an important predictor explaining size variation in both sexes. This study highlights the importance of integrating individual-based genetic information, relevant ecological parameters, and temporal and spatial autocorrelation in sex-specific models to detect potentially important hidden effects. Our individual-based approach devoted to extract and control for independent components was useful to reveal hidden effects linked with alternative non-exclusive hypothesis, such as those of primary productivity. Also, including measurement date allowed disentangling and controlling for short-term temporal autocorrelation reflecting sex-specific growth plasticity.

AB Environmental noise can be an important selective force modulating signal evolution in species with acoustic communication. Many anuran species breed alongside streams; hence, the sound produced by the flowing water is an important source of noise for acoustic communication. Since calling is physiologically very expensive in anurans, and communication is essential for reproduction, we expected adaptations that reduce environmental masking effects and allow acoustic communication in streamside breeders. This basic assumption of the acoustic adaptation hypothesis has not been yet evaluated at a large phylogenetic scale. We combined ahistorical and phylogenetic methods to test whether anuran species that breed alongside streams call at higher frequencies than species that breed away from streams. We compiled primary and secondary data on body size, breeding habitat, and the dominant frequency of the advertisement call for 110 species; 40 of them breed alongside streams and 70 away from streams. Call frequency was slightly higher and body size was significantly smaller in streamside breeding species. After controlling for the effects of body size and phylogenetic signal, only differences in body size persisted between species breeding at both kinds of habitats. Our data suggest that habitat filtering rather than acoustic adaptation explains the high call frequency of stream breeders. Species with large body size, pleiotropically constrained to utter low-frequency calls, would have succeeded less often in establishing viable populations alongside streams, due to the masking effect of low-frequency noise. Thus, small species calling at relatively high frequencies would be more common there. Although our data do not preclude adaptations to noisy habitats in some anuran species, they do not provide support for the acoustic adaptation hypothesis at a wider phylogenetic scale.

AB Interactions between desert vegetation and erosive forces are prominent and are part of landscape evolution in deserts. The role of annual herbaceous plants in these processes is usually overlooked. Likewise, the interactions and relative contributions of the different erosive forces are rarely studied.
   We examined the effects of mound-forming shrubs and annual plants on sediment dispersal at small spatial scales in the semi-arid shrubland of the northern Negev Desert of Israel. We conducted a field experiment to test the displacement of dyed sediment by wind, runoff and rain splash in 5 x 5 cm areas on shrub-mounds, placed under the canopy and on mound margins, and on the biological soil crust-covered intershrub space. As experimental treatments, we used artificial rain covers and removal of annuals and their litter.
   We found that I) most sediment displacement was caused by rain splash, which was effectively reduced by shrub canopy and less so by annual plant cover, and 2) runoff effects were limited to a fraction of rain events, took place only in the intershrub space, and were significantly reduced by annual plants and their litter. The combined effect of shrubs, annuals, and litter on sediment movement was significantly stronger than the effect of any single element.
   Accordingly, we conclude that, in addition to shrubs, herbaceous annual plants play a significant role in shrub-mound growth and maintenance, and thus also, in erosion control and vegetation pattern formation in dryland landscapes. Since herbaceous plants enhance mound formation, which in turn enhances shrub growth, our findings are further evidence of the crucial feedback interactions that are central to understanding ecosystem functioning, dynamics and pattern formation in water-limited ecosystems.

AB Flower characteristics have been traditionally considered relatively constant within species. However, there are an increasing number of examples of variation in flower characteristics. In this study, we examined the variation in attracting and rewarding flower characters at several ecological levels in a metapopulation of Pyrus bourgaeana in the Doana area (SW Spain). We answered the following questions: what are the variances of morphological and nectar characters of flowers? How important are intra-individual and inter-individual variance in flower characters? Are there microgeographical differences in flower characters? And if so, are they consistent between years? In 2008 and 2009, we sampled flowers of 72 trees from five localities. For six flower morphological and two nectar characteristics, we calculated coefficients of variation (CV). The partitioning of total variation among-localities, among-individuals, and within-individuals was estimated. To analyze differences among localities and their consistency between years, we conducted generalized linear mixed models. The CVs of nectar characters were always higher than those of morphological characters. As expected, inter-individual variation was the main source of variation of flower morphology, but nectar characters had significant variation at both intra- and inter-individual levels. For most floral traits, there were no differences among localities. Our study documents that variation is a scale-dependent phenomenon and that it is essential to consider intra- and inter-individual variance when investigating the causes and consequences of variation. It also shows that single year studies of floral characters should be viewed with caution.

AB We outlined a methodological framework for sustainable water resource management comprising of ecological monitoring, quantified water quality and an ecosystem model. We tested the proposed framework on the subtropical Lake Kinneret (Israel), a major national water resource. Methodologically, this study linked the economic activities in Lake Kinneret and its watershed (i.e. nutrient loads and water supply regimes) with lake water quality, sustaining of which was considered as the management objective. Based on analysis of the monitoring data and model scenario simulations we established quantitative relationships between changes to lake water level and nutrient loading and water quality. We assessed a set of ranges of nutrient loads from the watershed and water levels that will allow conservation of the lake water quality within pre-defined limits thereby defining limits for a sustainable management policy for the lake water resources. The defined sustainable management policy is in good correspondence with the loads and water level permissible ranges estimated from the ecological monitoring of the lake. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Given widespread concern about the status of elasmobranch fishes globally, information on this group in the Persian (Arabian) Gulf is reviewed comprehensively for the first time. The Arabian region may be of overlooked significance to elasmobranch biogeography, and the environmentally unique Gulf has some highly distinctive elements of biodiversity: an endemic and critically endangered rajid skate, a rarely recorded carcharhinid shark, and preliminary molecular studies which indicate intriguing levels of distinctness from conspecifics elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific. Elasmobranchs also have a long history of association with, and exploitation by, humans around the Gulf. Despite this, Gulf elasmobranchs have been poorly researched, probably due to their low esteem as food. Information is scattered through a variety of literature, and only a handful of published works have been primarily concerned with aspects relevant to management. Key areas of concern include large reported landings by Iran; the export of fins to east Asian markets (particularly through the United Arab Emirates); potentially increasing demand for elasmobranchs for pharmaceutical products and human consumption; a reported change in elasmobranch community structure along the Iranian coast; and major degradation of the Gulf's shallow, semi-enclosed environment. Priorities for research in the near future should include: resolution of taxonomic issues; species-level monitoring and reporting of fisheries landings by all Gulf states (including the species, pathways and fisheries involved in the fin trade locally); establishing the degree of connectivity of Gulf populations to those in adjacent waterbodies; and identification of key spatio-temporal sensitivities.

AB A combination of 3D micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (3D micro-XRF) and micro-XRF was utilized for the investigation of a small collection of highly heterogeneous, partly degraded Dead Sea Scroll parchment samples from known excavation sites. The quantitative combination of the two techniques proves to be suitable for the identification of reliable marker elements which may be used for classification and provenance studies. With 3D micro-XRF, the three-dimensional nature, i.e. the depth-resolved elemental composition as well as density variations, of the samples was investigated and bromine could be identified as a suitable marker element. It is shown through a comparison of quantitative and semiquantitative values for the bromine content derived using both techniques that, for elements which are homogeneously distributed in the sample matrix, quantification with micro-XRF using a one-layer model is feasible. Thus, the possibility for routine provenance studies using portable micro-XRF instrumentation on a vast amount of samples, even on site, is obtained through this work.

AB Modelling post-release survival probabilities of reintroduced birds can help inform 'soft-release' strategies for avian reintroductions that use captive-bred individuals. We used post-release radiotelemetry data to estimate the survival probabilities of reintroduced captive-bred Red-billed Curassow Crax blumenbachii, a globally threatened Cracid endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest. Between August 2006 and December 2008, 46 radiotagged Curassows from the Crax Brazil breeding centre were reintroduced to the Guapiacu Ecological Reserve (REGUA), Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, in seven different cohorts. Reintroduced birds were most vulnerable during the first 12 months post-release from natural predation, domestic dogs and hunting. Annual post-release survival probability was high (75%) compared with published estimates for other Galliform species. However, when considering survival in all birds transported to REGUA (some birds died before release or were retained in captivity) and not only post-release survival, phi in this study was closer to estimates for other species (60%). The duration of the pre-release acclimatization period within the soft-release enclosure and the size of the released cohorts both positively influenced post-release survival of reintroduced Curassows. Our results are relevant to future Cracid reintroductions and highlight the importance of utilizing post-release monitoring data for evidence-based improvements to soft-release strategies that can significantly enhance the post-release survival of captive-bred birds.

AB Background: Predation is an important driver of life-history trait evolution. Fish predators may prey selectively on certain prey size classes, or pregnant females, particularly those of livebearing prey species. This selectivity ought to affect the evolutionary trajectory of the prey population. In sulphidic and hypoxic habitats, Atlantic mollies (Poecilia mexicana) have to spend considerable time engaging in aquatic surface respiration, exposing themselves to predation by giant water bugs (Belostoma sp.). Compared with other females, pregnant P mexicana experience greater oxygen demands leading to more aquatic surface respiration.
   Questions: Are pregnant P mexicana females more likely to be captured by Belostoma as a result of more aquatic surface respiration and decreased flight abilities (i.e. slower fast-start responses)?
   Organisms and location: (1) Atlantic mollies (P mexicana: Poeciliidae, Teleostei) inhabiting a sulphidic cave (Cueva del Azufre) in Tabasco, Mexico. (2) A co-existing sit-and-wait predator, the giant water bug Belostoma sp. (Belostomatidae, Hemiptera), which catches surfacing fish at the water's edge.
   Methods: Predation experiments inside the Cueva del Azufre. In Experiment 1, one randomly selected cave molly female was placed into a perforated bottle with one individual water bug. In Experiment 2, two size-matched females (one pregnant and one non-pregnant) were placed into a perforated bottle with one individual water bug.
   Results: Capture rates after 24 h in Experiment I were correlated mainly with female body size. But larger females were also more likely to be pregnant, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of size and pregnancy. Experiment 2 isolated the effect of pregnancy, and water bugs clearly preferred pregnant over non-pregnant prey.

AB Evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) differ in the extent to which they capture, or even consider, adaptive variation, and most such designations are based solely on neutral genetic differences that may not capture variation relevant to species' adaptabilities to changing environmental conditions. While concordant patterns of divergence among data sets (i.e. neutral and potentially non-neutral characters) can strengthen ESU designations, determining whether such criteria are met for highly variable taxa is especially challenging. This study tests whether previously defined ESUs for endangered Panamanian golden frogs (Atelopus varius and Atelopus zeteki) exhibit concordant variation among multiple phenotypic traits and mitochondrial DNA sequences, and the extent to which such divergence corresponds to environmental differences. Multivariate analyses identify phenotypic and genetic differentiation consistent with proposed ESUs and support the status of A. varius and A. zeteki as separate species. Moreover, the significant association detected between ESU co-membership and genetic similarity, which remained strong after removing the effect of geographic distance, also indicates that genetic differences are not simply due to isolation by distance. Two phenotypic characters (body size and the extent of dorsal black patterning) that differ among ESUs also co-vary with environmental differences, suggesting that to the extent that these phenotypic differences are heritable, variation may be associated with adaptive divergence. Lastly, discriminant function analyses show that the frogs can be correctly assigned to ESUs based on simultaneous analysis of multiple characters. The study confirms the merit of conserving the previously proposed golden frog ESUs as well as demonstrates the utility and feasibility of combined analyses of ecological, morphological and genetic variation in evaluating ESUs, especially for highly variable taxa.

AB We show that inclusion of population characteristics in coupled advection-diffusion and fertilizationkinetics models results in higher fertilization rates than those previously reported in theoretical studies. We incorporate parameters related to both individuals and populations by running simulations over a large spatial scale and incorporating sperm contribution from multiple males. We compare predictions for three subpopulations of the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (those occupying kelp beds, barrens, and grazing fronts) to observations from small-scale experiments, and estimate effects of population size and current velocity in each subpopulation. Model outputs suggest that fertilization rates are low in kelp beds, intermediate in barrens, and high in grazing fronts. In all populations, increasing current velocity has a negative effect on the relationship between fertilization rate and downstream distance of gametes after release, but no effect on the relationship between fertilization rate and elapsed time since gamete release. Our model output was most sensitive to changes in the number of spawning males and the sperm release rate, suggesting that spawning synchrony and high gonadic index could greatly increase the fertilization success in sea urchins.

   MODEL
AB A generic model is developed that describes the broad properties of land-exploitation systems from hunting-gathering societies to modern, intensive agriculture. The framework includes social, economic and ecological drivers of change, going beyond the concept of "sustainability" to establish a paradigm of "resilient exploitation" that calculates the capacity of landscape exploitation systems to survive in uncertain and variable human and natural environments. The model is highly aggregated, consisting of two state variables: (1) human-made capital and labour (H) and (2) natural capital (N). Depending on the parameters, the model displays a single non-trivial equilibrium, two equilibria, or stable limit cycles. Our analysis focuses on the strategies that exploiters employ, through varying their investment in H, and how this affects resilience of the system. We measure resilience as the size of the basin of attraction near a desirable equilibrium and the return time following small perturbations. Four general strategies are analysed and discussed using grazing systems as a particular example: (1) constant stocking rate, (2) maintaining grass stock, (3) constant utilization rate, and (4) a non-linear, compound strategy.
   Like previous models of renewable resources, maximum sustainable yield and profit are determined by properties of the renewable resource, so all management strategies yield identical long-term sustainable production and identical equilibria. However, different management strategies drastically change the system's resilience. We assess the opportunity cost of the disparate objectives of resilience and profitability using multi-objective optimization and demonstrate that resilience decreases rapidly as maximum profit is approached. Thus, the same stable and sustainable equilibrium point in an exploitation system will be more or less resilient depending on the exploiter's strategy. Traditional economic analysis does not consider the impact of the management strategy employed to drive the system towards these long-term equilibria, and therefore misses large differences in dynamical behaviour away from equilibrium. The possibility of multiple steady states in these non-linear systems results in the potential for a discontinuous "threshold" in resilience, to one side of which resilience is maintained, while on the other resilience and production are greatly degraded. We further discuss how subsidies might increase or decrease resilience of exploitation systems by affecting an exploiter's strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The dynamics of feral cats ( Felis catus) were assessed at Shark Bay at two adjoining sites subject to differing intensities of predator control. The Heirisson Prong conservation reserve ( 12 km(2)) was fenced to exclude predators and was subject to intensive control actions, while a portion of the adjoining Carrarang pastoral lease (60 km(2)) was subject to a lesser level of control. Foxes ( Vulpes vulpes) were largely absent at both sites owing to effective control. Densities of cats were highly variable over time, showing strong annual fluctuations over 14 years of records Three independent estimates of peak density were made, varying between 1.5 and 2.8 km(-2). Rate of increase was assessed as 0.98 on the pastoral lease and 0.99 on the conservation reserve ( to give an approximate doubling of the population every 8.5 months). A logistic model, with K = 1.5 km(-2) and r of 0.98, gave a maximum sustained yield of 0.37 cats km(-2) year(-1) and a harvest rate of > 0.6 cats km(-2) year(-1) for their elimination in 5 years or less ( for K = 2.8 km(-2), these values increase to 0.69 and > 1.05 km(-2) year(-1) respectively). Harvest outcomes at both sites were consistent with these models. However, the effort required to maintain a given offtake rate increased 6-fold at low cat densities and offtake by trapping as a function of cat density took the form of a Type 3 functional response. The functional response for cat trapping ( the offtake with constant effort per unit time) overlaid against the curve of cat productivity suggested a stable equilibrium point at low cat densities (0.07 - 0.13 cats km(-2)). Hence, trapping effort needed to be greatly intensified at low cat densities and/or augmented by other methods of control to eradicate cats from the closed system of the reserve. The strongly male-biased sex ratio of captures at the barrier fence suggested high levels of reinvasion from beyond the harvested area of the pastoral lease and this made effective control in this open system difficult.

AB Cultures of the only photosynthetic green alga (Dunaliella parva) in the surface waters of the Dead Sea and three halophilic archaea (Haloarcula marismortui; Haloferax volcanii; Halorubrum sodomense) from the same location were analyzed for their lipid content to investigate the contribution of these organisms to the organic matter in the sediments of this hypersaline lake. Based on distribution patterns and stable carbon isotope ratios, most of the sedimentary short chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids may be attributed to the green alga, whereas the relatively abundant long chain acids are considered to be predominantly of allochthonous origin. Two Delta(7) sterols in the sediments also occur in the alga. Based on carbon isotope data, sedimentary phytol probably has a mixed origin, whereas n-alkanols and n-alkanes were contributed to the sediments from terrestrial sources. The extractable lipid compositions of the three archaea are very similar and dominated by squalenes with different degrees of unsaturation and by glycerol diphytanyl diether (archaeol). Whereas archaeol is also a major constituent of the extractable organic matter in the sediments, the squalenes apparently do not survive sedimentation unaltered; the same is true for the small amounts of less common unsaturated analogues of archaeol in the archaea.

AB The following parameters were determined in the photic zone of Lake Kinneret from January 2001 through December 2002: primary production (PP), community respiration (CR), bacterial biomass production (BBP), bacterial numbers (BN) and biological oxygen demand (BOD5). Average values over the 2 yr period for these parameters in the photic zone (0 to 15 m) were PP, 1539 mg C m(-2) d(-1); CR, 1653 mg C m(-2) d(-1); BBP, 887 Mg C m(-2) d(-1); BN, 4.6 x 10(6) cells ml(-1); and BOD5, 6366 mg C m(-2). We used these data together with literature-based assumptions about the ratio of net to gross primary production, bacterial and zooplankton respiration to estimate bacterial growth efficiencies (BGE) ranging from 44 to 64 %. Bacterial specific growth rates averaged 0.33 d(-1), ranging from 0.13 to 0.93 d(-1). CR was significantly correlated with both PP and BBP. A significant correlation was found between BBP and BOD5, suggesting that the indigenous bacterial populations were strongly dependent on substrates measured by BOD5. The potentially labile fractions of TOC, as quantified by BOD5, were rapidly cycled by heterotrophic bacteria, within similar to4 d on average. With the exception of 6 to 8 wk in early summer, the photic zone of this warm mesotrophic-eutrophic lake, with low inputs of allochthonous organic carbon, was net autotrophic. BBP and BGE values were high in comparison to those reported from even more eutrophic aquatic systems. Our results indicate that bacteria are by far the major biological agents of organic carbon cycling in Lake Kinneret, and contradict the general perception that the microbial loop plays a less important role in carbon cycling in eutrophic than in oligotrophic aquatic systems.

AB Models of semiarid vegetation dynamics incorporating concepts of equilibrium and stability have been largely replaced by nonequilibrium models in recent years. However, neither equilibrium nor disequilibrium and neither stability nor instability have been formally demonstrated. Most records of semiarid vegetation are inadequate for conclusive tests. We tested for equilibrium at seven study sites in six locations and vegetation types, in grazed semiarid grassland in central Otago, New Zealand, using data collected twice annually over 5-13 yr. Some sites showed overall directional change in composition over time, but others appeared to fluctuate about an average equilibrium state. At one site, an instantaneous perturbation experiment was used to test formally for stability, and to seek evidence for intrinsic stabilizing processes. In this experiment, three herbicide treatments removed or decreased different components of the community, and recovery and convergence with the untreated control was monitored over time. Although all exotic species increased or rapidly re-invaded the treated plots, many native species failed to re-invade, and treatments had not recovered by 194 wk after perturbation. We conclude that the vegetation is not stable, but that some stabilizing processes are evident. Contrary to some nonequilibrium theory, we observed strong competitive interactions between species. We suggest that New Zealand semiarid vegetation exists on a continuum between equilibrium and nonequilibrium dynamics.

AB Temporal patterns of total ammonia (T-NH3) in the upper layers of an ammonia-polluted, saline, hypereutrophic urban lake, Onondaga Lake, New York, and its status with respect to ammonia toxicity criteria are documented and evaluated for the spring to fall interval over 10 years (1989 to 1998). Implications of revisions (n = 5) in the criteria (1985 to 1999) and the omission of ionic strength effects in the most recent revisions for this saline system are considered. The implications of diurnal variations in pH for application of both chronic and acute criteria are illustrated based on 14 days of hourly pH data. Concentrations of T-NH3 in the upper layers of this lake were extremely high because of discharges received from a 3.5 m(3)/s (80 mgd) wastewater treatment plant; the average concentration during the April to June interval for the 10 years was 2.3 mg/L. Substantial interannual and seasonal variations were observed in the T-NH3 pool of the lake. April concentrations were largely regulated by the dilution provided by antecedent (i.e., December to March) tributary flow.
   Revisions of the chronic criteria have been progressively less stringent for low ionic strength conditions. However, under the saline conditions of this lake, the most recent (1998 and 1999) revisions can be more stringent than the earlier criteria. The 1984 chronic criterion (published in 1985) was exceeded by a wide margin annually (average factor of 2.2 for April to June) and for durations greater than 75 days. Widely different diurnal patterns in pH and the occurrence of an exceedance of the 1998 acute criterion during a pH maximum are documented. These diurnal variations are an important factor in the design of programs to assess status and in application of criteria for productive systems.

AB We evaluated in situ the effects of long-term grazing (>100 y) on the morphological (i.e., shoot height, leaf blade length, width and angle) and physiological (i.e., gas exchange and water relations) responses of the dominant perennial grass species from and lowlands and more mesic uplands of the Pryor Mountain Wild Worse Range (PMWHR) in Montana. Pseudoroegneria spicata, the most abundant grass in the lowland communities, had shorter vegetative shoot heights and leaf blade lengths and narrower leaves in plants from gazed than long-term ungrazed sites. Similarly, vegetative and reproductive shoot heights of Festuca idahoensis and Elymus lanceolatus, common upland grass species, were shorter in plants from grazed than ungrazed sites. Leaf lengths of these upland grasses also were shorter and less erect in plants from grazed sites than ungrazed sires. The physiological responses of the dominant grasses to sating were not consistent between species or sampling dates. Overall, photosynthetic rates, stomatal conductances and xylem pressure potentials were the same in over 65% of the comparisons between plants from grazed and unsated sites and were higher in grazed sites in only 11 to 22% of the grazed-ungrazed comparisons. Collectively our results indicate that long-term grazing of grasses by wild horses and other herbivores in the PMWHR has resulted in morphological modification, but has not substantively altered physiological function.

ID WATER COLUMN
AB Dissolved and particulate phosphorus, ammonia, and nitrate concentrations were measured in the Dead Sea water column (330 m depth, salinity ca. 340 g/L), in the Lower Jordan River and in springs along its western coast. Dissolved phosphate in the water column is fairly homogeneous, at about 35 mu g P/L. Particulate P shows larger variability, 30-50 mu g/L. The main inputs of dissolved phosphate into the lake are diffusion from bottom sediments (58%) and the Jordan River inflow (41%). Input from springs is negligible (1%). Biological uptake is a minor removal pathway because in the present Dead Sea, primary production takes place only when major floods occur and dilute the upper layer, about once in 10 years. When this happens, only about 200 ton P, out of a whole-lake reservoir of ca. 5000 ton P, are removed from the biologically active upper layer of about 7 m. Chemical removal pathways, not yet investigated, such as coprecipitation with authigenic aragonite, could be of importance. The average ammonia concentration in the water column has gradually increased from 5.9 mg/L in 1960 to 8.9 mg/L, in 1991. Diffusion from the bottom sediments is a major source of ammonia to the Dead Sea. The annual input from freshwater inflows has been of lesser importance in the 1960s and 1970s. A pollution-derived increase in the ammonia concentration of the Jordan River in the 1980s may partially explain the concomitant rise in the ammonia load of the lake. It is also suggested that following the 1979 overturn, and the yearly turnovers of the 1980s, ammonia might have been produced within the oxygenated water column by mineralization. Nitrate concentration was very low, 20 mu g N/L, in the 1960s and increased to 0.2 to 0.5 mg/L in 1981. This increase is shown to be due to human pollution of the Jordan River. We conclude that nutrient concentration in the Dead Sea water column is controlled by physical and chemical factors, whereas biological effects are minimal. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB A new sampling technique designed to study the vertical distribution of macroalgae associated with Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. pneumatophores is described. Correspondence Analysis was the primary technique computed to identify relationships between species, pneumatophore height intervals and density associations. The relationships between species frequency and pneumatophore height intervals were summarized in kite diagrams. Vertical zonation along the aerial roots was detected, being most obvious in samples where the tall, dense pneumatophores occurred along the water's edge. Three zones were identified: an upper Rhizoclonium-, a mid Bostrychia- and a lower Caloglossa-zone. The photophilic Cyanophyceae were not limited to any particular zone as their occurrence was along the entire length of the pneumatophores. Vertical distribution was generally limited to heights attained at tidal ebb and flow on the aerial mangrove roots. Environmental factors predicted to govern vertical zonation include tidal phenomena such as tidal inundation and wetting frequency, desiccation, salinity, as well as light intensity and temperature.

AB The release of captive-bred animals into the wild is commonly practised to restore or supplement wild populations but comes with a suite of ecological and genetic consequences. Vast numbers of hatchery-reared fish are released annually, ostensibly to restore/enhance wild populations or provide greater angling returns. While previous studies have shown that captive-bred fish perform poorly in the wild relative to wild-bred conspecifics, few have measured individual lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and how this affects population productivity. Here, we analyse data on Atlantic salmon from an intensely studied catchment into which varying numbers of captive-bred fish have escaped/been released and potentially bred over several decades. Using a molecular pedigree, we demonstrate that, on average, the LRS of captive-bred individuals was only 36% that of wild-bred individuals. A significant LRS difference remained after excluding individuals that left no surviving offspring, some of which might have simply failed to spawn, consistent with transgenerational effects on offspring survival. The annual productivity of the mixed population (wild-bred plus captive-bred) was lower in years where captive-bred fish comprised a greater fraction of potential spawners. These results bolster previous empirical and theoretical findings that intentional stocking, or non-intentional escapees, threaten, rather than enhance, recipient natural populations.

AB Aim The 'rate-of-living' theory predicts that life expectancy is a negative function of the rates at which organisms metabolize. According to this theory, factors that accelerate metabolic rates, such as high body temperature and active foraging, lead to organismic 'wear-out'. This process reduces life span through an accumulation of biochemical errors and the build-up of toxic metabolic by-products. Although the rate-of-living theory is a keystone underlying our understanding of life-history trade-offs, its validity has been recently questioned. The rate-of-living theory has never been tested on a global scale in a phylogenetic framework, or across both endotherms and ectotherms. Here, we test several of its fundamental predictions across the tetrapod tree of life.
   Location Global.
   Time period Present.
   Major taxa studied Land vertebrates.
   Methods Using a dataset spanning the life span data of 4,100 land vertebrate species (2,214 endotherms, 1,886 ectotherms), we performed the most comprehensive test to date of the fundamental predictions underlying the rate-of-living theory. We investigated how metabolic rates, and a range of factors generally perceived to be strongly associated with them, relate to longevity.
   Results Our findings did not support the predictions of the rate-of-living theory. Basal and field metabolic rates, seasonality, and activity times, as well as reptile body temperatures and foraging ecology, were found to be unrelated to longevity. In contrast, lower longevity across ectotherm species was associated with high environmental temperatures.
   Main conclusions We conclude that the rate-of-living theory does not hold true for terrestrial vertebrates, and suggest that life expectancy is driven by selection arising from extrinsic mortality factors. A simple link between metabolic rates, oxidative damage and life span is not supported. Importantly, our findings highlight the potential for rapid warming, resulting from the current increase in global temperatures, to drive accelerated rates of senescence in ectotherms.

AB "Old fields" are ecosystems that have been previously managed and subsequently abandoned, usually from agricultural use. These systems are classic testing grounds for hypotheses about community assembly. However, old field succession can be difficult to predict: seemingly similar fields often diverge in terms of species composition and environmental conditions. Here, we test the relative roles of contingency and stochasticity in driving vegetative successional dynamics. We draw on three decades of surveys in 24 old fields at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (Minnesota, USA), and focus on five drivers that are known to shape local plant communities: soil fertility, fire, climate, competition, and demography. These drivers can contribute to contingency when they act consistently across fields and years (e.g., soil nitrogen accumulation, experimental fire regimes, or average climate), or to stochasticity when their effects are variable (e.g., annual variations in weather, or colonization and mortality events). We proceed in two steps. First, we fit regressions estimating abundance, colonization, and mortality for eight major functional groups in relation to these five drivers. We then use these regressions to parameterize a series of metacommunity simulation models, and test whether observed levels of stochasticity and variation in the drivers are sufficient to explain successional divergence. All drivers were significantly associated with plant species abundances, colonization, and mortality. Contingent factors strongly altered predicted successional trajectories. However, replicate simulations with similar conditions followed similar successional trajectories, suggesting that stochastic processes did not lead to divergence. This robustness of successional dynamics may be explained by compensatory trade-offs. For example, species that were abundant late in succession typically suffered from low colonization rates and high mortality rates early in succession. Synthesis. Average successional dynamics among old fields at Cedar Creek follow largely consistent trends. Though dynamics of individual fields vary, much of this variation can be explained by contingent factors. Stochastic processes appear not to be sufficiently strong to create divergent successional trajectories among fields with similar sets of drivers. Our results therefore suggest that divergence among successional trajectories in chronosequences may be the result of predictable contingent factors, rather than unpredictable stochastic fluctuations.

AB The invasion of exotic grasses into shrublands is a major disturbance to dryland ecosystems. The presence of exotic grasses enhances the occurrence of wildfire in landscapes that had not evolved in the presence of fire, leading to high rates of mortality of the native vegetation. Exotic grasses could be more prone to water stress and mortality than the shrubs they replaced and may not establish during drought, facts that are crucial in ecosystems undergoing increased climatic variability. Here, we develop a process-based modelling framework to investigate the complex dynamics resulting from the introduction of exotic grasses under variable climate. We find that the system converges towards different steady states, depending on the magnitude of climatic variability. While in the absence of climate fluctuations the shrubland state is replaced by an exotic grassland, interannual climate variability may inhibit grass invasion and stabilize the shrubland state. However, climatic variability also gives rise to a novel third, unvegetated state, with grass invasion being followed by drought, grass mortality and intense soil erosion. Most of the research on climate change effects on ecosystems has historically concentrated on the ecological impact of shifts in mean climate conditions. This study shows that changes in the variance are also important when shifts in vegetation composition (e.g. species invasions) result in different susceptibility to climatic variability. In the presence of random climate fluctuations, ecosystems can display steady states that differ from those that would exist under a constant climate or with a climate trend.

TI Assessing the Underwater Acoustics of the World's Largest Vibration

AB Anthropogenic noise in aquatic environments is a worldwide concern due to its potential adverse effects on the environment and aquatic life. The Hongkong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is currently under construction in the Pearl River Estuary, a hot spot for the Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in China. The OCTA-KONG, the world's largest vibration hammer, is being used during this construction project to drive or extract steel shell piles 22 m in diameter. This activity poses a substantial threat to marine mammals, and an environmental assessment is critically needed. The underwater acoustic properties of the OCTA-KONG were analyzed, and the potential impacts of the underwater acoustic energy on Sousa, including auditory masking and physiological impacts, were assessed. The fundamental frequency of the OCTA-KONG vibration ranged from 15 Hz to 16 Hz, and the noise increments were below 20 kHz, with a dominant frequency and energy below 10 kHz. The resulting sounds are most likely detectable by Sousa over distances of up to 3.5 km from the source. Although Sousa clicks do not appear to be adversely affected, Sousa whistles are susceptible to auditory masking, which may negatively impact this species' social life. Therefore, a safety zone with a radius of 500 m is proposed. Although the zero-to-peak source level (SL) of the OCTA-KONG was lower than the physiological damage level, the maximum root-mean-square SL exceeded the cetacean safety exposure level on several occasions. Moreover, the majority of the unweighted cumulative source sound exposure levels (SSELs) and the cetacean auditory weighted cumulative SSELs exceeded the acoustic threshold levels for the onset of temporary threshold shift, a type of potentially recoverable auditory damage resulting from prolonged sound exposure. These findings may aid in the identification and design of appropriate mitigation methods, such as the use of air bubble curtains, "soft start" and "power down" techniques.

AB Obtaining accurate data on abundance is vital to undertaking viable stock assessments of commercially exploited species. Satellite Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMSs) combined with fisheries logbooks have the potential to provide an abundant source of data with greater spatial and temporal coverage than research surveys. However, to date it has not been demonstratedhowwell VMS-derived abundance or biomass indices reflect research survey results. In this study we compared biomass indices of scallops derived from (i) fishing vessel surveys, (ii) research vessel surveys, and (iii) fishery-dependent data using VMSs and logbooks. In most cases there were strong relationships between biomass indices of Pecten maximus from fishing vessels and the research vessel. There were stronger relationships between P. maximus biomass indices from fishery-dependent VMS and logbook data and research vessel data at the beginning of the fishing season, when abundance was higher, but weaker relationships at the end of the fishing season. The time and location of sampling affected biomass estimates over short periods, and without standardizing to location and vessel, biomass depletion was masked. Fishery-dependent data provides a valid means of assessing relative scallop abundance and may prove equally viable in other fisheries with appropriate standardization of Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) data, making real-time management of fisheries increasingly feasible.

AB The Hani terrace landscape located in the mountainous areas of Southwestern China has a history of 1300 years and is a classic example of human-environment harmony. This study investigates the spatial distribution and pattern characteristics of land cover in the landscape using geographical information system and remote-sensing techniques. With the synthetic consideration of both physical and cultural factors, the ecological stability of the landscape was discussed. The results showed that terrace' and forest' are dominant in the landscape accounting for 43.80% and 44.90% of the total area, respectively. A clear vertical land-cover distribution of higher forest-middle village-lower terrace-lowest river' can be found on steep slopes. The local climate and its variation with elevation are essential for the stable local water cycle, and the spatial layout of the landscape elements allows for effective material and energy flow within the landscape. Moreover, the obligatory forest and water resource conservation due to the unique history and culture of Hani adds a social layer of protection. The sustainable development of the Hani landscape is expected to provide valuable insights for the present land and environmental management.

AB Translocation is an increasingly popular conservation management activity worldwide, but the success of translocation is often not measured or reported. A population of the endangered Macquarie perch was imperilled by the damming in 1977 of the Queanbeyan River, near Canberra in south-eastern Australia. In November 1980, 66 adult Macquarie perch (309-389-mm total length) individuals were collected from the newlyformed reservoir, and translocated approximately 4 km upstream into the Queanbeyan River past a waterfall (which prevented access to spawning habitat). Five years of post-translocation monitoring at the release sites resulted in the capture of only a single individual in late 1981. Consequently, monitoring ceased because the translocation was assumed to have failed. However, subsequent angler reports and a preliminary survey in 1991 confirmed that some translocated fish had survived, and a small recruiting population had established. More intensive follow-up surveys and subsequent monitoring from 1996 to 2006 demonstrated an established population with consistent recruitment until 2001. However, after 2001, there was no evidence of recruitment and the population is now undetectable, with the prolonged 'millennium drought' (1997-2010) being the most plausible cause. The present study demonstrates the potentially ephemeral nature of assessments of success and failure, and the importance of targeted long-term monitoring programs.

ISSN 0300-9483. This study proposes a working hypothesis that Mediterranean hippopotamuses, and perhaps European ones as well, reduced their size, sometimes even drastically, from the 'Mid-Pleistocene Revolution' (MPR, c. 1.2-0.5 Ma) to the Late Pleistocene. In contrast to the Early Pleistocene, during this time period glacial/interglacial cycling was dominated by a 100-ka periodicity, with more extended glacial phases (up to 85 ka) alternating with shorter interglacial phases (up to 15 ka). These changes seem to have somehow affected the size of hippopotamuses. While relatively larger hippopotamuses have been found in warmer and somewhat more humid intervals, data seem to indicate that they might not have grown as large under less favourable conditions, namely during colder and comparatively drier times. This is a possible response to climate-driven fluctuations in food availability, but Pleistocene habitat fragmentation may also have had an influence. Environmental break-up during the late Quaternary led to the isolation of megafauna populations, which underwent modifications similar to those observed in insular mammals. Although the amount of remains available is still limited, it is nonetheless a fact that hippopotamuses changed their body size through time, normally becoming smaller. If the conclusions are confirmed as data continue to accumulate, hippopotamuses might cast doubt on the generality of Bergmann's rule.

AB Background: Spatial heterogeneity is essential for the persistence of many inherently unstable systems such as predatorprey and parasitoid-host interactions. Since biological interactions themselves can create heterogeneity in space, the heterogeneity necessary for the persistence of an unstable system could be the result of local interactions involving elements of the unstable system itself.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report on a predatory ladybird beetle whose natural history suggests that the beetle requires the patchy distribution of the mutualism between its prey, the green coffee scale, and the arboreal ant, Azteca instabilis. Based on known ecological interactions and the natural history of the system, we constructed a spatially-explicit model and showed that the clustered spatial pattern of ant nests facilitates the persistence of the beetle populations. Furthermore, we show that the dynamics of the beetle consuming the scale insects can cause the clustered distribution of the mutualistic ants in the first place.
   Conclusions/Significance: From a theoretical point of view, our model represents a novel situation in which a predator indirectly causes a spatial pattern of an organism other than its prey, and in doing so facilitates its own persistence. From a practical point of view, it is noteworthy that one of the elements in the system is a persistent pest of coffee, an important world commodity. This pest, we argue, is kept within limits of control through a complex web of ecological interactions that involves the emergent spatial pattern.

AB The distribution of traits within communities is thought to provide information on the evolutionary and ecological forces that structure community composition. Ecological character displacement (evolutionary divergence among populations of interacting species within a community), as well as community-wide character displacement (even dispersion of species traits within a community via species sorting), have been widely reported and are typically interpreted as evidence for interspecific competition. However, defining an appropriate null distribution with which to assess the observed distribution of traits within a community has proved controversial. Phylogenetic methods provide an alternative approach to evaluating community structure, but such methods also require an appropriate null and have typically overlooked the potential for evolutionary dynamics within communities. Here, we present a novel phylogenetic framework that uses evolutionary expectations to generate a simple null model of the expected distribution of traits among co-occurring species. Using a stochastic Brownian motion model of trait change, we illustrate that the expected community-wide dispersion of traits varies with phylogenetic tree shape. We then use data on body mass for mammals to evaluate the accuracy with which phylogeny can predict the empirical distribution of traits and find a strong correlation between predicted and observed trait distributions. We suggest that deviations from phylogenetic expectations may therefore provide a useful tool for evaluating the role of competition in shaping community structure. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach using empirical data on body mass and a phylogeny for a small community of terrestrial mammals in Yotvata, Israel, and reveal evidence consistent with ecological and community-wide character displacement. Our method unites ecological and evolutionary approaches, and it provides a novel framework for exploring community structure.

AB Dispersal distributions are often characterized by many individuals that stay close to their origin and large variation in the distances moved by those that leave. This variation in dispersal distance can strongly influence demographic, ecological, and evolutionary processes. However, a lack of data on the fitness and phenotype of individual dispersers has impeded research on the role of natural selection in maintaining variation in dispersal distance. Six years of spatially explicit capture-mark-recapture data showed that survival increased with dispersal distance in the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus. To understand the evolutionary implications of this fitness response, we tested whether variation in dispersal distance has a phenotypic basis. We used photographs of marked individuals to measure head, trunk, and leg morphology. We then tested whether dispersal distances over the six-year study period were predicted by these traits. Dispersal distance was significantly related to leg morphology: individuals with relatively long forelimbs and short hindlimbs dispersed the farthest. These results support the hypothesis that positive fitness consequences maintain phenotypes enabling long-distance dispersal. More broadly, they suggest that natural selection can promote variation in dispersal distance and associated phenotypes, offering an alternative to the view that dispersal distance is driven by stochastic or landscape-specific mechanisms.

AB The relative abundance of the different picoplankton components (eukaryotic picophytoplankton (Peuk), picocyanobacteria (Pcy) and bacterioplankton), and their relationships with the lake conditions were studied in three types of shallow lakes from the Pampa Plain (Argentina) that differ in their optical properties: clear-vegetated, phytoplankton-turbid and inorganic-turbid. All the selected lakes, but one, are characterized by their different alternative steady state (clear-vegetated and phytoplankton-turbid water phases) following the model proposed by Scheffer et al. (1993).
   Autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton abundances were analyzed seasonally in relation to environmental variables. All the lakes presented high concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) (>229 mu g L-1), total phosphorus (TP) (>46 mu g L-1) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (>13.7 mg L-1). Clear-vegetated lakes were characterized by vertical diffuse PAR (photosynthetic active radiation) attenuation coefficient (kd(PAR)) lower than 11 m(-1), whereas inorganic-turbid lake always showed values higher than 21.1 m(-1). The euphoric zone depth (Z(1%)) was wider in clear-vegetated lakes (40-140 cm) and thinner in the inorganicturbid (10-20 cm). The phytoplankton-turbid lakes presented a wide range in the values of these variables (kd(PAR): 5.2-35.8 m(-1).; Z(1%): 10-90 cm). Phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) strongly differed, ranging from 1.6 to 334.6 mu g L-1. Picophytoplankton was mainly represented by phycocianine-rich (PC-rich) Pcy in all cases, dominating over Peuk algae. The total and relative abundances of eukaryotic picophytoplankton. Pcy and bacterioplankton, as well as the size structure of the phytoplankton community differed among the water bodies. In general, clear-vegetated water bodies exhibited similar abiotic characteristics, picophytoplankton/bacterioplankton ratios, and phytoplankton size structure. Contrarily, no clear trend was identified for the group of turbid lakes. The contrasting results obtained for the importance of the picoplankton components in phytoplankton-turbid shallow lakes evidence that the availability of the energetical and nutrient resources cannot be solely considered to predict their relative importance in this type of shallow lake.

AB I tested the hypothesis that if sodium sulfate alters the bioenergetics of Ceriodaphnia dubia, concentrations that cause reduced fecundity in the short (7-day) and long (5 generations) term should also cause changes in feeding rate and/or metabolism, measured as oxygen consumption. In addition, to test the hypothesis that an altered bioenergetic level caused by sodium sulfate exposure will affect the response of that organism to another toxicant, I measured the acute toxicity of phenol to C. dubia in the presence and absence of both food and sodium sulfate. Sodium sulfate reduced the filter-feeding rate of C. dubia, which was associated with significantly reduced oxygen consumption. This decreased energy level appeared to result in a consistent but decreased level of fecundity over a number of generations and the reproductive impairment was dose-dependent. These effects occurred at concentrations much lower than those at which acute (mortality) effects have been observed, a finding that may have regulatory implications. In addition, whereas phenol toxicity to C dubia was exacerbated by the addition of food, increased phenol toxicity, likely induced by an increase in filtering or metabolic rate due to food addition, was negated when sodium sulfate was added to the test medium.

AB Few data are available and little is known about spatial variation in post-dispersal seed removal at different levels throughout the geographic range of a plant species. Here, we compare post-dispersal seed removal by rodents within and among sites in two distinct regions, the south-eastern Spanish Mediterranean highlands and the Swiss Jura. Seed removal was assessed experimentally for four fleshy-fruited species (Berberis vulgaris, Crataegus monogyna, Rosa spp. and Taxus baccata) in heterogeneous sites with distinct microhabitats. A factorial general linear model (GLM) analysis was used to evaluate the relative influence of species-specific seed traits on removal at three spatial levels (microhabitat, site and region). In both highland ecosystems, live trapping revealed that rodents were the main seed removers: Apodemus sylvaticus was observed in both regions, whereas A. flavicollis and Clethrionomys glareolus occurred only at the Swiss sites. There was a significant difference in seed removal between regions, and the preferences of the rodents varied among plant species and microhabitats. Variation in rodent presence explained some differences in seed removal between regions and among microhabitats. Finally, the effect of rodent presence on seed removal differs due to both regional and microhabitat effects.

AB Nine species of birds-seven hummingbirds (Trochilidae) and two Passeriformes-were observed visiting the flowers of Erythrina speciosa Andrews(Fabaceae),a hummingbird-pollinated species present on the campus of Londrina State University, Parana State, Brazil.Nectar in bagged flowers bore little relationship with nectar in flowers opened to foragers either regarding quantity or diurnal pattern of availability. Birds were more frequent early in the morning and their activity on flowers further declined, apparently following the pattern of nectar availability. The manner to which birds probed the flowers and, in consequence, their role on pollination were greatly determined by morphological traits and approaching behavior of birds. E. speciosa seemed best suited for pollination by long-billed hummingbirds but some short to medium-billed species may play some role on its pollination.

AB Changes in amino acid composition (AAC) during ontogeny of some planktonic crustacean species commonly found in fresh and brackish coastal waters were compared. For these comparisons two calanoid copepods (Eurytemora velox and Calanipeda aquae-dulcis), two cyclopoid copepods (Diacyclops bicuspidatus odessanus and Acanthocyclops robustus) and two Daphnia (Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia magna) species were selected. A discriminant analysis was performed to determine whether there were significant differences between the AAC of the different stages of each species. Results show gradual changes in AAC during ontogeny of the copepod species. Calanoids showed the greatest differences in AAC between stages, followed by cyclopoids. Gradual changes in AAC were due to the increase in some amino acids such as alanine, valine, glutamic acid, glycine, arginine, proline and tyrosine from nauplii to adults. The latter showed a remarkable increase in all copepod species. In contrast, Daphnia species showed a relatively constant AAC during development, with only minor changes being detected, and not related with ontogeny. Differences in the physico-chemical variables of the lagoons do not seem to be the cause of copepod ontogenic changes in AAC. Data suggest that AAC differences found between stages of copepod species could indicate a gradual change in diet during the life cycle of these copepods.

AB Previous work has shown that male Mannophryne trinitatis (Dendrobatidae) carry their larvae on their backs for up to 4 days in search of a predator-free pool in which to deposit them. The experiments reported here investigated whether costs to the larvae or to the adults limit transport duration. We simulated transport durations of 0, 4, 8, and 12 days for larvae, but found no deterioration in terms of ability to grow to metamorphosis; indeed, 12-day larvae grew better than all the others. After 8 days of simulated transport, larvae had used up all their yolk reserves and begun to lose dry weight. Larvae on wet substrates gained wet weight and length but on drier substrates merely maintained weight, suggesting that dehydration could be a problem on the male's back. In a trial of locomotor performance ( mean jump length; number of jumps to traverse a runway), females performed best with calling males not significantly different from transporting males, despite an average larval load equivalent to 15-20% of the frog's mass. Assessment of gut contents showed that females foraged more than males, but that transporting males foraged as much as did calling males. We found no differences between the three classes of adult frogs in fat body weight.

AB Zoning schemes that are becoming an important management tool in large marine reserves, are difficult to implement in small reef areas. At the 3.4 km long reef of Eilat (Red Sea), a small (ca. 350 m of coastline) enclosure strategy has been enforced since 1992, while the remaining reef was left open to intense human activities. Here we have investigated for 2.5 y three populations of the branching coral Stylophora pistillata (3605 colonies) in a locality within the enclosed area (site NR) and in two areas open to the public, by tossing random quadrats at the shallow lagoonar zone (0.5-1.5 m depth). In the two open sites we found significantly higher levels of colony breakage (14-34% vs. 4-9% in the enclosed site), lower partial mortality levels of colonies (in the first 1.5 y; 7-9% vs. 23-30% at NR), higher recruitment (up to 3.0 vs. up to 0.9 colonies/m 2), 50% reduction in coral life span (10 vs. 20 y) and an estimated extinction period of 9-10 y for new cohorts as compared to >20 y in the enclosed site. Average colony size and maximal colony size were about half in the open sites. Live coverage fluctuated widely in all sites but was 3 times higher in the enclosed area (1.0-3.0% vs. 0.3-1.1%). Log-transformed size frequency distributions revealed, at the open sites, a shift from small towards medium-size classes and at the enclosed site, a shift from larger to medium size classes. We conclude that the enclosure of a limited core zone, although improved some ecological parameters, was not sufficient to compensate for stress imposed by anthropogenic activities. It is suggested to employ active restoration approaches, such as the "gardening concept", as supplementary management tools. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB . It is remarkable that after many thousands of years of pastoralism in arid and semi-arid savannas, there is still no clear answer to the basic question: Does livestock grazing have more than a marginal effect on the dynamics of arid and semi-arid land vegetation? A small study of semi-arid savanna vegetation along a spatial gradient in grazing pressure, repeated three times over 19 years is used as a basis for discussing the behaviour of dry land vegetation under heavy grazing. Three basic theories are compared: (1) the theory that heavy grazing causes desertification; (2) the theory that heavy grazing causes no directed change in the vegetation of arid and semi-arid rangelands; and (3) the theory that heavy grazing leads to a switch between alternative states of vegetation. On the basis of the current data the first two theories are rejected, but the conclusion is that there is much evidence for a more complex behaviour of dry rangelands under grazing than what is accommodated in any of the three theories. Probably, site-specific properties including interactive and indirect effects of herbivory in the system are important for vegetation development under grazing in arid and semi-arid rangelands.

AB 1. Mathematical models of biological population dynamics have not only to account for growth and interactions but also for spatial processes, like random or directed and joint or relative motion of species, as well as the variability of the environment.
   2. Early attempts began with physico-chemical diffusion, exponential growth and Lotka-Volterra type interactions. These approaches have been continuously refined to more realistic descriptions of the development of natural populations.
   3. The main aim of this paper is to give an extensive introduction to the subject and the bibliography. It then focusses on minimal models of the temporally and spatially continuous dynamics of freshwater and marine plankton as well as other microorganisms, which is best described by non-linear reaction-diffusion and advection equations.
   4. The fascinating variety of spatio-temporal patterns in such systems and the governing mechanisms of their generation and further dynamics are introduced, making use of a model example of the nutrient-plankton-fish food chain. The formation of rotating spiral patterns is presented.

AB The Cyclops sp. responses of life history baits (growth, development, and reproduction) to food conditions from oligotrophic Lake Toya were analyzed by rearing animals individually under four food regimes: three densities of the alga Cryptomonas tetrapyrenoidosa and nauplii of the calanoid copepod Eurytemora affinis as prey in an algal suspension. Cyclops sp. grew successfully from newborn nauplii to adults when algal density was greater than or equal to 4 x 10(3) cells ml-L. Development time was shorter and body length larger in the high-density (H) treatment (4 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)) than in medium-density (M) treatment (4 x 10(3) cells ml(-1)) until the early copepodite stages. In late copepodite stages, females tended to grow more slowly but tended to be larger in the M treatment than in the H treatment. However, stage-specific growth rates were similar among treatments during development, suggesting a trade-off between body size and development time. Although the egg production rate was higher in the M treatment than in the H treatment, it depended on female body size regardless of the food regime. Furthermore, the weight-specific egg production rate was the same among treatments, indicating egg production was nor affected by the algal concentrations tested. Addition of copepod prey influenced neither postembryonic development time nor body size, and egg production rates were comparable to those reared with an algal diet. These results reveal that even older copepodites and adults, which are generally thought to be predacious, do not necessarily require animal prey for growth and reproduction, and that Cyclops sp. can complete its life cycle on an algal diet alone. Eor female Cyclops sp., reduction of algal density resulted in slow development and large body size, which might be an adaptation to the oligotrophic environment, the original habitat of the copepod.

AB A major objective in behavioural and evolutionary ecology is to understand how animals make decisions in complex environments. Examinations of animal behaviour typically use optimization models to predict the choices animals ought to make. The performance of animals under specific conditions is then compared against the predicted optimal strategy. This optimization approach has come into question because model predictions often do not match animal behaviour exactly. This has led to serious scepticism about the ability of animals to exhibit optimal behaviour in complex environments. We show that conventional approaches that compare observed animal behaviour with single optimal values may bias the way we view real-world variation in animal performance. Considerable insight into the abilities of animals to make optimal decisions can be gained by interpreting why variability in performance exists. We introduce a new theoretical framework, called `multi-objective optimization', which allows us to examine decision-making in complex environments and interpret the meaning of variability in animal performance. A multi-objective approach defines the set of efficient choices animals may make in attempting to reach compromises among multiple conflicting demands. In a multi-objective framework, we may see variation in animal choices, but, unlike single-objective optimizations where there is one `best solution', this variation may represent a range of adaptive compromises to conflicting objectives. An important feature of this approach is that, within the set of efficient alternatives, no choice can be considered to yield higher fitness, a priori, than any other choice. Thus, variability and optimal behaviour may be entirely consistent. We illustrate our point using selected examples from foraging theory where there is already an optimization program in place.

AB Using a seed dish technique in the Simpson Desert, Australia, it was found that ants removed the most seeds in the two time periods tested, followed by birds and then rodents, supporting previous work that has suggested that rodents are a minor element of this granivore community. However, a comparison with an energetics approach suggested that the relative contribution of rodents may have been underestimated. The indirect approach further suggested that at times of peak population numbers, rates of seed removal by Australian rodents may be greater than that by North American rodents.

AB The distribution of niches in resource space and the niche patterns of a 14-species community of Middle Asian desert rodents were studied during two years - at low and high rodent density - using discriminant function analysis. Nineteen quantitative environmental parameters (soil structure and vegetation), measured in 550 plots within 22 1-ha grids, were considered. The first three canonical axes of resource space account for 72% of the variance. The first two axes represent complex environmental gradients: the first axis represents a general landscape gradient from sand to clay soils, the second axis reflects a gradient of increasing productivity. The third axis reflects within-habitat environmental variation. All community parameters, as well as parameters of individual species niches, were unstable between years. At the same time, different parameters vary in different extent. Position of niche centroids along macrohabitat axes, as well as macrohabitat niche breadth, were relatively stable between years, but these parameters for microhabitat axis and values of niche overlap were much more variable. A strong correlation between changes in relative between-habitat niche breadth and differences in average niche overlap with relative changes in species abundances indicate density dependence of these parameters. Changes in niche overlap is a consequence of between-year differences in guild patterns. Guild structure was pronounced at high density when the level of niche overlap was intermediate. At low density, when the level of niche overlap decreased, guild structure was inconspicous. Different levels of diversity differed in their sensitivity to density changes. rr-diversity was relatively constant as a result of between-year stability of niche centroid positions. However level of B-diversity varied significantly between years reflecting changes in the level of niche overlap, because a decrease in niche overlap leads to an increase in the rare of species turnover.

AB Context Agroecology combines agronomic and ecological concepts. It relies on the enhancement of biodiversity and related ecosystem services to support agricultural production. It is dependent on biological interactions for the design and management of agricultural systems in agricultural landscapes. Objectives We review the role of landscape ecology to understand and promote biodiversity, pest regulation and crop pollination for the designing of "agroecology landscapes". We illustrate the use of landscape ecological methods for supporting agroforestry systems as an example of agroecological development, and we propose pathways to implement agroecology at landscape scale. Methods The state of the art of how landscape ecology contributes to agroecology development is summarized based on a literature review. Results Agroecology requires thinking beyond the field scale to consider the positioning, quality and connectivity of fields and semi-natural habitats at larger spatial scales. The spatial and temporal organisation of semi-natural elements and the crop mosaic interact. Understanding this interaction is the pre-requisite for promoting patterns and mechanisms that foster biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Promoting agroecological practices beyond individual farm borders can be rooted in a bottom-up approach from agroecological lighthouse farms to farm networks to amplify agroecology adoption at the landscape scale. Conclusions Achieving agricultural landscapes composed of fields and farms following agroecological management requires understanding of biodiversity patterns, biological interactions and mechanisms that determine and boost ecosystem functioning to improve services at landscape scale, involving farmers in a bottom-up and context-specific approach.

AB Microcystis blooms are a global problem adversely affecting the quality of freshwater in lakes and reservoirs. Surface scum (0-1 m) forms as a result of vertical migration by buoyant Microcystis colonies. Accurate forecasting of bloom and scum development is essential for establishing a reliable alert system and requires understanding the role that physicobiological factors play in the vertical distribution of Microcystis in natural ecosystems. We researched the role of limnological processes on the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies in Lake Kinneret (max depth = 38 m) during a winter-spring bloom. We used measurements from a Laser In situ Scattering and Transmissometry profiler and a plankton image analyser, FlowCAM. Various hydrometeorological conditions were captured during 6 outings from 9 February to 21 March 2017. Thermal stratification and turbulence levels influenced the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies and scum formation. During periods of weak turbulence (e.g., vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity [K-z] <1 cm(2) s(-1)), the volume concentration of Microcystis colonies near the surface abruptly increased. High turbulence levels (e.g., windy conditions) dispersed colonies concentrated near the surface. Simulations of the vertical distribution of Microcystis colonies under different turbulence levels showed that the thickness of the surface scum layer increased and colony concentration of scum decreased as turbulence level increased. We demonstrated that K-z >3 cm(2) s(-1), driven by the wind and surface heating/cooling, dispersed the surface layer of concentrated Microcystis colonies. Our results revealed an underlying interdependency between environmental factors and Microcystis colony distribution that can be utilized to accurately forecast scum formation.

AB Environmental temperatures play a vital role in the physiological and behavioral activity of ectotherms. Behavioral thermoregulation allows animals to modify their body temperature to optimize functions critical to fitness, including digestion, growth, reproduction, and locomotor performance. Diurnal reptiles are a classic model system to answer questions related to thermal ecology, whereas behavioral thermoregulation in nocturnal species is thought to be strongly constrained by low environmental thermal heterogeneity at night. The few studies describing the thermal ecology of nocturnal reptiles indicate a majority of thermoregulatory behavior (if any) occurs during the day within diurnal retreats, but few examined this behavior throughout the night. In tropical systems, thermal heterogeneity may remain high, even at night, allowing nocturnal ectotherms to thermoregulate through conduction on surfaces that retain heat after sunset. We investigated the thermoregulatory behavior of a tropical nocturnal gecko (Australian house gecko, Gehyra dubia) by measuring its preferred temperature in a thermal gradient, and selected body temperatures using radio telemetry, in relation to available operative environmental temperatures obtained using thermal models. Preferred body temperatures of geckos ranged from 31.4 +/- 0.59-34.5 +/- 0.55 degrees C in a laboratory thermal gradient. In the field, during winter, geckos were more effective thermoregulators than in the summer. In low thermal quality habitats, geckos sought rare, warm microclimates at night to maintain body temperatures warmer than most available environmental temperatures, and were highly effective thermoregulators. For ectotherms, appropriate environmental temperatures are a vital resource for survival, similar to food or shelter. The ability to exploit rare microclimates is especially important for nocturnal species, as heterogeneity of environmental temperatures is reduced at night compared to the day. In a warming world, it is vital to understand the thermal ecology of nocturnal ectotherms, as other species may shift to become more nocturnal to avoid lethal diurnal temperatures.

AB Maternal effects often provide a mechanism for adaptive transgenerational phenotypic plasticity. The maternal phenotype can profoundly influence the potential for such environmentally induced adjustments of the offspring phenotype, causing correlations between offspring and maternal traits. Here, we study potential effects of the maternal phenotype on offspring provisioning prior to and during gestation in the matrotrophic live-bearing fish species Poeciliopsis retropinna. Specifically, we examine how maternal traits such as body fat, lean mass, and length relate to pre- (i.e., allocation to the egg prior to fertilization) and post-fertilization (i.e., allocation to the embryo during pregnancy) maternal provisioning and how this ultimately affects offspring size and body composition at birth. We show that pre- and post-fertilization maternal provisioning is associated with maternal length and body fat, but not with maternal lean mass. Maternal length is proportionally associated with egg mass at fertilization and offspring mass at birth, notably without changing the ratio of pre- to post-fertilization maternal provisioning. This ratio, referred to as the matrotrophy index (MI), is often used to quantify the level of matrotrophy. By contrast, the proportion of maternal body fat is positively associated with post-fertilization, but not pre-fertilization, maternal provisioning and consequently is strongly positively correlated with the MI. We furthermore found that the composition of embryos changes throughout pregnancy. Females invest first in embryo lean mass, and then allocate fat reserves to embryos very late in pregnancy. We argue that this delay in fat allocation may be adaptive, because it delays an unnecessary high reproductive burden to the mother during earlier stages of pregnancy, potentially leading to a more slender body shape and improved locomotor performance. In conclusion, our study suggests that (a) offspring size at birth is a plastic trait that is predicted by both maternal length and body fat, and (b) the MI is a plastic trait that is predicted solely by the proportion of maternal body fat. It herewith provides new insights into the potential maternal causes and consequences of embryo provisioning during pregnancy in matrotrophic live-bearing species.

AB Industrial activities play a key role in the economic well-being of a country but they usually involve processes with a more or less profound environmental impact, including emission of pollutants. Among them, much attention has been given to airborne particulate matter (PM) whose exposure is ubiquitous and linked with several adverse health effects mainly due to its size and chemical composition. Therefore, there is a strong need to exploit monitoring systems for airborne PM able to provide accurate information on the potential health hazards and the specific emission sources for the implementation of adequate control strategies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera, L.) is widely used as an indicator of environmental pollution: this social hymenopteran strongly interacts with vegetables, air, soil, and water surrounding the hive and, as a consequence, pollutants from these sources are translated to the insect and to the hive products. During the wide-ranging foraging activity, the forager bee is known to collect samples of the main airborne PM pollutants emitted from different sources and therefore it can be used as an efficient PM sampler. In the present research, PM contaminating forager bees living nearby a cement factory and several kilometers away from it has been analysed and characterised morphologically, dimensionally and chemically through SEM/EDX. This provided detailed information on the role of both the cement manufacturing activities and the vehicular traffic as sources of airborne PM. This may indeed help the implementation of appropriate preventive and corrective actions that would effectively minimize the environmental spread of pollutant PM not only in areas close to the plant, but also in more distant areas.

AB Freshwater systems are characterized by an enormous diversity of eukaryotic protists and prokaryotic taxa. The community structures in different lakes are thereby influenced by factors such as habitat size, lake chemistry, biotic interactions, and seasonality. In our study, we used high throughput 454 sequencing to study the diversity and temporal changes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic planktonic communities in three Austrian lakes during the ice-free season. In the following year, one lake was sampled again with a reduced set of sampling dates to observe reoccurring patterns. Cluster analyses (based on SSU V9 (eukaryotic) and V4 (prokaryotic) OTU composition) grouped samples according to their origin followed by separation into seasonal clusters, indicating that each lake has a unique signature based on OTU composition. These results suggest a strong habitat-specificity of microbial communities and in particular of community patterns at the OTU level. A comparison of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic datasets via co-inertia analysis (CIA) showed a consistent clustering of prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples, probably reacting to the same environmental forces (e.g., pH, conductivity). In addition, the shifts in eukaryotic and bacterioplanktonic communities generally occurred at the same time and on the same scale. Regression analyses revealed a linear relationship between an increase in Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and elapsed time. Our study shows a pronounced coupling between bacteria and eukaryotes in seasonal samplings of the three analyzed lakes. However, our temporal resolution (biweekly sampling) and data on abiotic factors were insufficient to determine if this was caused by direct biotic interactions or by reacting to the same seasonally changing environmental forces.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB 1. Dispersal ecology is a topical discipline that involves understanding and predicting plant community responses to multiple drivers of global change. Propagule movements that entail long-distance dispersal (LDD) events are crucial for plants to reach and colonize suitable sites across fragmented landscapes. Yet, LDD events are extremely rare, and thus, obtaining reliable estimates of the maximum distances that propagules move across and of their frequency has been a long-lasting challenge in plant ecology. Recent advances in dispersal ecology have provided reliable records of dispersal distances, but they remain confined to focal populations, limiting our ability to infer the frequency and actual extent of LDD events across landscapes.
   2. In this study, we view LDD events as extreme values of a dispersal function, and we apply statistics of extremes to derive the frequency and extent of LDD events of simulated and empirical data sets. We first briefly explain the rationale behind statistics of extremes, and we then illustrate how dispersal ecology can benefit conceptually and analytically from applying extreme value analyses. We apply the block maxima approach to simulated seed shadows, and we apply the peak over a threshold method to empirical data sets that contain pollen and seed dispersal distances recorded for a population of Prunus mahaleb, an insect-pollinated and vertebrate-dispersed tree species.
   3. Diagnostic plots reveal a distance threshold of upsilon = 80 m for pollen grains and of upsilon = 170 m for dispersed seeds. Values that exceed the threshold fit a light-tailed distribution function for pollen and fit a fat-tailed Pareto distribution for seed dispersal distances. Both distribution functions estimate a low (but nonzero) conditional probability of reaching distant locations, extending well beyond the borders of our focal population as follows: Pr (X >= 1 km) = 9 x 10(-5) for pollen grains and Pr (X >= 10 km) = 7 x 10(-5) for dispersed seeds.
   4. Synthesis. Dispersal ecologists can take the most of their dispersal distance records by applying statistics of extremes to infer the probability of occurrence of extremely rare, but crucial, long distance dispersal events that reach locations well beyond focal populations.

AB 1. The giant limpet Patella ferruginea is the most endangered endemic species in the Mediterranean Sea. It is at serious risk of extinction, especially along the coast of Corsica and Italy. The small population of P. ferruginea in the marine protected area (MPA) Penisola del Sinis - Isola di Mal di Ventre (W Sardinia, Italy) is an isolated unit whose preservation is critical also from the perspective of conservation genetics.
   2. This study considered the impact of illegal harvesting on the conservation status of P. ferruginea in the MPA. Site accessibility (semi-accessible and hardly accessible) and legal protection (Zone A, B, C) were considered in two field surveys conducted in the Mal di Ventre Island in 2011 and 2013. Furthermore, Zone A was monitored annually from 2009 to 2013 to assess population dynamics and extinction risk.
   3. In summer 2013 the total population size was estimated at 310 specimens (0.016 +/- 0.005 ind m(-1)) with a significant decrease compared with 2011 (-52%), mainly due to poaching. Significantly higher density was found in the hardly accessible sites (0.039 +/- 0.007 ind m-1 in 2013) and generally in Zone A (0.042 +/- 0.009 ind m(-1) in 2013). The size distribution showed a similar pattern, with larger sized individuals in those sites with maximum legal protection and a lower degree of accessibility. Juveniles (<25 mm) were almost absent and the mean individual growth rate (2.6 +/- 0.5 mm yr(-1)) was lower in comparison with other Mediterranean populations. The population viability analysis predicted that, with current rates of harvesting, P. ferruginea may face local extinction within the next 10 years.
   4. Without a joint effort towards the protection of intertidal habitats by enforcement bodies, regulators, researchers and sea users, the MPA will not achieve its conservation objectives and P. ferruginea will disappear from Mal di Ventre Island. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Within the past few decades, telemetry has proven to be a valuable tool for tracking and monitoring fish. Although the advent of smaller transmitters has made these methods increasingly applicable to small-bodied fishes, limited information currently exists regarding the efficacy of these transmitters or their putative effects on small-bodied fishes. I evaluated the physiological and performance consequences of PIT tag implantation in a small-bodied, sexually dimorphic stream fish, the Blackspotted Topminnow Fundulus olivaceus. First, I used a common-garden experiment in an outdoor mesocosm setting to assess the long-term effects (184 d) of PIT tag implantation on a suite of physiological and phenotypic metrics. I randomly assigned 216 individuals (50-73 mm SL; equal sex ratio) to one of three tagging treatments: control (no PIT tag), small (8 mm) PIT tag, or large (12 mm) PIT tag. Survivorship did not vary among treatment groups, and the presence of the tags had no apparent effects on the condition or development of the intraperitoneal organs relative to that observed in control fish. Fish that received large PIT tags showed reduced growth rates relative to fish that received small PIT tags; however, this appeared to result in a trade-off that prioritized reproductive output. Second, I evaluated fish swimming performance (kinematics and endurance) to assess potential hydrodynamic consequences of PIT tag implantation. Kinematics (tailbeat frequency, amplitude, and total displacement) and endurance swimming were similar across all treatments and between sexes, with only slight idiosyncratic effects observed. These results indicate that 8-mm and 12-mm PIT tags are appropriate for use in adult Blackspotted Topminnow as no detrimental long-term effects were observed.

AB Spatial periodic forcing can entrain a pattern-forming system in the same way as temporal periodic forcing can entrain an oscillator. The forcing can lock the pattern's wave number to a fraction of the forcing wave number within tonguelike domains in the forcing parameter plane, it can increase the pattern's amplitude, and it can also create patterns below their onset. We derive these results using a multiple-scale analysis of a spatially forced Swift-Hohenberg equation in one spatial dimension. In two spatial dimensions the one-dimensional forcing can induce a symmetry-breaking instability that leads to two-dimensional (2D) patterns, rectangular or oblique. These patterns resonate with the forcing by locking their wave-vector component in the forcing direction to half the forcing wave number. The range of this type of 2:1 resonance overlaps with the 1:1 resonance tongue of stripe patterns. Using a multiple-scale analysis in the overlap region we show that the 2D patterns can destabilize the 1:1 resonant stripes even at exact resonance. This result sheds new light on the use of spatial periodic forcing for controlling patterns.

AB 1.The zooplankton in Lake Kinneret (Israel) have undergone large fluctuations in recent decades, which have been linked to both biotic and abiotic processes. 2.By applying a data-driven modelling approach to a long-term database, and focusing on key abiotic (lake-level change) and biotic (prey abundance) variables, we attempted to identify the possible factors impacting the lake's zooplankton community. 3.We hypothesised that changes in the predatory zooplankton (adult cyclopoids) assemblage are driven by changes in lake level during years of large changes. We further postulated that lake-level changes would have a similar impact on the herbivorous zooplankton (cladocerans and cyclopoid copepodites) but an opposite effect on the microzooplankton. In the years of moderate changes to lake level, however, the abundance of predatory zooplankton would determine the size of the herbivore and microzooplankton populations rather than their food sources, that is, top-down control. 4.The resulting decision trees supported the hypotheses stressing the importance of the annual rate of lake-level change in shaping the zooplankton community in the lake. In addition, and in contrast to expectations, bottom-up processes seem to play a role in determining zooplankton abundance.

AB A novel, yet generic, Bayesian approach to parameter inference in a stochastic, spatio-temporal model of dispersal and colonisation is developed and applied to the invasion of a region by an alien plant species. The method requires species distribution data from multiple time points, and accounts for temporal uncertainty in colonisation times inherent in such data. Covariates, such as climate parameters, altitude and land use, which capture variation in the suitability of sites for plant colonisation, are easily incorporated into the model. The method assumes no local extinction of occupied sites and thus is primarily applicable to modelling distribution data at relatively coarse spatial resolutions of plant species whose range is expanding over time. The implementation of the model and inference algorithm are illustrated through application to British floristic atlas data for the widespread alien Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) assessed at a 10 X 10 km resolution in 1970 and 2000. We infer key characteristics of this species, predict its future spread, and use the resulting fitted model to inform a simulation-based assessment of the methodology. Simulated distribution data are used to validate the inference algorithm. Our results suggest that the accuracy of inference is not sensitive to the number of distribution time points, requiring only that there are at least two points in time when distributions are mapped. We demonstrate the utility of the modelling approach by making future forecasts and historic hindcasts of the distribution of giant hogweed in Great Britain. Giant hogweed is one of the worst alien plants in Britain and has rapidly increased its range since 1970, yet we highlight that a further 20% of land area remains susceptible to colonisation by this species. We use the robustness of this case study to discuss the potential for modelling distribution data for other species and at different spatial scales.

AB Bergmann's rule states that, within species of endotherms, individuals tend to be larger in cooler environments, and has been reputed to apply to some ectotherms including amphibians. However, the validity of the rule has been debated, questioning whether Bergmann's dines are generally present in anurans. In the view, we studied altitudinal variation in body size in the rice frog (Rana limnocharis) among populations from Sichuan province located at three altitudes to find if there exist any differences in a relatively small altitudinal range (290-375 m). The results showed that individuals from higher altitudes tended to be larger in body size than lower altitudes, which was consistent with Bergmann's cline. Moreover, when the effect of age was removed, variation in body size of the frogs across altitudes still remained. Our findings suggested that age affected the pattern of variation in body size across the altitudinal cline, we also discussed that factors other than age also contributed to size differences among populations.

AB Tree invasions of grasslands are occurring globally, with profound consequences for ecosystem structure and function. We explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of tree invasion of a montane meadow in the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, where meadow loss is a conservation concern. We examine the early stages of invasion, where extrinsic and intrinsic processes can be clearly delineated. In a 0.21-ha plot, we mapped and aged 929 trees a parts per thousand yen0.3-m tall, yielding a detailed record of the spatio-temporal dynamics of invasion. For the primary species, Abies grandis and Pinus contorta, we correlated age structures (unimodal in both species) with climate (precipitation, temperature, and snowpack) and cone production, but found weak or non-significant relationships. Evidence of biotic interactions within and between species was obtained by examining the spatial associations of trees to a distance of 5 m and how these changed over time. We used multiple methods including uni- and bivariate forms of the Ripley's K and pair-correlation function (pcf) (corrected for inhomogeneity), the J-function, an evolving nearest-neighbor metric, and a test for directional bias in establishment. Pinus and Abies contributed in contrasting ways to the pace and spatial structure of invasion. Shade-intolerant Pinus tended to establish in the open, initiating clusters. In contrast, shade-tolerant Abies established in association with Pinus or in conspecific clusters. Preferential establishment of Abies to the north of older Pinus suggests that facilitation occurs by shading. The factors responsible for initial establishment remain unresolved, but positive interactions are pivotal in accelerating invasions, once initiated. Similar processes are likely to occur in other grasslands undergoing rapid conversion to woodland or forest. In combination, analyses of spatial and temporal patterns of establishment provide insight into the processes that structure invasions.

AB The maternal manipulation hypothesis states that ectothermic females modify thermal conditions during embryonic development to benefit their offspring (anticipatory maternal effect). However, the recent theory suggests that the ultimate currency of an adaptive maternal effect is female fitness that can be maximized also by decreasing mean fitness of individual offspring. We evaluated benefits of temperature oviposition preferences in Alpine newts (Ichthyosaura [formerly Triturus] alpestris) by comparing the thermal sensitivity of maternal and offspring traits across a range of preferred oviposition temperatures (12, 17, and 22 degrees C) and by manipulating the egg-predation risk during oviposition in a laboratory thermal gradient (12-22 degrees C). All traits showed varying responses to oviposition temperatures. Embryonic developmental rates increased with oviposition temperature, whereas hatchling size and swimming capacity showed the opposite pattern. Maternal oviposition and egg-predation rates were highest at the intermediate temperature. In the thermal gradient, females oviposited at the same temperature despite the presence of caged egg-predators, water beetles (Agabus bipustulatus). We conclude that female newts prefer a particular temperature for egg-deposition to maximize their oviposition performance rather than offspring fitness. The evolution of advanced reproductive modes, such as prolonged egg-retention and viviparity, may require, among others, the transition from selfish temperature preferences for ovipositon to the anticipatory maternal effect.

AB The management of reclaimed slopes derived from industrial and civil activities (e. g. surface mining and road construction) requires the development of practical stability analysis approaches that integrate the processes and mechanisms that rule the dynamics of these ubiquitous emerging ecosystems. This work describes a new modelling approach focused on stability analysis of water-limited reclaimed slopes, where interactive relationships between rill erosion and vegetation regulate ecosystem stability. Our framework reproduces two main groups of possible trends along the temporal evolution of reclaimed slopes: successful trends, characterized by widespread vegetation development and the effective control of rill erosion processes; and gullying trends, characterized by the progressive loss of vegetation and a sharp logistic increase in erosion rates. Furthermore, this analytical approach allows the determination of threshold values for the state variables (i.e. vegetation cover and rill erosion) that drive the system's stability, facilitating the identification of critical situations that require specific human intervention (e. g. revegetation or, in very problematic cases, revegetation combined with rill network destruction) to ensure the long-term sustainability of the restored ecosystem. The application of our threshold analysis framework in Mediterranean-dry reclaimed slopes derived from surface coal mining (the Teruel coalfield in central-eastern Spain) showed a good field-based performance. Therefore, we believe that this model is a valuable contribution for the management of water-limited reclaimed systems, including those associated with rill erosion, as it provides a tool for the evaluation of restoration success and can play an important role in decision-making during ecosystem restoration in severely disturbed landscapes.

AB Facilitation (positive plant-plant interactions) is a potential means to accelerate vegetation restoration in arid areas. Shrubs can accelerate vegetation recovery by means of soil amelioration, but this effect has not been evaluated at large spatial scales or across scales. Here, we examined the facilitative function of shrub change across spatial scales at a desert steppe in Mongolia. Using a high-resolution satellite image, we established five 2500 m(2) plots in each of three shrub density classes (low, moderate, high) in a desert steppe in Mongolia. To evaluate the facilitative functions of shrubs at multiple spatial scales. we recorded the total number of plant species at three nested spatial scales in each plot: 25,400, and 2500 m(2). The facilitative effect of shrubs on plant species richness was more pronounced at larger scales. Denser shrub communities increased plant species diversity at a larger scale. However, the increased taxonomic diversity was not clearly related to increased functional diversity in this system. This scale dependency in species diversity can be explained by the degree to which spatial heterogeneity of habitats within the plots increased as plot size increased. These results support the hypothesis of scale-dependent changes in the balance between facilitation and competition. Therefore, transplanting shrub saplings at high-density and a larger scale could potentially improve the success of vegetation restoration in arid regions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We studied geographical and temporal body size trends among 169 adult museum specimens of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) collected in Sweden between 1962 and 2008, whose sex, year of collection, and locality were known. Skull size and body mass increased significantly in relation to the year of collection, and skull size (but not body mass) was significantly and negatively related to latitude, contrasting Bergmann's rule and the trend found for Norwegian otters. Latitudinal differences in body size between the two countries may be due to differences in food availability. The temporal increase in body size among Swedish otters resembled that observed for Norway otters, though Swedish otters are smaller with respect to their Norwegian counterparts. Latitude and year represent a combination of environmental factors, including ambient temperature in the year of collection as well as the number of days of ice coverage. We replaced the above factors with mean annual temperature or the number of days of ice coverage, and found that each of these factors explains a similar proportion of the variation in body size as did latitude and year. We hypothesize that this temporal increase in body size is related to a combination of factors, including reduced energy expenditure resulting from increasing ambient temperature, and increased food availability from longer ice-free periods.

AB Global change is exacerbating the need for more effective mechanisms and approaches for working towards economic, social/cultural and environmental sustainability. It is now well recognised that science for sustainability will require integrated problem-focussed research that is by nature trans-disciplinary. Resolutions to both global and regional scale issues must involve participation of a diverse number of stakeholders. One region that would benefit greatly from such an integrated approach is the Northern Territory of Australia. This area is home to some of the most pristine savanna landscapes in the world and it is also occupied by one of the oldest living human cultures which are still in existence today. However, in recent years there has been increasing pressure to develop this region. The Northern Territory is also facing problems associated with having a growing Aboriginal population with deepening health and social problems. So as well as needing to facilitate adaptation in response to global change and development for economic prosperity of the region, there is an obligation to alter management practices to reduce social disadvantage. In light of this, it will be important that future landscapes are multifunctional and designed to ensure the preservation of biological and cultural diversity, as well as having provision for the livelihoods of the people that live within them. This article recommends the adoption of a landscape ecological approach for strategic development and sustainable planning, which captures and incorporates the values and identities of the different stakeholders, as well as engaging them in a continuous, adaptive process of planning and management, and in doing so discusses the importance of human ecological holism as part of the conceptual framework for landscape ecology.

AB Resins are a critical resource for stingless bees and resin -collecting bees act as seed dispersers in tropical plants. We describe the diurnal foraging patterns of colonies of Trigona sapiens and T. hockingsi on resin and pollen. We also document patterns of waste removal and seed dispersal of Corymbia torelliana. At most, only 10% of foragers collected resin or dispersed seed. Nevertheless, bees dispersed 1-3 seeds outside the nest per 5 minutes, and 38-114 seeds per day for each nest. The proportion of returning bees carrying pollen was highest in the morning for both species. The proportion of foragers returning with resin loads showed no significant diurnal variation in any season. Waste removal activity peaked in the afternoon for T. sapiens and in the morning for T. hockingsi. Seed removal peaked in the afternoon in one year only for T. sapiens. Bees dispersed thousands of seeds of C. torelliana over the season even though only a small proportion of the colony was engaged in seed transport.

   RESPONSES; IMPACTS; SHEEP
AB The substantial increase of deer populations in Europe and North America in recent decades has led to concerns regarding the long-term sustainability of current management from an ecosystem perspective. Key questions to be answered are how herbivore density relates to available resource levels, e.g. food availability and browsing pressure, and how this relation should be monitored and included in management. In Norway, the harvest of red deer Cervus elaphus has increased from 1,479 to 35,700 during 1960-2008. Current monitoring programmes focus on deer body mass and number of seen deer rather than on the state of the vegetation communities. In our study, we quantify browsing frequency on common shrubs and trees in two municipalities, Gloppen and Flora, in the county of Sogn and Fjordane, Norway, to document current browsing pressure levels and to evaluate the potential of using browsing frequency of indicator species as a tool in the monitoring of red deer populations. We found that several species were heavily browsed (median browsing frequency > 60%). Due to their wide availability, we analysed the spatial patterns of accumulated browsing of the highly selected rowan Sorbus aucuparia compared to the less selected bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus and birch Betula sp. We predicted less spatial variation in browsing frequency of the highly selected rowan. However, we found that the best model predicting browsing on rowan (forest type, habitat productivity, canopy cover, aspect, slope and distance to arable land) based on habitat variables was more complicated than for birch (habitat productivity and altitude) and bilberry (forest type, habitat productivity, altitude and distance from the coast). This suggests large spatial variation in browsing frequency of rowan even though the average browsing frequency of rowan was higher than for bilberry and birch. Browsing frequency for all species was positively correlated with faeces counts, but only bilberry showed additional correlation with red deer (harvest) density at the local management unit scale. Due to its wide distribution and promising link to local red deer density, bilberry stands out as the most promising species to monitor among winter browse species. However, browsing frequency on different species was not always correlated. It remains to be determined to which extent browsing on bilberry can be used as an indicator for the browsing pressure on the whole vegetation community. The documentation of high browsing frequencies clearly suggests that further focus on these issues is warranted.

AB Diatom assemblages preserved in lake sediment records can provide proxy data of past environmental changes in biological conditions. In order to investigate past changes in the environment of north-central Michigan, diatom assemblages were studied in sediment cores retrieved from 24 lakes. Diatoms were analyzed from the 'top' and 'bottom' of each core to reconstruct land-use changes in this area. Aulacoseira taxa were identified and evaluated with light and scanning electron microscopy. Results of these observations showed the presence of some variability of the morphological features within North American species populations. Diatom species composition in surface sediments and differences between tops and bottoms corresponded to changes in land use surrounding the lakes, ranging from predominantly forest and rangeland to urban and agriculturally impacted. Diatom-inferred past conditions revealed that the observed morphotypes probably represent taxa with different ecological preferences. The main factors influencing the variability of these morphotypes are changes in the trophic status of the lakes.

AB Oligophagous and polyphagous predators are confronted with spatially and temporally varying distributions of prey. Their species-specific foraging strategies should be able to cope with this variability. Using an individual based model, we explore how diet breath and the spatial scale at which predators respond to prey affects their capture efficiency in four heterogeneous prey landscapes, and combinations thereof. We interpret the spatial scale of the predator's response as perceptual range, and propose giving-up density as a proxy for diet breadth. Foraging behaviour is evaluated for a total of 121 perceptual range/giving-up density combinations, with four of them reflecting the strategies adopted by real ladybeetle species. Foraging rules of oligophagous ladybeetles were generally not very effective in terms of attained predation rate when foraging in a single prey landscape, but appear to be more effective when foraging in multiple prey landscapes. This finding is compatible with the notion that oligophagous predators do not adopt a foraging strategy that is especially adapted to a specific prey landscape, but to multiple prey landscapes. Simulations further indicated that there was not a 'best' foraging rule that resulted in the highest predation rates for a range of spatial prey distributions and prey densities. The findings thus suggest that strategies of four ladybeetle species are effective in generating sufficient prey capture under a broad range of spatial distributions, rather than maximum capture under a narrower set of distributions.

AB Natural and human-induced differences in frugivore assemblages can influence the seed dispersal distances of trees. An important issue in seed dispersal systems is to understand whether differences in seed dispersal distances also affect the genetic structure of mature trees. One possible approach to test for a relationship between seed dispersal and the genetic structure of mature trees is to compare the genetic structure of two closely related tree species between two biogeographical regions that differ in frugivore assemblages and seed dispersal distances. Previous studies on two Commiphora species revealed that Commiphora guillauminii in Madagascar has a much lower seed dispersal distance than Commiphora harveyi in South Africa. We tested whether the lower seed dispersal distance might have caused decreased gene flow, resulting in a stronger genetic structure in Madagascar than in South Africa.
   Madagascar and South Africa.
   Using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers we investigated the genetic structure of 134 trees in Madagascar and 158 trees in South Africa at a local and a regional spatial scale.
   In concordance with our hypothesis, kinship analysis suggests that gene flow was restricted mostly to 3 km in Madagascar and to 30 km in South Africa. At the local spatial scale, the genetic differentiation among groups of trees within sample sites was marginally significantly higher in Madagascar (F-ST = 0.069) than in South Africa (F-ST = 0.021). However, at a regional spatial scale genetic differentiation was lower in Madagascar (F-ST = 0.053) than in South Africa (F-ST = 0.163).
   Our results show that lower seed dispersal distances of trees were linked to higher genetic differentiation of trees only at a local spatial scale. This suggests that seed dispersal affects the genetic population structure of trees at a local, but not at a regional, spatial scale.

AB One of the greatest challenges for Latin America and the Caribbean, the most biologically and culturally diverse region in the world, is to halt the loss of species caused by habitat destruction and land degradation. Up to now, setting aside protected natural areas is considered the most effective alternative to conserve biodiversity. Protected areas. however, are under increasing assault by agricultural. silvicultural, and industrial development that surround and isolate them, reducing their habitat quality at the landscape scale. Among the different types of protected areas that have been proposed, biosphere reserves stand out for their attempt to compatibilize social development and conservation. Their management is the most amenable to integration of natural and human disturbance, inclusion of traditional management techniques, and participation by social and economic sectors in the administration. Biosphere reserves have proliferated all over the world, and today there are 53 1 of them located in 105 countries. where they protect vast ecological and Cultural diversity. Even though the design of biosphere reserves is based on the landscape concept. it has vet to take into account ecosystem scales, possible long-term effects of disturbances, and better integrate and give higher consideration to the knowledge and experience of numerous ethnic groups that live within them. However, doing so requires a transformation of the function of the core, buffer. and transition areas. The Current design of biosphere reserves is centripetal because the main function of the buffer zone is to protect biodiversity in the core. We propose a centrifugal model. where biodiversity of the core spreads freely toward the area of greater human influence with the buffer zone functioning as a connector. This connectivity can promote land-use practices that are in alignment with both ecosystems functioning and biodiversity conservation in natural. semi-natural. urban and industrial landscapes.

AB Habitat selection by individuals is often a density-dependent process:as density increases, the quality of the habitat decreases due to resource competition and interference. These same changes in habitat quality should likewise affect the foraging efforts of individuals at the patch scale. We used density manipulations, fenced enclosures in the field, to examine patch use in two species of gerbils, Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi and G. pyramidum. At the same time, we used sand tracking to measure activity densities and confirm that gerbils show density-dependent habitat selection across the stabilized and semistabilized sand habitats. We then quantified individual patch use, using giving-up densities (GUD; the amount of food left behind in a resource patch following exploitation) in artificial food patches. Gerbils used resource patches in a density-dependent manner, showing lower GUDs at higher activity densities. Interestingly, this was not the case in both habitats. In the stabilized sand habitat, GUDs for both gerbils were high. and decreased with increasing activity density, but in the semistabilized dune habitat, GUDs remained constantly low. This led GUDs in the two habitats to converge at high activity densities. For these surprising findings We Suggest two mechanistically different explanations, one that relies oil the ideal despotic distribution and the other, on safety in numbers. Evidence Supports the second hypothesis, in which safety is pumped from the semistabilized to the stabilized habitat with increasing activity density.

DT Article
ID PASSERINE BIRDS; MASS; DIET; RULE
AB Recent studies indicated that body size of various animals, including birds, changed during the twentieth century, and these changes were attributed to changes in food availability and climate. We used museum skins of goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) collected between 1854 and 1941 and between 1979 and 1998 in order to check whether body size of this species in Denmark changed during the study period. We compared three body measurements (wing, beak and tarsus length) and the first principal component (PC1) derived from these measurements of four groups of goshawks (adult and immature, females and males). We found that the wing length of goshawks collected after 1979 was significantly smaller in comparison with those collected before this year, and females were more affected than males. Immature birds (but not adults) collected after 1979 had significantly shorter beaks than those from the early period. Immature females collected after 1979 had shorter tarsi than those collected in the early period. There was a significant decrease in body size (as represented by PC1) from the early to late period, which was more pronounced among females and immature birds. In conclusion, body size of goshawks in Denmark decreased during the twentieth century.

AB Ground squirrels are often described as preferring open grassland habitats to increase their chances of locating predatory threats while visually surveying their surroundings. This description is often based on the assumption that ground squirrels require clear views to promote detection of predators. We studied a population of Uinta ground squirrels (Spermophilus armatus) inhabiting patches of grassland and sagebrush in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park to determine if the presence of view-obstructing vegetation would be associated with differences in vigilance behavior of individuals. We also compared rates of weight gain and population estimates in grassland and sagebrush patches to determine if these factors would vary in association with differences in time budgets and perceived risk of predation in these patch types. Although there were differences among sites in time spent foraging and maintaining vigilance, these differences were not consistent between sites of similar habitat and degree of visual obstruction. These results suggest that the relationship between visibility and vigilance for this species may be complicated by the dual nature of shrubs as visual obstructions and as protection from attacking predators. The relationship between these 2 factors will likely influence how prey species respond to alterations to the vegetative structure of their environments. Ground squirrels, specifically, appear to be capable of adapting to variation in the structure of the vegetation and will likely thrive as long as an abundance of grasses are available to provide fattening seeds for forage.

AB One goal of this study was to determine the combination of hydration and temperature in the northern cricket frog Acris crepitans that allowed maximum jump distance in the laboratory. Second, environmental variables in the field were measured to determine the best predictor(s) of mean body temperature and hydration and to determine whether frogs maintain levels of temperature and hydration yielding maximum jump distance. Laboratory data revealed that hydration and the hydration-temperature interaction significantly affected jump performance. Frogs at 95% and 85% hydration jumped significantly better than frogs at 75% hydration, but frogs at 95% hydration at 15 degreesC jumped significantly poorer than those at 95% hydration at 30 degreesC. Animals at 85% hydration at 30 degreesC and 85% hydration at 15 degreesC jumped just as well as those at 95% hydration at 30 degreesC. Mean body temperature of 55 frogs in the field was 28.0 degreesC, and hydration was 97.4%. Sky condition ( sunny, cloudy, or partly cloudy) was the best predictor of frog hydration, and air temperature was the best predictor of frog body temperature. Cricket frogs in the field maintain a hydration and temperature near those found to yield maximum jump distances in laboratory trials. This may be a behavioral adaptation to allow maximum jump distance during predator avoidance.

AB Nutrient management a, Dutch dairy farms is changing rapidly fro. strong reliance on external inputs to more prudent utilization of internal resources. This paper explores opportunities and constraints arising from this shift towards eco-technological management. A mathematical model of inorganic and organic nitrogen (N) flows in a dairy farming system was formulated based on ecological concepts, integrating processes of nutrient input, recycling, immobilization and mineralization. Recycling is defined as the mineralization of N within the year of its incorporation into herbage, which occurs through release from faeces, animal urine and non-harvested biomass. We simulated changes in inorganic and organic N per hectare, and the consequent emission (F), mineralization (M-s) and recycling (R) of N for different initial amounts of inorganic and organic N. Results demonstrate that in the long term, the system evolves to equilibrium amounts of inorganic and organic N, which are strongly determined by the imposed management practices, such as fertilizer input and grassland management. In the short term, moving away from the equilibrium is possible for particular initial amounts of inorganic and organic N. In the equilibrium state, E was reduced by lowering inorganic fertilizer input rate, increasing grassland productivity and improving animal N conversion efficiency, i.e., only by production-related parameters. Only in the short term E was affected by adjustments in quality-related parameters: lower N content, lower digestibility of herbage, reduced degradability of non-harvested biomass and faeces, and parameters determining the functioning of soil biota (degradation rate, efficiency, C/N ratio). Quality-related parameters had no effect on internal nutrient cycling in the equilibrium state, because adjustments in Ms were completely compensated by changes in R. A comparison of farming systems demonstrated that farming systems can be designed in such a way that improvement of internal nutrient cycling supports the same production with lower inputs and lower emissions.

AB We examined how selective seed predation by the introduced red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) influenced an old field plant assemblage by observing the ants' effects on ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) distribution and growth. Ragweed had higher cover on ant mounds than off mounds, and plants growing on the mounds had higher aboveground biomass than did plants growing away from mounds. Nitrate concentrations were higher on ant mound soil, while concentrations of organic matter, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, and zinc were higher in soil off ant mounds.
   In seed predation experiments, ragweed seeds were selected less often than those of four other early successional species: pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), bluegrass (Poa annua), common lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album), and goldenrod (Solidago altissima). Moreover, fire ants selected both larger and smaller seeds than those of ragweed indicating that selection was not driven by relative seed size. There was an increase in the number of ragweed seeds removed by fire ants as the summer progressed, suggesting that more ragweed seeds were incorporated into the diet of fire ants as other species of seeds became less abundant. Lastly, nearly all seeds of pigweed (a preferred species) placed 1, 2, 3 and 4 meters from ant mounds were consumed, which suggests that fire ants may effectively forage the entire field. Both fire ants and ragweed are early successional species that rapidly invade disturbed areas created by humans and natural events. Fire ants significantly contributed to the success of ragweed plants growing in an old field community.

AB Two types of acorns (fresh, current-year acorns and old, previous-year acorns) of Quercus liaotungensis were used under two different situations (night and day) to examine the removal and predation by animals in the field. The acorns disappeared very fast. During the day, all of the 280 'this-year' acorns (TA) and all of the 140 'last-year' acorns (LA) were removed by animals within 6 h and 5 h, respectively, after acorns were pur in place. At night, all of the 280 TA acorns were removed by animals within 10 h after acorns were distributed, and 71 out of 140 LA acorns were removed within 10 h. Animals consumed a small proportion of acorns in situ (11.8%). The number of TA acorns consumed in situ at night was higher than that during the day. During the day, the number of LA acorns consumed in situ was significantly higher than TA acorns. This result suggests that the most important harvesters of Q. liaotungensis during the day were visually orientated diurnal animals, and the most important harvesters ar night were olfactorily orientated nocturnal animals. Furthermore, the latter are more efficient than the former at finding and harvesting acorns, because they spend less energy on harvesting the same number of sound acorns.

AB We examined the effects of nectar guides of artificial flowers on the feeding behavior of naive and experienced butterflies, Pieris rapae crucivora Boisduval. A colored spot on artificial flowers triggered the responses of naive butterflies to probe around the spot on the flower, which contributed to their finding the source of nectar. This means that the spot acted as a nectar guide. Butterflies correlated nectar guides with the nectar source and improved their foraging efficiency by experience. Such improvement was not observed on flowers without a guide, which suggested that the nectar guide should play an important role in the improvement of foraging efficiency in P. rapae butterflies. Furthermore, butterflies foraged more consistently on flowers with a guide than those without guide after three days of conditioning for either flower type. If this foraging manner is widespread among other insect pollinators, visit consistency based on insect learning might have been a selective force for the nectar guide in natural entomophilous flowers.

AB State and transition (ST) descriptions of rangeland vegetation dynamics provide information on current perceptions of explicit causes of change in dominant vegetation. Structural attributes of ST applications allow an evaluation of the complexity of the ST model and comparisons with the organization of the traditional succession-retrogression model of secondary succession. An analysis of 29 applications of the ST model revealed consistent trends. The number of transitions connecting states showed a less-than-expected increase with the size of the application. This is probably associated with limitations to interpret complex relationships and a need to produce relatively simple applications. Larger applications exhibited a shift towards stable states with pivotal positions within structures less connected (i.e., with fewer transitions) than expected by chance for a given number of states. Thus, some stable states assume hey intermediary roles as the number of states considered increases. It is debatable whether this is a property of larger systems or an effect of modeling bias. The analysis of causes of vegetation change confirmed current perceptions about the importance of man-related sources of disturbance. Grazing, fire, and control of woody plant species are visualized as the most relevant man-related agents of change. Some ST applications retain autogenic behaviors embedded in transitions in spite of the event-driven nature of the approach. However, the ST model removes autogenic processes from their central role as general causes for vegetation change. This approach is theoretically very limited because no general properties or attributes of the components (e.g., plant species assemblages, individual species) or processes (e.g., growth, reproduction, mineralization) of the system are used in any comprehensive way to generate predictive rules of wider than local relevance. Alternative approaches are suggested that would allow ecological generalizations and comparisons across systems.

AB Parental care occurring after hatching of eggs in precocial birds has been assumed to have no effect on offspring survival because young feed themselves, and behaviour such as vigilance or defence benefits ail young regardless of brood size. We tested this assumption by manipulating clutch and brood size of wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and subsequently monitoring survival of ducklings. Offspring survival in enlarged broods tended to be lower than in control broods. By 14 days after hatching, enlarged broods had no more ducklings surviving than did controls. Brooding efficiency (i.e., the effectiveness of hear transfer from a care-giving female to her young) was evaluated with captive mallards in an environmental chamber where we manipulated ambient temperature and brood size, and monitored duckling temperature (T-d). There was no difference in T-d in broods of different sizes, but variation in T-d increased with brood size. Under natural conditions, the female's inability to effectively cover large broods could reduce duckling survival. Thus, brooding may represent one posthatching behaviour that could limit clutch size in precocial birds.

AB It is largely unknown how the presence and morphology of various auditory structures, including extratympanic structures, affect auditory sensitivity in anuran amphibians. This study examines body size, tympanum size, the presence versus absence of the tympanum, the 'external' versus 'internal' status of the tympanum, and the amphibian and basilar papilla (AP and BP) hair cell counts, as they relate to physiological estimates of auditory sensitivity, within both AP- and BP-sensitive frequency ranges. The BP sensitivity is positively correlated with tympanum area, which is positively correlated with body size. The AP sensitivity is also correlated with body size, perhaps through mediation by extratympanic factors. Tympanum presence affects only BP sensitivity, whereas the external/internal status of the tympanum is irrelevant. Lastly, AP hair cell count correlates with AP sensitivity, irrespective of possible sensory convergence effects.

AB The validation of a water-quality model for the Seneca River, a deep, stratifying, slow-moving river located in central New York, is documented.  Model validation is supported by comprehensive field monitoring and kinetic experiment programs, and a mass-transport model.  The river is severely impacted by the inflow from ionically polluted hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake.  Chemical-based density stratification is induced in the river, and attended by violations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and free ammonia standards in the ower layer of the river.  The model performed well in matching DO depletions in the lower layer of the river, and diurnal variations in DO.  Model projections demonstrate DO standards can only be met by eliminating chemical stratification in the river.  The water-quality model is to be used to support regional planning of domestic waste treatment and disposal, including diversion of a major discharge to the river.

AB Intensifying global change is propelling many ecosystems toward irreversible transformations. Natural resource managers face the complex task of conserving these important resources under unprecedented conditions and expanding uncertainty. As once familiar ecological conditions disappear, traditional management approaches that assume the future will reflect the past are becoming increasingly untenable. In the present article, we place adaptive management within the resist-accept-direct (RAD) framework to assist informed risk taking for transforming ecosystems. This approach empowers managers to use familiar techniques associated with adaptive management in the unfamiliar territory of ecosystem transformation. By providing a common lexicon, it gives decision makers agency to revisit objectives, consider new system trajectories, and discuss RAD strategies in relation to current system state and direction of change. Operationalizing RAD adaptive management requires periodic review and update of management actions and objectives; monitoring, experimentation, and pilot studies; and bet hedging to better identify and tolerate associated risks.

AB Motivated by the need to estimate the abundance of marine mammal populations to inform conservation assessments, especially relating to fishery bycatch, this paper provides background on abundance estimation and reviews the various methods available for pinnipeds, cetaceans and sirenians. We first give an "entry-level" introduction to abundance estimation, including fundamental concepts and the importance of recognizing sources of bias and obtaining a measure of precision. Each of the primary methods available to estimate abundance of marine mammals is then described, including data collection and analysis, common challenges in implementation, and the assumptions made, violation of which can lead to bias. The main method for estimating pinniped abundance is extrapolation of counts of animals (pups or all-ages) on land or ice to the whole population. Cetacean and sirenian abundance is primarily estimated from transect surveys conducted from ships, small boats or aircraft. If individuals of a species can be recognized from natural markings, mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data can be used to estimate the number of animals using the study area. Throughout, we cite example studies that illustrate the methods described. To estimate the abundance of a marine mammal population, key issues include: defining the population to be estimated, considering candidate methods based on strengths and weaknesses in relation to a range of logistical and practical issues, being aware of the resources required to collect and analyze the data, and understanding the assumptions made. We conclude with a discussion of some practical issues, given the various challenges that arise during implementation.

We also test whether the applicability of this rule varies based on the unit of analysis (species or assemblage), the appendage examined (tail, hind foot, ear), body size, occupied habitat, geographical range size, life mode and saltatorial ability. Location World-wide. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Rodents (order Rodentia). Methods We assembled data on the morphology, ecology and phylogeny for <= 2,212 rodent species, representing c. 86% of all the described rodent species and c. 95% of the described genera. We tested the predicted Allen's rule associations among size-corrected appendage lengths and both latitudinal and climatic variables (temperature and precipitation). We applied a cross-species approach based on phylogenetic regressions and a cross-assemblage approach based on spatial regressions in equal-area 1.5 degrees grid cells. Results Support for Allen's rule was greatest for the tail and was stronger across assemblages than across species. We detected a negative relationship between tail length and (absolute) latitude, which was accounted for by a positive association between tail length and temperature of the coldest month. This association was greatest in desert species. In addition, we observed a negative relationship between ear length and precipitation. Main conclusions In rodents, Allen's rule is confirmed only for tails, and this association seems to be driven by adaptation to the cold, rather than warm temperatures. Habitat type seems to influence conformity to this rule. Conformity to Allen's rule is likely to be the result of complex evolutionary trade-offs between temperature regulation and other essential species traits.

AB Many organisms are shrinking in size in response to global warming. However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms linking body size and temperature of organisms across their geographical ranges. Here we investigate the biophysical mechanisms determining the scaling of body temperature with size across latitudes in terrestrial ectotherms.
   Using biophysical models, we simulated operative temperatures experienced by lizard-like ectotherms as a function of microclimatic variables, body mass and latitude and used them to generate null predictions for the effect of size on temperature across geographical gradients. We then compared model predictions against empirical data on lizards' field body temperature (T-b) and thermal tolerance limits (CTmax and CTmin).
   Our biophysical models predict that the allometric scaling of operative temperatures with body size varies with latitude, with a positive relationship at low latitudes that vanishes with increasing latitude. The analyses of thermal traits of lizards show a significant interaction of body size and latitude on T-b and CTmax and no effect of body mass on CTmin, consistent with model's predictions. The estimated scaling coefficients are within the ranges predicted by the biophysical model. The effect of body mass, however, becomes non-significant after controlling for the phylogenetic relatedness between species.
   We propose that large-bodied terrestrial ectotherms exhibit higher risk of overheating at low latitudes, while size differences in thermal sensitivity vanish towards higher latitudes.
   Our work highlights the potential of combining mechanistic models with empirical data to investigate the mechanisms underpinning broad-scale patterns and ultimately provide a null model to develop baseline expectations for further empirical research.

AB Body size is one of the most influential traits affecting many ecological and physiological processes across animal and plant taxa. Studies of the environmental factors shaping body size patterns may evaluate either temporal or spatial dimensions. Here, we analyzed body size evolution in the radiation of Anolis lizards across both geographical and temporal dimensions. We used a set of macroecological and macroevolutionary methods to test current and past environmental effects on geographical gradients of body size and its evolutionary rates. First, we test whether a set of current ecological/physiological hypotheses (heat balance, productivity and seasonality) explains spatial body size gradients. Second, we evaluate how tempo (i.e. evolutionary rates) and mode (i.e. evolutionary process) of body size evolution changed through time and the role of paleo-temperatures on rates of body size evolution during the Cenozoic. We did not find a signature of current environmental variables driving spatial body size gradients. By contrast, we found strong support for a correlation between temperature changes (i.e. climate cooling) during the Cenozoic and rates of body size evolution (i.e. body size diversification). We suggest that patterns of body size evolution in Anolis lizards might be influenced by thermoregulatory behavior across clades and regions.

AB We discuss tipping phenomena in nonautonomous systems using an example of a bistable ecosystem model with environmental changes represented by time-varying parameters [Scheffer et al., Ecosystems, 11 (2008), pp. 275-279]. We give simple testable criteria for the occurrence of nonautonomous tipping from the herbivore-dominating equilibrium to the plant-only equilibrium using global properties of the autonomous frozen system with fixed-in-time parameters. To begin with, we use classical autonomous bifurcation analysis to identify a codimension-three degenerate Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation: the source of a dangerous subcritical Hopf bifurcation and the organizing center for bifurcation-induced tipping (B-tipping). Then, we introduce the concept of basin instability for equilibria to identify parameter paths along which genuine nonautonomous rate-induced tipping (R-tipping) occurs without crossing any classical autonomous bifurcations. We explain nonautonomous R-tipping in terms of maximal canard trajectories and produce nonautonomous tipping diagrams in the plane of the magnitude and rate of a parameter shift to uncover intriguing R-tipping tongues and wiggling tipping-tracking bifurcation curves. Discussion of nontrivial dynamics arising from the interaction between B-tipping and R-tipping identifies "points of no return" where tipping cannot be prevented by the parameter trend reversal and "points of return tipping" where tipping is inadvertently induced by the parameter trend reversal. Our results give new insight into the sensitivity of ecosystems to the magnitudes and rates of environmental change. Finally, a comparison between "tilted" saddle-node and subcritical Hopf normal forms reveals some universal tipping properties due to basin instability, a generic dangerous bifurcation, or the combination of both.

AB Through its behavior, an organism intentionally or unintentionally produces information. Use of this "social information" by surrounding conspecifics or heterospecifics is a ubiquitous phenomenon that can drive strong correlations in fitness-associated behaviors, such as predator avoidance, enhancing survival within and among competing species. By eliciting indirect positive interactions between competing individuals or species, social information might alter overall competitive outcomes. To test this potential, we present new theory that quantifies the effect of social information, modeled as predator avoidance signals/cues, on the outcomes from intraspecific and interspecific competition. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that social information can rescue populations from extinction and can shift the long-term outcome of competitive interactions from mutual exclusion to coexistence, or vice versa, depending on the relative strengths of intraspecific and interspecific social information and competition. Our findings highlight the importance of social information in determining ecological outcomes.

AB Archaeological remains are valuable relative sea-level (RSL) indicators in Israel, a tectonically stable coast with minor isostatic inputs. Previous research has used archaeological indicators to argue for centennial sea-level fluctuations. Here, we place archaeological indicators in a quality-controlled dataset where all indicators have consistently calculated vertical and chronological uncertainties, and we subject the data to statistical analysis. We combine the archaeological data with bio-construction data from Dendropoma petraeum colonial vermetids. The final dataset consists of 99 relative sea-level index points and 12 limiting points from the last 4000 a. The temporal distribution of the index points is uneven; Israel has only four index points before 2000 a BP. We apply an Errors-In-Variables Integrated Gaussian Process (EN IGP) to the index points to model the evolution of RSL. Results show RSL in Israel rose from -0.8 +/- 0.5 m at similar to 2750 a BP (Iron Age) to 0.0 +/- 0.1 m by similar to 1850 a BP (Roman period) at 0.8 mm/a, and continued rising to 0.1 +/- 0.1 m until similar to 1600 a BP (Byzantine Period). RSL then fell to -0.3 +/- 0.1 m by 0.5 mm/a until similar to 650 a BP (Lite Arab period), before returning to present levels at a rate of 0.4 mtnia. The reassessed Israeli record supports centennial-scale RSL fluctuations during the last 3000 a BP, although the magnitude of the RSL fall during the last 2000 a BP is 50% less. The new Israel RSL record demonstrates correspondence with regional climate proxies. This quality-controlled Israeli RSL dataset can serve as a reference for comparisons with other sea-level records from the Eastern Mediterranean. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The success of species reintroductions can depend on a combination of environmental, demographic, and genetic factors. Although the importance of these factors in the success of reintroductions is well-accepted, they are typically evaluated independently, which can miss important interactions. For species that persist in metapopulations, movement through and interaction with the landscape is predicted to be a vital component of persistence. Simulation-based approaches are a promising technique for evaluating the independent and combined effects of these factors on the outcome of various reintroduction and associated management actions. We report results from a simulation study of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) reintroduction to three watersheds of the Pend Oreille River system in northeastern Washington State, USA. We used an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to evaluate how reintroduction strategies, life history variation, and riverscape structure (e.g., network topology) interact to influence the demographic and genetic characteristics of reintroduced bull trout populations in three watersheds. Simulation scenarios included a range of initial genetic stocks (informed by empirical bull trout genetic data), variation in migratory tendency and life history, and two landscape connectivity alternatives representing a connected network (isolation-by-distance) and a fragmented network (isolation-by-barrier, using the known existing barriers). A novel feature of these simulations was the ability to consider the interaction of both demographic and genetic (i.e., demogenetic) factors in riverscapes with implicit asymmetric movement probabilities across the barriers. We found that connectivity (presence or absence of barriers) had the largest effect on demographic and genetic outcomes over 200 yr, with a greater effect than both initial genetic diversity and life history variation. We also identified regions of the study system in which bull trout populations persisted across a wide range of demographic, life history, and environmental connectivity parameters. Finally, we found no evidence that initial neutral genetic diversity influenced genetic diversity and structure after 200 yr; instead, genetic drift due to stray rate and population isolation dominated and erased any initial differences in genetic diversity. Our results highlight the utility of spatially explicit demogenetic approaches in exploring and understanding population dynamics and their implications for management strategies-in fresh waters.

AB Geographical gradients of body size express climate-driven constraints on animals, but whether they exist and what causes them in ectotherms remains contentious. For amphibians, the water conservation hypothesis posits that larger bodies reduce evaporative water loss (EWL) along dehydrating gradients. To address this hypothesis mechanistically, we build on well-established biophysical equations of water exchange in anurans to propose a state-transition model that predicts an increase of either body size or resistance to EWL as alternative specialization along dehydrating gradients. The model predicts that species whose water economy is more sensitive to variation in body size than to variation in resistance to EWL should increase in size in response to increasing potential evapotranspiration (PET). To evaluate the model predictions, we combine physiological measurements of resistance to EWL with geographic data of body size for four different anuran species. Only one species, Dendropsophus minutus, was predicted to exhibit a positive body size-PET relationship. Results were as predicted for all cases, with one species-Boana faber-showing a negative relationship. Based on an empirically verified mathematical model, we show that clines of body size among anurans depend on the current values of those traits and emerge as an advantage for water conservation. Our model offers a mechanistic and compelling explanation for the cause and variation of gradients of body size in anurans.

AB Historical contingency is the impact of past events, like the timing and order of species arrival, on community assembly, and can sometimes result in alternative stable states of ecological communities. Large herbivores, wild and domestic, can cause profound changes in the structure and functioning of plant communities and therefore probably influence historical contingency; however, little empirical data on the stability of such shifts or subsequent drivers of stability are available. We studied the centennial legacy of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) pressure on arctic tundra vegetation by considering historical milking grounds (HMGs): graminoid- and forb-dominated patches amid shrub-dominated tundra, formed by historical Sami reindeer herding practices that ended approximately 100years ago. Our results show that the core areas of all studied HMGs remained strikingly stable, being hardly invaded by surrounding shrubs. Soil nitrogen concentrations were comparable to heavily grazed areas. However, the HMGs are slowly being reinvaded by vegetative growth of shrubs at the edges, and the rate of ingrowth increased with higher mineral N availability. Furthermore, our data indicate that several biotic feedbacks contribute to the stability of the HMGs: increased nutrient turnover supporting herbaceous vegetation, strong interspecific competition preventing invasion and herbivore damage to invading shrubs. In particular, voles and lemmings appear to be important, selectively damaging shrubs in the HMGs. We concluded that HMGs provide clear evidence for historical contingency of herbivore effects in arctic ecosystems. We showed that several biotic feedbacks can contribute to subsequent vegetation stability, but their relative importance will vary in time and space.

AB The coral reef crisis has resulted in many reefs stabilizing in a low coral cover state, and this condition is exemplified by the fringing reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands, where coral cover has remained low for decades. To evaluate the demographic features maintaining this condition, a decade of coral abundance was examined in three domains: recruits, small colonies (<= 40-mm diameter), and cover. While cover was stable from 2007 to 2016, other aspects of coral community structure changed in taxonomically unique ways differing among domains. Most changes occurred gradually, although the warm year of 2010 was associated with perturbations in growth, mortality, and density that differed among domains and taxa, and summed to a weak signal distinguishing communities before and after similar to 2011/2012. As a result, coral community structure was taxonomically shuffled within each domain, while low cover was maintained. These low coral cover communities may be characterized by functional redundancy among taxa and a weakening of interactions among them that traditionally have supported emergent properties like community calcification. With persistent failure of recruitment to augment coral cover, some corals may already occur at such low abundances that they cannot perform the ecological services with which they were once associated.

AB Biomanipulation is a tool decision makers use to achieve desirable management goals. In lakes, one of the most common goals is the improvement of water quality, an objective that can be achieved mainly by reducing the amount of phytoplankton in the water. Although it is a very clear goal that is achievable by using actions that affect the phytoplankton biomass, experience shows that primary biomanipulation goals are rarely achieved. A biomanipulation program was conducted in Lake Kinneret over a 12-year period with the goal of improving water quality by reducing the population of the dominant fish species in the lake. However, the biomanipulation failed to achieve the goal and the program was stopped. We used Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) scenarios to examine the effect of biomanipulation on the ecosystem. The results of these scenarios show that biomanipulation actions, such as those used in the lake, indeed fail to improve water quality; furthermore, they will actually increase the amount of phytoplankton in the water and decrease water quality. The development of the method described in the present article provides managers with the means to evaluate the effect of biomanipulation on an ecosystem. This method enables researches to conduct a pre-action analysis of the planned measures and examine whether the goal can be achieved, saving money and time and preventing damage to the ecosystem.

AB We examined an 8.5-year record (2004-2012) of cell size data for phytoplankton species from Lake Kinneret, Israel, sampled weekly or at 2-week intervals and determined microscopically by the same person. Many of the species abundant enough to be counted year-round showed a typical seasonal cell size pattern that repeated annually: cell diameter was maximal in winter and minimal in summer. This pattern was shared by species from different taxonomic groups including cyanobacteria, chlorophyta, and dinoflagellates. Similarly, in colonial species of diatoms, chlorophyta, and cyanobacteria the number of cells per colony was larger in winter and smaller in summer. We postulated that the seasonal changes in cell or colony size constituted an adaptation that enabled species to overcome temperature-dependent changes in water density and viscosity and adjust their sinking velocities in the different seasons. A series of computations based on Stokes' law supported our hypothesis. If this phenomenon of larger cells or colonies of the same species at lower temperatures is widespread in lake phytoplankton, then (1) phytoplankton biomass estimates should be based on seasonally determined biovolume per species data rather than fixed values; and (2) we would expect to see smaller-sized organisms in the future as global warming changes ambient temperatures.

AB Satisficing is a hugely influential model of boundedly rational choice, yet it cannot be easily tested using standard choice data. We develop necessary and sufficient conditions for stochastic choice data to be consistent with satisficing, assuming that preferences are fixed, but search order may change randomly. The model predicts that stochastic choice can only occur amongst elements that are always chosen, while all other choices must be consistent with standard utility maximization. Adding the assumption that the probability distribution over search orders is the same for all choice sets makes the satisficing model a subset of the class of random utility models.

AB The formation, functioning and emergent properties of patterned landscapes have recently drawn increased attention, notably in semi-arid ecosystems. We describe and analyze a set of similarly spectacular landforms in seasonal tropical wetlands. Surales landscapes, comprised of densely packed, regularly spaced mounds, cover large areas of the Orinoco Llanos. Although descriptions of surales date back to the 1940's, their ecology is virtually unknown. From data on soil physical and chemical properties, soil macrofauna, vegetation and aerial imagery, we provide evidence of the spatial extent of surales and how they form and develop. Mounds are largely comprised of earthworm casts. Recognizable, recently produced casts account for up to one-half of total soil mass. Locally, mounds are relatively constant in size, but vary greatly across sites in diameter (0.5-5 m) and height (from 0.3 m to over 2 m). This variation appears to reflect a chronosequence of surales formation and growth. Mound shape (round to labyrinth) varies across elevational gradients. Mounds are initiated when large earthworms feed in shallowly flooded soils, depositing casts that form 'owers' above water level. Using permanent galleries, each earthworm returns repeatedly to the same spot to deposit casts and to respire. Over time, the tower becomes a mound. Because each earthworm has a restricted foraging radius, there is net movement of soil to the mound from the surrounding area. As the mound grows, its basin thus becomes deeper, making initiation of a new mound nearby more difficult. When mounds already initiated are situated close together, the basin between them is filled and mounds coalesce to form larger composite mounds. Over time, this process produces mounds up to 5 m in diameter and 2 m tall. Our results suggest that one earthworm species drives self-organizing processes that produce keystone structures determining ecosystem functioning and development.

AB The present study aims at describing and analysing the floristic composition and vegetation types, as well as determining the effect of recent land uses on the vegetation structure. It aims also at identifying the alien plants species and elucidating the impact of these species on the plant diversity and community structure of the study area. One hundred and ninety stands were selected monthly for this study, 145 species were recorded (69 perennials and 76 annuals) related to 83 genera, 40 families in 9 identified habitats in El-Omayed Biosphere Reserve (coastal sand dunes, salt marshes, saline depression, non-saline depression, inland ridges, inland plateau, irrigation canals, road sides and cultivated lands). Therophytes were the most represented life form. Three habitat groups resulted after the application of TWINSPAN and DCA as classification and ordination techniques: 2 represented the natural habitats and one represented the urban and cultivated habitats. Group I represented coastal dunes and salt marshes GII: saline depressions, non-saline depressions, inland plateau and inland ridges and GIII: irrigation canals, road sides and cultivated lands. Coastal dunes had the highest species richness (a-diversity), followed by cultivated lands, while inland plateau had the lowest; but saline depressions had the highest species turnover (beta-diversity). Non-saline depressions had the highest relative evenness, while saline depressions had the highest relative concentration of dominance. Coastal dunes had highest values of calcium carbonates and calcium ions, and salt marshes had the highest salinity, pH, potassium and sodium contents, but cultivated lands had the highest values of silt, clay and organic matter. The diagram resulting from CCA showed an influence of most soil variables, except nitrogen, calcium and potassium. Twenty two species were recorded for the first time in the study area. The recent land use (overgrazing, wood cutting and collecting, construction of summer resorts and irrigation canals and agricultures) led to the emergence of new invasive species, which may severely affect the plant diversity and community structure of this hot spot of biodiversity in Egypt.

AB The Mediterranean region is both a global biodiversity hot spot and one of the biomes most strongly affected by human activities. Ecologists and land managers are increasingly required to advise on threats to biodiversity under foreseeable climate change. We used expert surveys to evaluate current understanding and uncertainties regarding climate change impacts on biodiversity in terrestrial, inland freshwater, and marine ecosystems of Israel. Finally, we propose a response strategy toward minimizing these changes. The surveys and the published literature indicated that the main climate change impacts in Israel include ongoing deterioration of freshwater habitats, decline of shrubland and woodland areas, and increased frequency and severity of forest fires. For the Mediterranean Sea, the surveys predict further introduction and establishment of invasive species from the Red Sea, accelerated erosion of coastal rocky habitat, and collapse of coastal rocky platforms. In the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, corals may be resilient to foreseen climate change due to their high tolerance for rising water temperatures. Despite these predictions, science-based knowledge regarding the contribution of management toward minimizing climate change impacts on biodiversity is still lacking. Habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation are presently the primary and immediate threats to natural ecosystems in Israel. Protection of natural ecosystems, including local refugia, must be intensified to maintain existing biodiversity under pressure from mounting urban development and climate change. This protection policy should include ecological corridors to minimize the consequences of fragmentation of existing natural habitats for species survival. A longer-term strategy should mandate connectivity across environmental and climatic gradients to maintain natural resilience by allowing reorganization of natural ecosystems facing climate change.

AB The potential positive effects of herbivores on plants have been the subject of debates for decades. While traditionally, herbivory was considered to have a negative impact on plants, some studies also reported possible mutualism between plants and herbivores. Plant defences, and in particular tolerance and resistance, seem to play an important role in shaping plant-herbivore interactions. The aim of this study is to show how a direct plant compensation mechanism translates into apparent compensation, i.e. the long-term biomass response to herbivory, in simple plant-herbivore models. A special emphasis is then put on how it interacts with resistance mechanisms. A qualitative study of the proposed models shows that they can exhibit different plant-herbivore patterns, including neutral, antagonistic (negative apparent compensation) and mutualistic (positive apparent compensation) interactions. Moreover, it is shown that density dependence plays a crucial role since, for a given system, the realized plant-herbivore pattern critically depends on the initial plant and herbivore levels. Our study shows the importance of direct compensation for the presence of plant-herbivore mutualism, a finding which we show, has significant implications both in ecosystems ecology and in agricultural pest management.

AB This work presents a modeling approach to simulate spatial distribution of metal contamination in aerosols with evaluation of health hazard. This approach offers the advantage to be non-intrusive, less expensive than sampling and laboratory analyses. It was applied to assess the impact of metal-bearing dust from mining wastes on air quality for a nearby community and agricultural lands in Jebel Ressas (Tunisia) locality. Dust emission rates were calculated using existing parameterization adapted to the contamination source composed of mining wastes. Metal concentrations were predicted using a Gaussian model (fugitive dust model) with, as input: emission rates, dump physical parameters and meteorological data measured in situ for 30 days in summertime. Metal concentration maps were built from calculated PM10 particle concentrations. They evidence the areas where Pb and Cd concentrations exceeded WHO guidelines (0.5 and 0.005 A mu g/m(3), respectively). Maximum concentrations of Pb and Cd in PM10 are, respectively, of 5.74 and 0.0768 A mu g/m(3) for measured wind speed values up to 22 m/s. Preferential areas of contamination were determined in agricultural lands to the NW from the source dump where Pb and Cd exceeded guidelines up to a distance of 1,200 m. The secondary spreading directions were SW and E, toward the village. Health hazard prospecting shown that a major part of the village was exposed to contaminated dust and that daily hazard quotient (HQ) values reached locally 118 and 158, respectively, for Pb and Cd during the study period. However, HQ variations in the village are high, both temporally and geographically.

AB Humans will, at times, act against their own economic self-interest, for example, in gambling situations. To explore the evolutionary roots of this behavior, we modified a traditional human gambling task, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), for use with chimpanzees, capuchin monkeys and humans. We expanded the traditional task to include two additional payoff structures to fully elucidate the ways in which these primate species respond to differing reward distributions versus overall quantities of rewards, a component often missing in the existing literature. We found that while all three species respond as typical humans do in the standard IGT payoff structure, species and individual differences emerge in our new payoff structures. Specifically, when variance avoidance and reward maximization conflicted, roughly equivalent numbers of apes maximized their rewards and avoided variance, indicating that the traditional payoff structure of the IGT is insufficient to disentangle these competing strategies. Capuchin monkeys showed little consistency in their choices. To determine whether this was a true species difference or an effect of task presentation, we replicated the experiment but increased the intertrial interval. In this case, several capuchin monkeys followed a reward maximization strategy, while chimpanzees retained the same strategy they had used previously. This suggests that individual differences in strategies for interacting with variance and reward maximization are present in apes, but not in capuchin monkeys. The primate gambling task presented here is a useful methodology for disentangling strategies of variance avoidance and reward maximization.

AB Spatial periodic forcing of pattern-forming systems is an important, but lightly studied, method of controlling patterns. It can be used to control the amplitude and wave number of one-dimensional periodic patterns, to stabilize unstable patterns, and to induce them below instability onset. We show that, although in one spatial dimension the forcing acts to reinforce the patterns, in two dimensions it acts to destabilize or displace them by inducing two-dimensional rectangular and oblique patterns.

AB Predictable empirical patterns of variation in body size along spatial and environmental gradients have been documented within many species of mammals. Four main hypotheses, heat conservation, heat dissipation, primary productivity and seasonality, have been proposed to explain these patterns of variation in body size. In this study, we reported an analysis of geographic variation in body size of Richardson's ground squirrels Urocitellus richardsonii, a North American hibernating, burrowing mammal. Firstly, we evaluated whether a Bergmannian size pattern was exhibited by Richardson's ground squirrels. Secondly, we used an information-theoretic approach to test which of the four main hypotheses best explain(s) geographic variation in body size of Richardson's ground squirrels or to assess whether, as proposed by McNab's resource rule or Huston and Wolverton's eNPP rule, the primary productivity hypothesis is the only explanation. Richardson's ground squirrels exhibited a pattern of increasing body size towards the colder areas, that is, more productive and seasonal central Alberta and foothills of the southern Alberta Rocky Mountains, indicative of a Bergmannian size pattern. Plant productivity and seasonality in plant productivity were likely the primary underlying factors generating the observed pattern of geographic variation in body size. Thus, our results supported primary productivity and seasonality hypotheses. From these results, we see that McNab's resource rule or Huston and Wolverton's eNPP rule (i.e. spatial variation in food availability) is an explanation for a Bergmannian size pattern in Richardson's ground squirrels, but not the only explanation.

AB Recent surveys using high-resolution imagery have enabled improved detection of Atlantic sea scallops, Placopecten magellanicus, between 10 mm and 65 mm in shell height, allowing the observation of juvenile scallops in the wild, which was previously difficult. Using these high-resolution images from 2008 and 2009 surveys of Georges Bank and the Mid-Atlantic Bight, the distribution and crowding levels of juvenile and adult scallops were examined. Mean crowding values revealed differences in small-scale distribution of scallops that were undetectable with density estimates. Juveniles on Georges Bank were 2.6-3.9 times more crowded than adults, and 2.9-7.4 times more crowded than juveniles and adults in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. The increased crowding of juvenile scallops on Georges Bank may be the result of differences in substrate, sea star interactions, and abundance of filamentous flora and fauna. The incorporation of high-resolution imagery into optical surveys represents an important development in the advancement of survey techniques because it has the potential (1) to quantify year class strength of 1-y-old scallops more accurately; (2) to improve growth, mortality, and biomass estimates in stock assessments; and (3) to advance our understanding of scallop ecology, including recruitment processes and population dynamics.

AB We consider the existence of multiple positive solutions to the steady state reaction diffusion equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions of the form:
   {-Delta u = lambda[u - u(2)/K - cu(2)/1 + u(2)], x is an element of Omega,
   u = 0, x is an element of partial derivative Omega.
   Here Delta u = div(del u) is the Laplacian of u, 1/lambda is the diffusion coefficient, K and c are positive constants and Omega subset of R(N) is a smooth bounded region with partial derivative Omega in C(2). This model describes the steady states of a logistic growth model with grazing in a spatially homogeneous ecosystem. It also describes the dynamics of the fish population with natural predation. In this paper we discuss the existence of multiple positive solutions leading to the occurrence of an S-shaped bifurcation curve. We prove our results by the method of sub-supersolutions.

AB This paper analyzes landscape in a rainforest region integrating geomorphologic and ecosystem analysis methods. Major landscape elements (geology, geomorphology, soils, vegetation and land use) were mapped as biogeomorphic land units using remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Associations between these variables were analyzed by map fusion and the results were expressed on a land unit map (scale ca. 1:100,000). Volcanic structures are dominant in the study area. Lava flows cover most of the region, mainly as basalt; several pyroclastic cones are widely distributed over the area but are dominant in the southeast region. A hypsometric map derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), and intersected with a land cover/use map showed an altitudinal gradient of vegetation. Rainforest grows at lower altitudes (0 to 700 m) and Virola, Juglans and Chionantus are distributed from 700 to 900 m. These species are located on slopes of basalt and andesites intercalated with tephra, recent isolated stratovolcano structures and an erosive flood plain. At higher altitudes (900 to 1100 m) the forest identified as Chionantus Ulmus Randia is associated with cinder cones. A Quercus Litmus forest (900 to 1400 m) covers the slopes of the highest volcano (San Martin) and surrounding areas, while evergreen (elfin) forest is at the top of this mountain (1660 m).

AB In 2003 a reintroduction program of osprey started in the region of Andalusia, SW Spain, in order to recover the former breeding population in mainland Spain and to improve the situation of the species in the Mediterranean basin. From 2003 to 2009, 129 young ospreys were released by means of hacking. In 2009, the first breeding pair reared successfully three chicks in the Odiel Marshes for the first time in mainland Spain since 1981, when the species become extinct. The first breeding pair constitutes a significant indicator for the evaluation of the project and the beginning of a future population.

AB We studied a. sample of 131 skulls of the stone marten Martes foina that were collected in Denmark between 1858 and 1999. Data were available for 37 years, but collection effort was not uniform throughout the study period and annual sample size varied between I and 27. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to combine the information Of four skull measurements into a single variable (PC 1). PC I was then corrected for factors that significantly affected it (sex and longitude), and residual PCI was used for further analysis in which we calculated trends in PCI values during the study period. During the study period there was an increase in mean annual temperature in Denmark, but this increase was not continuous, as there was slight decrease in temperature between 1947 and 1965.
   We found that skull size (and by implication body size) of the stone marten in Denmark had two periods of decrease and these two periods coincide with the periods of increase in mean annual temperature. These results may indicate that body size of the stone marten is sensitive to the change in ambient temperature, either due to a change in food availability that was caused by the increase in temperature, or decreased its size in accordance with Bergmann's rule.

AB Many plant species grow inside tussocks of some graminoids, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We address whether some species occur and flower mainly inside tussocks so that species diversity and sexual reproduction are higher inside than outside tussocks, and whether relieving biological and physical stress is the mechanism associated with the facilitative process. In a heavily grazed grassland on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, where both physical (due to high altitude) and biological conditions (due to heavy grazing) are extremely harsh, we investigated vegetation in paired plots inside and outside 150 Kobresia tibetica tussocks and measured tussock basal area (=plot area). We also measured temperatures at soil surface, 5 and 10 cm depth and the number of animals (yaks, sheep and horses) grazing inside and outside tussocks. Sixty-seven percent of the species occurred and 42% flowered more frequently inside than outside tussocks, but none less frequently. Inside tussocks 78% species flowered, but outside tussocks only 31% did. Consequently, number of species, number of flowering species and number of inflorescences were all markedly larger inside than outside tussocks. Differences in number of species, number of flowering species and number of inflorescences inside and outside tussocks increased with increasing tussock basal area. Soil temperatures were lower inside than outside tussocks, but grazing intensity was much larger outside tussocks. Therefore, tussocks of K. tibetica facilitated the species inside them likely by grazing prevention, but not by increasing warmth. This study provides evidence that plant species colonizing tussocks of graminoids can be facilitated by the tussock species, and facilitation by grazing prevention may be one mechanism causing the coexistence of the species inside tussocks.

AB A revival in the concept of sustainability is appreciated as Earth's human population continues to increase and its related global concerns in disease ecology, energy resource management, environmental literacy, food production, genetic diversity, and landscape vitality continue to magnify. Sustain is defined within this paper as to keep in existence or to supply with resources or necessities to prevent from falling below a given threshold of health or vitality. Barrett et al. (Bioscience 47:531-535, 1997) illustrated how seven (7) processes (behaviour, development, diversity, energetics, evolution, integration, regulation) transcend eleven (11) levels of ecological organization, ranging from the ecosphere to the cellular. Comprehension of how these processes transcend all levels of ecological organization allow programs and initiatives (e.g. preserving biotic diversity) to be defined by informed incentive, rather than regulatory mandate, within societal systems. We describe how the integration of an eighth transcending process-aesthetics-is essential in the approach to and managing of market and nonmarket capital necessary in sustaining societies.

AB We derived phylogenies, phylogeographies, and population demographies for two North American pitvipers, Agkistrodon contortrix (Linnaeus, 1766) and A. piscivorus (LacEpede, 1789) (Viperidae: Crotalinae), as a mechanism to evaluate the impact of rapid climatic change on these taxa.
   Midwestern and eastern North America.
   We reconstructed maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) relationships based on 846 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) ATPase 8 and ATPase 6 genes sequenced over 178 individuals. We quantified range expansions, demographic histories, divergence dates and potential size differences among clades since their last period of rapid expansion. We used the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test to compare our ML tree against three biogeographical hypotheses.
   A significant SH test supported diversification of A. contortrix from northeastern Mexico into midwestern-eastern North America, where its trajectory was sundered by two vicariant events. The first (c. 5.1 Ma) segregated clades at 3.1% sequence divergence (SD) along a continental east-west moisture gradient. The second (c. 1.4 Ma) segregated clades at 2.4% SD along the Mississippi River, coincident with the formation of the modern Ohio River as a major meltwater tributary. A single glacial refugium was detected within the Apalachicola region of southeastern North America. Significant support was also found for a hypothesis of trans-Gulf rafting by the common ancestor of A. piscivorus from eastern Mexico (possibly the Yucatan Peninsula) to northern Florida. There, a Mid-Late Pliocene marine transgression separated it at 4.8% SD from mainland North America. Significant range expansions followed compressive glacial effects in three (of four) A. contortrix clades and in two (of three) A. piscivorus clades, with the Florida A. piscivorus clade exhibiting significant distributional stasis.
   Pliocene glaciations, rapidly developing western aridity, and Pleistocene glacial meltwaters seemingly led to the diversification of A. contortrix and A. piscivorus in North America. Both species were pushed southwards by Pleistocene climate change, with subsequent northward expansions uninhibited topographically. The subspecific taxonomy used for A. contortrix and A. piscivorus today, however, appear non-representative. The monophyletic Florida subspecies of A. piscivorus may be a distinct species (at 4.8% SD), whereas two western subspecies of A. contortrix also appear to constitute a single distinct species, pending additional analyses. We conclude that both species of Agkistrodon can be used as suitable ectothermic models to gauge impacts of future climate change.

AB Following the previous report on this subject, published in 2007, there has been a very substantial increase in publications relevant to landscape ecology and this is illustrated by the growth in citations for articles in the core journal Landscape Ecology over the period 2000-2007. The continuing 'identity crisis' of landscape ecology is described and recent literature in the field is then summarized under the following headings: 'Landscape ecology and climate change research'; 'Alternatives to fragmentation and the patch-based model - the links between pattern and process'; 'Fragmentation research'; 'Methodology and techniques in landscape ecology'; and 'Connectivity and graph theoretical approaches'. The review concludes that landscape ecology now represents one important focus within biogeography, linked to ecological biogeography, and takes its place alongside other key foci, including macroecology, palaeoecology and soil science/pedology. Nevertheless, both physical and human geographers still need to embrace landscape ecology even more enthusiastically than they have up until now.

AB A new freshwater phototrophic species of the dinoflagellate genus Peridiniopsis, P. niei sp. nov., is described based on morphology. The new species appeared during spring with densities up to 1.48 x 10(7) cells L(-1) in some tributaries and gullies of Three Gorge Reservoir and Lake Donghu, China, forming red tides. Peridiniopsis niei is a cyst-producing freshwater dinoflagellate that belongs to the group Penardii. The plate tabulation is po+x+4 '+0a+6 ''+5c+5s+5 '''+2 '''' and the plate pattern is symmetric. The cells of P. niei are pentagonal in ventral view, the epitheca is larger than the hypotheca, making up about 2/3 the length of the cell. Plate 3 ' is hexangular. The closest species to P. niei is P. penardii (Lemmermann) Bourrelly, but cells of the former are pentagonal, very compressed dorsoventrally, and the hypotheca is truncated with one transparent, robust spine on each antapical plate.

AB Fish assemblages associated with shallow rocky bottoms along the coast of Cape Milazzo were investigated within three selected habitats, each represented by a different degree of complexity and namely vermetid reef (VR), rocky-algal reef (RR) and boulder and pebbles (BP). The area, located along the northern coast of Sicily (southern Tyrrhenian Sea) was studied by using a non-destructive diver visual census methodology evaluating species composition and abundance. A total of 39 fish taxa belonging to 15families were recorded over the three habitats investigated. Multivariate and univariate approaches detected significant differences among the three habitats. These differences were either in fish assemblage structure, in the assemblage parameters or in the abundances of some common species. A multidimensional scaling performed on the entire fish density data set showed distinct groupings for the three habitats. The highest values of mean species richness (S), diversity (H'), evenness (J) and density (N) occurred over the more complex habitat, represented by VR, than over rocky-algal reef habitat or BP. Different habitat preferences were evidenced for several fish species. Diplodus sargus, Serranus scriba, Tripterygion tripteronotus, T. delaisi and T. melanurus were significantly more abundant over VR whereas Thalassoma pavo and Symphodus tinca were more abundant both over VR and BP habitats. Statistical comparison did not detect habitat preferences in Symphodus roissali, Oblada melanura, Diplodus vulgaris and Sarpa salpa. As far as the size is concerned, small, medium and large-sized specimens of D. sargus and only large-sized individuals of D. vulgaris were significantly more abundant over the VR habitat side than over the other two. These results suggest that differences in assemblage parameters are related to habitat structure. Greater habitat complexity means greater surface available, thus providing additional resources for adults and juveniles of many species:food, cavities, caves and then new niches, refuges from predation, from artisan fishery nets, as well as resting or mating sites, boosting the total number of individuals and species. The results of this study highlight the importance of VR in sustaining the biodiversity of fish assemblages and emphasize the need for their careful management in an area already proposed as a Site of Community Interest.

AB A synthesis of the impacts of domestic and industrial wastes on oxygen resources and redox conditions of polluted Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, N.Y., is presented based on a long-term (1978-2005) monitoring program. Insights from this retrospective analysis are used to evaluate management alternatives for the remediation of oxygen resources and redox conditions. Reduced byproducts of anaerobic metabolism accumulated annually in the hypolimnion, causing low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the upper waters during fall turnover. The high natural sulfate (SO(4)(2-)) concentration of the lake promoted DO depletion and the production of methylmercury (CH(3)Hg(+)). Severe depletions of DO occurred annually in the upper waters during fall mixing, representing violations of water quality standards for extended intervals from 1978 to 1996. Depletions of DO during fall were less severe from 1997 to 2004. The improvement is reported to be in response to: ( 1) more routine occurrence of spring turnover following closure of an industry; ( 2) reduction in primary productivity; ( 3) return of large bodied Daphnia from closure of the industry; ( 4) satisfaction of historic debt from earlier higher primary production levels; and (5) year-round nitrification at a contributing domestic wastewater facility. Additional improvements in oxygen resources and decreases in SO(4)(2-) reduction are anticipated based on mandated future upgrades of phosphorus and ammonia treatment at the wastewater facility. Prevailing DO conditions during fall turnover, particularly within the context of anticipated improvements from the mandated upgrades, indicate hypolimnetic aeration or oxygenation is not required to meet water quality goals. Amendments to the hypolimnetic pool of NO(3)(-) are recommended instead of aeration or oxygenation to inhibit production of CH(3)Hg(+) by SO(4)(2-) reducing bacteria.

AB Understanding sperm dispersal patterns in free-spawning marine invertebrates is fundamental to assessing the likelihood of successful fertilization under a range of biological and physical conditions. Field estimates of sperm dispersal in egg broadcasters have relied on sperm assays that sample short-term sperm availability, and tended to focus on simple patterns of availability with distance along a 1-dimensional transect at a single site. However, sperm are diluted in multiple dimensions, and the decrease in concentration with increasing distance from a sperm source in any single dimension is dependent on the rate of dilution in other dimensions. We used short-term sperm availability assays to evaluate the 2-dimensional distribution of sperm downstream of 2 different populations of the egg-brooding colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri. Female colonies were exposed to water samples collected at various distances and 2 depths. Because many egg brooders that feed on phytoplankton appear to collect sperm throughout an extended period of time, short-term assays of sperm availability may underestimate absolute fertilization. Consequently, at one site we also compared fertilization in our short-term assays with time-integrated fertilization levels obtained by deploying colonies in the sampling locations for the entire period of egg viability. Our results indicate that vertical patterns of sperm availability with horizontal distance can vary between sites, suggesting that sperm transport patterns will be site-specific and dependent on local flow, and that vertical mixing may cause a more rapid decline in sperm concentration with increasing distance. Our comparison of instantaneous vs. time-integrated assays suggests that short-term assays may vastly underestimate actual field fertilization levels in some free-spawners.

AB 1. The mouthparts of five species of adult planktonic cyclopoid copepods (Cyclops vicinus, C. abyssorum, Acanthocyclops robustus, Mesocyclops leuckarti and Thermocyclopscrassus), in particular the distance between setae and setules of the maxilliped (which can indicate the ability to retain small particles), were compared using electron and light microscopy.
   2. The mesh-sizes of the food-collection grid formed by these setae and setules ranged between 4.6 and 13.2 mu m; the area covered by the grid ranged between 6000 and 32 000 mu m(2).
   3. Mesh-size was not simply correlated with body size. Cyclops abyssorum and M. leuckarti have the coarsest meshes and T. crassus the finest, while C. vicinus and A. robustus were intermediate.
   4. The results suggest that cyclopoid copepods are able to retain particles in the size range of nanoplankton and that differences in mesh-sizes between species may explain differences in the ability to subsist and reproduce on a diet of small algae.

AB Seasonal patterns in thallus length, biomass, reproduction, total biomass m(-2) and size structure were monitored in populations of Dictyota cervicomis and Stoechospermum polypodioides on a shallow reef flat in the southern Red Sea. These tropical reef flats are exposed to extreme temperatures of about 34 degrees C in summer and to temperatures of about 25 degrees C in winter. Both species showed peaks in length, biomass and reproduction in winter; macrothalli were absent in summer. Thallus length, biomass and the proportion of reproductive thalli showed a strong negative correlation with seawater temperature. Young thalli first appeared in November, following a drop in seawater temperature from about 33 to 31 degrees C. Macroscopic thalli had disappeared in May, when temperatures had reached the same values as those at the start of the growth season (33 degrees C). When reef substrata collected in summer were kept at sub-ambient temperatures (29-31 degrees C), macroscopic thalli of D. cervicomis developed. Size structure varied over time, probably because of non-synchronous development and tissue loss among thalli. Reproduction was size-dependent. We conclude that D. cervicomis and S. polypodioides have highly seasonal patterns of growth and reproduction related to the seasonal variation in the environment, especially temperature.

AB Group foraging allows for individuals to exploit the food discoveries of other group members. If searching for food and searching for exploitation opportunities within a group are mutually exclusive alternatives, the decision to use one or the other is modeled as a producer-scrounger game because the value of each alternative is frequency dependent. Stochastic producer-scrounger models generally assume that producer provides a more variable and uncertain reward than does the scrounger and hence is a riskier foraging alternative. Socially foraging animals that are attempting to reduce their risk of starvation should therefore alter their use of producer and scrounger alternatives in response to changes in energy budget. We observed flocks of nutmeg mannikins (L. punctulata) foraging in an indoor aviary to determine whether their use of producer and scrounger alternatives were risk sensitive. Analyses of the foraging rewards of three flocks of seven birds confirm that producer is a riskier foraging strategy than is scrounger, although the difference in risk is rather small. We then submitted two other flocks to two different energy budgets and observed the foraging decision of four focal birds in each flock. All but one bird increased their relative use of the riskier producer strategy in the low food reserve treatment, but the overall use of producer did not differ significantly between treatments, providing evidence for a small but consistent effect.

AB Levels of coral cover and abundance on a coral reef flat in Eilat (Israeli Red Sea) were estimated in 2001 by surveying nineteen 10-m transects, and compared to the levels reported in the same area between 1966 and 1973. Lower values compared to 1966 levels are evident, and there has been only a modest recovery following a catastrophic low tide that killed a large proportion of the corals in 1970. Percent cover of soft and stony corals (16.1%) was less than half of that reported for 1969 (35%), when a sharp decrease in coral abundance had already been observed. The total number of soft and stony coral colonies observed was 300, compared to 541 in 1966. In contrast to 1966, when half of the transects surveyed contained more than 30 coral colonies, no transects with this number of corals were observed. The cover of seven of the most common stony coral species was 841 cm, which is twice the coral cover of that in 1973, but only 22% of the 1969 level. Millepora dichotoma, an abundant species before 1970, has almost disappeared, and the soft coral Litophyton, abundant in 1972, was not observed. Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment is apparently among the causes for the lack of coral recovery in the studied reef flat. Reefs located further away from sources of pollution have recovered quickly after natural and anthropogenic disturbances and have retained their coral abundance and diversity. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB 1 LPBN is a parameterized simulation model of flows of nitrogen (N) in an ecosystem of cyanobacteria, grass and grazers, based on the N dynamics of a grazed Puccinellia lawn in an intertidal marsh on Hudson Bay. This system shows two alternate stable states: (a) lawns that either support a foraging population of lesser snow geese, or are not grazed by geese; and (b) exposed saline sediments that support little or no vegetation. The model represents the flow of N from cyanobacterial fixation, the major N input into the system, to the geese that migrate in autumn; those that do not return represent the major N output from the system. We have modelled N fixation, the transformations of N in the soil, plant growth, lawn regeneration, and goose grazing and grubbing.
   2 The model simulates steady-state flows of N similar to those observed in the field at zero and at moderate goose density, and it also simulates the transition to the state of zero plant biomass, a consequence of increased grubbing at high goose density. The simulated steady-state flows are found to be more sensitive to changes in the parameters that describe N fixation and goose biology, than to similar changes in the parameters describing plant biology.
   3 Because the model shows the alternate stable states and the transition between them, with values for the state variables that are consistent with field data, we conclude that N dynamics are crucial in determining the stability of the real salt marsh-goose system. The determining factor is the loss of the input of N from fixation when lawn area is reduced because the rate of goose grubbing exceeds that of plant re-establishment.

AB Post-release monitoring, including abundance estimation, is an important part of reintroductions, providing a basis for management intervention designed to achieve long-term persistence. The Arabian oryx Oryx leucoryx became extinct in the wild in 1972, surviving as captive populations. Since 1982 reintroductions of Arabian oryx have taken place in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Modelling of oryx population dynamics has highlighted the importance of precise estimation of population size (N). Between 1990 and 2000 three methods of estimating N have been applied in Mahazat as-Sayd protected area in Saudi Arabia: derived population estimates (DPE) based on known births and deaths, distance sampling, and mark-resighting (MR). This study assesses the feasibility and precision of these methods. Inability to assess precision, interdependence of consecutive estimates, and the assumption that all gains and losses are recorded, make DPE of limited value. At current densities, distance sampling along 455 km of driven transects yields too few detections to derive precise estimates of N. To achieve a coefficient of variation of 20% it would be necessary to drive up to c. 2,900 km of transect; this amount of survey effort could be achieved through pooling of data across repeat surveys of established transects. MR estimates, based on re-sighting of collared oryx, have the potential to yield the most precise estimates of N when the proportion of marked animals reaches 30% of the total population. The most reliable MR estimates available indicate the Mahazat as-Sayd Arabian oryx population had grown to > 400 animals by 2000.

AB Risk sensitivity is important for modeling behavior since organisms live in a stochastic world and must respond to risk by either avoiding it to the extent possible or taking chances. Researchers have proposed various models of risk-sensitive behavior including concave utility functions and step functions. These formulations either do not model attraction to risk, or they are overly simple or discontinuous models of more complex behavior. I propose a sigmoid formulation to overcome these limitations. I then compare different models using data from Andean pastoralists, Ache foragers, and Sulawesi Crested Black Macaques. The analyses indicate that the sigmoid utility function provides a useful model in situations where class-like status differences exist. Otherwise, more traditional concave or linear functions can model utility, although the sigmoid formulation can subsume both linear and concave functions. Importantly, the models considered contain variables that have an impact on reproductive fitness, indicating that there could be an evolutionary basis for systematic risk sensitivity.

AB In savannas, degrading trends such as increasing woody cover are caused by livestock ranging. Hence, identifying sustainable utilisation intensities is crucial for range management. However, knowledge concerning herbivory effects on herbaceous vegetation and primary productivity, but also productivity of and foraging on woody vegetation (browsing) is incomplete. Consequences of these knowledge gaps for predictions of long-term herbivory impacts are analysed by exploring a set of herbivory models in the framework of a spatially explicit simulator of vegetation dynamics in a semiarid savanna. We distinguish herbaceous and woody vegetation, and two impacts of herbivory, namely on phytomass and on primary productivity. Herbaceous phytomass is consumed under all grazing models, which are distinct by effects on herbaceous productivity per unit ground area: none; direct effect on productivity; direct effects on productivity and survival. Browsing is either absent or present. Additionally, low and high spatial grazing heterogeneity are distinguished. For a time scale of 100 years, herbivory impacts were analysed in a simulation experiment over a range of low to high stocking rates. Without effects on primary productivity, herbivory showed no long-term impact on shrub cover. However, under higher stocking rates, mean herbage utilisation reached over 50% of herbaceous phytomass production, rendering the null hypothesis on productivity effects of herbivory unrealistic. When grass productivity was affected by herbivory, shrub cover showed a threshold response to utilisation intensity: at low subcritical intensities, shrub cover did not exceed the low initial values; above a threshold intensity, savanna vegetation was characterised by high shrub cover. The level of this threshold was affected by heterogeneity, browsing, and by the nature of the productivity effects, and also depended on the time span considered. Since sustainable livestock ranging is possible only at utilisation intensities below this threshold, its determinants are crucial for long-term assessments. Given the insufficient quantitative understanding of all three of the factors determining long-term herbivory impacts, our results suggest caution towards current predictions, and provide for a priority ranking in urgently needed further research.

AB Gut fluorescence, feeding and egg production rates of zooplankton assemblages were measured in a shallow, eutrophic brackish-water pond for 24 days. Brachionus plicatilis, Hexarthra intermedia and Apocyclops panamensis successively developed and exhibited differences in food selectivity. Rotifers selected small particles but also had a preference for larger particles (15-21 mu m, Equivalent Spherical Diameter, ESD). B. plicatilis appeared less selective than H. intermedia, which fed mostly on particles <6 mu m. A. panamensis adults showed a selectivity for 6-21 mu m ESD particles. Laboratory experiments suggested that A. panamensis adults were able to shift from seston to carnivorous feeding, depending on the availability of these food resources. Measurements of gut fluorescence and grazing gave comparable ingestion rates. Rotifers displayed the highest ingestion rates (up to 486% body C d(-1)). Despite high total phytoplankton and seston biomasses, the high ingestion rates and selective grazing of rotifers induced auto food-limitation phenomena and caused major changes in seston abundance and size structure. Grazing impact was less important when A. panamensis dominated.

AB A comparatively recent focus in consumer-resource theory has been the examination of whether adaptive foraging by consumers, manifested through the functional response, can stabilize consumer-resource dynamics. We offer a brief synthesis of progress on this body of theory and identify the conditions likely to lead to stability. We also fill a gap in our understanding by analysing the potential for adaptively foraging herbivores, which are constrained by time available to feed and digestive capacity, to stabilize dynamics in a single-herbivore/two-plant resource system. Because foraging parameters of the adaptive functional response scale allometrically with herbivore body size, we parameterized our model system using published foraging data for an insect, a small mammal and a large mammal spanning four orders of magnitude in body size, and examined numerically the potential for herbivores to stabilize the consumer-resource interactions. We found in general that the herbivore-plant equilibrium will be unstable for all biologically realistic herbivore population densities. The instability arose for two reasons. First, each herbivore exhibited destabilizing adaptive consumer functional responses (i.e. density-independent or inversely density-dependent) whenever they selected a mixed diet. Secondly, the numerical response of herbivores, based on our assumption of density-independent herbivore population growth, results in herbivores reaching densities that enable them to exploit their resource populations to extinction. Our results and those of studies we reviewed indicate that, in general, adaptive consumers are unlikely to stabilize the dynamics of consumer-resource systems solely through the functional response. The implications of this for future work on consumer-resource theory are discussed.

AB The distribution of niches in resource space of darkling beetles of Negev desert, Israel were studied using discriminant analysis. Seventeen environmental variables (substrate structure and vegetation) were measured at 375 plots within 15 grids. The first three discriminant axes account for 77% of the variance and reflect a soil structure gradient from sand to clay (the first axis), a gradient of increasing productivity (the second axis), and a type of vegetation architecture (the third axis). Abundance and biomass of tenebrionids increased linearly along the first, the second and the third axes. Species richness and diversity had a slanting parabola shape along the substrate axis and increased along the productivity axis. There were two distinct spatial guilds of tenebrionid species. One guild was composed by species that preferred sandy-gravel soils, and another guild consisted of species that preferred clay soils. Niche overlapping of the ''sandy-gravel'' species was lower than that of the ''clay'' species. Niches of the ''sandy-gravel'' species were randomly distributed in the resource space. Those of the ''clay'' species formed a tight cluster with most niches placed in the center of the space, representing the centrifugal type of organization. The conformity of the guild structure with the different types of organization was supported by comparisons between empirical data and stochastic models. The border between these two guilds matches with proposed earlier biogeographical boundary (Ramon-Zohar line).

AB World wide coral reef decline has now been well documented, but the actual dynamics of this disturbing phenomenon are still far from understood. In this note we describe a simple spatial mathematical model that attempts to capture some of the important ecological processes-including colonization, mortality and competition for space-all of which govern questions of species coexistence in coral communities. The model is then extended to determine what might happen to a community if a proportion of the spatial landscape is destroyed and can no longer be occupied. We examine the species extinction debt incurred as habitat destruction increases and attempt to predict the characteristics of those species which are at greatest risk. To gain even further insights, the results of the model are compared with field-data from the reef flats of Eilat, Israel, as found in Loya's (1976; Ecology 57:278-289) classic study of community structure at reef sites damaged by chronic oil pollution.

AB The patterns of abundance and seed (acorn) predation races were analyzed in granivorous rodents (mainly the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus L.) wintering in two man-made habitats: cereal croplands, and a kind of wood-pasture exclusive to the western Mediterranean basin, the dehesas. Both seed (acorn) abundance ana vegetation structure were also measured. Within dehesas, neither rodent abundance nor acorn predation rates were related to acorn abundance, whereas there Tvas a significant. association between rodent abundance and shrub cover at the end of winter. These results were coincident with previous findings in croplands. Both rodent abundances and seed predation rates were lower in dehesas than in croplands, despite the better structural and trophic conditions of the first habitat for rodents (larger shrub cover and food abundance). However, the body condition of animals was better in dehesas, to the extent that we found strong evidence for mincer reproduction. Rodent predator communities appear to be more diverse and denser in dehesas than in croplands. This suggests a heavier predation pressure in dehesas which would have culled rodent populations in such a way chat food Tvas plentiful for survivors, rhus explaining their scarcity, good body condition, and low dependence on food resources.

ID BIOMASS; CARBON; ZOOXANTHELLAE; RATES
AB One of the most difficult problems for coral conservation is to find a sensitive physiological parameter to assess the health of living coral. In searching for a suitable index, ATP concentration in several species of coral under different natural and experimental conditions was studied from 1986 to 1989 in the coastal waters of southern Taiwan (21-degrees 56' N, 120-degrees 44' E). Interspecific variation in ATP concentration in 6 coral species ranged from 8.2 +/- 1.3 to 52.6 +/- 14.8-mu-g g-1. In an experiment of short-term desiccation stress, ATP content in Acropora hyacinthus dropped drastically from 67.0 +/- 13.7 to 7.9 +/- 6.1-mu-g g-1. During a bleaching event resulting from a natural disturbance, ATP concentration in A. hyacinthus dropped significantly but recovered gradually to normal values several months later. An annual survey of ATP variation in A. formosa showed a high peak between December and April with lower values in other months, perhaps in response to fluctuating temperature. In view of the significant rapid response of coral ATP content to stress and the rise in concentration during a recovery phase of months, the amount of ATP in living coral could be feasible parameter for monitoring environmental stress in living coral.

AB The waters of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) host a diversity of marine and coastal habitats that are under increasing pressure from multiple anthropogenic activities related to rapid economic growth. In response, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) currently cover 12% of the UAE's coastal and marine zones. The UAE National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan aims to increase the extent of protection to 14% by 2021, a target that exceeds current global commitments. We applied systematic conservation planning to (1) assess whether conservation features (i.e. species and habitats of conservation concern) are adequately represented in the current system of MPAs, and (2) identify complementary coastal and marine priority areas for conservation and management. Eight planning scenarios were produced based on different conservation targets, the inclusion (or not) of existing MPAs in the generated solutions, and the consideration (or not) of dredging (an activity linked with coastal development in the UAE). A gap analysis demonstrated that to achieve the targets set by experts for all conservation features, additional areas would need to be integrated in conservation plans and policies. Key coastal and marine priority areas were consistently selected for conservation across all planning scenarios. The findings of this work provide a basis for the identification of conservation priorities that can be embedded in the current network of MPAs by extending their boundaries, in post-2020 conservation strategies including plans for creating new MPAs, and in broader spatial planning initiatives.

AB Ecological specialization is an important mechanism enhancing species coexistence within a given community. Yet, unravelling the effect of multiple selective evolutionary and ecological factors leading the process of specialization remains a key challenge in ecology. Subterranean habitats provide highly replicated experimental arenas in which to disentangle the relative contribution of evolutionary history (convergent evolution vs. character displacement) and ecological setting (environmental filtering vs. competitive exclusion) in driving community assembly. We tested alternative hypotheses about the emergence of ecological specialization using the radiation of a lineage of sheet-weaver cave-dwelling spiders as model system. We observed that at the local scale, a differential specialization to cave microhabitats generally parallels moderate levels of morphological similarity and close phylogenetic relatedness among species. Conversely, geographic distance contributed little in explaining microhabitat occupation, possibly mirroring a limited role of competitive exclusion. Yet, compared to non-coexisting species, co-occurring species adapted to different microhabitats showed lower morphological niche overlap (i.e. higher dissimilarity) and deeper genetic distance. The framework here developed suggests that in the subterranean domain, habitat specialization is primarily driven by environmental filtering, secondarily by convergent evolution, and only marginally by character displacement or competitive exclusion. This pattern results in the establishment of replicated communities across geographical space, composed by ecologically equivalent species. Such process of community assembly well explains the numerous adaptive radiations observed in subterranean habitats, an eco-evolutionary pattern well documented in oceanic islands or mountain summit communities.

AB Aim Lizard assemblages vary greatly in taxonomic, ecological and phenotypic diversity, yet the mechanisms that generate and maintain these patterns at a macroecological scale are not well understood. We aimed to characterize the ecological and environmental drivers of species richness patterns in the context of macroecological theory for 10 independent lizard radiations. Location Global. Time period Present day. Major taxa Lizards. Methods We analysed patterns of species and functional trait diversity in 10 ecologically distinct and widely distributed clades encompassing nearly all known lizard species. Using recently published spatial, phylogenetic, and functional trait datasets, we built spatially explicit structural equation models to ask whether species richness was directly or indirectly related to functional divergence or convergence within communities, and with features of the environment, including measures of productivity, complexity and harshness. Results Our results show that high species richness is achieved via different pathways in different lizard clades, with both functionally divergent and convergent assemblages harbouring high diversity in different clades. More generally, we also find common, positive effects of temperature, productivity and topography on species richness within lizard clades. Main conclusions Thermal constraints, topographic complexity and spatial structuring of functional diversity help explain the presence of highly diverse lizard assemblages, suggesting the importance of environmental filters in shaping present-day diversity and assemblage structure. Our results show how different pathways to high richness in different clades have contributed to the overall global pattern of species richness in reptiles.

AB The aim of this paper is to illuminate the impacts of cement production emissions on the environment. Various research work has shown that countries in sub-Saharan Africa, suffer the most from environmental pollution especially air pollution. One of such contributing factors is the behavioural pattern of workers and traders living close to production plants. Significantly also, data are not available in this region. The need for cement as well as the presence of local raw materials, coupled with the need for local content has resulted in an increase in the number of cement plants. Areas within and around the cement plant are exposed to various air pollutants.These pollutants affect the life and wellbeing of workers, children and people in close communities as well as the flora and fauna. Diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary, silicosis, preterm delivery, psychasthenia, endocrine disruption, cancer and infertility are associated with these pollutants. This paper describes the impacts of these pollutants on human's health and plant's growth as well as where studies should focus on in the future. Various high impact papers were selected and cogent findings as it affects different classes of people were discussed in this paper. It is recommended that more data collection, pollutant characterization, risk assessment and dispersion analysis should be carried out in developing countries. More research should be undertaken to determine the impact of alternative fuel and the effectiveness of dust control technologies used in various cement plants.

AB Climate change is occurring at an unprecedented rate and has begun to modify the distribution and phenology of organisms worldwide. Chelonians are expected to be particularly vulnerable due to limited dispersal capabilities as well as widespread temperature-dependent sex determination. The number of papers published about the effects of climate change on turtles has increased exponentially over the last decade; here, I review the data from peer-reviewed publications to assess the likely impacts of climate change on individuals, populations, and communities. Based upon these studies future research should focus on: (1) Individual responses to climate change, particularly with respect to thermal biology, phenology, and microhabitat selection; (2) improving species distribution models by incorporating fine-scale environmental variables as well as physiological processes; (3) identifying the consequences of skewed sex ratios; and (4) assessments of community resilience and the development of methods to mitigate climate change impacts. Although detailed management recommendations are not possible at this point, careful consideration should be given regarding how to manage low vagility species as habitats shift poleward. In the worst-case scenario, proactive management may be required in order to ensure that widespread losses do not occur.

AB Reproducing sharks must provide their offspring with an adequate supply of nutrients to complete embryonic development. In oviparous (egg-laying) sharks, offspring develop outside the mother, and all the nutrients required for embryonic growth are contained in the egg yolk. Conversely, in viviparous (live-bearing) sharks, embryonic development is completed inside the mother, providing offspring with the opportunity to receive supplementary embryonic nourishment, known as matrotrophy. Viviparous sharks exhibit nearly all forms of matrotrophy known in vertebrates, including a yolk-sac placenta, which involves several significant ontogenetic modifications to fetal and maternal tissues. The selective pressures that have driven the evolution of complex placentas in some shark species, but not in others, are unresolved. Herein we review the mechanisms of reproductive allocation and placental diversity in sharks, and consider the application of both adaptive and conflict hypotheses for the evolution of placental nutrient provisioning. Both have likely played roles in placental evolution in sharks, perhaps at different times in evolutionary history. Finally, we recommend sharks as an outstanding model system to investigate the evolution of placentas and mechanisms for fetal nutrition during pregnancy in vertebrates.

AB Prediction of ecosystem response to global environmental change is a pressing scientific challenge of major societal relevance. Many ecosystems display nonlinear responses to environmental change, and may even undergo practically irreversible 'regime shifts' that initiate ecosystem collapse. Recently, early warning signals based on spatiotemporal metrics have been proposed for the identification of impending regime shifts. The rapidly increasing availability of remotely sensed data provides excellent opportunities to apply such model-based spatial early warning signals in the real world, to assess ecosystem resilience and identify impending regime shifts induced by global change. Such information would allow land-managers and policy makers to interfere and avoid catastrophic shifts, but also to induce regime shifts that move ecosystems to a desired state. Here, we show that the application of spatial early warning signals in real-world landscapes presents unique and unexpected challenges, and may result in misleading conclusions when employed without careful consideration of the spatial data and processes at hand. We identify key practical and theoretical issues and provide guidelines for applying spatial early warning signals in heterogeneous, real-world landscapes based on literature review and examples from real-world data. Major identified issues include (1) spatial heterogeneity in real-world landscapes may enhance reversibility of regime shifts and boost landscape-level resilience to environmental change (2) ecosystem states are often difficult to define, while these definitions have great impact on spatial early warning signals and (3) spatial environmental variability and socio-economic factors may affect spatial patterns, spatial early warning signals and associated regime shift predictions. We propose a novel framework, shifting from an ecosystem perspective towards a landscape approach. The framework can be used to identify conditions under which resilience assessment with spatial remotely sensed data may be successful, to support well-informed application of spatial early warning signals, and to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to global environmental change.

AB The genus Hystrix includes eight species of porcupines distributed in Eurasia and Africa, across a broad latitudinal gradient. Our aim was to assess whether porcupine skulls: (1) allow for a reliable interspecific distinction; (2) change in size proportionally with body size; (3) follow the Bergmann's rule. We measured 235 Hystrix skulls from museums and private collections. We tested for differences in skull size and we assessed whether variability in skull shape allows species recognition through a multivariate approach. All Hystrix species considered could be reliably identified by skull shape. Skull size was correlated with body size and species differed in skull shape and size, with skulls of Hystrix javanica and Hystrix africaeaustralis being respectively the smallest and the largest ones. Within Hystrix cristata, the Mediterranean and the sub-Saharan clades differed for both skull size and shape. Using skull size, we could distinguish among African, mainland Italian and Sicilian populations. Skull size of this species decreased in size for increasing latitude values, contrary to prediction by the Bergmann's rule. Such latitudinal pattern may depend on the adaption of H. cristata to Equatorial African conditions, where the species evolved. In Italy (where H. cristata was introduced in the VI Century AD) and in North Africa, a smaller body size may be due to the local climate, or to a 'founder effect'.

AB Ecosystems' responses to changing environmental conditions can be modulated by spatial self-organization. A prominent example of this can be found in drylands, where formation of vegetation patterns attenuates the magnitude of degradation events in response to decreasing rainfall. In model studies, the pattern wavelength responds to changing conditions, which is reflected by a rather gradual decline in biomass in response to decreasing rainfall. Although these models are spatially explicit, they have adopted a mean-field approach to grazing. By taking into account spatial variability when modeling grazing, we find that (over)grazing can lead to a dramatic shift in biomass, so that degradation occurs at rainfall rates that would otherwise still maintain a relatively productive ecosystem. Moreover, grazing increases the resilience of degraded ecosystem states. Consequently, restoration of degraded ecosystems could benefit from the introduction of temporary small-scale exclosures to escape from the basin of attraction of degraded states.

AB Plants may depend on nurse plants to establish and survive on gypsum environments, which are stressful for plant life. Shrubs may act as nurse plants by ameliorating micro-environmental conditions in their local vicinity. Despite its importance, the role of nurse shrubs on the spatial patterning of plant establishment remains largely unknown in gypsum communities. Our aim was to understand the patterns of plant establishment and to identify key nurse species in facilitating plant establishment and structuring plant diversity at community level in these environments. We set an observational study in two gypsum plant communities of NE Spain to assess the microsites where seedlings germinate. Also, we assessed the role of six dominant shrubs (gypsophytes and gypsovags), in spatially structuring plant diversity by assessing species-area relationships in their local vicinity to identify key nurse species. To assess the potential amelioration of micro-environmental conditions associated to shrubs, we analyzed physical-chemical soil properties under shrub canopies compared to open areas. Most plants were spatially associated with adult shrubs. Gypsophytes accumulated more diversity than gypsovags, despite both showing ameliorated conditions under canopy compared to open areas. In conclusion, gypsophyte shrubs play key roles in the structure of gypsum plant communities by facilitating plant establishment.

AB Anthropogenic global climate change is anticipated to increase the frequency and intensity of transient extreme weather events that can be catastrophic to ecological communities. Here, we characterize an extremely stressful, transient phenomenon on southeastern Mediterranean (Israel) rocky shores: prolonged desiccation events (PDE). We also examined (during 2012-2014) its potential ecological impacts on the unique intertidal Mediterranean Sea ecosystemvermetid reefs. In this region, where the tide is minimal but the rocky intertidal is extensive, high pressure and dry easterly winds generated by specific synoptic systems can suppress tidal flooding and create stressful desiccation conditions in the lower intertidal zones for many consecutive days (several days to weeks). Very long and strong PDEs resulted in extensive macroalgal bleaching and their eventual removal from the rocks and caused mortality of stranded topshell snails and partial collapse of the mid-shore limpet population. Dominant intertidal fleshy algae were shown to be more sensitive than calcareous algae to desiccation stress, but both die after 24h of exposure in lab conditions. Re-analysis of climatic data for the period 1960-2010 showed a considerable increase in the frequency of PDE-generating synoptic systems, mainly during winter. This means that desiccation stress has already increased on southeastern Mediterranean vermetid reef ecological communities, and if this trend continues, we can expect further increases in aerial exposure and desiccation stress that could have long-term impacts on this fragile ecosystem. These results demonstrate the importance of change in patterns of synoptic systems and wind regimes to the integrity of coastal ecological communities.

AB The main objective of this study was to identify and investigate the atmospheric dispersion of fine particles from a cement plant stack in Doroud (Iran). For that, we used the SCREEN3 software, developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, and a Gaussian plume model for particles dispersion from the source. Simulated particles concentrations in ambient air were compared with measured data to evaluate the performance of both models. Upwind-downwind method was also applied to evaluate the ground-level PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations in the cement industry surroundings. The maximum particle concentrations were obtained within a radius of 1600-1800m around the source in downwind direction. Within this area the modelled concentrations were strongly correlated to in-situ measured data (r(2)=0.98). The simulated and measured results show that the PM10 concentrations have significantly exceeded the daily (50 mu g/m(3), about 62.8%) and annual (20 mu g/m(3), about 82.3%) limit values established by the World Health Organization. Therefore, due to hazardous emissions a distance greater than 7500 m, in downwind direction of prevailing wind, is recommended to build residents' habitation. Quantification of air pollution impacts on the public health has increasingly become a critical component in the policy discussion. Both models provide useful information to define pollution areas for the environmental and health impact assessment and to provide recommendations for the implementation of effective local policies and mitigation strategies for air pollution.

AB Uncovering the limiting factors for benthic algal distributions in lakes is of great importance to understanding of their role in global carbon cycling. However, limited is known about the benthic algal community distribution and how they are influenced by geographic distance and environmental variables in alpine lakes. Here, we investigated the benthic algal community compositions in the surface sediments of six lakes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), China (salinity ranging from 0.8 to 365.6 g/L; pairwise geographic distance among the studied lakes ranging 8-514 km) employing an integrated approach including Illumina-Miseq sequencing and environmental geochemistry. The results showed that the algal communities of the studied samples were mainly composed of orders of Bacillariales, Ceramiales, Naviculales, Oscillatoriales, Spirulinales, Synechococcales, and Vaucheriales. The benthic algal community compositions in these QTP lakes were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with many environmental (e.g., dissolved inorganic and organic carbon, illumination intensity, total nitrogen and phosphorus, turbidity and water temperature) and spatial factors, and salinity did not show significant influence on the benthic algal community structures in the studied lakes. Furthermore, geographic distance showed strong, significant correlation (r = 0.578, p < 0.001) with the benthic algal community compositions among the studied lakes, suggesting that spatial factors may play important roles in influencing the benthic algal distribution. These results expand our current knowledge on the influencing factors for the distributions of benthic alga in alpine lakes.

AB The 'cost of reproduction' refers to a series of negative effects that reproduction has on females. One behavioural cost of reproduction in vertebrates is the loss of or decrease in motility. Diminished locomotion in gravid individuals has serious potential effects on various behaviours, including locomotion, predation, antipredator, migration and the patrolling of territories. However, there have not been comparable studies on marine invertebrates. To address the cost of reproduction in marine invertebrates, we studied the sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus, as a model system. Using time-lapse technology and behavioural analysis software, we analysed the locomotor behaviour of A. japonicus from the nonbreeding to the mature stage. In addition, metabolism in muscle tissue of animals between the nonbreeding and growth stage was tested with ultraperformance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The results showed that reproduction had no negative effects on locomotion frequency or maximum velocity. However, the total distance moved and cumulative duration of moving gradually decreased. Therefore, the results suggest that loss of locomotor endurance is the behavioural cost of reproduction in female A. japonicus. Additionally, we found 10 significant metabolic changes in the muscle tissue of animals in the growth stage. These results suggest that oxidative stress and lipid metabolism are potential physiological mechanisms linking reproduction and depressed locomotory performance.

AB Arenaria polytrichoides (Caryophyllaceae) is a common cushion plant occurring at high elevations in the Himalaya- Hengduan Mountains, SW China. It frequently has other non-cushion species growing within its canopy, forming a contrast with the surrounding areas because it creates patches of higher diversity and greater biomass. In this study, we examined the relationship between the cushions and associated noncushion species along a gradient of cushion size. A total of 200 A. polytrichoides individuals were selected to fit four size classes. Field measurements were carried out to assess canopy structure, functional traits relevant to growth and reproduction, and soil quality below cushions along the size gradient. Furthermore, the size effect of cushions on the richness and abundance of species and biomass production was also examined. All the morphological variables examined exhibited a positive correlation with cushion size, as did the nutrients under cushions. Large and compact cushions were associated with higher soil nutrient contents compared with small and loose cushions. As a result of these biogenic environmental changes, there was a stronger facilitation effect performed by large cushions. Data pertaining to functional traits revealed that large cushions benefit from the enhanced resources within their compact structure and exhibit greater fitness and a higher reproductive output than small cushions. Our data indicated that interactions occur between cushion species and other plants depending on the size of the cushions, probably because of the greater heterogeneity of conditions beneath larger cushions. These findings provide a clear demonstration of the generally overlooked importance of the traits of nurse plants, such as size and age, in terms of their facilitative effects.

AB Monitoring demographic and genetic parameters of reintroduced populations of endangered species is essential for evaluating and informing conservation strategies to maximize the chances of a successful recovery. We applied noninvasive genetic monitoring using fecal DNA to evaluate demographic and genetic parameters as they relate to the recovery of the endangered Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit (Brachylagus idahoensis) in central Washington, United States, during the initial 3 years of a renewed reintroduction effort. We quantified post-release dispersal, apparent survival, and reproduction in the wild, and monitored the genetic diversity and composition of the released cohorts, wild surviving population, and breeding population held in large enclosures. During this study, we reintroduced 1,206 pygmy rabbits into the wild, and detected a total of 176 individuals living on or near the release area during surveys the following winters. Median dispersal distance of juveniles was 776 m, compared to 471 m for adults, and dispersal distances for juveniles decreased for rabbits released later in the release season. Survival of juveniles differed across years and was positively associated with release date, release weight (a surrogate for age), and heterozygosity. Survival of adults was similarly influenced by release day, with some evidence for a positive effect of heterozygosity. Only 14 wild-born individuals were detected during the study. Genetic monitoring was an effective way to evaluate the demographic and genetic status of the reintroduced population within a limited study area, to inform changes to the conservation strategy, and to generate a data set to address long-term research and recovery goals.

AB Reintroduction projects aim to reestablish a self-sustaining population of an endangered species within its historical range. Adequate post-release monitoring by gathering demographic data is important to evaluate the success of a reintroduction. Survival and reproduction rates of a reintroduced population can be compared with a self-sustaining wild population to evaluate the success of a reintroduction. In early 2007, Nipponia nippon (Crested Ibis) was reintroduced into the Qinling Mountains (Shaanxi, Central China). In this study, we attempt to evaluate the demographic status of the reintroduced population. Age-specific survival rates of 56 released adults and 77 wild-born fledglings were estimated using mark-recapture data obtained from 2007 to 2014. Survival rates for the yearlings (0.599, with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.467-0.719) were lower than the estimates from a wild population in Yangxian County, but the survival rates of the adults (0.678, with 95% CI: 0.603-0.745) were similar. The number of breeding pairs gradually increased since 2008, although breeding success (52.5%) was somewhat less than that of the wild population (67.6%). The stochastic estimation of population growth rate (1.084 with 95% CI: 1.069-1.098) and population size (5-fold increase) estimated from an age-classified Leslie matrix indicate that the reintroduced population of the Crested Ibis is more likely in regulation phase over the next 25 years. We conclude that the reintroduction of the Crested Ibis in Qinling Mountains has great promise, and progress toward a self-sustaining population has been made under some interventions. Governments, local communities, and scientists need to facilitate habitat restoration for the long-term survival of this endangered species.

AB Historically, small-scale inland fisheries have been overlooked. Management practices based on industrial fishing, rarely take into account vital factors such as complex socio-environmental relations. This paper aims to help address this gap, contributing to a better understanding of small-scale inland fisheries. It uses the Pantanal wetland of Brazil as a case study, in which policymakers established restrictive fishing rules based on claims that local overfishing had caused numbers of recreational fishing tourists to decline. Through multiple regressions, participatory observation and mapping, this paper deconstructs the environmental narrative and uncovers the area's complex traditional system of use. The case study, firstly illustrates the adverse consequences of misconceived top-down fishing management practices and, how such environmental narratives may be deconstructed. Then it presents important aspects of customary management in inland floodplains fisheries, including high levels of mobility within a common property regime and unexploitable reserves. It concludes by analysing recently proposed categories of property regimes, identifying fundamental elements that must be taken into account in designing appropriate management policies in inland floodplain fisheries.

AB To fully understand the bacterial processes in tomb environments, it is necessary to investigate the details of the bacterial communities present under such oligotrophic conditions. Here, high -throughput sequencing based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequences was used to fully evaluate the bacterial communities at different sites in the tomb of Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty. We also aimed to identify the soil factors that were significant related to bacterial diversity and community composition. The results showed the presence of a broad taxonomic diversity that included nine major phyla. Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominated the bacterial profiles in all tomb soil samples. However, significant differences between deposited soils (DS) and covering soils (CSA, CSB and CSC) were revealed by chemistry -based principal component analysis (PCA), the number of OTUs, and the Chao 1 and Shannon indexes. At the family level, hierarchically clustered heatmap and LefSe analyses showed differences in the bacterial community compositions at different sampling sites. Notably, CSA contained significant populations of Nocardioidaceae, Pseudonocardiaceae and Streptomycetaceae, which are often reported to be associated with biodeterioration in cave environments. Further, the most abundant group (>10%) in all soil samples was Streptococcaceae, whose abundance decreased from 34.66% to 13.43% with increasing soil depth. The results of redundancy analysis (RDA) and the Monte Carlo permutation test indicated that soil pH and Cu and Mn levels were significantly related to the bacterial communities in this tomb. This research offers new insight into bacterial communities in cave environments and also provides important information for the protection of this historically important tomb.

AB There is good evidence that natural selection drives the evolution of locomotor performance, but the processes that generate the among-individual variation for selection to act on are relatively poorly understood. We measured prolonged swimming performance, U-crit, and morphology in a large cohort (n=461) of wild-type zebrafish (Danio rerio) at similar to 6 months and again at similar to 9 months. Using mixed-model analyses to estimate repeatability as the intraclass correlation coefficient, we determined that U-crit was significantly repeatable (r=0.55; 95% CI: 0.45-0.64). Performance differences between the sexes (males 12% faster than females) and changes with age (decreasing 0.07% per day) both contributed to variation in U-crit and, therefore, the repeatability estimate. Accounting for mean differences between sexes within the model decreased the estimate of U-crit repeatability to 21% below the naive estimate, while fitting age in the models increased the estimate to 14% above the naive estimate. Greater consideration of factors such as age and sex is therefore necessary for the interpretation of performance repeatability in wild populations. Body shape significantly predicted U-crit in both sexes in both assays, with the morphology-performance relationship significantly repeatable at the population level. However, morphology was more strongly predicative of performance in older fish, suggesting a change in the contribution of morphology relative to other factors such as physiology and behaviour. The morphology-performance relationship changed with age to a greater extent in males than females.

AB Air entrained during the transfer of bulk materials from one belt conveyor to another is a primary factor of dust emissions. However, theoretical calculation of the volumetric flow rate of air entrainment is very difficult to obtain, resulting in inaccurate and unreliable design and operation of dust control systems. This paper summarizes existing theoretical calculation and experimental methods, as well as techniques employed to decrease air entrainment. The current study focuses on the process of physical motion and energy conversion of falling bulk materials, the flow pattern of free-falling particles, and the factors which influence the generation of air entrainment. Additionally, the impact of certain devices on the weakening or guiding of air entrainment is also discussed.

AB The use of captive animals for population re-establishment or augmentation can be an important part of conservation efforts, but practitioners need experimentally derived evidence to guide the best strategies and inform whether such practices could be successful. Here, we examined how several manipulations to captive-rearing practices influence the performance of the Common Watersnake, Nerodia sipedon sipedon, during their first year in the wild. Following release, snakes that had experienced a period of enrichment during captivity to better simulate natural environments did not differ from conspecifics reared in more simplistic conditions on any measure of post-release behavior or performance. Moreover, captive snakes in both treatments exhibited habitat use, movement, thermoregulatory, and seasonal activity behaviors largely indistinguishable from resident conspecifics at the release site, and ultimately performed similarly in maintenance of body condition and survivorship. These results are in contrast to earlier releases and suggest that using older and larger individuals that have undergone a period of simulated winter dormancy may improve success during the early phase of establishment. However, captive snakes grew only one third as fast as wild native snakes, suggesting they experienced difficulties foraging in the wild. Further studies testing the effectiveness of translocation programs using captive animals as a management tool are urgently needed, but our findings do point to some success.

AB Background: Individual body growth is controlled in large part by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of, and competition for, resources. Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos L.) are an excellent species for studying the effects of resource heterogeneity and maternal effects (i.e. silver spoon) on life history traits such as body size because their habitats are highly variable in space and time. Here, we evaluated influences on body size of grizzly bears in Alberta, Canada by testing six factors that accounted for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environments during maternal, natal and 'capture' (recent) environments. After accounting for intrinsic biological factors (age, sex), we examined how body size, measured in mass, length and body condition, was influenced by: (a) population density; (b) regional habitat productivity; (c) inter-annual variability in productivity (including silver spoon effects); (d) local habitat quality; (e) human footprint (disturbances); and (f) landscape change.
   Results: We found sex and age explained the most variance in body mass, condition and length (R-2 from 0.48-0.64). Inter-annual variability in climate the year before and of birth (silver spoon effects) had detectable effects on the three-body size metrics (R-2 from 0.04-0.07); both maternal (year before birth) and natal (year of birth) effects of precipitation and temperature were related with body size. Local heterogeneity in habitat quality also explained variance in body mass and condition (R-2 from 0.01-0.08), while annual rate of landscape change explained additional variance in body length (R-2 of 0.03). Human footprint and population density had no observed effect on body size.
   Conclusions: These results illustrated that body size patterns of grizzly bears, while largely affected by basic biological characteristics (age and sex), were also influenced by regional environmental gradients the year before, and of, the individual's birth thus illustrating silver spoon effects. The magnitude of the silver spoon effects was on par with the influence of contemporary regional habitat productivity, which showed that both temporal and spatial influences explain in part body size patterns in grizzly bears. Because smaller bears were found in colder and less-productive environments, we hypothesize that warming global temperatures may positively affect body mass of interior bears.

AB North Africa is an intricate biogeographical region at the crossroads of immigration waves from tropical Africa and Asia. Species confined between various barriers (Atlas Mountains, arid environments such as the Sahara in the south, water masses such as the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west) were generally forced to adapt locally to environmental changes instead of tracking their habitat by shifting their distribution area. The present study aims at providing first insight into the evolution of the genus Mus, and more specifically of the western Mediterranean species Mus spretus in this area. The study relies on the abundant Late Pleistocene and Middle Holocene fossil assemblage from the El Harhoura 2 cave (Rabat-Temara, Morocco). This exceptional record was studied using geometric morphometrics applied to first upper and lower molars, constituting the most informative and best preserved fossil remains for such small rodents. Two main issues were addressed. (1) Geometric morphometrics was used to clarify taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships among fossil and modern species in this area. Morphometric analysis revealed good discrimination of most modern and fossil species but failed to document intermediate forms tracing anagenetic evolution. Not mutually exclusive, the occurrence of complex processes of morphological evolution in this genus such as parallel evolution and the action of stabilizing selection may make it difficult to translate patterns of morphological evolution into phylogenetic conclusions. (2) The record was shown to document a sequence of intraspecific evolution of M.spretus. The morphology of the molars through the fossil record of El Harhoura 2 was surprisingly stable despite extensive modern variation. The limited temporal variation largely failed to correlate to palaeoenvironmental proxies. The mouse fossil record at El Harhoura 2 thus presents an intriguing case of morphological stasis despite extensive environmental changes. This long-term stability may have been recently perturbed by anthropogenic factors including landscape changes and introduction of various competitors and predators, leading to a size reduction.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2013, 109, 599-621.

AB Facilitation has been reported for a wide range of plant communities, with evidence of interactions between prot g and nurse plants shifting during their ontogenetic cycles. This study showed that large Ampelodesmos mauritanicus tussocks can act as nurse for different species, but only after fire occurrence. Large tussocks are typically composed by an external belt of living tillers surrounding dead standing tillers in the inner area, thus being arranged as a "ring" shape. A low plant diversity in unburned sites, dominated by intact Ampelodesmos tussocks, was related to the intense aboveground competition due to space physical limitation by standing tillers, as well as to the reduction of light availability at ground level. In contrast, after burning, tussocks resprouted only in their external belts, leaving empty inner areas. During post-fire recovery, several species (e.g. Plantago spp., Trifolium spp., Carlina spp.) recolonize the bare soil among different tussocks. On the other hand, a moss (Funaria hygrometrica) and several herbaceous and woody plants (e.g. Spartium junceum, Calicotome villosa, Quercus pubescens subsp. pubescens) were selectively distributed within the ash-full central areas of burned Ampelodesmos tussocks. In summary, the study reported evidence of changing prevalence in the interplay of competition and facilitation effects between small and large Ampelodesmos tussocks, respectively. These results suggest a broad significance of the interactions between fire occurrence and ontogenetic phases of the dominant species in affecting the restoration dynamics of natural plant communities.

AB Threatened populations of birds are often restored after bottleneck events by using reintroduction techniques. Whilst population numbers are often increased by using such measures, the long-term genetic effects of reintroductions and post-release management of the resulting populations are frequently overlooked. We identify an overall declining trend in population-wide estimates of genetic diversity over two decades since the initial recovery of the population from the most severe part of this species' bottleneck. Additionally, by incorporating the genotypes of known founding individuals into population viability simulations, we evaluate the genetic effects of population management under various scenarios at both the metapopulation and subpopulation levels. We reveal that whilst population augmentation has led to increased genetic homogenisation among subpopulations, significant differentiation still exists. Simulations predict that even with a low level of natural dispersal leading to gene-flow this differentiation could be ameliorated. We conclude by offering a number of key recommendations relating to post-recovery management of reintroduced bird populations which support the encouragement of individual dispersal using established management techniques such as artificial nest-site provisioning.

AB Nutrient release from lake sediments may increase concentrations of harmful algal toxins - such as microcystins - by stimulating blooms of toxigenic cyanobacteria. This hypothesis is supported by a series of experiments in which intact cores of sediment were incubated under different environmental conditions, after which the water overlying the sediments was harvested as a culture medium for growing a toxic strain of the common cyanobacterium Microcystis. Both littoral and profundal sediments from Lake Kinneret, the largest freshwater lake in Israel, released substantial amounts of dissolved phosphorus (1.0 and 4.0 mg.m(-2).d(-1), respectively) and nitrogen (44.2 and 24.3 mg.m(-2).d(-1), respectively) under simulated summer conditions in the laboratory. In comparison, nutrient fluxes from sediments under simulated winter conditions were considerably smaller or negative. The addition of nutrient-rich overlying water harvested from profundal sediments, and to a lesser extent from littoral sediments, increased both chlorophyll a and microcystin concentrations in Microcystis cultures. In contrast, when Microcystis cells were inoculated in natural surface waters only, the cultures did not grow or produce microcystins, and soon collapsed. This study provides experimental evidence of a link between internal nutrient loading from sediments and microcystin concentrations in freshwaters, and demonstrates how environmental factors may indirectly exert control over toxin concentrations in freshwater lakes.

AB The presence of forest vegetation can aid in preserving the permafrost layer by maintaining lower soil temperatures via the accretion of an organic layer at the surface. This layer has a low bulk density and low thermal conductivity (due also to high evapotranspiration rates by forest vegetation), which insulates ice-rich permafrost. Forest removal can lead to significant increases in the summer soil temperature, which increases the thickness of the active layer (i.e., the surficial layer above permafrost which thaws during summer and freezes again in winter) and causes a rise in the active layer towards the surface. When vegetation is sensitive to saturated soil conditions, a rise in the active layer can lead to the conversion of forested areas to wetlands. In this manuscript, we develop a modeling framework to relate vegetation permafrost feedbacks to the emergence of multiple stable ecosystem states. Factors related to soil temperature and hydrologic characteristics of the system were examined to see how they affect the location of the stable and unstable states. This model was also used to examine how an increase in precipitation would affect the temporal dynamics of the active layer and vegetation. Results show that the presence of forest vegetation can enhance the resilience of the system in that it is less prone to state shifts following a disturbance. Understanding these dynamics is important given, (i) the rapid rate at which these systems can shift between states, (ii) the projected climatic changes for forested areas underlain by permafrost and (iii) the high rates of forest loss in these areas.

AB Small carbonate bioconstructions, composed of micrite and vermetids, occur in the Salento Peninsula (southern Italy) at the base of the reefal early Messinian Novaglie Formation. These lens-shaped bioconstructions are tens of meters in length and up to 2.5 m in thickness, and crop out patchily along the South-Eastern Salento coast line.
   Micrite is the most abundant component. Its origin and role in this association have been investigated by means of microfacies, epifluorescence, and organic matter analyses. Three different types of micrite were recognized: (I) not/weakly fluorescent detrital micrite with a few fine bioclasts; (II) fluorescent micrite rich in fine bioclasts; (III) fluorescent clotted peloidal micrite (automicrite). The first type of micrite, mainly present in the basal layer of the carbonate bioconstructions surrounds vermetids in life position. The type (II) and type (HI) micrites occur in the overlying deposits, characterized by sub-horizontally isooriented vermetid shells.
   The high fluorescence of the type (II) and (III) micrite can be related to organic matter derived respectively from decaying metazoan and microbial organisms. Twofold organic matter origin was supported by FT-IR and GC-MS analyses, carried out on the extracted organic matter. Micrite (I) shows very low intensity of organic matter functional groups, confirming its abiotic origin. The spectra of the automicrite (III) are characterized by the presence of stretching C=C vibrations attributable to alkene and/or unsaturated carboxylic acids, that may be synthesized by microbes. GC-MS investigations indicate the presence of extended hopane series, straight chain saturated (C-14, C-16), monounsaturated (C-16, C-18), and diunsaturated C-18-acids, diagnostic of microbial activity. Microbial communities appear to have played a prominent role in the deposition and stabilization of Salento micrite vermetid carbonate bioconstructions. The type (III) micrite, classifiable as microbialite or automicrite, can be regarded a sort of "primary framework" of these small "bioconstructions". (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB New plant macrofossil localities are found in the middle-upper part of the Albian Upper Hatira Formation of Makhtesh Qatan, an erosion crater in the northern Negev. These are so far the only outcrop localities in the Negev containing plant compressions and well-preserved sporomorphs. Their age assignments are controlled by the ammonite Knemiceras records below and above the plant-bearing sequence in the adjacent Makhtesh Hatira. The macrofossil assemblages are strikingly different in the sandy fluvial and shaly lacustrine facies, the former being dominated by Araucaria, Athrotaxopsis, Brachyphyllum and pinnatifid Sapindopsis, comparable at the plant assemblage and leaf morphological levels to the early to early late Albian assemblage of the North American Potomac flora. The lacustrine shale macrofossil assemblages appear archaic on account of their diverse pteridophyte component and sparse angiosperm remains. A new supposedly gnetophytic genus and species Qataniaria noae Krassilov, gen. et sp. nov. is dominant in the shale horizon. The sporomorph assemblages are strongly dominated by psilate trilete spores (87-93%). In the absence of elaterate forms, the angiosperm pollen Afropollis jardinus, Pennipollis, Tricolpites spp. and Walkeripollis sp. is consistent with the early Albian age. The abundance and diversity of conifers and the prominence of the fern bog assemblage suggest a relatively humid phase of the regional Albian climates. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We argue for the landscape ecology community to adopt the study of poverty and the ecology of landscapes as a Grand Challenge Topic. We present five areas of possible research foci that we believe that landscape ecologists can join with other social and environmental scientists to increase scientific understanding of this pressing issue: (1) scale and poverty; (2) landscape structure and human well-being; (3) social and ecological processes linked to spatial patterns in landscapes; (4) conservation and poverty, and (5) applying the landscape ecologist's toolkit. A brief set of recommendations for landscape ecologists is also presented. These include the need to utilize broad frameworks that integrate social and ecological variables, build capacity to do this kind of work through the development of strong collaborations of researchers in developed and developing countries, create databases in international locations where extreme poverty exists, and create a new generation of researchers capable of addressing this pressing social and environmental issue.

AB Sedimentation rates of organic materials and algal pigments were measured by near-bottom traps in Lake Kinneret (Israel) throughout 2006. Pigment composition in the epilimnion and in the traps was compared by trap-to-water indices (TWIs) based on the proportion of a given pigment to the concentration of beta-carotene. The appearance of particular pigment in traps was associated with its ability to decompose and be transferred to the trap. The relative lability of pigments increased in the following order: beta-carotene > lutein+zeaxanthin > Chlorophyll b > Chlorophyll a > echinenone > fucoxanthin > Chlorophyll c > peridinin. A seasonal variability, pertaining to the thermal stratification in the lake was observed in the TWI; it showed highest values during holomixis, and lowest after an establishment of anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion. Bacteriochlorophyll e was one of the dominant pigments in traps from mid-July to mid-September, when the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium phaeobacteroides formed dense populations in the metalimnion. Using chlorophyllous pigments as a proxy for biomass, we evaluated the possible contribution of Ch. phaeobacteroides to the total sedimentation flux of all photosynthesizing organisms on an annual basis. The proportion of freshly fixed carbon in the downward flux changed seasonally, depending on the composition of the phytoplankton and thermal stratification, and was on average 22% of primary productivity at the lake centre.

AB The ecological consequences of homogenization remain relatively unexplored. One example of landscape-homogenizing is the establishment of plantations. We studied the effect of human-made forests by contrasting plant and small-mammal community composition between planted tree stands and adjacent natural habitat in two different Mediterranean habitats in Israel: (1) inland habitat where we focused on pine (Pinus halepensis) and carob (Ceratonia siliqua) stands, and (2) coastal sand dune habitat where we focused on planted acacia (Acacia saligna) stands. We first wanted to verify whether planted trees modify plant species composition, and second, if and how the small-mammal community is affected by the different habitat conditions created in plantations with different canopy cover. We were especially interested in the abundance of the commensal house mouse (Mus musculus). All tree stands underwent biotic homogenization indicated by abundance of house mice coupled with lower diversity of indigenous vegetation and small-mammal abundances and diversities. Habitat structural diversity was positively related with small-mammals diversity and was lower in artificial tree stands in both habitats. Our results suggest that using the abundance of commensal generalist species such as the house mouse relative to other more specialist small-mammals is a good approach to determine ecosystem integrity. Pre-commercial thinning treatment is a potential management tool to maintain a proportion of native tree species within the canopy of planted tree stands. However, until sufficient data is available for making generalizations, the exact level of thinning necessary to reverse the homogenization processes in man-made plantations and keeping indigenous small-mammal communities diverse and less prone to invasion must be determined empirically.

AB The increased use of white clover in grasslands has led to new management challenges, as mixed pastures have been associated with unstable herbage production. The stability of mixed pastures depends on a complex of intrinsic ecosystem properties, on the variability of the environment, and on the spatial and temporal scale at which it is studied. In this paper, intrinsic ecosystem properties and processes are explored and illustrated using a simple dynamic simulation model of grass and clover interactions. Competition for light, the delayed availability of nitrogen fixed by white clover, grazing per se, preferential grazing for clover, and cutting were identified as destabilising processes. Instead, niche-differentiation, nitrogen dependence of grass and clover, and plant mechanisms to 'escape' from grazing, were identified as stabilising processes. The intrinsic stability of mixed swards depended on the balance of, and the interactions between these processes. Including the temperature as an environmental variable into the model, unstable ecosystems were stabilised by seasonal temperature fluctuations, and were either further destabilised, or stabilised by stochastic temperature fluctuations. Stable ecosystems were always destabilised by these stochastic fluctuations. It is explained how spatial heterogeneity can stabilise ecosystems, which oscillate at patch scale. Heterogeneity can be maximised by increasing the incidence of small-scale disturbances and by minimising large-scale disturbances. Finally, three concepts of stability are presented. The actual stability is defined as the stability of grasslands as measured in the field, i.e. subjected to both seasonal and stochastic environmental fluctuations. The extrinsic stability presumes the presence of seasonal, yet the absence of stochastic environmental fluctuations. The intrinsic stability represents the stability of yields in a hypothetical constant environment. It is explained how these concepts of stability can bridge the gap between experimental and theoretical studies. It is demonstrated that long-term experiments are required for the experimental analysis of grassland stability, and it is argued that the development of spatially and environmentally explicit simulation models is a prerequisite for the prototyping of management systems for mixed grasslands.

TI Realistic parameter assessment for a well known elephant-tree ecosystem
   model reveals that limit cycles are unlikely
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING

ID NATIONAL-PARK; VEGETATION
AB In 1976 Caugley proposed a simple predator-prey model for elephant-tree dynamics. To our knowledge no-one has attempted to assess this model against real data. The significance of Caughley's model was to show that limit cycle behavior is possible for the elephant-tree system. Using realistic parameter estimates the paper emphasizes that, in fact, limit cycles are highly unlikely. For a wide range of realistic parameter estimates the model predicts a fixed point equilibrium between elephant and trees. Equilibrium model results are compared to real data for systems where there is a strong dependence between elephant and a dominant tree species. These results compare well giving added confidence in the biological premises of the model. Reasonable variations in parameter values change the equilibrium points in explainable ways. The conclusion is that this model, while crude, is realistic for certain ecological situations and can provide useful insights into such ecosystems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The contribution of zooplankton and the water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, to the internal cycling of phosphorus was investigated in Pampulha Reservoir, in the shallow and eutrophic Pampulha Reservoir. In the last 20 years, algal blooms, as well as outbreaks of the macrophyte, have been observed with increasing frequency. Previous investigations have suggested that phosphorus is the limiting nutrient controlling the plant production in this ecosystem. A restoration program is currently underway aiming at the complete removal of external nutrient input. Therefore, the knowledge of the magnitude of some internal metabolic processes would be desirable in order to estimate the time lag that would be necessary for the recovery of water quality. The production and loss of macrophyte biomass was monitored in limnocurrals between May 1994 and April 1995. The zooplankton was also monitored during this period at a central sampling point. The biomass losses of macrophytes were followed in marked plants during their growing season. The P-content of macrophyte biomass was also measured monthly. Excretion rates of zooplankton collected in the reservoir were determined using short time experiments at the laboratory. This study demonstrated that zooplankton was more important for the P-cycling during the dry season when it was able to recycle a maximum of 26% d(-1) of total phosphorus in lake water. The macrophyte contribution was more important during the rainy season (especially at the end of the rainy season). In April 1995, the macrophytes were able to recycle as much as 26% d(-1) of the total phosphorus present in the water. At this time of the year, both communities recycled more than 40% d(-1) of the total phosphorus available in water. Therefore, it was demonstrated that zooplankton and macrophytes play a key role in the internal cycling of a limiting nutrient in this reservoir.

AB We studied under laboratory conditions the post-embryonic developmental rates (from nauplii to adult stage) of Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides, commonly found in the eutrophic and hypertrophic local ponds, in relation to different food types. Nauplii hatched from the eggs collected from laboratory-maintained mass cultures were reared at 25 +/- 1.5 degrees C, using the following test diets: bacteria (Klebsiella aerogenes), cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa, as single cells and in the form of colonies), green algae (Chlorella, Scenedesmus and Chlorogonium), ciliates (Tetrahymena) and rotifers (Brachionus angularis). The developmental rates were fastest, and the proportion of nauplii reaching the copepodid stage and that of copepodids reaching the adult stage the highest, with Chlorogonium, followed by ciliates and rotifers. Development was incomplete with bacteria and Microcystis. The algae Chlorella and Scenedesmus supported complete post-embryonic development only when cultured in media enriched with beef extract, bactotryptone and yeast extract. With rotifers as the exclusive food, > 70% of the nauplii reached the copepodid stage, and > 85% of the copepodids the adult stage. The ratio (D-c/D-n) of copepodid duration (D-c) and naupliar duration (D-n) was significantly different from 1.0, indicating the absence of isochronal development in M.thermocyclopoides. Our results show that post-embryonic development in this species is not possible with certain algal diets, probably because of nutritional deficiencies, and that the later stage nauplii are capable of capturing rotifers and utilizing them as food to complete their development to the adult stage.

AB A sampling technique designed to study the distribution of macroalgae associated with Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. pneumatophores was applied. Eighteen species of algae were recorded growing epiphytically on the pneumatophores. A variety of environmental factors were measured simultaneously. Resultant data were subjected to Correspondence Analysis and grouping patterns which influenced the two major axes on the scatterplot revealed the presence of ecological gradients through the mangrove swamp. Algal cover was dominated by Bostrychia moritziana (Sender) J. Ag., B. radicans (Mont.) Mont. and Caloglossa leprieurii (Mont.) J. Ag. Clustering of these species on the scatterplot corresponded to a salinity gradient through the swamp from isosalinity in the south to hyposalinity towards the north. A second gradient, lateral in influence, corresponding to wetting frequency was apparent from the permanent water supply (the creek) outwards to the drier outer pneumatophore perimeter. Microcoleus chthonoplastes Thuret ex Gomont and Lyngbya confervoides C. Ag. ex Gomont were the most abundant Cyanophyceae, but were usually inconspicuous within the mass of Rhodophyceae. Rhizoclonium implexum (Dillw.) Kuetz. and R. riparium (Roth) Harvey, which were visually obvious in the field when clustered together in macroscopic colonies, were the most abundant members of the Chlorophyceae. Distribution of the blue-green and green algae was similar to that of the red algae, although they tended to be more apparent in the drier areas as the red algae became less dominant. Salinity, tidal inundation and the related wetting frequency appeared to be the main environmental factors governing horizontal zonation of epiphytic algae associated with mangroves in this estuarine ecosystem.

AB Nitrification does not occur in conventional fish ponds or in oxidation ponds. Yet, intensive nitrification occurs in continually aerated and mixed fish ponds and in activated sludge systems. In a combined fish pond system, water from a conventional pond is pumped through a continually aerated and mixed pond, with a 5 h average hydraulic residence time. Unlike other aerated ponds, nitrification did not occur in this case.
   The masons for nitrification inhibition were studied in laboratory and field experiments. Inhibited nitrification was not due to any factor associated with water composition and persisted even when the water was replaced. In addition, it was not limited by a lack of inoculum. Nitrification in a laboratory assay started immediately in samples taken from a continually aerated pond, while it started only following a 24-48 h lag period in water sampled from a conventional pond or from the combined pond system.
   Nitrifying bacteria have to adapt to the partial anoxic conditions in the conventional pond. It is assumed that the lag period is needed by the reverse process, adaptation to oxic conditions. The ecological and practical implications of this phenomenon are discussed. The lag period is needed when nitrifiers are transferred from anoxic to oxic conditions as a protective mechanism to ensure that nitrification will take place only if continuous or long-term oxic conditions prevail.

AB To investigate their potential effects on each other in nature, calanoid (Diaptomus clavipes and D. siciloides) and cyclopoid (Acanthocyclops vernalis and Mesocyclops edax) copepod populations were manipulated in 5 liter aquaria in laboratory experiments of 20-60 days duration.  Diaptomus generally had a strongly negative effect on both cyclopoid species.  The cyclopoids established populations more successfully when introduced to aquaria  before calanoids than they did when calanoids were already present.  On the other hand, whether introduced earlier or later than the cyclopoids, Diaptomus  populations were unaffected by Acanthocyclops and were strongly depressed by Mesocyclops. Diaptomus effects on the phytoplankton were often strong but varied markedly among experiments.  They included reduction of populations of edible algae, such as Chlamydomonas, which are essential for both calanoid and cyclopoid nauplii, and large increases in inedible algae, such as Kirchneriella. Feeding experiments revealed that under conditions of food scarcity Acanthocyclops nauplii survived less well than did Diaptomus nauplii.  Competition for edible phytoplankton seemed to be a key factor in the calanoid-cyclopoid interactions, since the survival of herbivorous cyclopoid larvae determined the abundance of the predaceous adults.  This indicates that the competitive effects of calanoids on cyclopoids often may exceed the predative effects of cyclopoids on calanoids.

TI Conservation status of the world's skinks (Scincidae): Taxonomic and

AB Our knowledge of the conservation status of reptiles, the most diverse class of terrestrial vertebrates, has improved dramatically over the past decade, but still lags behind that of the other tetrapod groups. Here, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation (similar to 92% of the world's similar to 1714 described species) of the conservation status of skinks (Scincidae), a speciose reptile family with a worldwide distribution. Using International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) criteria, we report that similar to 20% of species are threatened with extinction, and nine species are Extinct or Extinct in the Wild. The highest levels of threat are evident in Madagascar and the Neotropics, and in the subfamilies Mabuyinae, Eugongylinae and Scincinae. The vast majority of threatened skink species were listed based primarily on their small geographic ranges (Criterion B, 83%; Criterion D2, 13%). Although the population trend of 42% of species was stable, 14% have declining populations. The key threats to skinks are habitat loss due to agriculture, invasive species, and biological resource use (e.g., hunting, timber harvesting). The distributions of 61% of species do not overlap with protected areas. Despite our improved knowledge of the conservation status of the world's skinks, 8% of species remain to be assessed, and 14% are listed as Data Deficient. The conservation status of almost a quarter of the world's skink species thus remains unknown. We use our updated knowledge of the conservation status of the group to develop and outline the priorities for the conservation assessment and management of the world's skink species.

AB Endemic freshwater fish from semiarid environments are among the most threated species in the world due to water overexploitation and habitat fragmentation problems. Stepped or pool-type fishways are used worldwide to reestablish longitudinal connectivity and mitigate fish migration problems. Many of them are being installed or planned in rivers of semiarid environments, however, very few studies about fish passage performance through pool-type fishways has been carried out to date on these regions. The present work focuses on the passage performance of two potamodromous cyprinids endemic of these regions, with different ecological and swimming behavior: southern Iberian barbel (Luciobarbus sclateri) and Iberian straight-mouth nase (Pseudochondrostoma polylepis). These are assessed in two of the most common types of stepped fishways: vertical slot and submerged notch with bottom orifice fishways. Experiments were carried out during the spawning season in the Segura River (southeastern Spain), using a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag and antenna system. Ascent success was greater than 80%, with a median transit time lower than 17 minutes per meter of height in all trials, and for both species and fishway types. Results show that both types of fishways, if correctly designed and constructed, provide interesting alternatives for the restoration of fish migration pathways in these regions.

AB Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) appear to be robustly risk-seeking in computerized gambling tasks typically used for electrophysiology. This behavior distinguishes them from many other animals, which are risk-averse, albeit measured in more naturalistic contexts. We wondered whether macaques' risk preferences reflect their evolutionary history or derive from the less naturalistic elements of task design associated with the demands of physiological recording. We assessed macaques' risk attitudes in a task that is somewhat more naturalistic than many that have previously been used: subjects foraged at four feeding stations in a large enclosure. Patches (i.e., stations), provided either stochastically or non-stochastically depleting rewards. Subjects' patch residence times were longer at safe than at risky stations, indicating a preference for safe options. This preference was not attributable to a win-stay-lose-shift heuristic and reversed as the environmental richness increased. These findings highlight the lability of risk attitudes in macaques and support the hypothesis that the ecological validity of a task can influence the expression of risk preference.

AB Aim Avian beak morphology is a good example of how anatomical structures have evolved in response to different selective pressures, such as diet and vocalizations, but also thermoregulation. The last of these functions was neglected until recently, but convincing evidence has been provided regarding the capacity of birds to regulate heat dissipation through their highly vascularized bills. According to this adaptive function and coherently with the ecogeographical "Allen's rule", which predicts smaller body appendages in colder climates, large beaks should be favoured in warm environments. Here, we tested this prediction in the cosmopolitan common barn owl group. Location World. Time period 1809-2017. Major taxa studied Tyto alba species complex. Methods We analysed the variation in bill length relative to body size according to temperature, latitude and elevation in 7,619 barn owls. The specimens were collected by 140 museums and represent three distinct evolutionary lineages that occur in geographically separated regions and cover the entire distributional range of the species complex: the Afro-Palaearctic Tyto alba, the Australasian Tyto javanica and the American Tyto furcata. Results In the three lineages, the bill becomes larger with increasing temperature. This convergent pattern of evolution of smaller bills in colder climates is associated with a latitudinal variation in temperature, because small-billed individuals occurred at higher latitudes than conspecifics living closer to the Equator. Moreover, in T. furcata, large-billed birds mostly occurred at lower elevations closer to the Equator, with bill length decreasing progressively with concomitant increase in latitude and elevation. Discussion These findings provide evidence for the repeated evolution of bill size on a global scale that is compatible with Allen's rule. These results suggest a role of the bill as a potential heat-exchange surface in nocturnal raptors, which are not directly exposed to solar radiation and whose bill shape evolved primarily to hunt and consume animal prey.

AB Background Animals that live at higher latitudes/elevations would have a larger body size (Bergmann's rule) and a smaller appendage size (Allen's rule) for thermoregulatory reasons. According to the heat conservation hypothesis, large body size and small appendage size help animals retain heat in the cold, while small body size and large appendage size help them dissipate heat in the warm. For animals living in seasonal climates, the need for conserving heat in the winter may tradeoff with the need for dissipating heat in the summer. In this study, we tested Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule in two widely-distributed passerine birds, the Oriental Magpie (Pica serica) and the Oriental Tit (Parus minor), across geographic and climatic gradients in China. Methods We measured body size (body mass and wing length) and appendage size (bill length and tarsus length) of 165 Oriental Magpie and 410 Oriental Tit individuals collected from Chinese mainland. We used linear mixed-effect models to assess variation patterns of body size and appendage size along geographic and climatic gradients. Results Oriental Magpies have a larger appendage size and Oriental Tits have a smaller body size in warmer environments. Appendage size in Oriental Magpies and body size in Oriental Tits of both sexes were more closely related to the climates in winter than in summer. Minimum temperature of coldest month is the most important factor related to bill length and tarsus length of male Oriental Magpies, and wing length of male and female Oriental Tits. Bill length and tarsus length in female Oriental Magpies were related to the annual mean temperature and mean temperature of coldest quarter, respectively. Conclusions In this study, Oriental Magpies and Oriental Tits followed Allen's rule and Bergmann' rule respectively. Temperatures in the winter, rather than temperatures in the summer, drove morphological measurements in Oriental Magpies and Oriental Tits in Chinese mainland, demonstrating that the morphological measurements reflect selection for heat conservation rather than for heat dissipation.

AB In water-limited regions, competition for water resources results in the formation of vegetation patterns; on sloped terrain, one finds that the vegetation typically aligns in stripes or arcs. We consider a two-component reaction-diffusion-advection model of Klausmeier type describing the interplay of vegetation and water resources and the resulting dynamics of these patterns. We focus on the large advection limit on constantly sloped terrain, in which the diffusion of water is neglected in favor of advection of water downslope. Planar vegetation pattern solutions are shown to satisfy an associated singularly perturbed traveling wave equation, and we construct a variety of traveling stripe and front solutions using methods of geometric singular perturbation theory. In contrast to prior studies of similar models, we show that the resulting patterns are spectrally stable to perturbations in two spatial dimensions using exponential dichotomies and Lin's method. We also discuss implications for the appearance of curved stripe patterns on slopes in the absence of terrain curvature.

AB Vegetation patterns are a ubiquitous feature of water-deprived ecosystems. Despite the competition for the same limiting resource, coexistence of several plant species is commonly observed. We propose a two-species reaction-diffusion model based on the single-species Klausmeier model, to analytically investigate the existence of states in which both species coexist. Ecologically, the study finds that coexistence is supported if there is a small difference in the plant species' average fitness, measured by the ratio of a species' capabilities to convert water into new biomass to its mortality rate. Mathematically, coexistence is not a stable solution of the system, but both spatially uniform and patterned coexistence states occur as metastable states. In this context, a metastable solution in which both species coexist corresponds to a long transient (exceeding 103 years in dimensional parameters) to a stable one-species state. This behaviour is characterised by the small size of a positive eigenvalue which has the same order of magnitude as the average fitness difference between the two species. Two mechanisms causing the occurrence of metastable solutions are established: a spatially uniform unstable equilibrium and a stable one-species pattern which is unstable to the introduction of a competitor. We further discuss effects of asymmetric interspecific competition (e.g. shading) on the metastability property.

AB 1. Bergmann's rule sensu lato, the ecogeographic pattern relating animals' body size with environmental temperature (or latitude), has been shown to be inconsistent among insect taxa. Body size clines remain largely unexplored in aquatic insects, which may show contrasting patterns to those found in terrestrial groups because of the physiological or mechanical constraints of the aquatic environment. 2. Bergmann's rule was tested using data on body size, phylogeny and distribution for 93 species belonging to four lineages of dytiscid water beetles. The relationship between size and latitude was explored at two taxonomic resolutions - within each independent lineage, and for the whole dataset - employing phylogenetic generalised least-squares to control for phylogenetic inertia. The potential influence of habitat preference (lotic versus lentic) on body size clines was also considered. 3. Within-lineage analyses showed negative relationships (i.e. converse Bergmann's rule), but only in two lineages (specifically in those that included both lotic and lentic species). By contrast, no relationship was found between body size and latitude for the whole dataset. 4. These results suggest that there may be no universal interspecific trends in latitudinal variation of body size in aquatic insects, even among closely related groups, and show the need to account for phylogenetic inertia. Furthermore, habitat preferences should be considered when exploring latitudinal clines in body size in aquatic taxa at the interspecific level.

AB Coral reefs are degrading from the effects of anthropogenic activities, including climate change. Under these stressors, their ability to survive depends upon existing phenotypic plasticity, but also transgenerational adaptation. Parental effects are ubiquitous in nature, yet empirical studies of these effects in corals are scarce, particularly in the context of climate change. This study exposed mature colonies of the common reef-building coral Stylophora pistillata from the Gulf of Aqaba to seawater conditions likely to occur just beyond the end of this century during the peak planulae brooding season (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5: pH -0.4 and +5 degrees C beyond present day). Parent and planulae physiology were assessed at multiple time points during the experimental incubation. After 5 weeks of incubation, the physiology of the parent colonies exhibited limited treatment-induced changes. All significant time-dependent changes in physiology occurred in both ambient and treatment conditions. Planulae were also resistant to future ocean conditions, with protein content, symbiont density, photochemistry, survival and settlement success not significantly different compared with under ambient conditions. High variability in offspring physiology was independent of parental or offspring treatments and indicate the use of a bet-hedging strategy in this population. This study thus demonstrates weak climate-change-associated carryover effects. Furthermore, planulae display temperature and pH resistance similar to those of adult colonies and therefore do not represent a larger future population size bottleneck. The findings add support to the emerging hypothesis that the Gulf of Aqaba may serve as a coral climate change refugium aided by these corals' inherent broad physiological resistance.

AB When plant communities suffer the stress of limited resources, for instance adverse environmental conditions such as extreme aridity, the spatial homogeneity of the biomass is lost and self-organized patterns may arise. Here, we report the observation of spiral-shaped patterns in the biomass of grass (genus deyeuxia), under highland arid conditions in the north of Chile. The spiral arms are a few meters long and a few centimeters wide. These dynamic structures are observed in the grazing area of an herbivore member of the South American camelids, the vicuna, on the border of highland wetlands. These spirals cannot be explained by the well-established mathematical models which describe other vegetation patterns (that emerge from a Turing-type of instability) such as stripes, rings, or fairy circles. We attribute the formation of spirals to the coupling between the growth of vegetation in semiarid regions and the grazing of vicunas. The mathematical analysis of this coupling reveals an excitable behavior, i.e. small perturbations of the equilibrium generate large trajectories before coming back, that is the origin of the spirals.

AB Livestock keeping and food production from grasslands play an important role in the Mediterranean region, where grazing has a long tradition and still is a key livelihood strategy. Yet, in many places widespread degradation (caused by overgrazing) severely threatens the natural resource base and prospects for future food security and sustainable development. On Samothraki, a Greek island, several decades of continuous increase of the local livestock population, exceeding not only the local food base by far but also the local farmers' ability to provide supplementary feed, led to a socio-ecological tipping point turning the dynamics downward. Still, in the face of very restricted marketing opportunities, we find local farmers in an economic deadlock of relying on CAP subsidies as a main source of income and on still too high animal numbers for maintaining an ecological balance of their land while lacking the labor power (due to large-scale migration to Germany in the 1950s and 60 s) to apply adequate management practices. In this paper, we present a feed balance (feed-demand and supply) for sheep and goats from 1970 to 2012 and discuss causes and effects of the excessive growth in animal numbers, as well as reasons for their downturn in the last decade. We describe the island's groundcover and symptoms of soil degradation, and underline our findings by reference to a remote sensing approach. Our findings recently gained in prominence as in September 2017, a state of emergency had to be declared on the island when a major weather event triggered a series of landslides that severely damaged the main town, a number of roads and bridges and even the 700 years old Fonias Tower, a marker of Samothraki tourism.

AB Rewilding is a strategy for ecological restoration that uses reintroductions of animals to re-establish the ecological functions of keystone species. Globally, rewilding efforts have focused primarily on reinstating the ecological functions of charismatic megafauna. In Australia, rewilding efforts have focused on restoring the ecological functions of herbivorous and omnivorous rodents and marsupials weighing between 30 and 5,000g inside of predator-proof exclosures. In many arid ecosystems, mammals are considered the dominant seed predators. In Australian deserts, ants are considered to be the primary removers and predators of seeds and mammals unimportant removers and predators of seeds. However, most research on granivory in Australian deserts has occurred in areas where native mammals were functionally extinct. Here, we compare rates of seed removal by mammals and ants on shrub seeds and abundance of shrub seedlings in two rewilded desert ecosystems (Arid Recovery Reserve and Scotia Wildlife Sanctuary) with adjacent areas possessing depauperate mammal faunas. We used foraging trays containing seeds of common native shrubs (Acacia ligulata and Dodonaea viscosa) to examine rates of seed removal by ants and mammals. We quantified the abundance of A. ligulata and D. viscosa seedlings inside and outside of rewilded areas along belt transects. By excluding ants and mammals from foraging trays, we show that ants removed more seeds than mammals where mammal assemblages were depauperate, but mammals removed far more seeds than ants in rewilded areas. Shrub seedlings were more abundant in areas with depauperate mammal faunas than in rewilded areas. Our study provides evidence that rewilding of desert mammal assemblages has restored the hitherto unappreciated ecological function of omnivorous rodents and bettongs as seed predators. We hypothesize that the loss of omnivorous mammals may be a factor that has facilitated shrub encroachment in arid Australia. We contend that rewilding programs aimed at restoring ecological processes should not ignore consumers with relatively lower per capita consumptive effects. This is because consumers with low per capita consumptive effects often occur at high population densities or perform critical ecological functions and thus may have significant population level impacts that can be harnessed for ecological restoration.

AB Hypersaline intertidal zones are highly dynamic ecosystems that are exposed to multiple extreme environmental conditions including rapidly and frequently changing parameters (water, nutrients, temperature) as well as highly elevated salinity levels often caused by high temperatures and evaporation rates. Microbial mats in most extreme settings, as found at the coastline of the subtropical-arid Arabian Peninsula, have been relatively less studied compared to their counterparts around the world. We report, here, for the first time on the diversity of the bacterial and archaeal communities of marine microbial mats along an intertidal transect in a wide salt flat with strongly increased salinity employing Illumina MiSeq technology for amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Microbial communities were dominated by typical halotolerant to halophilic microorganisms, with clear shifts in community composition, richness, and diversity along the transect. Highly adapted specialists (e.g., Euhalothece, Salinibacter, Nanohaloarchaeota) were mainly found at the most extreme, upper tidal sites and less specialized organisms with wide tolerance ranges (e.g., Lyngbya, Rhodovibrio, Salisaeta, Halobacteria) in intermediate sites of the transect. The dominating taxa in the lower tidal sites were typical members of well-stabilized mats (e.g., Coleofasciculus, Anaerolineaceae, Thaumarchaeota). Up to 40% of the archaeal sequences per sample represented so far unknown phyla. In conclusion, the bacterial richness and diversity increased from upper towards lower tidal sites in line with increasing mat stabilization and functional diversity, opposed to that of cyanobacteria only and archaea, which showed their highest richness and diversity in upper tidal samples.

AB Researchers have long been intrigued by evolutionary processes that explain biological diversity. Numerous studies have reported strong associations between animal body size and altitude, but insect analyses have often yielded equivocal results. Here, we analyze a collection database of New Zealand's diverse endemic stonefly fauna (106 species across 21 genera) to test for relationships between altitude and plecopteran body size. This insect assemblage includes a variety of wing-reduced (26 spp) and fully winged (80 spp) taxa and covers a broad range of altitudes (0-2,000m). We detected significant relationships between altitude and body size for wing-reduced, but not fully winged, stonefly taxa. These results suggest that, while the maintenance of flight apparatus might place a constraint on body size in some fully winged species, the loss of flight may free insects from this evolutionary constraint. We suggest that rapid switches in insect dispersal ability may facilitate rapid evolutionary shifts across a number of biological attributes and may explain the inconsistent results from previous macroecological analyses of insect assemblages.

AB Reintroductions are a common tool for restoring lost biodiversity around the globe and across taxa. The decision to pursue a reintroduction is often based upon the success of past efforts, yet in most cases the assumption that resulting populations are the products of recolonization, is not tested. By collecting data from source populations, reintroduced populations, and natural populations adjacent to reintroductions, it is possible to evaluate the success of past reintroduction events and these data may be used to guide future conservation initiatives. We used the fisher (Pekania pennanti), one of North America's most commonly reintroduced species, as a model to conduct an evaluation of reintroduction success. We genotyped 147 individuals at 15 microsatellite loci to determine the genetic contribution of reintroduced individuals to an ostensibly successfully reintroduced population in central Alberta, Canada. Principle component analysis and Bayesian statistical methods converged with confidence on one result: assayed individuals were descended from adjacent native Albertan populations, not putative founders from eastern Canada. A review of fisher reintroduction literature reveals similar patterns: a large proportion of contemporary individuals appear to be the result of recolonization events. Our study has broad implications for conservation as it may imply a 1) over-confidence in past reintroductions, which might lead to significant expenditure of financial and human capital on future initiatives of modest, if any, benefit, and 2) underestimation of some species' ability to disperse and (re-)colonize, highlighting limits to our understanding of functional connectivity. Obtaining appropriate genetic samples in relation to reintroductions will help determine when future reintroduction is likely to be the best conservation initiative.

AB Exploitation of organisms can prompt the reduction in the number and size of target populations consequently affecting reproductive output and replenishment. Here, we investigated the effects of exploitation on the population structure of a protandrous patellid limpet, Patella aspera, an over exploited Macaronesian endemic. Timed dives were used to collect animals across eleven islands of Macaronesia. Individuals were inspected for sex, size, and gonad stage. Using catch effort (n time per person) per island coastal perimeter as a surrogate for exploitation intensity, we found that limpet abundance (CPUE) and mean size tended to decrease with exploitation intensity. When considering the sex of animals separately, the size of the largest male, but not females, decreased with exploitation. In contrast, the size of the smallest male remained relatively consistent, whereas the size of the smallest female decreased significantly with exploitation. As exploitation is mostly targeting larger individuals, results suggest that males are compensating the removal of larger females, by undergoing sex change at smaller and presumably earlier sizes. These results have wider implications for the conservation of P. aspera, as a reduction in female size will likely affect the numbers of oocytes produced, hence fecundity. Regulations promoting the protection of the larger-sized animals should be enforced to safeguard the replenishment of the population.

AB Microbial outbreaks and related biodeterioration problems have affected the 1300-year-old multicolor (polychrome) mural paintings of the special historic sites Takamatsuzuka Tumulus (TT) and Kitora Tumulus (KT). Those of TT are designated as a national treasure. The microbiomes of these tumuli, both located in Asuka village, Nara, Japan, are critically reviewed as the central subject of this report. Using culture-dependent methods (conventional isolation and cultivation), we conducted polyphasic studies of the these microbial communities and identified the major microbial colonizers (Fusarium spp., Trichoderma spp., Penicillium spp., dark Acremonium spp., novel Candida yeast spp., Bacillus spp., Ochrobactrum spp., Stenotrophomonas tumulicola, and a few actinobacterial genera) and noteworthy microbial members (Kendrickiella phycomyces, Cephalotrichum verrucisporum (equivalent to Doratomyces verrucisporus), Sagenomella striatispora, Sagenomella griseoviridis, two novel Cladophialophora spp., Burgoa anomala, one novel species Prototheca tumulicola, five novel Gluconacetobacter spp., three novel Bordetella spp., and one novel genus and species Krasilnikoviella muralis) involved in the biodeterioration of mural paintings, plaster walls, and stone chamber interiors. In addition, we generated microbial community data from TT and KT samples using culture-independent methods (molecular biological methods, including PCR-DGGE, clone libraries, and pyrosequence analysis). These data are comprehensively presented, in contrast to those derived from culture-dependent methods. Furthermore, the microbial communities detected using both methods are analytically compared, and, as a result, the complementary roles of these methods and approaches are highlighted. In related contexts, knowledge of similar biodeterioration problems affecting other prehistoric cave paintings, mainly at Lascaux in France and Altamira in Spain, are referred to and commented upon. Based on substrate preferences (or ecological grouping) and mapping (plotting detection sites of isolates), we speculate on the possible origins and invasion routes whereby the major microbial colonizers invaded the TT stone chamber interior. Finally, concluding remarks, lessons, and future perspectives based on our microbiological surveys of these ancient tumuli, and similar treasures outside of Japan, are briefly presented. A list of the microbial taxa that have been identified and fully or briefly described by us as known and novel taxa for TT and KT isolates since 2008 is presented in Supplementary Materials.

AB Morphological changes following changes in species' distribution and phenology have been suggested to be the third universal response to global environmental change. Although structural size and body mass result from different genetic, physiological, and ecological mechanisms, they are used interchangeably in studies evaluating population responses to environmental change. Using a 22-year ( 1991-2013) dataset including 1768 individuals, we investigated the coupled dynamics of size and mass in a hibernating mammal, the Alpine marmot ( Marmota marmota), in response to local environmental conditions. We ( i) quantified temporal trends in both traits, ( ii) determined the environmental drivers of trait dynamics, and ( iii) identified the life-history processes underlying the observed changes. Both phenotypic traits were followed through life: we focused on the initial trait value ( juvenile size and mass) and later-life development ( annual change in size [ Delta size] and mass [ Delta mass]). First, we demonstrated contrasting dynamics between size and mass over the study period. Juvenile size and subsequent Dsize showed significant declines, whereas juvenile mass and subsequent Dmass remained constant. As a consequence of smaller size associated with a similar mass, individuals were in better condition in recent years. Second, size and mass showed different sensitivities to environmental variables. Both traits benefited from early access to resources in spring, whereas Dmass, particularly in early life, also responded to summer and winter conditions. Third, the interannual variation in both traits was caused by changes in early life development. Our study supports the importance of considering the differences between size and mass responses to the environment when evaluating the mechanisms underlying population dynamics. The current practice of focusing on only one trait in population modeling can lead to misleading conclusions when evaluating species' resilience to contemporary climate change.

AB Patterned vegetation occurs in many semi-arid regions of the world. Most previous studies have assumed that patterns form from a starting point of uniform vegetation, for example as a response to a decrease in mean annual rainfall. However an alternative possibility is that patterns are generated when bare ground is colonised. This paper investigates the conditions under which colonisation leads to patterning on sloping ground. The slope gradient plays an important role because of the downhill flow of rainwater. One long-established consequence of this is that patterns are organised into stripes running parallel to the contours; such patterns are known as banded vegetation or tiger bush. This paper shows that the slope also has an important effect on colonisation, since the uphill and downhill edges of an isolated vegetation patch have different dynamics. For the much-used Klausmeier model for semi-arid vegetation, the author shows that without a term representing water diffusion, colonisation always generates uniform vegetation rather than a pattern. However the combination of a sufficiently large water diffusion term and a sufficiently low slope gradient does lead to colonisation-induced patterning. The author goes on to consider colonisation in the Rietkerk model, which is also in widespread use: the same conclusions apply for this model provided that a small threshold is imposed on vegetation biomass, below which plant growth is set to zero. Since the two models are quite different mathematically, this suggests that the predictions are a consequence of the basic underlying assumption of water redistribution as the pattern generation mechanism.

AB We estimated the abundance of Antillean manatees (Trichechus manatus manatus) through a large-scale project conducted in 2010 in north-eastern Brazil and evaluated the efficacy of an aerial survey for conservation purposes. Two observers conducted the survey via flights that maintained an altitude of 150 m and an air speed of 140 km h(-1), covering over 2590.2 km(2) of the coastline. Strip transects were flown in a zigzag pattern. A total of 67 manatees (on-and off-effort) were recorded in 55 sightings. Historical published records of occurrence were formally incorporated using a Bayesian approach. We estimated the manatee population for north-eastern Brazil in the form of a posterior distribution with a mean of 1104 individuals and a 95% posterior probability interval ranging from 485 to 2221 individuals, which indicates high uncertainty. More large-scale studies in the region are warranted to understand temporal trends, in addition to further studies in hotspot areas, with smaller spatial scales, to reduce the coefficient of variation and to allow the use of improved techniques for monitoring the manatees. A greater emphasis on species-specific characteristics and methods to enhance detection probability (e.g. dual observers) are also recommended. The conditions prevailing along the study area were not conducive to aerial surveillance; thus, the results are not a precise estimate of the manatee population. However, these highlight the importance of conservation efforts for the Antillean manatee, considered the most endangered aquatic mammal in Brazil.

AB Spatial variation in population densities across a landscape is a feature of many ecological systems, from self-organised patterns on mussel beds to spatially restricted insect outbreaks. It occurs as a result of environmental variation in abiotic factors and/or biotic factors structuring the spatial distribution of populations. However the ways in which abiotic and biotic factors interact to determine the existence and nature of spatial patterns in population density remain poorly understood. Here we present a new approach to studying this question by analysing a predator-prey patch-model in a heterogenous landscape. We use analytical and numerical methods originally developed for studying nearest-neighbour (juxtacrine) signalling in epithelia to explore whether and under which conditions patterns emerge. We find that abiotic and biotic factors interact to promote pattern formation. In fact, we find a rich and highly complex array of coexisting stable patterns, located within an enormous number of unstable patterns. Our simulation results indicate that many of the stable patterns have appreciable basins of attraction, making them significant in applications. We are able to identify mechanisms for these patterns based on the classical ideas of long-range inhibition and short-range activation, whereby landscape heterogeneity can modulate the spatial scales at which these processes operate to structure the populations.

AB This study investigated the effects of fasting and feeding on the fast-start escape swimming performance of juvenile southern catfish Silurus meridionalis, a sit-and-wait forager that encounters extreme fasting and famine frequently during its lifespan. Ten to 30 days of fasting resulted in no significant change in most of the variables measured in the fast-start response except a 20-30% decrease in the escape distance during the first 120 ms (D-120ms) relative to the control group (48 h after feeding). The ratio of the single-bend (SB) response (lower energetic expenditure) to the double-bend (DB) response increased significantly from 0% in the control group to 75 and 825% in the 20 and 30 day fasting groups, respectively. Satiated feeding (25% of body mass) resulted in a significantly lower (366%) maximum linear velocity (V-max) and a significantly lower (433%) D-120ms than in non-fed fish (control group, 48 h after feeding). Half-satiated feeding (125% of body mass), however, showed no significant effects on any of the measured variables of the fast-start response relative to control fish. It is suggested that the increase in the ratio of SB:DB responses with fasting in S. meridionalis may reflect a trade-off between energy conservation and maintaining high V-max, while variables of fast-start performance were more sensitive to feeding than fasting might be an adaptive strategy to their foraging mode and food availability in their habitat.

AB Different ecological preferences among species may result in differences in response to similar environmental variation. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the patterns of skull and mandible size and shape variation in three Sigmodontinae mice from agroecosystems of central Argentina with increasing degree of specialization: Calomys musculinus, Akodon azarae and Oxymycterus rufus. Spatial patterns in size and shape were analysed after controlling for allometry and sexual dimorphism using a total of 697 specimens. We then evaluated the covariation between shape, climatic and environmental variables and assessed the contribution of distinct climatic and environmental variables to phenotypic variability. Oxymycterus rufus displayed a marked spatial structure, and there was a high correlation between shape, climatic and environmental variables in this species. Climatic and environmental variables had a moderate effect on the phenotype of A. azarae, and were not correlated with morphological variation in C. musculinus. Our study highlights the difference in phenotypic responses to spatial and environmental gradients across coexisting species, specialist species displaying a more marked spatial structure in morphology than generalist species.

AB Temporary wetlands dominate the wet season landscape of temperate, semi-arid and arid regions, yet, other than their direct loss to development and agriculture, little information exists on how remaining wetlands have been altered by anthropogenic conversion of surrounding landscapes. This study investigates relationships between the extent and type of habitat transformation around temporary wetlands and their water column physico-chemical characteristics. A set of 90 isolated depression wetlands (seasonally inundated) occurring on coastal plains of the south-western Cape mediterranean-climate region of South Africa was sampled during the winter/spring wet season of 2007. Wetlands were sampled across habitat transformation gradients according to the areal cover of agriculture, urban development and alien invasive vegetation within 100 and 500 m radii of each wetland edge. We hypothesized that the principal drivers of physico-chemical conditions in these wetlands (e.g. soil properties, basin morphology) are altered by habitat transformation. Multivariate multiple regression analyses (distance-based Redundancy Analysis) indicated significant associations between wetland physico-chemistry and habitat transformation (overall transformation within 100 and 500 m, alien vegetation cover within 100 and 500 m, urban cover within 100 m); although for significant regressions the amount of variation explained was very low (range: similar to 2 to similar to 5.5%), relative to that explained by purely spatio-temporal factors (range: similar to 35.5 to similar to 43%). The nature of the relationships between each type of transformation in the landscape and individual physico-chemical variables in wetlands were further explored with univariate multiple regressions. Results suggest that conservation of relatively narrow (similar to 100 m) buffer strips around temporary wetlands is likely to be effective in the maintenance of natural conditions in terms of physico-chemical water quality.

AB In this study, we address the question of the provenance and origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls manuscripts. A characteristic low ratio of chlorine to bromine, corresponding to that of the Dead Sea water, may serve as an indicator for local production. For this aim we developed a non-destructive procedure to determine the Cl/Br ratio in the parchment of these manuscripts. Micro-X-ray fluorescence (mu-XRF) measurements of a large number of parchment and leather fragments from the Dead Sea Scrolls were analyzed with a routine we developed based on fundamental parameter quantification. This routine takes into account the absorption of the collagen matrix and the influence of the different sample thicknesses. To calculate the representative Cl/Br ratio for each fragment, we investigated the lateral homogeneity and determined the total mass deposition using the intensity of the inelastically scattered, characteristic tube radiation. The distribution of the Cl/Br ratios thus obtained from the mu-XRF measurements make it possible to distinguish fragments whose origin lies within the Dead Sea region from those produced in other locations.

AB Here we describe the genome of Mesotoga prima MesG1.Ag4.2, the first genome of a mesophilic Thermotogales bacterium. Mesotoga prima was isolated from a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-dechlorinating enrichment culture from Baltimore Harbor sediments. Its 2.97 Mb genome is considerably larger than any previously sequenced Thermotogales genomes, which range between 1.86 and 2.30Mb. This larger size is due to both higher numbers of protein-coding genes and larger intergenic regions. In particular, the M. prima genome contains more genes for proteins involved in regulatory functions, for instance those involved in regulation of transcription. Together with its closest relative, Kosmotoga olearia, it also encodes different types of proteins involved in environmental and cell-cell interactions as compared with other Thermotogales bacteria. Amino acid composition analysis of M. prima proteins implies that this lineage has inhabited low-temperature environments for a long time. A large fraction of the M. prima genome has been acquired by lateral gene transfer (LGT): a DarkHorse analysis suggests that 766 (32%) of predicted protein-coding genes have been involved in LGT after Mesotoga diverged from the other Thermotogales lineages. A notable example of a lineage-specific LGT event is a reductive dehalogenase gene-a key enzyme in dehalorespiration, indicating M. prima may have a more active role in PCB dechlorination than was previously assumed.

AB Broadcast spawners are exceptionally suited and simple models for studying parental investment in offspring, because direct post-spawning investment is nonexistent. However, a comprehensive understanding of the large variation that exists in their egg sizes is still lacking. One of the main hypotheses states that variation in fertilization conditions underlies some of the egg size variation, as larger eggs are larger targets for sperm. Here, we test the hypothesis that egg size may be locally tuned to expected ambient sperm concentrations during fertilization. In accordance with the hypothesis, we find that in the bivalve Macoma balthica (L) adult density as a proxy for sperm concentration correlates strongly (correlation coefficient -0.87) with egg size in the field. Optimisation modeling confirms the negative relationship between optimal egg size and sperm concentration for M. balthica and this is independent of the fertilization model used. Discrepancies between models and observations remaining include larger egg sizes overall and a concave predicted relationship that is not obvious in the data. The results suggest that in M. balthica sperm limitation may play a role in fertilization success and in shaping egg size variation, and that locations with high population densities may make disproportionately large contributions to the next generation.

AB A class of prey-predator models with infected prey is investigated. Predation terms are either of Holling type II or III, infection is either modelled by mass action or standard incidence. It is shown that the key for understanding the model behaviour is the competition of predators versus infection. In the presented models the predator is not susceptible to the infection and the infection of the prey has no influence on the ability of the predator of catching the prey. However, the prey population can be seen as a resource which both the predators and the infection depend on. The competition for this resource is strong the principle of competitive exclusion holds for biologically meaningful choices of parameters as long as there is no destabilisation by a Hopf bifurcation. The representation of models in competition diagrams which are introduced in this article can be used for a wide range of competition models which seems to be a promising method with many potential applications.

AB Combating invasive species requires a detailed, mechanistic understanding of the manner and speed with which organisms expand their ranges. Biological control efforts provide an opportunity to study the process of species invasions and range expansions under known initial conditions. This study examines the rate, pattern and mechanisms of spread for two populations of the biological control agent Pseudacteon tricuspis, phorid-fly parasitoids of imported fire ants. We employ a trap-based survey method that detects phorid flies in low-density populations, and provides data on abundance. This technique allows us to differentiate between continuous population spread and effective long-distance dispersal and to examine density gradients of phorid flies across the expanding population front. We find that occupied sites in front of the leading edge of continuous populations were common; forming small populations we refer to as satellite populations. Satellite populations are tens of kilometers from the nearest possible source. Wind governs the dynamics of spread in these two central Texas populations. Population edges expanding with the wind exhibited a higher frequency of effective long-distance dispersal than did populations expanding into the wind. This enhanced effective long-distance dispersal rate translated into a five times faster rate of spread for population edges traveling with the wind. This planned invasion shares many characteristics in common with unplanned species invasions including: protracted establishment phase during which densities were below detection thresholds, and slow initial spread immediately after establishment followed by rapid, accelerating spread rates as population sizes grew.

AB Zones of secondary contact between closely related species provide a rare opportunity to examine evidence of evolutionary processes that reinforce species boundaries and/or promote diversification. Here, we report on genetic and morphological variation in two sister species of woodrats, Neotoma fuscipes and N. macrotis, across a 30-km transition zone in the Sierra Nevada of California. We assessed whether these lineages readily hybridize, and whether their morphology suggests ecological interactions favoring phenotypic diversification. We combined measurements of body size and 11 craniodental traits from nine populations with genetic data to examine patterns of variation within and between species. We used phylogenetic autocorrelation methods to estimate the degree to which phenotypic variation in our dataset arose from independent evolution within populations versus phylogenetic history. Although no current sympatry or hybridization was evident, craniodental morphology diverged in both lineages near their distributional limits, whereas body size converged. The shift in craniodental morphology arose independently within populations whereas body size retained a strong phylogenetic signal, yet both patterns are consistent with expectations of phenotypic change based on different models of resource competition. Our findings demonstrate the importance of examining a suite of morphological traits across contact zones to provide a more complete picture of potential ecological interactions: competition may drive both diversification and convergence in different phenotypic traits.

AB Discrimination among differentially rewarding flowers allows honeybees to maximize their foraging efficiency. We studied how honeybees are able to relate to differential positive rewards when the odor representations are either structurally dissimilar, structurally similar ( or form a substrate-product duo in planta), or form a binary mixture sharing a common constituent. Bees were tested both in conditioning of the proboscis-extension response ( PER) and in a free-flying context. Our results point to honeybees using olfactory associative learning to differentiate between two positively rewarded odors. In PER, subjects discriminated best between dissimilar odors; they initially generalized between similar odors, but eventually learned to discriminate between them. The discrimination between mixtures sharing a common constituent remained poor. Likewise, the difference in visits to low- and high-rewarding flowers of free-flying bees was greater for dissimilar odors than for binary mixtures sharing a common constituent. Consequences of the operant conditioning nature of the free-flying context are discussed.

AB Many of today's grazing ecosystem management problems require a predictive understanding of the interactions between ecological processes acting across different spatiotemporal scales with complex soil, vegetation, climate, topographic and geologic characteristics. Due to complexity of ecosystems and the incomplete nature of empirical data for specific relationships involved in ecosystem dynamics, resource managers usually select management strategies without complete information or knowledge. Such vagueness in real world situations is also an obstacle to understanding and modeling ecosystem dynamics by means of conventional mathematical and computer simulation techniques. Modeling, simulating, and analyzing actual ecosystems can be significantly improved if modeling is extended to deal with imprecise and vague variables, relationships, and events. In this paper, a simulation model combining fuzzy imprecision with probabilistic uncertainty is formulated to study climate-plant-herbivore interactions in,grassland ecosystems. This approach provides a unifying simulation framework to integrate numerical data, linguistic statements, and expert experience. The model includes treatment of imprecise and vague input variables as fuzzy variables, use of fuzzy arithmetic in equations when fuzzy and probability numbers are involved, and replacement of some of the relationships in the dynamic systems either with fuzzy conditional statements, or with fuzzy algorithms. The temporal patterns of herbivore population and primary production for a laissez-faire, extensive system in both Australia and China are modeled. The consistency of results obtained from the two simulations suggests the underlying mechanisms for semi-arid grassland ecosystems are those included in the model. Models combining fuzzy sets to quantify subjective parameters and traditional mechanistic techniques can be used to form a basis of long-term managerial policies for a sustainable grassland ecosystem.

AB A model of an animal cohort foraging on logistically growing food is analyzed. The problem is captured in three differential equations, one for food density and two for the state of the animal cohort, keeping track of body weight and number of individuals, respectively. When the animals efficiently exploit their food to low densities, the model produces cycles. The cycles differ markedly from those produced by traditional predator-prey models. Consumer decline is associated with starvation mortality when individuals lose too much weight. This condition causes a stepwise decline in individual number, each step corresponding to one cycle. Because the survivors of each starvation period grow and because larger animals have lower weight-specific metabolic rates, the nature of the cycles changes over time. They acquire a slow-fast character because of the increasing difference between food and consumer speed and show distinct catastrophic features, as the fast phases are caused by jumping between an over- and underexploited state of the food population, The cycles may either continue toward extinction of the cohort or damp out in a stable state characterized by stunted individual growth. Data from fish communities are closely in line with the specific predictions from this generic model about patterns of die-off and stunted growth. The model behavior is robust. It does not depend on the type of functional response or the way in which mortality increases with individual loss. Furthermore, the same patterns are obtained from an elaborate, realistic individual-based model, which indicates that the results are not artifacts of simplifications like considering all individuals equal and assuming only one food source.

TI DECISION-MAKING OF A SIT-AND-WAIT FORAGER IN AN UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT -
   LEARNING AND MEMORY LOAD
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST

   EVOLUTION; TIME; INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; PREY; PREFERENCES; STARLINGS
AB I present patch exploitation models of a sit-and-wait forager in a stochastic environment and incorporate the learning process across a series of foraging trials. Environmental uncertainty implies that patch state (number of prey in the patch) changes at every visit to the patch according to a first-order Markov chain and that prey move around three places within a patch with a continuous-time and discrete-state Markov process. Since patch state is uncertain for the forager, it can be supposed that the forager adopts a giving-up time that is determined when entering a patch. The forager may have several experiences in one foraging trial: finding no prey or some prey without attack, or attacking a prey. I assume the forager uses the experience of the previous visits at a patch to reduce uncertainty about patch state. By learning, the uncertainty among patches is reduced during the series of foraging trials. I further assume that memory capacity is limited. Information acquired from only a finite number of patches can be stored in the memory of the forager. When the memory capacity is small, the memory load is not serious, but resource depression among the patches may overcome the effect of learning. On the other hand, when the memory capacity is large, the forager has many alternatives, and learning effects may overcome the resource depression of some patches. However, the forager may sometimes be impeded by a memory load. I conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to survey how memory capacity affects foraging efficiency in the stochastic environment. I assumed that the forager chooses the most profitable patch among the patches that it uses in one series of foraging trials. The forager obtained a high reward rate when it used many patches with learning. However, the reward rate did not increase monotonically with increase of memory capacity. Learning is effective in an environment with low prey density compared to an environment with high prey density. Further, learning is more effective in conservative environments in which the forager gets information on prey existence during the foraging process. Memory load must be taken into account when considering how many patches the forager should use in a stochastic environment.

AB The cyclopoid copepod Apocyclops royi produced six nauplius, five copepodite instars, and an adult stage when reared in a laboratory under 25-degrees-C, 300-degrees/oo salinity, and with excess food resources. The durations of all nauplius were short and nearly isochronal beyond the copepodid I stage. Generation length was sixteen days. Regression equations for prosome length (P.L.) and body length (B.L.) vs. dry weight (D.W.), plus ash free dry weight (AFDW) were expressed as follows: a). Nauplii: ln (D.W.) = 1.0128 ln (B.L.) - 2.633 (R2 = 0.768) ln (AFDW) = 1.1771 ln (B.L.) - 3.120 (R2 = 0.756) b). Copepodites and Adults: ln (D.W.) = 1.5289 ln (P.L.) - 3.876 (R2 = 0.964) ln (AFDW) = 0.9255 ln (P.L.) - 2.445 (R2 = 0.891) ln (D.W.) = 1.2924 ln (B.L.) - 3.504 (R2 = 0.978) ln (AFDW) = 0.7821 ln (B.L.) - 2.220 (R2 = 0.903)
   The mean ash content of this species was 2.47%, and the mean energy content of later copepodite stages was 5.13 cal/mg D.W. or 5.33 cal/mg AFDW.

AB 1. We compared the standard operative temperatures (T(es)) of two nocturnal desert rodents, Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum, in summer and winter in the Negev Desert, Israel. We found that T(es) was below the lower thermal critical temperature in both summer and winter.
   2. We found significant differences in T(es) among microhabitats. There was no significant effect of orientation on T(es).
   3. Unlike other studies of small ground-dwelling endotherms, we found that T(es) most closely tracked T(a).
   4. The larger of the two species, G. pyramidum, had a higher T(es) under all conditions, which is related to its lower surface area:volume ratio.
   5. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of low ambient temperatures to the thermal physiology of nocturnal desert rodents.

AB Macroecological rules have been developed for plants and animals that describe large-scale distributional patterns and attempt to explain the underlying physiological and ecological processes behind them. Similarly, microorganisms exhibit patterns in relative abundance, distribution, diversity, and traits across space and time, yet it remains unclear the extent to which microorganisms follow macroecological rules initially developed for macroorganisms. Additionally, the usefulness of these rules as a null hypothesis when surveying microorganisms has yet to be fully evaluated. With rapid advancements in sequencing technology, we have seen a recent increase in microbial studies that utilize macroecological frameworks. Here, we review and synthesize these macroecological microbial studies with two main objectives: (1) to determine to what extent macroecological rules explain the distribution of host-associated and free-living microorganisms, and (2) to understand which environmental factors and stochastic processes may explain these patterns among microbial clades (archaea, bacteria, fungi, and protists) and habitats (host-associated and free living; terrestrial and aquatic). Overall, 78% of microbial macroecology studies focused on free living, aquatic organisms. In addition, most studies examined macroecological rules at the community level with only 35% of studies surveying organismal patterns across space. At the community level microorganisms often tracked patterns of macroorganisms for island biogeography (74% confirm) but rarely followed Latitudinal Diversity Gradients (LDGs) of macroorganisms (only 32% confirm). However, when microorganisms and macroorganisms shared the same macroecological patterns, underlying environmental drivers (e.g., temperature) were the same. Because we found a lack of studies for many microbial groups and habitats, we conclude our review by outlining several outstanding questions and creating recommendations for future studies in microbial ecology.

AB Aim Understanding how ecological communities are assembled remains a grand challenge in ecology with direct implications for charting the future of biodiversity. Trait-based methods have emerged as the leading approach for quantifying functional community structure (convergence, divergence) but their potential for inferring assembly processes rests on accurately measuring functional dissimilarity among community members. Here, we argue that trait resolution (from finest-resolution continuous measurements to coarsest-resolution binary categories) remains a critically overlooked methodological variable, even though categorical classification is known to mask functional variability and inflate functional redundancy among species or individuals.
   Innovation We present the first detailed predictions of trait resolution biases and demonstrate, with simulations, how the distortion of signal strength by increasingly coarse-resolution traits can fundamentally alter functional structure patterns and the interpretation of causative ecological processes (e.g. abiotic filters, biotic interactions). We show that coarser trait data impart different impacts on the signals of divergence and convergence, implying that the role of biotic interactions may be underestimated when using coarser traits. Furthermore, in some systems, coarser traits may overestimate the strength of trait convergence, leading to erroneous support for abiotic processes as the primary drivers of community assembly or change.
   Main conclusions Inferences of assembly processes must account for trait resolution to ensure robust conclusions, especially for broad-scale studies of comparative community assembly and biodiversity change. Despite recent improvements in the collection and availability of trait data, great disparities continue to exist among taxa in the number and availability of continuous traits, which are more difficult to acquire for large numbers of species than coarse categorical assignments. Based on our simulations, we urge the consideration of trait resolution in the design and interpretation of community assembly studies and suggest a suite of practical solutions to address the pitfalls of trait resolution biases.

AB In restoration ecology, the transition from desired to degraded state is based solely on the composition of the aboveground plant community, whereas belowground propagules are often neglected. We developed a conceptual framework integrating seed bank dynamics into alternative stable state theory, highlighting the important relationship between aboveground and belowground composition. This integration emphasizes the role of resilience in systems that appear to have shifted to an "undesirable" state. Belowground propagules, especially soil seed and bud banks, provide buffering capacity and may serve as valuable indicators of potential resistance to state transition based on the degree of similarity between belowground and aboveground vegetation composition. Ecosystem states may have multiple components that differ in their rate of change, as well as in their capacity to promote resilience. We recommend that the application of alternative stable state theory from a management perspective should incorporate components of both above- and belowground vegetation.

The integration of landscape ecology and spatial development planning can help overcome the complex problems of managing landscapes and natural resources and increase the chances of reaching sustainable spatial development. Objectives The main goal of this research is to provide insight into the development of landscape ecology from the spatial planning perspective. Methods A chronological systematization and categorization were made of relevant papers, authors and events that are important for an understanding of the discipline's development. An analysis of their content and interrelationships in the integral chronological overview enabled the identification of landscape ecology's developmental periods. Results Research resulted in the elaboration of an integral chronological overview of the scholarly and professional communities' key activities and achievements, making it possible to monitor the development of theory, key developmental concepts and their corresponding methodological procedures, methods and techniques. The overview enabled the identification of (a) types of "arenas" for professional dialogue, (b) key authors and works, (c) relationships among components within the same, but also between different, categories of components of the chronological overview, and on the basis of all this (d) the establishment of developmental periods. Five developmental periods of the discipline have been established: (1) Landscape Ecology Foundation Period 1939-1979, (2) Landscape Ecology Establishment Period 1980-1987, (3) Landscape Ecology Solidification Period 1988-1991, (4) Period of Retrospection and New Articulation 1992-2005, and (5) Period of Stable Development 2006- present. Conclusions Research indicated continued development of the theoretical-methodological framework of landscape ecology and its links with spatial planning through the constant reexamination of existing perspectives and the establishment of new ones. The numerous conceptual frameworks selected in the paper unequivocally illustrate a strong conditionality between landscape ecology and spatial planning. However, the systematization of written sources revealed that few papers present a review or perspectives with regard to the link with spatial planning, which is why this research has become an important basis for future research in a form of a curriculum for initial research on the relationship between landscape ecology and spatial planning.

AB Aim Biomes, biogeographical realms and ecoregions have become central concepts of biotic organization and biodiversity research. Recent data-intensive analysis has shown that, while ecoregions do delineate biotic communities, how distinct they are from one another varies considerably across regions and taxa. Given their central importance to global models of the earth system and to the development of conservation plans, it is key to understand in what regions, and for which taxa, ecoregion classification schemes best describe the underlying variability in biological communities.
   Location Global.
   Taxa Plants, animals, fungi.
   Methods In this paper, we integrate ecoregion maps with data on spatially continuous changes in environmental conditions, biodiversity and species traits to quantify the descriptive power of ecoregions around the globe. Capitalizing on the troves of newly available global biodiversity data, we model the abiotic and biotic factors that describe how distinct ecoregions are from one another.
   Results From an abiotic perspective, we report compelling evidence that, first, ecoregions are more distinct in tropical zones with higher temperatures, less temperature seasonality and greater rainfall seasonality. Second, we also find that ecoregions are more distinct in regions with steeper slopes. From a biotic perspective, we find that ecoregions tend to be more distinct for reptiles and amphibians than they are for mammals or birds. Likewise, ecoregions tend to be more distinct for smaller-bodied species and, to a lesser extent, species at lower trophic levels.
   Main conclusions While ecoregion-based conservation planning can provide a crucial tool for developing holistic conservation interventions, we show here that the ability to capture and describe communities is not uniform across regions or taxa. In particular, ecoregions tend to best describe communities of small-bodied species, less vagile and tropical taxa that are typically underrepresented in the scientific literature. While ecoregion classification schemes will continue to provide invaluable conservation guidance, we must think critically about when an ecoregional approach is best suited to informing management.

AB In this study, mutant CotA-laccase SF was successfully expressed in Escherichia colt by co-expression with phospholipase C. The optimized extracellular expression of CotA-laccase SF was 1257.22 U/L. Extracellularly expressed CotA-laccase SF exhibits enzymatic properties similar to intracellular CotA-laccase SF. CotA-laccase SF could decolorize malachite green (MG) under neutral and alkaline conditions. The K-m and k(cat) values of CotAlaccase SF to MG were 39.6 mM and 18.36 s(-1). LC-MS analysis of degradation products showed that MG was finally transformed into 4-aminobenzophenone and 4-aminophenol by CotA-laccase. The toxicity experiment of garlic root tip cell showed that the toxicity of MG metabolites decreased. In summary, CotA-laccase SF had a good application prospect for degrading malachite green.

AB Cyanobacteria are notorious for producing water blooms and for toxin formation. Toxic cyanobacterial blooms present an ever-increasing serious threat to both the quality of drinking water and recreational uses and severely disrupt aquatic ecosystems, worldwide. In many cases, such blooms are dominated by toxic Microcystis sp. that produce a family of structurally similar hepatotoxins, known as microcystins (MCs). Here we present a retrospective analysis of Microcystis seasonal blooms from Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel) indicating that the population is composed of at least 25 different genotypes and two different chemo-types, whose relative abundance changes over decades. Based on a long-term record of biotic and abiotic parameters and laboratory experiments we propose that minor increase in water temperature, but not in salinity, may affect Microcystis community structure by changing the relative abundance of species/strains from toxic to less or non-toxic species.

AB Numerical analysis of spatial pattern is widely used in ecology to describe the characteristics of floral and faunal distributions. These methods allow attribution of pattern to causal mechanisms by uncovering the specific signatures of patterns and causal agents. For example, grassland-gap patterns called fairy circles (FCs) in Namibia and Australia are characterized by highly regular and homogenous distributions across landscapes that show spatially periodic ordering. These FCs have been suggested to be caused by both social insects and competitive plant interactions. We compared eight Namibian and Australian FC patterns and also modeled FCs to 16 patterns of social insect nests in Africa, Australia, and America that include the most regular termite mound patterns known. For pattern-process inference, we used spatial statistics based on both nearest-neighbor analysis and neighborhood-density functions. None of the analyzed insect-nest distributions attain the spatially periodic ordering that is typical of FCs. The inherently more variable patterns of termite and ant nests are commonly attributable to well documented aspects of the faunal life-history. Our quantitative evidence from drylands shows that the more variable insect-nest distributions in water-limited environments cannot explain the characteristic spatial signature of FCs. The analysis demonstrates the interpretation of scale-dependent neighborhood-density functions and that it is the identification of unique spatial signatures in regular patterns that need to be linked to process. While our results cannot verify a specific hypothesis, they support the hypothesis that FCs in these drylands are more likely an emergent vegetation pattern caused by strong plant competition for water.

AB Aim Isolation is a key factor in island biology. It is usually defined as the distance to the geographically nearest mainland, but many other definitions exist. We explored how testing different isolation indices affects the inference of impacts of isolation on faunal characteristics. We focused on land bridge islands and compared the relationships of many spatial and temporal (i.e., through time) isolation indices with community-, population- and individual-level characteristics (species richness, population density and body size, respectively). Location Aegean Sea islands, Greece. Time period Current. Taxon Many animal taxa. Methods We estimated 21 isolation indices for 205 islands and recorded species richness data for 15 taxa (invertebrates and vertebrates). We obtained body size data for seven lizard species and population density data for three. We explored how well indices predict each characteristic, in each taxon, by conducting a series of ordinary least squares regressions (controlling for island area when needed) and a meta-analysis. Results Isolation was significantly (and negatively) associated with species richness in 10 of 15 taxa. It was significantly (and positively) associated with body size in only one of seven species and was not associated with population density. The effect of isolation on species richness was much weaker than that of island area, regardless of the index tested. Spatial indices generally out-performed temporal indices, and indices directly related to the mainland out-performed those related mainly to neighbouring islands. No index was universally superior to others, including the distance to the geographically nearest mainland. Main conclusions The choice of index can alter our perception of the impacts of isolation on biological patterns. The nearly automatic, ubiquitous use of distance to the geographically nearest mainland misrepresents the complexity of the effects of isolation. We recommend the simultaneous testing of several indices that represent different aspects of isolation, in order to produce more constructive and thorough investigations and avoid imprecise inference.

AB Plant-plant interactions are important drivers of ecosystem structure and function, yet predicting interaction outcomes across environmental gradients remains challenging. Understanding how interactions are affected by ontogenetic shifts in plant characteristics can provide insight into the drivers of interactions and improve our ability to anticipate ecosystem responses to environmental change. We developed a conceptual framework of nurse shrub facilitation of tree establishment. We used a combination of field experiments and environmental measurements to test the framework with a shrub (Artemisia tridentata) and a tree (Pinus monophylla), two foundation species in a semiarid environment. Shrub microsites allowed trees to overcome an early population bottleneck and successfully establish in areas without tree cover. Shrubs facilitated trees at multiple ontogenetic stages, but the net outcome of the interaction shifted from strongly positive to neutral after the transition of P. monophylla from juvenile to adult foliage. Microhabitat conditions varied across a broad elevational gradient, but interaction outcomes were not strongly related to elevation. Favorable microsites provided by A. tridentata cover are crucial for P. monophylla recovery after stand-replacing disturbance. Models of vegetation response to rapid global environmental change should incorporate the critically important role of nurse shrub interactions for ameliorating population bottlenecks in tree establishment.

AB Questions Positive and negative associations among species influence the structure of plant communities. Yet how these plant associations are assembled at the community level is poorly understood. We propose a new approach that combines spatial ecology, network theory and trait-based ecology to examine the assembly of plant-plant associations at the community level. Location Gemmipass, Swiss Alps. Methods We fully mapped an alpine plant community at the individual plant level, recording both plant coordinates and functional traits for each individual. We identified non-random species associations using spatial point-pattern analysis and partialled out the effect of abiotic heterogeneity. We then analysed the plant network structure and used plant traits to predict species associations. Results We identified 36 significant spatial associations between plant species, 34 positive and two negatives. Dominant, stress-tolerant species such as Dryas octopetala, Linaria alpina and Leontodon montanus were highly connected in the network, whereas rare, water- and nutrient-demanding species such as Saxifraga aizoides, Galium anisophyllon and Thymus praecox were less connected compared to random expectation. The plant network was clustered, meaning that species were overall more connected among each other than expected by chance. Conclusions Positive associations among species characterized the studied plant community. Besides the primary effect of associations of the "foundation" species D. octopetala with other species, these "subordinate" plants were also associated with each other. Our study reveals the assembly of plant communities as driven by positive associations among stress-tolerant pioneer species, highlighting their role in supporting the cohesiveness of alpine plant communities.

AB Ecosystems are highly nonlinear dissipative systems that often admit multiple alternative stable states, but seldom have the time span to converge to these states as they are repeatedly interfered by environmental changes and disturbances. Multiplicity of stable states in variable and disturbed environments is of high concern because of the possible occurrence of regime shifts, i.e. state transitions that involve large, abrupt decline in ecosystem function. State transitions induced by disturbances, however, need not be abrupt as the disturbances are often limited in their spatial extent. In that case they induce local state transitions that result in spatially confined alternative-state domains. The subsequent dynamics crucially depend on the dynamics of the transition zones or fronts that bound these domains. In this paper we study three aspects of front dynamics that affect the nature of regime shifts and their outcomes: single-front motion, front interactions and front instabilities. Using models of dryland vegetation as a case study we show that fronts can change their speed and invert their direction of motion as parameters change across a threshold value the Maxwell point, that fronts may slow down or stop entirely when interacting with other fronts, and that disturbances may change one front type to another, each with its distinct speed. We further study the implications of these three aspects of front dynamics to gradual regime shifts. We show that such shifts can occur due to the propagation of a perturbation beyond its original extent, that such a transition does not necessarily culminate in the alternative state, i.e. it may remain incomplete, and that the time it takes for a regime shift to occur can be changed by front manipulations. Since gradual regime shifts can take place far from the typical tipping point considered, early warning signals of an approaching tipping point would fail in predicting gradual regime shifts. A more relevant approach for these regime shifts may be the development of detection and prevention methods, which can be applied during an ongoing gradual regime shift due to its slow dynamics. We conclude with a discussion of the need to develop such methods and of other ecological contexts that may benefit from them.

AB Coral reefs are predicted to be vulnerable to the Allee effect due to the density dependence of broadcast spawning fertilisation success. Verifying such effects in corals, however, is hindered by their annual or biannual nocturnal multispecific synchronous spawning events, the lack of colony spatial distribution data, and the difficulty of manipulating coral colony density in the field. These obstacles were overcome by simulating scleractinian coral spawning events at various distances between colonies. While controlling for density, and including the influence of colony size and current flow speed, we investigated the distance at which reproductive contact became unlikely (critical intercolonial distance). The relationship between fertilisation success and colony density was also examined by simulating broadcast spawning events at different densities, with the aim of investigating whether Allee effects can occur at population densities observed in the literature. Fertilisation events rarely occurred between simulated coral colonies that were more than 30-40 m apart in the conditions tested due to sperm dilution and insufficient mixing between gametes from different colonies. Higher flow speeds improved mixing for distant colonies but generally resulted in low fertilisation success; larger colonies reduced the impact of dilution due to increased reproductive output. Fertilisation success exhibited a logarithmic relationship as colony density increased (e.g. 99.0% at 3.36 x 10(-2) colonies m(-2) for colonies with 1 m(2) surface area), with low fertilisation success (21.0% at 2.70 x 10(-3) colonies m(-2) for 1 m(2) colonies) at densities comparable to post-disturbance populations. These findings suggest the potential for strong component Allee effects due to broadcast spawning. Our critical intercolonial distance results support existing evidence that coral populations within a reef may consist of multiple breeding groups instead of a single homogeneous one. The inclusion of spatial data when surveying for coral colony density should be considered when attempting to predict density dependent effects.

AB Dispersal is a critical factor determining the spatial scale of speciation, which is constrained by the ecological characteristics and distribution of a species' habitat and the intrinsic traits of species. Endogean taxa are strongly affected by the unique qualities of the below-ground environment and its effect on dispersal, and contrasting reports indicate either high dispersal capabilities favoured by small body size and mediated by passive mechanisms, or low dispersal due to restricted movement and confinement inside the soil. We studied a species-rich endogean ground beetle lineage, Typhlocharina, including three genera and more than 60 species, as a model for the evolutionary biology of dispersal and speciation in the deep soil. A time-calibrated molecular phylogeny generated from > 400 individuals was used to delimit candidate species, to study the accumulation of lineages through space and time by species-area-age relationships and to determine the geographical structure of the diversification using the relationship between phylogenetic and geographic distances across the phylogeny. Our results indicated a small spatial scale of speciation in Typhlocharina and low dispersal capacity combined with sporadic long distance, presumably passive dispersal events that fuelled the speciation process. Analysis of lineage growth within Typhlocharina revealed a richness plateau correlated with the range of distribution of lineages, suggesting a long-term species richness equilibrium mediated by density dependence through limits of habitat availability. The interplay of area-and age-dependent processes ruling the lineage diversification in Typhlocharina may serve as a general model for the evolution of high species diversity in endogean mesofauna.

AB Millions of generally regularly spaced, roughly circular barren patches called fairy circles occur in a narrow band ca 100 km inland of the south-west African coast. These generally have conspicuously taller peripheral grasses in a shorter grass matrix. The origins of these fairy circles are controversial, but one possibility is that they are self-organizing emergent vegetation patterns that are the consequence of interplay between positive (facilitative) and negative (competitive) interactions between grasses. We hypothesized that the coarse textured sand on which fairy circles occur creates a hydraulically and nutritionally connected landscape, in which neighbouring fairy circles competitively influence each other over several metres, while providing opportunity for focusing of resources around the peripheral grasses. To test our hypotheses we conducted three main groups of analyses: 1) we measured grass biomass to assess facilitative and competitive effects of the component grasses; 2) across a region with fairy circles we measured the size and density of fairy circles and correlated that with water infiltration rates into soil; 3) we measured the capacity of soil to conduct water pulses and N-15 tracers. We found evidence of facilitative interactions in the periphery of the fairy circles and competitive suppression of the matrix grass proximal to the periphery. Across the region, fairy circle size was positively correlated with soil infiltration rates and negatively with precipitation. This suggests that fairy circles emerge in soils with high capacity for water flux that enables landscape hydraulic connectivity. Water- and N-15-pulse experiments showed that edaphic resources were highly mobile, moving up to 7.5 m over a period of 1-3 weeks. We concluded that the evidence is consistent with an emergent vegetation pattern explanation for the origins of fairy circles and that the circles are more closely associated with a highly connective edaphic environment, rather than with particular biota.

AB Sexual dimorphism is common across the animal kingdom, but the contribution of environmental factors shaping differences between the sexes remains controversial. In ectotherms, life-history traits are known to correlate with latitude, but sex-specific responses are not well understood. We analyzed life-history trait variation between the sexes of European perch (Perca fluviatilis L.), a common freshwater fish displaying larger female size, by employing a wide latitudinal gradient. We expected to find sex-dependent latitudinal variation in life-history variables: length at age, length increment, and size at maturity, with females showing consistently higher values than males at all latitudes. We further anticipated that this gender difference would progressively decrease with the increasingly harsh environmental conditions toward higher latitude. We hypothesized that growth and length increment would decrease and size/age at maturity would increase at higher latitudes. Our results confirmed female-biased sexual size dimorphism at all latitudes and the magnitude of sexual dimorphism diminished with increase in latitude. Growth of both sexes decreased with increase in latitude, and the female latitudinal clines were steeper than those of males. Hence, we challenge two predominant ecological rules (Rensch's and Bergmann's rules) that describe common large-scale patterns of body size variation. Our data demonstrate that these two rules are not universally applicable in ectotherms or female-biased species. Our study highlights the importance of sex-specific differences in life-history traits along a latitudinal gradient, with evident implications for a wide range of studies from individual to ecosystems level.

AB Within southern Africa's savanna ecosystems, woody and herbaceous species have differing growth characteristics that allow a tenuous co-existance. The high dependence of humans on the landscape, through agricultural production, tourism, and natural resource extraction makes understanding savanna vegetation dynamics essential. Studies analyzing resilience of savannas suggest potential state changes in vegetation structure from continuous grasslands with sporadic woody cover to less biologically productive landscapes. One of the biggest questions in this landscape is the impact of climate change. The spatially explicit SAVANNA model is used to analyze the impact of climate change on vegetation cover across Kruger National Park's (KNP) main land system classifications (Satara, Skukuza, Letaba, and Phalaborwa). Manipulating climate inputs and management regimes allowed us to analyze the resilience of savanna vegetation under multiple Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios. Trends in future climate indicate an increase in temperatures greater than 1.0 degrees Celsius and a slight decrease in precipitation by 2080. Model results indicate a long-term decrease in multiple size classes of vegetation across all the four land systems. However, the model runs show differing response to climate change between the woody and herbaceous cover types. Spatial trends across the park follow closely with the north-south climate gradient. The most spatially distinct land system was Skukuza, which exhibited some of the highest initial net primary production (NPP) values and also the greatest decreases in NPP into the future. While this region is projected to lose large proportions of its herbaceous and shrub vegetation it is projected to increase in tree green leaf, mostly related to increasing fine leaf vegetation (Acacia sp.). The northern land systems were already dominated by mopane, but under all model scenarios mopane will increase in Letaba and Phalaborwa. This mopane increase will offset the loss of herbaceous and shrub vegetation, resulting in little to no decrease in NPP across time for these land systems. This work illustrates that landscape resilience is not only impacted by the severity of changing climate but the degree to which we manage such systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim We describe patterns of skull size and shape variation in an Atlantic forest endemic rodent to test the influence of genetic structure, historical and environmental variables upon intraspecific morphological variability.
   Location South America, Brazil, Atlantic forest.
   Methods We analyse subtle differences in skull morphology of Akodon cursor through geometric morphometrics applied to 324 individuals from 12 localities distributed throughout the species range. Using cytochrome-b gene (cyt-b) sequences from 125 individuals (38 localities), we describe underlying patterns of genetic structure and transform them into distance measures that are included in our morphological analyses. We estimate the relative importance of genetic structure, historical variables and environmental variables on skull size and shape through mixed model selection and Akaike's information criterion.
   Results Geographical patterns in skull size are mainly explained by non-random factors related to primary productivity and precipitation, whereas spatial shifts in shape correlate with mitochondrial divergence. Cytochrome-b data revealed a phylogeographic break around the Jequitinhonha River, yet striking morphological shifts were observed further south. Differences in palaeostability between regions, and the configuration of rivers, appear as secondary sources of explanation for observed patterns.
   Main conclusions Multiple forces explain morphological variation within A. cursor. Teasing apart the effects of local adaptation and gene flow may be difficult, but is a key to improve our understanding of the drivers of intraspecific morphological variation. Our findings support the view that size is a more labile feature than shape, and that it may more easily break away from constraints imposed by gene flow. The combination of random and non-random factors, together with documented breaks in the distribution of the Atlantic forest over the Late Quaternary, accounts for the majority of morphological differences observed in A. cursor.

AB Considering the impacts caused to vegetation in the vicinity of cement factories, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impacts of cement dust on the structural organization and physiological/biochemical traits of Cedrela fissilis leaflets, a woody species native to tropical America. Plants were exposed to 2.5 or 5 mg cm(-2) cement dust applied to the leaf surface, to the soil or simultaneously to the leaf surface and the soil.. Leaves of shoot-treated plants exhibited chlorosis, marginal and inter veins necrosis, diminished thickness, epidermal cells less turgid, cellular collapse, obstructed stomata, senescence, rolling and some abscission. In few cases, individual death was recorded. Cement dust-treated plants also presented decreased amount of photosynthetic pigments and iron (Fe) and increase in calcium (Ca) levels. The cement crust formed in leaves surface blocked from 30 to 50% of the incoming light and reduced the stomatal conductance and the potential quantum yield of photosystem II. Control or soil-treated plants did not exhibit morphophysiological changes throughout the experiment. The activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase increased in leaves of plants upon treatment with 2.5 mg cm(-2) cement dust, independent of the site application. Overall, these results indicate that C. fissilis is highly sensitive to cement dust at the initial stage of development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pregnancy inhibits locomotion, increases predation risk and may translate into reduced survival. The extent to which animals modify behavior in the wild to compensate for the locomotor costs of pregnancy remains poorly understood. We have investigated how reproductive allocation (RA-the proportion of body mass devoted to reproduction) affects locomotor performance and habitat use in Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata) populations from low- and high-predation regimes. During steady swimming, females with high RA had increased tail beat amplitudes, indicating increased swimming costs. Females with high RA also exhibited slower escape velocities, which may result in an increased risk of predation. In low-predation localities, females with high RA used habitats with a lower water velocity, suggesting that females may be modifying behavior to offset the locomotor costs of pregnancy. Habitat use in high-predation localities was severely restricted to areas without predators, which had a relatively slower water velocity with little or no variation in current. These results provide a link between the performance-related costs of reproduction and behavior in a natural setting and show that animals may compensate for reproductive traits that constrain locomotor performance by modifying habitat use.

AB The relationship between environmental gradients and patterns of geographic variation in body size has been a controversial topic for ectothermic organisms globally. To examine whether the patterns that generally hold in more temperate species also hold for tropical ones, we examined the intraspecific body size variation in three species of Neotropical frogs, Dendropsophus minutus, Hypsiboas faber and Physalaemus cuvieri, along different environmental gradients (e.g. temperature, precipitation and topography). We analysed four competing hypotheses: (i) the water availability hypothesis that predicts a negative relationship between body size and precipitation; (ii) the heat balance hypothesis that predicts a negative relationship between body size and temperature; (iii) the topography hypothesis that predicts a negative relationship between body size and altitude; and (iv) the mixed-effect hypothesis that predicts that individuals occurring in wet and cold sites would be larger than individuals occurring in dry and warm sites. The spatial pattern of geographic variation in body size among populations of H.faber was associated with the mixed-effect hypothesis. In localities with low precipitation seasonality and cold conditions, H.faber individuals were larger than in localities with high precipitation seasonality and warm conditions. Variation in the body size of D.minutus was the opposite of that predicted by the heat balance hypothesis. Individuals in localities with high temperatures were larger than in localities with low temperatures. On the other hand, variation in the body size of P.cuvieri was not associated with the variables used in this study. Our results suggest that intraspecific variation in anuran body size is more dependent on species-specific response than on the region (i.e. temperate or tropical) where they occur.

Matrotrophy is the post-fertilization maternal provisioning of nutrients to developing embryos throughout gestation. Several studies have demonstrated that, in viviparous fishes, superfetation and matrotrophy have evolved in a correlated way, such that species capable of bearing several simultaneous broods also exhibit advanced degrees of post-fertilization provisioning. The adaptive value of the concurrent presence of both reproductive modes may be associated with the production of larger newborns, which in turn may result in enhanced offspring fitness. In this study, we tested two hypotheses: (1) species with superfetation and moderate or extensive matrotrophy give birth to larger offspring compared with species without superfetation or matrotrophy; (2) species with higher degrees of superfetation and matrotrophy (i.e. more simultaneous broods and increased amounts of post-fertilization provisioning) give birth to larger offspring compared with species with relatively low degrees of superfetation and matrotrophy (i.e. fewer simultaneous broods and lesser amounts of post-fertilization provisioning). Using different phylogenetic comparative methods and data on 44 species of viviparous fishes of the family Poeciliidae, we found a lack of association between offspring size and the combination of superfetation and matrotrophy. Therefore, the concurrent presence of superfetation and moderate or extensive matrotrophy has not facilitated the evolution of larger offspring. In fact, these traits have evolved differently. Superfetation and matrotrophy have accumulated gradual changes that largely can be explained by Brownian motion, whereas offspring size has evolved fluidly, experiencing changes that probably resulted from selective responses to the local conditions.

AB Demographic responses and fatty acid profiles of Moina macrocopa were quantified under different temperature regimes (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C and diurnally variable 20-30 degrees C) and at fixed ration (10.65 mu g DWml(-1)) of Chlorella. Highest constant temperature (30 degrees C) reduced the density of M. macrocopa. The cladocerans under the fluctuating temperature regime too had lower population growth (about 50% lower than that at constant 25 degrees C). The survivorship of M. macrocopa was higher at 20 degrees C than that at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C or at variable temperature regime. Gross and net reproductive rates were higher at 25 degrees C. At 20 degrees C, neonates had the highest proportion (67%) of myristic, palmitic and stearic acids while the adults had the lowest (26%) proportion. For both adults and neonates, palmitoleic, linoleic and linolenic comprised of 15-35% of the total fatty acids. Higher percentage (19%) of linoleic acid was present in adults than neonates (7%). Adults had linolenic acid level which was 3-times higher than in neonates. Linoleic and linolenic fatty acids decreased with increasing temperature for neonates and adults from 20 degrees C to 30 degrees C. The demographic responses and fatty acid profiles of M. macrocopa were discussed in relation to level and mode of temperature exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in the seasonal dynamics of Mediterranean macroalgal-dominated assemblages from the upper sublittoral zone are described along a gradient of sewage pollution. Algal coverage and composition were measured for more than one year at approximately monthly intervals. Nutrients concentrations (nitrites, nitrates, ammonia and phosphates) showed different seasonal patterns depending on the distance to the pollution focus. Ulva-dominated assemblages appearing close to the sewage outfall showed maximal coverage during early spring and started to decrease in May. Cora/lina-dominated assemblages replacing ulvacean algae at intermediate levels of pollution - followed the same pattern, peaking in March and decreasing in May. In contrast, Cystoseira-dominated assemblages, present at sites with low or no influence of sewage, increased coverage in May and continued with high coverage until the end of summer. Neither ephemeral algae (Ulva spp.), nor stress-tolerant algae (Corallina elongata), nor canopy-forming algae (Cystoseira spp.) have a seasonal growth cycle governed by eutrophication. Results demonstrate also that the period from May to July is the best time of the year for Water Framework Directive (WFD) monitoring purposes as less variability is observed within the assemblages.

AB Bergmann's rule predicts an increase in body size with decreasing environmental temperature; however, the converse pattern has been found in the majority of lizards studied to date. For these ectotherms, small body size may provide thermal benefits (rapid heat uptake when basking), which would be highly advantageous in cold environments. Yet such an advantage may not exist in nocturnal lizards (which do not avidly bask), in which Bergmann's rule has not been closely studied. We have examined whether the body size of a primarily nocturnal gecko, Woodworthia "Otago/Southland" changed with elevation and operative temperature (determined using physical copper models). In a laboratory study, we investigated whether thermoregulatory mode (heliothermy or thigmothermy) alters the effect of body size on heating and cooling rates. This gecko followed Bergmann's rule, thereby showing the opposite of the dominant pattern in diurnal lizards. Size at maturity, maximum size of adults and size at birth were larger at higher elevations and at lower operative temperatures. Using physical models, we found that large body size can confer thermal benefits for nocturnal lizards that remain within diurnal retreats. Bergmann's rule should not be dismissed for all lizards. Our results clearly support Bergmann's rule for at least one thigmothermic species, for which large body size may provide thermal benefits. Future studies on Bergmann's rule in lizards should consider thermoregulatory mode. We advocate that this ecogeographic rule be examined in relation to operative temperature measured at field sites. Finally, we predict that climate warming may weaken the relationship between body size and elevation in this gecko.

AB Habitat selection is a density-dependent process, but little is known regarding how this relationship may vary across different temporal scales. Over long time scales, grazing shapes the structure, diversity and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and grazing-induced changes in forage production over time are likely to affect the level of density dependence in habitat selection. In this fully-replicated, landscape-scale experiment, we investigated how density-dependent habitat selection by a large grazing herbivore, sheep Ovis aries, develops over the time scale of a decade. We also address an often-neglected challenge in habitat selection studies; namely, whether there is variation in use within a particular habitat or vegetation type and why. We found clear evidence of density dependence in habitat selection, with a wider use of habitats at high density. Despite a change in the standing biomass of high-productivity vegetation at high herbivore density over the years, with herb biomass declining and graminoid biomass increasing, there was no clear evidence that these grazing-induced changes in habitat over the years were strong enough to affect the level of density-dependent habitat selection. The difference in selection for high versus low-productivity habitats remained similar, despite annual fluctuations in the strength of selection. We found strong variation in selection within each vegetation type, even when vegetation types were mapped at a fine-resolution scale. Our study shows that despite the interactive effects of herbivores and habitats, they are not always sufficiently strong enough to affect the level of density-dependent habitat selection.

AB We assessed long-term effects of grazing cessation and drought on the shrub community of a semiarid ecosystem with a long history of grazing, located in the Mediterranean-to-desert transitional zone in Israel. Effects of grazing and drought on the cover of dominant (Sarcopoterium spinosum) and subdominant (Thymelaea hirsuta, Noaea mucronata and Coridothymus capitatus) shrubs were monitored during 12 years in four topographic habitats. With the exception of the toxic shrub T hirsuta, shrub cover increased by a few (at most five) percentage points soon after the establishment of fenced plots to prevent grazing, but the difference in cover between protected and grazed plots did not increase subsequently. Response of the woody vegetation cover to the drought pulse was more complex because it was affected by both species and habitat; it showed patterns of steady decrease, transient decrease, and transient increase. Recovery after the drought pulse was relatively slow, and total shrub cover did not return to its predrought level within 7 years. Varied responses to drought and grazing preclude consideration of shrubs as a single response group. The findings heighten concern for the stability of the ecosystem in light of the increasing frequency of dry seasons predicted by climate-change models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Coral recruitment is a pivotal factor in coral reef stability and in recovery following substantial disturbances. Despite its immense importance, the study of coral recruitment has some major gaps, notably larval survival before and following settlement, mainly due to technical limitations, which stem from the difficulty in observing the minute larvae. To overcome the major limitation in coral recruitment studies, i. e. the in situ detection of recruits during their early stages, we designed a new detection set-up, composed of a fluorescence detection set-up, a grid-covered substrate, and a Geographic Information System tracking system. This set-up, enabling the identification of coral recruits soon after settlement, revealed that in the critical period of the first day, less than 45% of the settling corals may survive. The results also suggest that either coral larva select locations that may increase their survival chances or they experience dramatic mortality during the early hours of settlement, which induce a consistent pattern of spat distribution. Our study confirms an earlier speculation that the first 24 h post-settlement may determine the rates and spatial patterns of recruitment. The significant implications of these findings, and the implemented " detection set-up" for coral reef monitoring and management, are discussed.

AB Various ecological and other complex dynamical systems may exhibit abrupt regime shifts or critical transitions, wherein they reorganize from one stable state to another over relatively short time scales. Because of potential losses to ecosystem services, forecasting such unexpected shifts would be valuable. Using mathematical models of regime shifts, ecologists have proposed various early warning signals of imminent shifts. However, their generality and applicability to real ecosystems remain unclear because these mathematical models are considered too simplistic. Here, we investigate the robustness of recently proposed early warning signals of regime shifts in two well-studied ecological models, but with the inclusion of time-delayed processes. We find that the average variance may either increase or decrease prior to a regime shift and, thus, may not be a robust leading indicator in time-delayed ecological systems. In contrast, changing average skewness, increasing autocorrelation at short time lags, and reddening power spectra of time series of the ecological state variable all show trends consistent with those of models with no time delays. Our results provide insights into the robustness of early warning signals of regime shifts in a broader class of ecological systems.

AB This paper presents an innovative methodological framework - Landscape Preferences Spatial Framework (LPSF) - which is able to translate landscape preferences, as expressed by various users, concerning possible land cover pattern compositions into land cover pattern preference maps. The innovative potential of the contribution lies in the exploration of a comprehensive methodical framework that facilitates the spatial representations of landscape demands by relevant user groups thus bridging the gap between landscape preference research and landscape planning. The LPSF developed here goes beyond the state of the art in translating local scale preference by people into regional scale planning settings. Throughout the paper the development and testing of the LPSF is described and explained. Although the paper focuses on the conceptual framework of the method, it also shows the results of its application in a case study. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The capacity to discriminate between choice options is crucial for a decision-maker to avoid unprofitable options. The physical properties of rewards are presumed to be represented on context-dependent, nonlinear cognitive scales that may systematically influence reward expectation and thus choice behavior. In this study, we investigated the discrimination performance of free-flying bumblebee workers (Bombus impatiens) in a choice between sucrose solutions with different concentrations. We conducted two-alternative free choice experiments on two B. impatiens colonies containing some electronically tagged bumblebees foraging at an array of computer-automated artificial flowers that recorded individual choices. We mimicked natural foraging conditions by allowing uncertainty in the probability of reward delivery while maintaining certainty in reward concentration. We used a Bayesian approach to fit psychometric functions, relating the strength of preference for the higher concentration option to the relative intensity of the presented stimuli. Psychometric analysis was performed on visitation data from individually marked bumblebees and pooled data from unmarked individuals. Bumblebees preferred the more concentrated sugar solutions at high stimulus intensities and showed no preference at low stimulus intensities. The obtained psychometric function is consistent with reward evaluation based on perceived concentration contrast between choices. We found no evidence that bumblebees reduce reward expectations upon experiencing non-rewarded visits. We compare psychometric function parameters between the bumblebee B. impatiens and the flower bat Glossophaga commissarisi and discuss the relevance of psychophysics for pollinator-exerted selection pressures on plants.

AB Local soil water-vegetation feedbacks play an essential role in vegetation pattern formation in drylands. However, the impact of spatial vegetation patterning on atmosphere-soil water fluxes, and thus on vegetation-climate interactions, is still unknown, even though this issue is crucial to determine how much detail is needed in representing vegetation-atmosphere dynamics in climate models. In this work, we explore whether evapotranspiration fluxes depend only on bulk vegetation characteristics, such as biomass density or vegetated fraction, or rather they depend also on the spatial vegetation pattern dynamics. To address this point, we introduce a new explicit-space model for vegetation dynamics in water-limited ecosystems, which includes two soil layers and is able to correctly represent evapotranspiration in the presence of intermittent rainfall conditions. The model dynamics display spatial self-organization of vegetation with multiple stable states, and the model outcomes reveal that transpiration fluxes in the days following a rainfall event depend on the type of vegetation pattern. The difference in transpiration per unit mass between spots and stripes is about 10%. The results of the simulations also indicate that fluxes from fixed vegetation (representing e.g., cultivated areas) can be very different from those above dynamically evolving vegetation, even when the two vegetation types cover the same fraction of space and have the same biomass density.

AB Stable isotopes were used to investigate contributions of autochthonous (i.e. benthic: epilithon and macroalgae) and allochthonous (i.e. pelagic: phytoplankton) organic matter sources to the diet of suspension-feeders, grazers and predators associated to small reef-pools (cuvettes) created by the reef-building species Dendropoma petraeum in the north-western coast of Sicily (Italy). Contributions of potential food sources were calculated using Bayesian mixing-models and integrated to a multivariate approach to highlight the diversity of C and N pathways within Dendropoma cuvettes. Both pelagic and benthic organic matter sources were exploited by benthic consumers, although clear differences were revealed in the various species depending on their feeding strategy. Three different trophic pathways were identified: one based mainly on phytoplankton, one based mainly on macroalgae and a third one mainly on epilithon. Suspension-feeders seemed to rely mainly on allochthonous organic matter sources, while grazers showed a wider diet spectrum. Predators revealed a high specialization in each of the three food chains and showed a distinct reliance on organic matter originated from benthic or pelagic sources. Stable isotopes evidenced here a marked differentiation of the trophic niche within the cuvette-associated community, which allows minimizing competition in very space-limited conditions.

AB The population and community level consequences of positive interactions between plants remain poorly explored. In this study we incorporate positive resource-mediated interactions in classic resource competition theory and investigate the main consequences for plant population dynamics and species coexistence. We focus on plant communities for which water infiltration rates exhibit positive dependency on plant biomass and where plant responses can be improved by shading, particularly under water limiting conditions. We show that the effects of these two resource-mediated positive interactions are similar and additive. We predict that positive interactions shift the transition points between different species compositions along environmental gradients and that realized niche widths will expand or shrink. Furthermore, continuous transitions between different community compositions can become discontinuous and bistability or tristability can occur. Moreover, increased infiltration rates may give rise to a new potential coexistence mechanism that we call controlled facilitation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Gradual changes in exploitation, nutrient loading, etc produce shifts between alternative stable states (ASS) in ecosystems which, quite often, are not smooth but abrupt or catastrophic. Early warnings of such catastrophic regime shifts are fundamental for designing management protocols for ecosystems. Here we study the spatial version of a popular ecological model, involving a logistically growing single species subject to exploitation, which is known to exhibit ASS. Spatial heterogeneity is introduced by a carrying capacity parameter varying from cell to cell in a regular lattice. Transport of biomass among cells is included in the form of diffusion. We investigate whether different quantities from statistical mechanics-like the variance, the two-point correlation function and the patchiness-may serve as early warnings of catastrophic phase transitions between the ASS. In particular, we find that the patch-size distribution follows a power law when the system is close to the catastrophic transition. We also provide links between spatial and temporal indicators and analyse how the interplay between diffusion and spatial heterogeneity may affect the earliness of each of the observables. We find that possible remedial procedures, which can be followed after these early signals, become more effective as the diffusion becomes lower. Finally, we comment on similarities of and differences between these catastrophic shifts and paradigmatic thermodynamic phase transitions like the liquid-vapour change of state for a fluid like water.

AB The adsorption rate constants of Ra and Th were estimated from empirical data from a freshwater lake and its feeding saline springs. We utilized the unique setting of Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, northern Israel) in which most of the Ra and Th nuclides are introduced into the lake by saline springs with high Ra-226 activities and a high Ra-224/Ra-228 ratio of 1.5. The mixing of the Ra enriched saline waters and freshwater in the lake causes the Ra-224/Ra-228 ratio to drop down to 0.1 in the Kinneret due to preferential adsorption of Th-228. These conditions constitute a "natural experiment" for estimating adsorption rates. We developed a simple mass-balance model for the radionuclides in Lake Kinneret that accurately predicted the Ra isotope ratios and the Ra-226 activity in the lake. The model is comprised of simultaneous equations; one for each radionuclide. The equations have one input term: supply of radionuclides from the saline springs; and three output terms: adsorption on particles in the lake, radioactive decay and outflow from the lake. The redundancy in the analytical solutions to the mass balance equations for the relevant nuclides constrained the values of Ra and Th adsorption rate constants to a very narrow range. Our results indicate that the adsorption rate constant for Ra is between 0.005 d(-1) and 0.02 d(-1). The rate constant for Th is between 0.5 d(-1) and 1 d(-1), about fifty to a hundred times higher. The estimated desorption rate coefficient for Ra is about 50-100 times larger than its adsorption rate constant. The mass-balance equations show that the residence times of all Ra isotopes (Ra-226, Ra-228, Ra-223, Ra-224) and of Th-228 in the lake are about 95, 92, 14, 6 and 1 d, respectively. These residence times are much shorter than the residence time of water in the lake (about 5.5 y). The steady state activity ratios in Lake Kinneret depend mainly on the adsorption rate constants, decay constants, the outflow rate from the lake and the activity ratios in the saline springs. The activity ratios are independent of the saline springs flow rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The mound building ant Formica exsecta Nyl. is widely distributed in grassland ecosystems of the Central European Alps. We studied the impact of these ants on seed bank and vegetation patterns in a 11 ha subalpine grassland, where we counted over 700 active ant mounds. The mounds showed a distinct spatial distribution with most of them being located in tall-grass, which was rarely visited by ungulates (red deer; Cervus elaphus L.). Heavily grazed short-grass, in contrast, seemed to be completely avoided by ants as only few mounds were found in this vegetation type. The species composition of the ant mound and grassland seed banks was quite similar, i.e. from 15 common plant species 12 were found in both seed bank types. We found the same proportions of myrmecochorous seeds in ant mound and grassland soil samples. In contrast, the number of seeds was 15 times higher in mound compared with the grassland soil samples. Also, the vegetation growing on ant mounds significantly differed from the vegetation outside the mounds: graminoids dominated on ant mounds, herbaceous and myrmecochorous species in the grassland vegetation. We found significant continuous changes in vegetation composition on gradients from the ant mound centre to 1 m away from the mound edge. Overall, F. exsecta was found to have a considerable impact on seed bank and vegetation patterns in the grassland ecosystem studied. These insects not only altered grassland characteristics in the close surrounding of their mounds, but also seem to affect the entire ecosystem including, for example, the spatial use of the grassland by red deer.

AB history research has mostly neglected learning even though it is probably a major contributor to lifetime performance in a variety of animals. As part of an ongoing project evaluating the relative contribution of learning, physiology and effort to performance throughout the life span, I quantified lifetime performance of honeybees, Apis mellifera, foraging at a feeder. Unlike natural foraging, where bees may learn a variety of features that contribute to increased performance, food collection from a feeder requires little learning. Foragers showed no long- term change in the rate of food delivery, a pattern that was different from published data indicating a long- term gradual increase in foraging performance in honeybees under natural settings. The discrepancy between bees' lifetime performance in the artificial versus natural settings suggests that learning is the key component contributing to the increase in performance throughout a forager's life as observed in the field.

AB Analysis of long-term (1970-2002) zooplankton body sizes in Lake Kinneret, as recorded in an historical zooplankton sample archive, combined with re-analysis of published long-term zooplankton taxonomic abundance data revealed previously undetected patterns in zooplankton biomass and demonstrates a profound long-term impact of planktivorous fish predation intensity driven by fishery harvest practices. During the 1970s, crustacean zooplankton biomass remained relatively constant at a mean (+/- SD) of 1.50 +/- 0.26 g m(-3), dropped precipitously in the 1980s reaching 0.57 g m(-3) by 1993, and rebounded to 1.33 +/- 0.19 g m(-3) in the early 2000s. The 1980s decline reflects decreased cladoceran biomass due to a decline in mean body mass in the three dominant cladoceran genera (Diaphanosoma, Ceriodaphnia, Bosmina) and decreased copepod biomass that resulted from a shift a dominance by large Mesocyclops agunnus to small Thermocyclops dybowskii. Although crustacean body sizes remained small through the early 2000s, cladoceran and copepod densities increased by similar to 34 and >300%, respectively, after 1994 leading to a dramatic increase in crustacean zooplankton biomass. These patterns indicate an intensification in fish predation throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and although zooplankton biomass rebounded in 1996-2002 to similar to 80% of the 1970s levels due to sharp increases in crustacean densities, smaller cladoceran and copepod body sizes suggest that Lake Kinneret zooplankton continue to be strongly influenced by intense lish predation.

AB The little stint Calidris minuta is one of the smallest shorebird species breeding in the Arctic (weighing 4.3 g on hatching). Their chicks are small and have a high surface area-to-volume ratio. We determined prefledging growth, energy expenditure and time budgets for little stint chicks in northwestern Taimyr, Siberia. A modified power curve was introduced to model the relationship between daily energy expenditure and body mass. Total metabolisable energy, TME, over the 15-d prefledging period was 107% greater than the allometric prediction for a bird the size of a little stint. Their growth rate coefficient was 14% greater than the prediction for a bird their size. The growth of young chicks was reduced in cool weather, possibly due to a reduction in foraging time in order to be brooded and reduced food availability which impact foraging efficiency. We did not detect weather effects on energy expenditure of chicks, but lack of temperature variation during energy expenditure measurements may have prevented this. In sum, both growth rate coefficient and energy expenditure of little stint chicks were greater than predicted and this is similar to that observed in other arctic shorebird species.

AB 1. The quality-variability trade-off hypothesis predicts that (i) energy density (kJ g(-1)) and spatial-temporal variability in abundance are positively correlated in nearshore marine fishes; and (ii) prey selection by a nearshore piscivore, the pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba Pallas), is negatively affected by variability in abundance.
   2. We tested these predictions with data from a 4-year study that measured fish abundance with beach seines and pigeon guillemot prey utilization with visual identification of chick meals.
   3. The first prediction was supported. Pearson's correlation showed that fishes with higher energy density were more variable on seasonal (r = 0.71) and annual (r = 0.66) time scales. Higher energy density fishes were also more abundant overall (r = 0.85) and more patchy at a scale of 10s of km (r = 0.77).
   4. Prey utilization by pigeon guillemots was strongly non-random. Relative preference, defined as the difference between log-ratio transformed proportions of individual prey taxa in chick diets and beach seine catches, was significantly different from zero for seven of the eight main prey categories.
   5. The second prediction was also supported. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to summarize variability in correlated prey characteristics (energy density, availability and variability in abundance). Two PCA scores explained 32% of observed variability in pigeon guillemot prey utilization. Seasonal variability in abundance was negatively weighted by these PCA scores, providing evidence of risk-averse selection. Prey availability, energy density and km-scale variability in abundance were positively weighted.
   6. Trophic interactions are known to create variability in resource distribution in other systems. We propose that links between resource quality and the strength of trophic interactions may produce resource quality-variability trade-offs.

AB The carbon assimilation efficiency and the internal composition of the chlorophyte Dunaliella viridis have been studied under conditions of current (0.035%) and enriched (1%) levels of CO2, with and without N limitation (supplied as nitrate). Results show that both photosynthesis and growth rates are enhanced by high CO2, but the strategy of acclimation also involves the light harvesting machinery and the nutritional metabolism in an N supply dependent manner. D. viridis carried out a qualitative rather than a quantitative acclimation of the light harvesting system leading to increased PSII quantum yields. Total internal C decreased as a consequence of either active growth or organic carbon release to the external medium. The latter process allowed photosynthetic electron transport to proceed at higher rates than under normal CO2 conditions, and maintained the internal C:N balance in a narrow range (under N sufficiency). N limitation generally prevented the effects of high CO2, with some exceptions such as the photosynthetic O-2 evolution rate.

AB Pollinator biodiversity on Ecballium elaterium (L.) A. Richard was studied for 2 years at 2 sites in southern France. Six families, 15 genera, and 43 species of bees were collected from the flowers, and 33 bee species carried Ecballium pollen in their scopae. The numerically dominant species were Lasioglossum malachurum (Kirby), the honey bee, Apis mellifera L., and Ceratina cyanea (Kirby). Few pollinators were observed in 1997 due to a drought. In 1996, mean forager density was slightly over one bee per 100 flowers throughout the flowering period. Most visitors (98%) were female bees which foraged for both pollen and nectar. Most visits (97%) were to staminate flowers and visitation to pistillate flowers was by deceit since these are nectarless. Behavior of nectar foragers on staminate flowers differed according to body size. Large bees foraged for nectar mostly in the afternoon after nectar sugar concentrations reached high values while smaller bees foraged for nectar throughout the day.

AB The relative importance of granivory by birds, rodents and ants in the southern Monte Desert (Argentina) was examined using an experimental seed-dish technique. Monthly seed-removal rates were recorded during two consecutive years, from September' 1995 to August' 1997. Birds were the main and most constant seed eaters during the study period. There was no seed removal by ants in September' 95, April, June, and July' 96, and May, June and August' 97. There was no consumption by rodents from March to May' 96. Rodents consumed significantly more seeds than did ants during both winters, and spring' 96. Conversely, seed removal by ants was significantly higher than that of rodents in summer 96. Overall removal rates were significantly different between both annual cycles studied. The highest seed-removal rate was recorded in March 1997.
   We compare our results with those obtained by several authors at the northern and central Monte Desert, as well as other and and semi-arid regions of the World, reevaluating conclusion about granivory in South American and zones. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Several hypotheses have been raised to explain the upper limit of clutch size at four eggs in waders (suborder Charadrii), which may play an important role in the evolution of the variety of mating and parental care systems in this group. Experimental tests of the hypotheses have produced conflicting results. It was recently suggested that the combined effects of several incubation costs of a larger clutch suffice to limit its size to four eggs in this group. Here we test the incubation-limitation hypothesis in a field experiment, in redshank Tringa totanus. We created five-egg clutches by adding one egg from another nest to a just completed four-egg clutch. Four-egg control clutches were created by replacing one of the eggs by an egg from another nest. All egg removals, additions and replacements were done before incubation started. Incubation time in five-egg clutches increased by 1 day to 24.3+/-0.23 days, compared to 23.3+/-0.32 days in four-egg clutches. Egg hatchability and nest predation rates did not differ significantly between treatments. On average five-egg clutches produced one extra chick at hatching (4.5+/-0.26 chicks) compared to four-egg clutches (3.5+/-0.27 chicks). Also when several additional costs from incubating enlarged clutches are added, redshanks by laying a fifth egg would on average increase their reproductive success at hatching by an estimated 22%. The incubation-limitation hypothesis therefore is clearly rejected in this species. Possible mechanisms behind the four-egg clutch limit in waders and ways of testing the alternatives are discussed.

AB Studies on core samples of the genus Porites in the northern Gulf of Aqaba revealed marked short-term variations in the growth rate of this coral over the last 20 years. Individual growth rates show high variations, even among colonies growing next to each other. These variations might be attributed to locally restricted differences in the reef environment, or to endogenous differences between the individual colonies. A general increase in linear extension rate was observed for colonies situated in a relatively undisturbed reef area between 1 m and 15 m water depth. Over the time period 1972-1992, major variations in climate conditions that could have affected coral growth were not observed. Reduction of terrestrial sediment influx is a possible reason for the accelerated growth rates. The effect of intense sediment loading on the rate of coral growth within a stressed environment is demonstrated for one Porites-core taken from a colony growing in the vicinity of the phosphate loading berth at Aqaba. The drastic decrease in growth rate at this location during the observed time span stands in contrast with the general development of Aqaba's reefs and is most probably the result of sediment stress.

   STRATEGIES
AB The major goal of this study was to examine patterns of gender variation in Ochradenus baccatus, a shrub found in the Judean Desert and Arava Valley of Israel, whose breeding system was previously considered dioecious (separate male and female individuals). We conducted detailed measurements on 150 marked plants over two years to (1) quantitatively describe the variation in sex expression and elucidate the factors responsible for gender variation in males, (2) determine the role of plant size in regulating the flowering behavior through the year, and (3) document pollinator visitation to males and females. The variability in sex expression differed between males and females. Females only reproduced by seed. In contrast, gender in males was extremely variable: 35% of males reproduced only by pollen donation (pure males) and 65% produced pollen and varying amounts of fruit and seeds (inconstant males). The ability to produce fruit was highly correlated with individual plant size. Inconstant males were significantly larger than pure males. Individual plant size also determined the flowering pattern through the year. Unlike most other desert plant species that typically flower after the winter rains, large O. baccatus plants flowered all year. Small plants, regardless of sex, flowered only during the winter months. The flowers of O. baccatus were visited by a diverse suite of insects including wasps, bees, ants, beetles, flies, and butterflies. Perhaps owing to the greater attractiveness of the floral display of males (due to the presence of yellow pollen), males were visited by many more insects than females. Over four observation days, 526 insects were counted on male plants compared to only 39 on females.

AB There is a real consensus that new antibiotics are urgently needed and are the best chance for combating antibiotic resistance. The phylum Actinobacteria is one of the main producers of new antibiotics, with a recent paradigm shift whereby rare actinomycetes have been increasingly targeted as a source of new secondary metabolites for the discovery of new antibiotics. However, this review shows that the genus Streptomyces is still the largest current producer of new and innovative secondary metabolites. Between January 2015 and December 2020, a significantly high number of novel Streptomyces spp. have been isolated from different environments, including extreme environments, symbionts, terrestrial soils, sediments and also from marine environments, mainly from marine invertebrates and marine sediments. This review highlights 135 new species of Streptomyces during this 6-year period with 108 new species of Streptomyces from the terrestrial environment and 27 new species from marine sources. A brief summary of the different pre-treatment methods used for the successful isolation of some of the new species of Streptomyces is also discussed, as well as the biological activities of the isolated secondary metabolites. A total of 279 new secondary metabolites have been recorded from 121 species of Streptomyces which exhibit diverse biological activity. The greatest number of new secondary metabolites originated from the terrestrial-sourced Streptomyces spp.

AB In salt-affected and groundwater-fed oasis-desert systems, water and salt balance is critically important for stable coexistence of oasis-desert ecosystems, especially in the context of anthropogenic-induced over-development and perturbations due to climate variability that affects the sustainability of human-natural systems. Here, an investigation of the spatio-temporal variability of soil salinity and groundwater dynamics across four different hydrological regions in oasis-desert system is performed. An evaluation of the effects of soil salinization and groundwater degradation interplays on the coexistence of oasis-desert ecosystems in northwestern China is undertaken over 1995-2020, utilizing comprehensive measurements and ecohydrological modelling framework. We note that the process of salt migration and accumulation across different landscapes in oasis-desert system is reshaping, with soil salinization accelerating especially in water-saving agricultural irrigated lands. The continuous decline in groundwater tables, dramatic shifts in groundwater flow patterns and significant degradation of groundwater quality are occurring throughout the watershed. Worse so, a clear temporal-spatial relationship between soil salinization and groundwater degradation appearing to exacerbate the regional water-salt imbalance. Also, the eco-environmental flows are reaching to their limit with watershed closures, although these progressions were largely hidden by regional precipitation and streamflow variability. The oasis-desert ecosystems tend to display bistable dynamics with two preferential configurations of bare and vegetated soils, and soil salinization and groundwater degradation interplays are causing catastrophic shift in the oasis-desert ecosystems. The results highlight the importance of regional adaptive water and salt management to maintain the coexistence of oasis-desert ecosystems in arid areas. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Anthropogenically-driven climate change is responsible for body size decreases in mammals. Using an important dataset of historically-collected data and data from continental-scale survey efforts from the National Ecological Observatory Network, Hantak et al. show that urbanization plays an important role in mediating this dynamic.
   Anthropogenically-driven climate warming is a hypothesized driver of animal body size reductions. Less understood are effects of other human-caused disturbances on body size, such as urbanization. We compiled 140,499 body size records of over 100 North American mammals to test how climate and human population density, a proxy for urbanization, and their interactions with species traits, impact body size. We tested three hypotheses of body size variation across urbanization gradients: urban heat island effects, habitat fragmentation, and resource availability. Our results demonstrate that both urbanization and temperature influence mammalian body size variation, most often leading to larger individuals, thus supporting the resource availability hypothesis. In addition, life history and other ecological factors play a critical role in mediating the effects of climate and urbanization on body size. Larger mammals and species that utilize thermal buffering are more sensitive to warmer temperatures, while flexibility in activity time appears to be advantageous in urbanized areas. This work highlights the value of using digitized, natural history data to track how human disturbance drives morphological variation.

AB Wind, insects, or both? The pollination mode of chestnuts, an important genus of nut-producing forest trees of the Fagaceae family, is still unclear. We revisit this old question using an integrated approach, focusing on cultivated Castanea sativa trees and hybrids in South-western France. We first conducted a large-scale insect isolation experiment. We then monitored 16 trees, focusing on flowering phenology, flower abundance and insect visits. Half of these trees are male-sterile, helping explore the role of pollen in insect attraction. Finally, we characterized the pollination syndrome of chestnuts and contrasted it with that of wind-pollinated oaks using original and published data. Chestnut female flowers have erect styles resembling stamens from male flowers, a probable case of intersexual mimicry. The tree's unusual phenology includes two peaks of pollen production. Pollinator exclusion experiments demonstrated a predominant role of insects in chestnut pollination. Flowering trees attract large numbers of beetles, bees and flies. In contrast, the few insects seen on female flowers (66 in 32 h of observation, <2% of the total) were mostly beetles. Compared to male-fertile trees, male-sterile trees attract fewer insects overall but their female flowers are more frequently visited and they have higher fruit set. All chestnut flower traits examined, such as the tiny pollen grains and the huge rate of pollen production, resulting in the highest pollen/ovule ratio ever reported in plants, are compatible with a beetle pollination syndrome. The high uncertainty of this pollination mode and its convergence with wind pollination explain the pervading confusion regarding chestnut pollination.

AB Understanding how resilient rangelands are to climatic disturbances such as drought is of major importance to land managers. The resilience of ecosystems can be reduced by livestock grazing and by environmental conditions. Most studies quantifying resilience are based on model simulations. However, natural time series from satellite data offer the possibility to infer aspects of resilience from real systems. The objective of this study was to investigate two aspects of ecological resilience, namely resistance to climate variability and recovery from drought, by applying a change detection method (Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend; BFAST) spatially on a 28-year Landsat NDVI time series in a dry rangeland in southern Cyprus. First, we used the number of breakpoints fitted by the BFAST model as an inverted proxy for long-term vegetation resistance to climate variability (the ability to withstand change during a disturbance reduces the likelihood to trigger a breakpoint in the time series). Second, we used the linear slope of the BFAST model after a known drought as a proxy of the recovery rate of the vegetation. This information was then used to analyse the spatial distribution of the total number of breakpoints and of the NDVI recovery trend in relation to grazing and environmental properties. Our results show that high NDVI and a northern orientation (i.e. favourable environmental conditions) were associated with a highly resilient system, due to high resistance to climate variability and fast recovery after drought. Intermediate conditions were associated with low resistance. Unfavourable conditions and high grazing intensities were associated with an unresponsive ecosystem state characterised by high resistance and slow recovery after a drought event. Low grazing intensities positively affected the NDVI recovery trend, but did not improve resistance. On northern slopes, terrain slope had a positive effect on the NDVI recovery trend, while on southern slopes it had a negative effect. Our satellite-driven approach has a strong potential for resilience monitoring, because it can be applied on broad spatial and temporal scales in areas with low availability of field data. Moreover, it allows to jointly extract two important components of resilience: resistance and recovery rate.

AB Critical slowing down is considered to be an important indicator for predicting critical transitions in dynamical systems. Researchers have used it prolifically in the fields of ecology, biology, sociology, and finance. When a system approaches a critical transition or a tipping point, it returns more slowly to its stable attractor under small perturbations. The return time to the stable state can thus be used as an index, which shows whether a critical change is near or not. Based on this phenomenon, many methods have been proposed to determine tipping points, especially in biological and social systems, for example, related to epidemic spreading, cardiac arrhythmias, or even population collapse. In this perspective, we briefly review past research dedicated to critical slowing down indicators and associated tipping points, and we outline promising directions for future research.

AB So-called fairy circles (FCs) comprise a spatially periodic gap pattern in arid grasslands of Namibia and north-west Western Australia. This pattern has been explained with scale-dependent ecohydrological feedbacks and the reaction-diffusion, or Turing mechanism, used in process-based models that are rooted in physics and pattern-formation theory. However, a detailed ecological test of the validity of the modelled processes is still lacking. Here, we test in a spinifex-grassland ecosystem of Western Australia the presence of spatial feedbacks at multiple scales. Drone-based multispectral analysis and spatially explicit statistics were used to test if grass vitality within five 1-ha plots depends on the pattern of FCs that are thought to be a critical extra source of water for the surrounding matrix vegetation. We then examined if high- and low-vitality grasses show scale-dependent feedbacks being indicative of facilitation or competition. Additionally, we assessed facilitation of grass plants for different successional stages after fire at fine scales in 1-m(2)quadrats. Finally, we placed soil moisture sensors under bare soil inside the FC gap and under plants at increasing distances from the FC to test if there is evidence for the 'infiltration feedback' as used in theoretical modelling. We found that high-vitality grasses were systematically more strongly associated with FCs than low-vitality grasses. High-vitality grasses also had highly aggregated patterns at short scales being evidence of positive feedbacks while negative feedbacks occurred at larger scales. Within 1-m(2)quadrats, grass cover and mutual facilitation of plants was greater near the FC edge than further away in the matrix. Soil moisture after rainfall was lowest inside the FC with its weathered surface crust but highest under grass at the gap edge, and then declined towards the matrix, which confirms the infiltration feedback. Synthesis. The study shows that FCs are a critical extra source of water for the dryland vegetation, as predicted by theoretical modelling. The grasses act as 'ecosystem engineers' that modify their hostile, abiotic environment, leading to vegetation self-organization. Overall, our ecological findings highlight the validity of the scale-dependent feedbacks that are central to explain this emergent grassland pattern via the reaction-diffusion or Turing-instability mechanism.

AB Aerosol samples were collected using eight stage non-viable Andersen cascade impactor at three urban and two rural sites in north-east India during 2018 covering three seasons i.e., winter, summer and monsoon. The size-segregated samples collected in the selected locations were carefully analysed in terms of deposition in human respiratory tract using inhalation and deposition curves. Seasonal variation of fractional deposition of particulate matter (PM) in human respiratory tract was observed. For example, during winter, in one of the urban sites i.e., S3 (0.61) the maximum deposition was in Pulmonary (P) region, while in the case of other sites, the maximum deposition was in Nasopharyngeal (NOPL) region. Regional deposition in P was high in S1 and S3 when compared with other sites. Vehicular emissions was dominant in both S1 and S3 in P, while biomass burning being dominant in S3 which could be the reason for maximum deposition in P. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) revealed five to eight factors at each individual site in NOPL, tracheobronchial (TB) and P regions: biomass burning (accounting for 7-32% of PM), coal combustion (14-27%), construction dust (9-25%), dust emissions (17-28%), industrial emissions (12-26%), oil refinery (18%), secondary aerosols (17-33%) and vehicular emissions (12-39%). Dominant sources in urban and rural areas were vehicular emissions and dust emissions, respectively. Therefore, the present study highlights the importance of analyzing source apportionment of PM at ultrafine scale and forms a basis upon which the future air quality studies and mitigation strategies can be formulated in this region.

AB A global review of animal translocation programs. We performed a bibliometric analysis to investigate the efficiency of release techniques (soft and hard-release), to analyse the characteristics and outcomes of the translocation programs, to identify knowledge gaps, and to provide recommendations. Animal conservation studies involving animal release to the wild increased significantly over the 31 years studied and were more frequently performed with terrestrial mammals than with other taxonomic groups. Most of the studies were performed by researchers from developed countries. Translocations occurred mostly in temperate regions, with almost no translocations occurring in the tropics. Almost 60 % of the studies did not provide information regarding the success or failure of the translocation programs. The most commonly used technique was hard release. Wild-caught specimens were preferred for translocations. Translocation programs were less common for groups like amphibians, fishes, and invertebrates. If criteria for suitable translocation are met, this management tool should also be conducted for tropical threatened species, led by native researchers. Furthermore, criteria for successful translocation should be clearly identified in order to improve future conservation actions.

AB Aim The aim was to test whether large-scale patterns of variation in the bodily proportions of small mammals relate to latitude and climate. Location The New World. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Marsupials, lipotyphlans and rodents. Methods Distributional, morphological and phylogenetic data were compiled for 149 faunal samples including 360 species of New World small mammals. Phylogenetic autocorrelation was addressed using phylogenetic generalized least squares regression. Results The faunal data show that tails are systematically larger in the tropics relative to head and body lengths. Furthermore, the data for individual species demonstrate a negative relationship between tail length and the distance of the midpoint of a geographical range from the equator. Hind foot and ear length also decline at high latitudes, but the relationships are much weaker. Allen's rule states that all extremities, including ears, feet and tails, should be larger at low latitudes because heat loss is not a limiting factor. However, no correlation between any measurement and mean annual temperature is found in two major groups (cricetid rodents and didelphid marsupials) or in all mammals combined. Main conclusions Allen's rule does not apply at the macroevolutionary scale, and a new one does. Given that long tails stabilize movement between tree branches and are better suited for being prehensile, this rule might relate to increasing arboreality in the tropics.

AB Little is known of the resources that limit or promote the rapidly expanding golden jackal (Canis aureus) population in Europe. We hypothesised that in an area of intensive big game hunting, a reduction of the main food resource (human subsidised big game viscera) would result in dietary switching. We used multivariate analyses to test whether the dietary composition of 200 jackal stomachs varied between two 2-yearly survey occasions, the first without big game viscera removal (availability of 68 kg viscera/year/km(2)) followed by a period with viscera removal (minimum of 50 kg of viscera/year/km(2) removed). The proportion of empty stomachs and the stomach wet content weight did not differ between the two periods. Even after the reduction of food subsidies, the primary food of jackals was viscera and carrion from wild ungulates (frequency of occurrence: 45% vs. 30%; wet weight: 55% vs. 29%, respectively), and scavenging was not affected by season or sex. Log-linear analysis of frequency data revealed no significant differences between survey occasions in consumption of either food type. MANCOVA of wet weight data revealed that in the first period with food subsidies jackals consumed a higher proportion of adult wild boar (11.6% vs. 1.3%; from predation or scavenging), while juvenile wild boar (0 vs. 11.8%; from predation or scavenging), domestic animals (0.8% vs. 6.2%; mostly from scavenging) and invertebrates (2.6% vs. 4.1%) increased in the second period. The stomachs in the second survey occasion contained more varied food items, but the trophic niche was not significantly wider. The feeding responses of this mesopredator to the reduction of food subsidies were less pronounced than expected. Because in high big game density areas, wild ungulate carrion from different mortality causes are available in high quantities throughout the year, predator populations can be maintained despite the high amount of viscera removal.

AB Understanding the impacts of livestock grazing is crucial to rangeland management and conservation. Numerous indicators have been employed to detect differences caused by grazing, while case studies suggest that effects differ among individual indicator systems. Across Tibetan pastures that have evolved with long grazing histories and harbour high levels of biodiversity, we tested: (I) whether commonly used grazing indicators differ in their sensitivity to grazing and environmental conditions, and (2) the relative importance of grazing and abiotic factors in controlling effects on indicators.
   Our sampling covered 18 sites within two main grassland types (steppe and meadow). We compared species compositions among communities of plants, small mammals and ants, as well as overall soil chemical conditions and field hyperspectral reflectance data using multivariate analyses between two qualitative levels of grazing intensity (heavy vs. light). Using univariate Generalized Linear Models, we explored the effects of grazing intensity, grassland type and their interaction on the richness and abundance of biotic groups as well as values of key soil and hyperspectral indices. The major environmental factors tested included temperature, precipitation, elevation, relief, exposure and inclination.
   Few of the indicators differed under relatively heavy grazing, including reductions in vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen concentration and two hyperspectral indices. Indicator groups differed both quantitatively and qualitatively with respect to grazing and climate impacts. Grazing effects were evident in the moist Kobresia meadows of eastern Tibet, while environmental controls dominated in alpine steppes of the drier western part of the plateau. Grazing effects on indicators thus depended on local precipitation conditions. Multivariate species compositions were affected by abiotic factors in all biotic indicator groups: precipitation was the most influential abiotic factor affecting plant species composition, overall soil nutrients and hyper spectral data, while elevation and temperature influenced ant and small mammal communities in terms of richness and species composition.
   Our results do not support the notion that local increases in relative grazing intensity have strong effects on the species richness of key biotic indicator groups across all Tibetan pastures. Reliable assessments of grazing effects thus require both multiple appropriate indicators and careful calibration to account for local climate and topographic conditions. Differences between principal grassland types must be acknowledged for future grassland conservation and management.

AB Many ecosystems exhibit gapped, labyrinthine, striped or spotted patterns. Important examples are vegetation patterns in drylands: these patterns are viewed as precursors of a catastrophic transition to a degraded state. A possible source of degradation is overgrazing, but many current spatially extended models include grazing in a local linear way. In this article nonlocal grazing responses are derived, taking into account (1) how many consumers there are (demographic response) (2) where they are (aggregative response) and (3) how much they forage (functional response). Different assumptions lead to different grazing responses, the type of grazing has a large influence on how ecosystems adapt to changing environmental conditions. In dryland simulations the different types of grazing are shown to alter the desertification process driven by decreasing rainfall. A sufficiently strong aggregative response leads to the suppression of vegetation patterns, nuancing their role as generic early warning signals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Zuelania guidonia is a tree species of cultural importance in Totonac society. This tree is a central element of the Los Voladores (the "flying men") pre-Hispanic ritual ceremony. However, the populations of Z. guidonia have decreased due to anthropogenic activity. This study aimed to codesign an agroforestry model for the recovery of Z. guidonia populations by combining scientific and traditional agroforestry knowledge at the El Tajin archaeological site in Veracruz, Mexico. We assessed the abundance of Z. guidonia and analyzed plant species richness and diversity in forest fragments. Species were classified according to plant regeneration modes (light-demanding and shade-tolerant) and to the local uses of secondary forests and conserved forest fragments. In addition, we worked collaboratively in a project that consisted of workshops, focus groups, open interviews, drawings, and field walks with community members. We studied a small population of Z. guidonia and recorded 116 woody species. Our findings showed that conserved forests were more diverse than secondary forests. Seventy-four percent of the species are useful to people. The Totonac people chose traditional vanilla plantations as a guiding model to shape their agroforestry system for restoring native vegetation. The results of our collaborative work revealed the Totonac extensive Traditional Ecological Knowledge and the need for the Voladores' group to strengthen alliances with other government and nongovernment organizations. They designed a model of a diversified traditional agroforestry vanilla system enriched with multipurpose plants as the outset of local well-being and regional agrobiodiversity restoration. This study reveals a distinct heterogenous land management scheme that provides the necessary conditions for preserving plant diversity, which will be used by local people for different purposes. We argue for studies that build on the relationship between scientific knowledge and Traditional Ecological Knowledge in transformed landscapes as a step forward for the long-term conservation of biocultural diversity.

ID DECISION-MAKING; EXPLORATION; CHOICE; MODEL
AB Satisficing is a relaxation of maximizing and allows for less risky decision making in the face of uncertainty. We propose two sets of satisficing objectives for the multi-armed bandit problem, where the objective is to achieve reward-based decision-making performance above a given threshold. We show that these new problems are equivalent to various standard multi-armed bandit problems with maximizing objectives and use the equivalence to find bounds on performance. The different objectives can result in qualitatively different behavior; for example, agents explore their options continually in one case and only a finite number of times in another. For the case of Gaussian rewards we show an additional equivalence between the two sets of satisficing objectives that allows algorithms developed for one set to be applied to the other. We then develop variants of the Upper Credible Limit (UCL) algorithm that solve the problems with satisficing objectives and show that these modified UCL algorithms achieve efficient satisficing performance.

AB In seeking to achieve poverty alleviation and environmental conservation, public policy has often centred on guaranteeing land titles to local peoples. However, such approaches have brought unintended outcomes, replacing small-scale economies and natural areas by intensive exploitation of resources with no clear improvement in local people's wellbeing. To understand this, we go beyond a general political ecology framing to consider relations between sustainability and land tenure, focusing on the intersection of economics, ecology and anthropology to understand how land tenure, property and use play out on the ground. We draw together different concepts including bundle of rights, de facto and de jure resource use, property regimes, density-dependence and non-equilibrium theory. The significance of this three-discipline view is illustrated through a case study of the Pantanal wetland, Brazil, where conservationists, the government and the local population contest ownership of the Paraguay River floodplain. Government sought to address conflicts around tenure and access through a narrow view of property, which failed to encompass the overlapping layers of land tenure, property and use on the ground and only served to create further legal battles. This article concludes that a more complex view combining the three perspectives is needed in the case of the Pantanal, and in other cases of contested property rights, in order to resolve conflicting claims and foster sustainability. We dissect both the power plays involved between different groups competing for control of a valuable resource, and the legal frameworks which can and should provide checks and balances in the system. The more nuanced grasp that emerges of local systems of tenure and access, of how these diverge from western property concepts, and of their environmental implications favours a better understanding of local realities, allowing for better management policy and consequently contributing more effectively towards poverty alleviation and environmental protection.

AB In this paper we used a modelling approach integrating both physical and biological constraints to understand the biogeographical distribution of the great scallop Pecten maximus in the English Channel during its whole life cycle. A 3D bio-hydrodynamical model (ECO-MARS3D) providing environmental conditions was coupled to (i) a population dynamics model and (ii) an individual ecophysiological model (Dynamic Energy Budget model). We performed the coupling sequentially, which underlined the respective role of biological and physical factors in defining P. maximus distribution in the English Channel. Results show that larval dispersion by hydrodynamics explains most of the scallop distribution and enlighten the main known hotspots for the population, basically corresponding to the main fishing areas. The mechanistic description of individual bioenergetics shows that food availability and temperature control growth and reproduction and explain how populations may maintain themselves in particular locations. This last coupling leads to more realistic densities and distributions of adults in the English Channel. The results of this study improves our knowledge on the stock and distribution dynamics of P. maximus, and provides grounds for useful tools to support management strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier By.

AB Experimental tests of the hypothesis that ecological communities can exist in "multiple stable states" are rare, and some argue, impossible, because of the unlikelihood that any system will meet the necessary criteria. These are that alternative states (1) are in the same location, (2) experience the same environment, (3) persist for multiple generations, (4) resist repeated perturbations, and (5) result from a pulse manipulation. In 1974, we initiated an experiment testing the ability of Ascophyllum nodosum-dominated rocky intertidal communities to recover from complete canopy removal. Manipulations were monitored frequently for 5 yr after clearance and resurveyed again after a 35-yr hiatus. After clearance, Ascophyllum was replaced immediately by another fucoid alga, Fucus spp, which continued to dominate the space through 1979 despite regular annual recruitment by Ascophyllum. Observations in 2009 revealed that Fucus spp. still dominated the cleared plots. Surveys in 2011 and 2013 demonstrated that Fucus persisted in experimental plots and Ascophyllum persisted in adjacent, unmanipulated plots. All criteria for testing an alternative state were met. Fucus persisted through multiple generations of both fucoids, a steady annual rain of recruits of both species, a high frequency of storm-driven perturbations, and it resulted from a pulse manipulation. Likely mechanisms include poor Ascophyllum recruitment directly under the Fucus spp. canopy despite abundant recruitment in adjacent areas, self-maintenance by Fucus spp. through high recruitment and fast growth, and recruitment facilitation of Fucus by the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides. Several lines of evidence indicate that other possible mechanisms including indirect facilitation of fucoids through predation on competitors (mussels), and positive or negative effects of littorine grazing, are unlikely. Although prior results in Maine suggested that the mussel Mytilus edulis was an alternative stable state, the new results suggest that Fucus spp. was the alternative state to Ascophyllum. During the nearly four decades of this experiment, a number of important species including fucoids, littorine grazers, and mussels all declined in abundance, most likely due to climate change. The presumed impact of climate change makes prediction of the long-term response of this system difficult, but it already differs dramatically from its structure in the 1970s.

AB Grazing by domestic livestock in the Caldenal rangelands has been threatening the ecological balance of this unique biome located in the semiarid zone of central Argentina. The aim of this review was to describe and explain the floristic changes observed in grazed rangelands in the southern Caldenal, discuss management alternatives for the conservation of desirable plant communities, and identify gaps in current knowledge of this distinctive ecosystem. Grazing-induced modification in the species composition entails the replacement of palatable grasses by unpalatable grasses and/or woody plants. Coarse grass and shrub encroachment represents discontinuous stable changes that lead to undesirable regimes in terms of functionality of primary ecological processes, species diversity, carrying capacity, and the economic productivity of livestock operations. Recovery of the desirable regime dominated by palatable grasses requires active restoration technology, which is often constrained by climatic and economic factors. Conservation of the regime dominated by palatable grasses calls for flexible stocking rates and intermittent grazing in replacement of current fixed stocking rates and continuous grazing. However, there is a basic need for more research related to restoration alternatives, grazing management, and for the development of simulation models to encompass the complexity of the system and assess the ecological and economic consequences of different management options of the southern Caldenal rangelands.

AB Ecological studies have frequently stressed that the availability of seeds in the soil is important for the recovery of semi-arid rangelands. However, the crucial role of soil seed banks has not been incorporated into rangeland models to understand vegetation states and transitions in semi-arid rangelands. We developed and evaluated a novel model to show that the availability of seeds in the soil seed banks as a function of plant cover can trigger transitions from perennial to annual grasses and from annual grasses to bare soil with increasing grazing pressure. The model indicates that when grazing pressure is low, a high cover of perennial grasses and a large soil seed bank of these grasses may be present, whereas annual grasses with their seeds in the soil appear with increasing grazing. When grazing pressure further increases, vegetation cover and the soil seed bank size decline. We found that the positive feedback between plant cover and the size of the soil seed bank depends on seed traits, i.e., longevity and germination rate. This positive feedback is an alternative explanation for a sudden vegetation changes in rangelands, which are often explained by the positive feedback between plant cover and the infiltration rate of rain into the soil. In contrast to this latter positive feedback, our model can explain shifts in vegetation from perennials to annuals and vice versa on different soil types, which are often seen in semi-arid rangelands. Our model contributes therefore to the understanding of vegetation dynamics for the proper management and possible restoration of degraded semi-arid rangelands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB In arid and semiarid ecosystems, shrubs usually play an important role in determining vegetation pattern and landscape diversity. By exerting multiple effects on microhabitat, shrubs can modulate the performances, species assemblages, and spatial patterns of their understory plants. Both positive and negative interactions act simultaneously, and the balance between them shifts at different spatial locations. To better understand shrub-herb interaction and its possible mechanisms, we chose three common shrub species in a dry-land of Hexi desert region and examine their effects on microhabitat and understory vegetation among different locations. Results showed that the understory vegetation can benefit from the presence of Calligonum mongolicum, as a result of modified drought stresses, increased soil nutrients and more available seeds. However, understory vegetation exhibited better performances at the peripheral location of Nitraria sphaerocarpa patches, which can be explained by the balance between resources improvement and seeds limitation. It has been also found that the higher salt contents (e.g., Na+, K+, Cl-, and SO42-) on vegetation patches beneath Haloxylon ammodendron may interfere with herbaceous performances and thus modified their spatial pattern. Our study revealed that the multiple effects of shrubs on microhabitat are species specific and at a fine scale, which may result in various fine-scale spatial patterns of vegetation in response to different shrub species.

AB Conservation translocations, anthropogenic movements of species to prevent their extinction, have increased substantially over the last few decades. Although multiple species are frequently moved to the same location, current translocation guidelines consider species in isolation. This practice ignores important interspecific interactions and thereby risks translocation failure. We model three different two-species systems to illustrate the inherent complexity of multispecies translocations and to assess the influence of different interaction types (consumer-resource, mutualism, and competition) on translocation strategies. We focus on how these different interaction types influence the optimal founder population sizes for successful translocations and the order in which the species are moved (simultaneous or sequential). Further, we assess the effect of interaction strength in simultaneous translocations and the time delay between translocations when moving two species sequentially. Our results show that translocation decisions need to reflect the type of interaction. While all translocations of interacting species require a minimum founder population size, which is demarked by an extinction boundary, consumer-resource translocations also have a maximum founder population limit. Above the minimum founder size, increasing the number of translocated individuals leads to a substantial increase in the extinction boundary of competitors and consumers, but not of mutualists. Competitive and consumer-resource systems benefit from sequential translocations, but the order of translocations does not change the outcomes for mutualistic interaction partners noticeably. Interspecific interactions are important processes that shape population dynamics and should therefore be incorporated into the quantitative planning of multispecies translocations. Our findings apply whenever interacting species are moved, for example, in reintroductions, conservation introductions, biological control, or ecosystem restoration.

AB The Kinneret phytoplankton biodiversity has been monitored on a regular basis since 1969, with the taxonomic information stored as a digital online catalog (http://kinneret.ocean.org.il/phyt_cat_listView.aspx) containing photographs and morphological descriptions. Our aim was to upgrade this ID tool by adding to it a consensus DNA sequence as a species identifier-DNA barcode. A two-gene system approach was applied, sequencing DNA fragments from the Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) and the rRNA small subunit and intragenic space (SSU-ITS). Today, 72 species isolated from Lake Kinneret, are at different stages of processing. The barcoding process was completed for 26 of those. Barcoding has enabled us to support current nomenclature, clarify the taxonomic names of species whose identification was previously inconclusive, classify to species level taxa previously identified to genus only, discover species new to the lake, and update current nomenclature. The construction of the DNA barcode database stands as the first brick of knowledge upon which further experimental work can be conducted, enabling fast and accurate identification of the Kinneret phytoplankton.

AB Light in the sea is one of the major factors influencing corals, with changes in light being rapid along the depth gradient. Those changes can be a potential stress factor for coral-reef organisms and affect different aspects of the coral's physiology, including its fluorescence. Fluorescence is a physical phenomenon, comprising the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light with a different wavelength. Major hypotheses concerning the role of coral fluorescence include that of photoprotection and the facilitation of photosynthesis. We sought to further investigate some ecophysiological aspects of coral fluorescence. We focused on the effect of different light conditions on fluorescence of the coral Galaxea fascicularis and used photography, confocal microscopy, and spectral measurements to assess changes in its fluorescence. We show that fluorescence is significantly influenced by light and, therefore, by depth. Coral fluorescence increased with the increase in light intensity and when the spectrum of light was broader. Hence, we support the "sunscreen" hypothesis and conclude that fluorescence plays a role in the coral's defense mechanism against harmful radiation. However, multiple fluorescent proteins, as found in different locations of the coral tissue, might suggest more than one functional role of fluorescence in the coral's physiology.

AB Invasive plants have tremendous potential to enrich native food webs by subsidizing net primary productivity. Here, we explored how a potential food subsidy, seeds produced by the aggressive invader cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), is utilized by an important guild of native consumers -granivorous small mammals-in the Great Basin Desert, USA. In a series of field experiments we examined 1) how cheatgrass invasion affects the density and biomass of seed rain at the ecosystem-level; 2) how seed resources from cheatgrass numerically affect granivorous small mammals; and 3) how the food preferences of native granivores might mediate the trophic integration of cheatgrass seeds. Relative to native productivity, cheatgrass invasion increased the density and biomass of seed rain by over 2000% (P < 0.01) and 3500% (P < 0.01), respectively. However, granivorous small mammals in native communities showed no positive response in abundance, richness, or diversity to experimental additions of cheatgrass seeds over one year. This lack of response correlated with a distinct preference for seeds from native grasses over seeds from cheatgrass. Our experiments demonstrate that increased primary productivity associated with exotic plant invasions may not necessarily subsidize consumers at higher trophic levels. In this context, cheatgrass invasion could disrupt native food webs by providing less-preferred resources that fail to enrich higher trophic levels.

AB Animal reintroductions are important tools of wildlife management to restore species to their historical range, and they can also create unique opportunities to study population dynamics and genetics from founder events. We used non-invasive hair sampling in a systematic, closed-population capture-mark-recapture (CMR) study design at the Big South Fork (BSF) area in Kentucky during 2010 and Tennessee during 2012 to estimate the demographic and genetic characteristics of the black bear (Ursus americanus) population that resulted from a reintroduced founding population of 18 bears in 1998. We estimated 38 (95% CI: 31-66) and 190 (95% CI: 170-219) bears on the Kentucky and Tennessee study areas, respectively. Based on the Tennessee abundance estimate alone, the mean annual growth rate was 18.3% (95% CI: 17.4-19.5%) from 1998 to 2012. We also compared the genetic characteristics of bears sampled during 2010-2012 to bears in the population during 2000-2002, 2-4 years following reintroduction, and to the source population. We found that the level of genetic diversity since reintroduction as indicated by expected heterozygosity (H-E) remained relatively constant (H-E(source,H- 2004)=0.763, H-E(BSF,H- 2000-2002)=0.729, H-E(BSF,H- 2010-2012)=0.712) and the effective number of breeders (N-B) remained low but had increased since reintroduction in the absence of sufficient immigration (N-B(BSF,N- 2000-2002)=12, N-B(BSF,N- 2010-2012)=35). This bear population appears to be genetically isolated, but contrary to our expectations, we did not find evidence of genetic diversity loss or other deleterious genetic effects typically observed from small founder groups. We attribute that to high initial genetic diversity in the founder group combined with overlapping generations and rapid population growth. Although the population remains relatively small, the reintroduction using a small founder group appears to be demographically and genetically sustainable. (c) 2015 The Wildlife Society.

AB AimWe assessed the phenotypic responses of body size and organ weights of two small rodent species (Myodes glareolus and Apodemus flavicollis) to elevation, a surrogate for temperature and other environmental conditions. We expected not only an increase in body size (Bergmann's rule), but also an increase in relative heart weight with increasing elevation (Hesse's rule).
   LocationThe Bohemian Forest, south-eastern Germany.
   MethodsWe measured body length, body mass, and mass of the heart, lung, liver, kidneys and spleen of 386 adult specimens (188 of A flavicollis and 198 of M. glareolus) from 28 localities at 300-1450m a.s.l., and also recorded the number of ectoparasites. We analysed body length using linear mixed models, with site as a random factor and species, sex, population density and elevation as fixed factors, and included all two-way interactions between species and the remaining fixed variables. For the organ masses, we included body length and body mass in the calculations to account for allometric variation of organ mass with body size. For a subset of individuals, we sequenced the mitochondrial D-loop to analyse genetic variation along the elevational gradient.
   ResultsFor both species, we found no support for Bergmann's rule. The body size of A. flavicollis even decreased with elevation. In contrast, the relative heart weight of both species significantly increased with elevation, thereby supporting Hesse's rule. Lung mass also increased with elevation. The mass of other internal organs showed no such consistent relationship with elevation. Neither species showed genetic differentiation across the elevational gradient.
   Main conclusionsOur results suggest that both rodent species respond to increasing elevation by decreasing overall energy expenditure and by increasing overall aerobic capacity. In the context of climate change, our results indicate that biogeographers should pay more attention to the potential significance of genetic and/or phenotypic plasticity of relative organ mass to environmental heterogeneity.

AB This study addresses the need for operational models in view of rapidly advancing in situ sensor technology that puts lakes into online surveillance mode. A model ensemble for simulating plankton community dynamics in Lake Kinneret (Israel) from 1988 to 1999 has been induced from electronically-measurable predictor variables (EMPV) such as water temperature, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. It cascade wise predicts the total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratios TN/TP, concentrations of chlorophyta, baccilariophyta, cyanophyta and dinophyta, as well as densities of rotifera, cladocera and copepoda solely from EMPV. The best coefficients of determination (r(2)) have been achieved with 0.6 by the dinophyta model, 0.45 by the rotifera model and 0.44 by the bacillariophyta model. The worst coefficients of determination (r(2)) have been produced by the cladocera model with 0.24 and by the TN/TP model with 0.28. Despite the differences in the r(2) values and apart from the cladocera model, the remaining models matched reasonably well seasonal and interannual plankton dynamics observed over 11 years in Lake Kinneret.
   The model ensemble developed by HEA also revealed ecological thresholds and relationships determining plankton community dynamics in Lake Kinneret solely based on in situ predictor variables. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plant communities are structured by complex interactions between multiple factors, which veil our understanding of the effects of environmental changes on communities and ecosystems. Besides the relative role of biotic and abiotic factors as community-structuring processes, addressing how they jointly affect the ecological resilience and resistance of plant communities is crucial to understand better the long-term response of communities facing global changes. Here, we used the results from a long-term (23years) perturbation experiment set up in Fennoscandian mountain tundra to test these mechanisms. The experiment consisted of a transplantation of twenty blocks of Vaccinium myrtillus heath vegetation including upper soil layer from a lower elevation tundra heath habitat to a snowbed habitat 150m higher in elevation where V.myrtillus lies at its upper limit. In the snowbed with contrasting levels of soil wetness, half of the transplanted blocks were protected from mammalian herbivores. Our results revealed that in addition to the important role of environmental conditions as a structuring force, the joint effects of multiple drivers resulted in divergent patterns in both plant functional composition and species diversity among transplanted communities. Under environmental perturbation (i.e. transplantation to snowbed), the heath vegetation was altered by grazing pressure that reduced the cover of shrubs (especially V.myrtillus). In grazed dry snowbed, a species-rich community with high functional type evenness and diversity developed. Reversely, in dry exclosures, V.myrtillus gained high dominance associated with only few graminoids and forbs. In wet snowbed conditions, shrubs tended to decline both in grazed plots and exclosures whereas bryophytes attained high abundance. Grazing promoted species richness while soil waterlogging tended to promote among-plot heterogeneity (-diversity) which was highest in wet exclosures.Synthesis. Our long-term experiment reveals that environmental perturbation, grazing and soil wetness exhibit joint effects that induce divergent trajectories of tundra plant communities. We suggest that a strong environmental perturbation triggers mountain tundra heath community to move away from its equilibrium state. The outcome of this shift depends on the interplay between grazing pressure and soil wetness that drive tundra plant communities toward divergent alternative states.

AB We study spatial localization in the generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation with either quadratic-cubic or cubic-quintic nonlinearity subject to spatially heterogeneous forcing. Different types of forcing (sinusoidal or Gaussian) with different spatial scales are considered and the corresponding localized snaking structures are computed. The results indicate that spatial heterogeneity exerts a significant influence on the location of spatially localized structures in both parameter space and physical space, and on their stability properties. The results are expected to assist in the interpretation of experiments on localized structures where departures from spatial homogeneity are generally unavoidable.

AB Using a spatially explicit mathematical model for water-limited vegetation we show that spatial instabilities of uniform states can lead to species coexistence under conditions where uniformly distributed species competitively exclude one another. Coexistence is made possible when water-rich patches formed by a pattern forming species provide habitats for a highly dispersive species that is a better competitor in uniform settings.

AB Geomorphologies tend to categorize dunes into three major states (mobile, semi-stabilized and stabilized) based on their shape and mobility rate. However, the ecologists try to find bio-indicators that can characterize the mobility rate and the ecological features of the various dune states. Unfortunately, there are limited numbers of significant bio-indicators, if any. The aim of our study was to develop a Dune Assemblage Index (DAI) in order to indicate the affinity of annual plants and arthropods assemblages to dune mobility. The DAI values range between 0 for stabilized dunes and 1 for bare and active dunes. The index was calculated for 10 coastal dunes in Nizzanim nature reserve, located at the southern part of the Israeli Mediterranean coast, from data that were collected in the years 2006 and 2007. Generally, the lower the vegetation cover is, the higher are DAI values for both taxon groups. Generalist species tend to mask the differences between active and stabilized dunes whereas psammophiles (sand-dwelling species) tend to increase the DAI values. Additionally, the DAI may differ among dunes with the same perennial coverage due to differences in the spatial plant distribution patterns. Likewise, the DAI depends also on the distance of the dunes from rural areas, which encourage invasion of generalist species, thus decreases the DAI value. This new defined spatial index that relies on plant and animal assemblages, rather than on individual bio-indicators, can be adapted to any taxon and dune ecosystems. The use of several taxons may support better understanding of the ecosystem state of the dune. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The way an invasion progresses through space is a theme of interest common to invasion ecology and biological pest control. Models and mark-release studies of arthropods have been used extensively to extend and inform invasion processes of establishment and spread. However, the extremely common single-scale approach of monitoring initial spread leads to misinterpretation of rate and mode. Using the intentional release of a novel biological control agent (a parasitic hymenoptera, Eretmocerus hayati Zolnerowich & Rose (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), we studied its initial dispersal and spread at three different spatial scales, the local scale (tens of metres), field scale (hundreds of metres) and landscape scale (kilometres) around the release point. We fit models to each observed spread pattern at each spatial scale. We show that E. hayati exhibits stratified dispersal; moving further, faster and by a different mechanism than would have been concluded with a single local-scale post-release sampling design. In fact, interpretation of each scale independent of other scales gave three different models of dispersal, and three different impressions of the dominant dispersal mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that using a single-scale approach may lead to quite erroneous conclusions, hence the necessity of using a multiple-scale hierarchical sampling design for inferring spread and the dominant dispersal mechanism of either human intended or unintended invasions.

AB One of the major threats facing coral reefs is intense benthic algal growth that can result in overgrowth and mass mortality of corals if not controlled by herbivore grazing. Unlike the well-studied coastlines of the Caribbean, there is currently a lack of knowledge regarding the effects of herbivory on benthic communities in the Red Sea. This is particularly relevant today as the local impacts in the Red Sea are increasing due to growing population and tourism. Over 4 mo, this study investigated the impact of herbivory as a potential key factor controlling algal growth on a reef flat in the Egyptian northern Red Sea. The main experiment consisted of in situ deployment of exclosure cages in combination with quantification of sea urchins and herbivorous fish. When all herbivores were excluded, our findings showed a significant 17-fold increase of algal dry mass within 4 mo. Although herbivorous fish occurred in much lower abundance (0.6 +/- 0.1 ind. m(-2); mean +/- SE) compared to sea urchins (3.4 +/- 0.2 ind. m(-2)), they were 5-fold more efficient in reducing algal dry mass and 22-fold more efficient in reducing autotrophic production of nitrogen. A significant shift from benthic turf to macroalgae (mostly Padina sp. and Hydroclathrus clathrathus) was observed when grazers were excluded. These algae may serve as early warning indicators for overfishing. Findings suggest that herbivorous fish act as an important top-down factor controlling both benthic algal biomass and composition at the study location. Results also indicate the potential of rapid benthic community change at the study site if herbivory is impeded.

AB Pigeons were given repeated choices between variable and fixed numbers of token reinforcers (stimulus lamps arrayed above the response keys), with each earned token exchangeable for food. The number of tokens provided by the fixed-amount option remained constant within blocks of sessions, but varied parametrically across phases, assuming values of 2, 4, 6, or 8 tokens per choice. The number of tokens provided by the variable-amount option varied between 0 and 12 tokens per choice, arranged according to an exponential or rectangular distribution. In general, the pigeons strongly preferred the variable option when the fixed option provided equal or greater numbers of tokens than the variable amount. Preference for the variable amount decreased only when the alternatives provided widely disparate amounts favoring the fixed amount. When tokens were removed from the experimental context, preference for the variable option was reduced or eliminated, suggesting that the token presentation played a key role in maintaining risk-prone choice patterns. Choice latencies varied inversely with preferences, suggesting that local analyses may provide useful ancillary measures of reinforcer value. Overall, the results indicate that systematic risk sensitivity can be attained with respect to reinforcer amount, and that tokens may be critical in the development of such preferences.

AB 1. The introduction of exotic species to new areas poses a major threat to the environment. For those introduced species that establish and survive beyond the short term, the opportunities to manage the risk of continuing spread often rest with limiting reproductive output. The introduced northern Pacific seastar Asterias amurensis is an ecologically important pest that has established in the Derwent Estuary (Australia). Driven by oversupply of bivalve prey, it is persistent, abundant and fecund when associated with man-made structures such as docks, marinas, jetties and piers, that is, wharves. 2. As a free-spawning invertebrate, fertilization by A. amurensis is a critical life-history stage constrained by strong Allee effects. Eggs must be released in close proximity to sperm sources because the chances of achieving fertilization drastically reduce with increasing distances of spawner separation. 3. Investigation of zygote production in the Derwent Estuary using a spatially explicit model of free-spawning fertilization shows that A. amurensis at wharves, while representing <10% of the total population in the estuary and concentrated in <0.1% of the total area, may contribute >90% of total zygote production. Given the seastars long-lived and highly dispersive larvae, we show that wharves not only represent important sites of invasion but also facilitate propagule pressure promoting secondary invasions. 4. Synthesis and applications. In the absence of effective pest control solutions, focusing on reproductive hotspots has the potential to reduce further spread of established marine pests and to alleviate ongoing ecological impacts. In the case of the northern Pacific seastar, elimination of highly localized wharf populations annually prior to spawning can reduce overall zygote production by up to estimated 90%. The long-term protection of key sources of larval production is a common goal for marine reserve design and fisheries management. However, the same concept but in reverse, whereby larval production is minimized at key sources, could be effective in the management of introduced pests in subtidal marine environments.

AB The great bustard Otis tarda became extinct in the UK during the 19th century due to a combination of factors, including hunting, egg collection and changes in agriculture. In 2003 a 10-year licence was granted to begin a trial to reintroduce the species back to the UK. Here we report on the first 5 years of the trial and assess the progress made towards establishing a founder population. From April 2004 to September 2009 a total of 102 great bustard chicks were imported from Russia and 86 released on Salisbury Plain. Monitoring showed that post-release survival was 18% in the first year following release, and that mortality of released bustards was mainly attributable to predation and collisions. Estimated adult survival was 74%, although the sample size was small. All known surviving great bustards are faithful to the surroundings of the release site, returning throughout the year. A lek has been established where males have been observed displaying to females. The first nesting attempt was in 2007, and in 2009 two females aged 3 and 4 years successfully nested, fledging one chick each. Models incorporating the new demographic estimates suggest that at the end of the 10-year trial period the project can expect to have 8-26 adults as a founder population.

AB In arid ecosystems, shrub patches are regarded as "islands of fertility," enriched in resources that facilitate growth of herbaceous vegetation. It is often assumed that the modulation of resources and the effect that it has on herbaceous vegetation are homogeneous within each shrub patch. We examined the modulated resources in terms of their fine-scale spatial extent, level, and response to anthropogenic disturbances, that is, canopy removal and grazing. We defined three patch types-core of shrub patch, periphery of shrub patch, and intershrub patch-and recorded their levels of soil nutrients (organic matter, potassium, phosphorus, nitrate, and ammonium) and temperature regimes, with and without canopy removal, and/or grazing. Overall, our study found higher soil-nutrient contents and lower maximum temperatures at the core of the shrub patch than in the intershrub matrix. However, we also found that resource modulation was not spatially homogeneous within the shrub patch: soil nutrient levels were higher in the core than at the periphery. Anthropogenic disturbances did not affect soil nutrients within the 2-year time scale of our study. Our results emphasize the importance of examining the landscape at the spatial scale of the modulated resources, in order to develop patch management that increases productivity and diversity, and prevents desertification.

AB Despite the distribution of dugongs Dugong dugon ranging across nearshore waters of the tropical and subtropical regions of the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean, their distribution in the western Indian Ocean is highly fragmented and appears to be declining. The population of the Bazaruto Archipelago is believed to comprise the only viable population in the region. In all, 27 surveys were flown over the Bazaruto Bay area to define the distribution and estimate the abundance of the species in the area. A total of 9 052 nautical miles of survey effort was flown during the surveys, from which there were 355 sightings of 760 dugongs. Two core areas of distribution were apparent within the surveyed area; a northern core area spread within the 10 m isobath between the Save River mouth and Ponta Bartolomeu Dias (21 degrees 24' S), and a southern core area aligned with the shallow sandbanks to the north and south of Santa Carolina Island. Group sizes recorded in the Bazaruto Archipelago were comparable to group sizes recorded in other regions where dugongs occur, although few large (>20) groups of dugongs were seen in this study. Line transect analyses of each survey showed dugong densities were considerably lower than densities recorded in surveys in Australian waters or in the Arabian Gulf, with a population estimate of 247 dugongs (CV = 34.1) when all surveys were considered, and 359 dugongs (CV = 38.2) when only the surveys that were carried out under adequate sighting conditions were included.

AB Canada yew (Taxus canadensis Marsh.) is a shade-tolerant evergreen shrub native to the understories of the boreal and deciduous forests of northeastern North America. Canada yew has a relatively unique growth form, with low sprawling branches capable of forming dense clusters of stems. Historic accounts suggest that before Euro-American settlement, Canada yew was a common plant across its range in many forest types and that it was locally abundant or dominant in 5%-20% of forest stands in the northern part of its range. Canada yew's range has declined during the last century as a result of browsing by native ungulates, fire, intensive forest management, and clearing of land for agriculture and other development. It is considered uncommon throughout most of its present North American range, except for often isolated populations in areas that remain free from heavy browsing pressure by moose and deer (e.g., islands, areas with heavy snow cover, or areas naturally low in ungulate abundance). Its decline has likely resulted in changes to abiotic and biotic conditions, including structure and composition of understory vegetation and concomitant effects on understory vertebrates. Increasing white-tailed deer populations and reduced snowfall as a result of climate change in eastern North America threaten to extirpate this species from additional parts of its range in the next century. Suggestions for future research are discussed.

AB An Integrated Pest Management is formulated as a threshold policy. It is shown that when this strategy is applied to a food web consisting of generalist, specialist predators and endemic and pest prey, the dynamics can be stable and useful from the pest control point of view, despite the dynamical complexities inherent to the application of biocontrol only. In addition, pesticide toxicity depends rather on the species intrinsic parameters than on the chemical agent concentration.

AB Babcock's leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis babcocki) are taken to rehabilitation centers in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, because they are either escaped, unwanted, or confiscated pets, or else are confiscated from persons who acquire them illegally from the wild. South African rehabilitation centers are reluctant to euthanize tortoises, and there are few tortoise sanctuaries. Consequently, the local conservation authority, Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife, developed a release protocol based on International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources guidelines, to facilitate the release of rehabilitated S. p. babcocki into the wild. The present study was done to determine whether rehabilitated animals could be successfully released into the wild, judged by whether individuals were able to survive in the wild. Seventeen apparently healthy individuals, with longer than 100-mm carapace length, that had been in captivity for more than 2 months in a large rehabilitation center were released into the wild. These rehabilitated animals, with attached radiotelemeters, were hard-released at 2 different sites within the historical range of the species and were monitored over a year. One of the tortoises was returned to captivity because of disease, 3 were killed intentionally or accidentally by humans, one died probably due to being turned over by another animal, 3 others died from a combination of disease, starvation and/or dehydration, and the fate of 6 was unknown. Because only 2 animals survived 13 months after release at one of the sites and only one was known to have survived 25 months after release at the other site, rehabilitated S. p. babcocki were not successfully released into the wild. However, recommendations to improve the probability of success of future releases of rehabilitated S. p. babcocki into the wild are provided.

AB Marine habitats are naturally patchy and anthropogenic disturbance can further fragment them. Many marine animals are sessile as adults or obligate inhabitants of particular habitats, so populations living in isolated patches of habitat are linked largely by dispersal of planktonic larvae. Theoretically, larvae are more likely to find and settle into large patches of habitat than small patches, thus small habitat patches may experience a more discontinuous supply of recruits resulting in small populations with unusual size- or age-structures or odd sex ratios - conditions where Allee effects on reproductive success are likely. We tested this hypothesis for the Caribbean spotted spiny lobster (Panulirus guttatus), an obligate inhabitant of coral patch reefs whose mating dynamics are size-dependent. We found that P. guttatus were less abundant on small reefs where their size structure and per capita reproductive success were significantly more variable, particularly among large females that are susceptible to sperm limitation that diminishes fertilization rates. These results are indicative of Allee effects and provide a mechanistic understanding of how size-dependent mating dynamics influence reproductive success in ways that alter population dynamics in patchy habitats.

AB Measurements of O-3 and BrO concentrations over the Dead Sea indicate that Ozone Depletion Events (ODEs), widely known to happen in polar regions, are also occuring over the Dead Sea due to the very high bromine content of the Dead Sea water. However, we show that BrO and O-3 levels as they are detected cannot solely be explained by high Br- levels in the Dead Sea water and the release of gas phase halogen species out of sea borne aerosol particles and their conversion to reactive halogen species. It is likely that other sources for reactive halogen compounds are needed to explain the observed concentrations for BrO and O-3. To explain the chemical mechanism taking place over the Dead Sea leading to BrO levels of several pmol/mol we used the one-dimensional model MISTRA which calculates microphysics, meteorology, gas and aerosol phase chemistry. We performed pseudo Lagrangian studies by letting the model column first move over the desert which surrounds the Dead Sea region and then let it move over the Dead Sea itself. To include an additional source for gas phase halogen compounds, gas exchange between the Dead Sea water and the atmosphere is treated explicitly. Model calculations indicate that this process has to be included to explain the measurements.

AB From 1996 to 2004, we studied population dynamics of a rodent assemblage in semiarid habitats in Lassen County, California. Abundances of rodents appeared affected by fluctuations in precipitation from a high in 1996 to average and slightly below-average levels in subsequent years; perhaps reflecting this, assemblage composition also changed dramatically during the study period. California kangaroo rats (Dipodomys californicus) declined from abundant to extremely rare, abundances of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) fluctuated greatly during the study period, and, perhaps most notably, populations of dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) appeared to decline to local extinction, possibly allowing for the subsequent colonization of desert woodrats (N. lepida). These changes appeared to represent natural variation in numbers and composition in an ecologically dynamic ecotonal region in response to multiyear changes in precipitation.

AB The effect of solar radiation (photosynthetically active radiation and ultraviolet radiation [UVR]) on the photosynthetic extracellular release (PER) of phytoplankton and its utilization by bacterioplankton were studied in an alpine lake (Gossenkollesee, Austria) over a seasonal cycle. For comparison, 2 Arctic lakes on the Taymir Peninsula (Siberia) were investigated as well. The contribution of PER to primary production (% net PER) ranged between 0 and 95 % (mean 32 %) in Gossenkollesee (May 1999 to July 2000) following a seasonal trend that was inversely related to phytoplankton biomass. PER was released only under light conditions and was positively related to the intensity of solar radiation. During the ice-covered period, the % net PER increased, while total primary production (P-tot) decreased with experimentally increasing irradiance, indicating radiation-induced stress with dark-adapted phytoplankton. During the ice-free period, the increase of % net PER with increasing irradiance was independent of photoinhibition. The fraction of PER not immediately incorporated by bacteria (similar to 60 % of total PER) may be an important contribution to the generally low pool of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Gossenkollesee. At the Arctic site, net PER amounted to 21 % of P-tot in an ice-free lake and 51 % in the ice-covered Lake Nyagamya, In all lakes, the amount of PER was sufficient to meet the bacterial carbon demand. The UVR-induced inhibition of primary production in the investigated lakes was inversely related to the DOC concentration of the water column, with the lowest effect in the ice-free Arctic lake (3.5% reduction of P-tot) and the highest impact in the alpine lake (56 % reduction of P-tot, 61 % reduction of PER); the percentage of net PER was apparently not controlled by UVR. This suggests that the investigated alpine lake is more sensitive to changes in UVR than the Arctic lakes are.

AB Seed removal from bait stations was studied in miombo habitat in western Zimbabwe. Previous studies of seed predation in southern Africa have largely been conducted in desert ecosystems. However, this woodland-savanna habitat is more mesic and has relatively predictable rainfall patterns. The experiment was conducted in grassy and woody microhabitats in the hot, dry season and early wet season, and followed a year in which precipitation was 69 % of the long-term average. Birds removed the greatest quantity of seeds, followed by ants and then rodents. Previous studies in northern hemisphere mesic environments emphasize the importance of rodents and minor role of invertebrates in seed predation. Although our site appears to have more in common with southern hemisphere desert sites than with northern hemisphere mesic sites, we recognize that our results are likely to reflect a lower limit of consumption by rodents.

AB Basins of attraction of nonlinear systems can be "riddled"; arbitrarily close to any point in a riddled basin are neighboring points which go to a different attractor. I present two chaotically forced single-species population models with riddled basins of attraction. As a result of this complex basin structure, the ultimate survival of these populations is effectively unpredictable. Riddled basins produce a level of unpredictability qualitatively greater than the familiar sensitive dependence on initial conditions within a single chaotic attractor, or the unpredictability caused by multiple attractors with fractal basin boundaries.

AB We investigated foraging patterns of the southern fire ant, Solenopsis xyloni (McCook), using combinations of readily available foods that might be incorporated into a bait mixture. Choice tests conducted to determine the most attractive diet for S, xyloni included preference tests for each of 4 particle sizes. Freeze-dried diets were more attractive than oven-baked diets, and diets made with freeze-dried chicken eggs and anchovies were the most attractive. A particle size of diet of 11-20 mesh (840-2,000 mu m) resulted in the largest amount of diet removed by the colony. The smallest particle size, 40 mesh (420-590 mu m), had the most particles removed by workers but yielded the least amount of diet brought into the ant colony. S. xyloni is primarily a nocturnal forager, whose foraging begins approximate to 4 h before sunset and whose maximal foraging occurs between 2 and 7 h after sunset. There was considerable seasonal intracolony variation, but the maximal amount of diet was taken in June, August, and October.

Geographical variation in niche breadth and niche position among three community types of Southern, Western and Eastern Gobi was considered in overall coordinates for the whole desert. To reduce the environmental constraints in regional communities, niche breadth was estimated along comparable parts of discriminant axes and was measured by use of the Shannon-Weaver index. Niche overlap values were calculated for each of the three communities as a probability of displacement along the discriminant axis. Guild structure of the fauna reflects the adaptation of species to the range of main landscape types of the desert zone. Species shift their preferences along the axes of ecological space independently. These results challenge the viewpoint that the spatial-guilds are stable co-adapted assemblages. The nearest neighbor analysis of niche overlap indicates the absence of dense niche packing in the southern Mongolian desert, whereas the relatively even distribution of niche overlap in communities of the northern Mongolian desert suggests more dense niche packing. We did not find any features of regularity in body size distribution among Mongolian desert species. Pairs of congeneric species with low and high niche overlap have the same body weight ratio.

AB Offspring number was manipulated in Willow Ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus to determine the effect of brood size on parental effort in defence of young. Three chicks were added (n = 8), exchanged (n = 10) or removed (n = 12) among broods of females that had laid 7-9 eggs. If parents based effort on the value of the brood, it was predicted that defence should increase with offspring number because ptarmigan parents receive greater returns from large broods. Parental effort in defence was unaffected by brood size, probably because a predator cannot threaten the entire brood simultaneously when ptarmigan young are scattered. This evidence supports theoretical models which predict that if the young are able to disperse, patterns of defence will be different in precocial birds from that in fish or altricial birds.

AB Competing hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the phenomenon of posthatch brood mixing by waterfowl can be distinguished by whether they assume that adults experience costs in rearing nidifugous offspring. To test this, time budget data were collected for giant Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima) at Cambridge, Ontario, in 1990. Breeding adults with broods devoted more time to vigilance (p = 0.001) and less time to feeding (p = 0.001) than adults that hatched clutches but were without broods, suggesting a cost to rearing nidifugous young. However, as goslings matured, parents allocated less time to vigilance (p < 0.001) and more time to locomotion (p = 0.005), and time spent feeding did not change (p = 0.336). In addition, brood size did not affect the time parents allocated to vigilance (p = 0.543) or feeding (p = 0.727), suggesting that caring for additional young has negligible effects on parents. Goslings were selective about the adult with which they associated (they were positioned closer to females than to males), but neither brood size nor brood age affected the feeding time of goslings (p = 0.94 and 0.76, respectively) or time spent vigilant (p = 0.22 and 0.69, respectively), suggesting that goslings gained no obvious advantage from greater foraging opportunities or better predator detection by congregating in larger broods.

ID TARANDUS
AB The optimal harvesting policy for a plant-herbivore system consisting of lichen and reindeer in Finnish Lapland is investigated. Using a discrete time model with no age structure it is shown that the optimal procedure to reach target levels for lichen and reindeer involves a possible initial harvest of reindeer and then a sequence of no-harvesting years until the lichen has recovered. After two adjusting harvests the system will settle to an equilibrium. The optimal solution is compared with the fastest possible approach to the target levels. The two solutions coincide if future yields are sufficiently discounted. With a discount factor near one there will be a heavier initial harvest in the optimal solution. It is seen that allowing some harvesting also in the no-harvesting years has no marked effect on the total yield. The target levels for lichen and reindeer are not unique but depend both on discounting and on the length of the planning period.

ID MIXED-GRASS PRAIRIE; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY
AB The effects of grazing and fire were studied in lowland pastures at Thessaly, Central Greece. Five community types, which occur in an area of 1250 ha, experience different grazing pressure and fire frequencies. Comparing the vegetation characteristics of the five studied communities, we found that grazing increased the cover of undesirable species, while frequent fires resulted in a drastic decrease of the woody species cover. The studied communities were ordinated by Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Grazing pressure conditions the data distribution along the first two axes, while frequency of fires conditions the data distribution along the first axis. A degradation model and three possible scenarios of change are proposed. This model shows that the divergence of the final degraded stages depends on the intensity of the main human impacts, although the initial stage and the climatic and soil conditions are the same.

AB The water bodies are greatly influenced by chemical contamination and global increasing temperature. As an emerging pollutant, microplastics are widely distributed in the freshwater environment, raising concerns regard-ing their potential toxicity to organisms. Especially for zooplankton filter feeders, many of microplastics are in similar size as their food. Individually, both microplastics and temperature have profound effects on zooplankton populations and their function in ecosystems. However, the strength and direction of their interactive effects are still not clear. Here, we performed a comprehensive biotoxicity assessment providing empirical evidence that the temperature played a key role in shaping the sensitivity of the zooplankter, Daphnia magna, against microplastic toxicity. We found that exposure to microplastics generally caused negative effects on Daphnia individual fitness, such as increased lethality, declined fecundity and reduced population growth rate. This microplastic toxicity was more prominent at 30 degrees C than at 20 degrees C, and was rather minor at 15 degrees C. Moreover, the warming accelerated the ingestion of microplastics, and triggered abnormal ultrastructure of intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, the ex -pression profiling of candidate genes revealed oxidative damage, fecundity impairment and energy retardation by microplastics were amplified with increasing temperature, which may contribute to the enhancement of microplastic toxicity under warming. Given that high temperature fluctuations are becoming more common and difficult to predict, the interactive effects of microplastics and climate warming on Daphnia population dy-namics and biomass production may become increasingly aggravated in nature. Collectively, extrapolation for environmental risk assessment studies conducted under different temperature contexts may broaden our knowl-edge microplastic toxicity on aquatic organism fitness.

AB Aim Alpine habitats support unique biodiversity confined to high-elevation areas in the current interglacial. Plant diversity in these habitats may respond to area, environment, connectivity and isolation, yet these factors have been rarely evaluated in concert. Here we investigate major determinants of regional species pools in alpine grasslands, and the responses of their constituent species groups.
   Location European mountains below 50 degrees N.
   Time period Between 1928 and 2019.
   Major taxa studied Vascular plants.
   Methods We compiled species pools from alpine grasslands in 23 regions, including 794 alpine species and 2,094 non-alpines. We used species-area relationships to test the influence of the extent of alpine areas on regional richness, and mixed-effects models to compare the effects of 12 spatial and environmental predictors. Variation in species composition was addressed by generalized dissimilarity models and by a coefficient of dispersal direction to assess historical links among regions.
   Results Pool sizes were partially explained by current alpine areas, but the other predictors largely contributed to regional differences. The number of alpine species was influenced by area, calcareous bedrock, topographic heterogeneity and regional isolation, while non-alpines responded better to connectivity and climate. Regional dissimilarity of alpine species was explained by isolation and precipitation, but non-alpines only responded to isolation. Past dispersal routes were correlated with latitude, with alpine species showing stronger connections among regions.
   Main conclusions Besides area effects, edaphic, topographic and spatio-temporal determinants are important to understand the organization of regional species pools in alpine habitats. The number of alpine species is especially linked to refugia and isolation, but their composition is explained by past dispersal and post-glacial environmental filtering, while non-alpines are generally influenced by regional floras. New research on the dynamics of alpine biodiversity should contextualize the determinants of regional species pools and the responses of species with different ecological profiles.

AB The selection pressures that have shaped the evolution of complex traits in humans remain largely unknown, and in some contexts highly contentious, perhaps above all where they concern mean trait differences among groups. To date, the discussion has focused on whether such group differences have any genetic basis, and if so, whether they are without fitness consequences and arose via random genetic drift, or whether they were driven by selection for different trait optima in different environments. Here, we highlight a plausible alternative that many complex traits evolve under stabilizing selection in the face of shifting environmental effects. Under this scenario, there will be rapid evolution at the loci that contribute to trait variation, even when the trait optimum remains the same. These considerations underscore the strong assumptions about environmental effects that are required in ascribing trait differences among groups to genetic differences.

AB Human disturbances alter the functioning and biodiversity of many ecosystems. These ecosystems may return to their pre-disturbance state after disturbance ceases; however, humans have altered the environment in ways that may change the rate or direction of this recovery. For example, human activities have increased supplies of biologically limiting nutrients, such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which can reduce grassland diversity and increase productivity. We tracked the recovery of a grassland for two decades following an intensive agricultural disturbance under ambient and elevated nutrient conditions. Productivity returned to pre-disturbance levels quickly under ambient nutrient conditions, but nutrient addition slowed this recovery. In contrast, the effects of disturbance on diversity remained hidden for 15 years, at which point diversity began to increase in unfertilised plots. This work demonstrates that enrichment of terrestrial ecosystems by humans may alter the recovery of ecosystems and that disturbance effects may remain hidden for many years.

AB Mediterranean coastal ecosystems experience many local and global stressors and require long-term monitoring to detect and follow trends in community structure. Between 2009 and 2017, we seasonally and annually monitored the spatiotemporal community dynamics at 11 sites on the rocky shores of the southeastern Mediterranean, focusing on the understudied intertidal vermetid reef ecosystem. Marked seasonal trends were found in biodiversity, with the highest diversity in winter and spring. Canopy-forming brown algae, dominating the northwestern Mediterranean intertidal reefs, were generally scarce on the reef platform and almost only found in tidepools. Interannual shifts in community structure were driven mostly by sharp fluctuations in a few dominant native and alien species and the regional mass mortality of an Indo-Pacific mussel in summer 2016. Compared to an older macroalgae dataset, dating back to 1973-1995, we found that some warm-affinity (summer) taxa became more dominant and cold-affinity (winter) species less dominant, while one once conspicuous species, Halimeda tuna, completely disappeared. The observed community shifts are probably driven mostly by stressors related to climate change. We encourage forming a network of long-term, multi-site ecological monitoring programs in the Mediterranean to improve our understanding of ecosystem change and to enable making better predictions at the basin scale.

AB We describe the application of the computerized deep learning methodology to the recognition of corals in a shallow reef in the Gulf of Eilat, Red Sea. This project is aimed at applying deep neural network analysis, based on thousands of underwater images, to the automatic recognition of some common species among the 100 species reported to be found in the Eilat coral reefs. This is a challenging task, since even in the same colony, corals exhibit significant within-species morphological variability, in terms of age, depth, current, light, geographic location, and inter-specific competition. Since deep learning procedures are based on photographic images, the task is further challenged by image quality, distance from the object, angle of view, and light conditions. We produced a large dataset of over 5,000 coral images that were classified into 11 species in the present automated deep learning classification scheme. We demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of the method, as compared to painstaking manual classification. Specifically, we demonstrated that this method is readily adaptable to include additional species, thereby providing an excellent tool for future studies in the region, that would allow for real time monitoring the detrimental effects of global climate change and anthropogenic impacts on the coral reefs of the Gulf of Eilat and elsewhere, and that would help assess the success of various bioremediation efforts.

AB Halites, which are typically found in various Atacama locations, are evaporitic rocks that are considered as micro-scaled salterns. Both structural and functional metagenomic analyses of halite nodules were performed. Structural analyses indicated that the halite microbiota is mainly composed of NaCl-adapted microorganisms. In addition, halites appear to harbor a limited diversity of fungal families together with a biodiverse collection of protozoa. Functional analysis indicated that the halite microbiome possesses the capacity to make an extensive contribution to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles, but possess a limited capacity to fix nitrogen. The halite metagenome also contains a vast repertory of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZY) with glycosyl transferases being the most abundant class present, followed by glycosyl hydrolases (GH). Amylases were also present in high abundance, with GH also being identified. Thus, the halite microbiota is a potential useful source of novel enzymes that could have biotechnological applicability. This is the first metagenomic report of fungi and protozoa as endolithobionts of halite nodules, as well as the first attempt to describe the repertoire of CAZY in this community. In addition, we present a comprehensive functional metagenomic analysis of the metabolic capacities of the halite microbiota, providing evidence for the first time on the sulfur cycle in Atacama halites.

AB Body size shapes ecological interactions across and within species, ultimately influencing the evolution of large-scale biodiversity patterns. Therefore, macroecological studies of body size provide a link between spatial variation in selection regimes and the evolution of animal assemblages through space. Multiple hypotheses have been formulated to explain the evolution of spatial gradients of animal body size, predominantly driven by thermal (Bergmann's rule), humidity ('water conservation hypothesis') and resource constraints ('resource rule', 'seasonality rule') on physiological homeostasis. However, while integrative tests of all four hypotheses combined are needed, the focus of such empirical efforts needs to move beyond the traditional endotherm-ectotherm dichotomy, to instead interrogate the role that variation in lifestyles within major lineages (e.g. classes) play in creating neglected scenarios of selection via analyses of largely overlooked environment-body size interactions. Here, we test all four rules above using a global database spanning 99% of modern species of an entire Order of legless, predominantly underground-dwelling amphibians (Gymnophiona, or caecilians). We found a consistent effect of increasing precipitation (and resource abundance) on body size reductions (supporting the water conservation hypothesis), while Bergmann's, the seasonality and resource rules are rejected. We argue that subterranean lifestyles minimize the effects of aboveground selection agents, making humidity a dominant selection pressure - aridity promotes larger body sizes that reduce risk of evaporative dehydration, while smaller sizes occur in wetter environments where dehydration constraints are relaxed. We discuss the links between these principles with the physiological constraints that may have influenced the tropically-restricted global radiation of caecilians.

AB Ecosystem dynamics in monomictic lakes are characterized by seasonal thermal mixing and stratification. These physical processes bring about seasonal variations in nutrients and organic matter fluxes, affecting the biogeochemical processes that occur in the water column. Physical and chemical dynamics are generally reflected in seasonal structural changes in the phytoplankton and bacterio-plankton community. In this study, we analyzed, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, the structure of the bacterial community associated with large particles (> 20 mu m) in Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel), and its associations to phytoplankton populations. The study was carried out during late winter and early spring, a highly dynamic period in terms of thermal mixing, nutrient availability, and shifts in phytoplankton composition. Structural changes in the bacterioplankton population corresponded with limnological variations in the lake. In terms of the entire heterotrophic community, the structural patterns of particle-associated bacteria were mainly correlated with abiotic factors such as pH, ammonia, water temperature and nitrate. However, analysis of microbial taxon-specific correlations with phytoplankton species revealed a strong potential link between specific bacterial populations and the presence of different phytoplankton species, such as the cyanobacterium Microcystis, as well as the dinoflagellates Peridinium and Peridiniopsis. We found that Brevundimonas, a common freshwater genus, and Bdellovibrio, a well-known Gram-negative bacteria predator, were positively associated to Microcystis, suggesting a potentially important role of these three taxa in the microbial ecology of the lake. Our results show that the dynamics of environmental abiotic conditions, rather than specific phytoplankton assemblages, are the main factors positively correlated with changes in the community structure as a whole. Nevertheless, some specific bacteria may interact and be linked with specific phytoplankton, which may potentially control the dynamic patterns of the microbial community.

AB Multiple performance traits in animals can be affected by the same morphological feature. Armaments, or morphological weapons, and ornaments, morphological features used to attract mates, can have important influences on individual fitness. For example, ornaments of aquatic animals that improve fighting abilities or reproductive success can increase drag, resulting in decreased swimming performance. We investigated the effects of chela size on pinching force and escape performance in the western painted crayfish, Faxonius palmeri longimanus (Faxon, 1898). We predicted that individuals with larger chelae would swim more slowly than individuals with smaller chelae, and that males would be disproportionately affected because of male-biased sexual size dimorphism in chela size. We found support for our hypothesis that individuals with larger chelae would swim more slowly, but males and females were equally affected by large chela size, such that the differences in the scaling of chela growth did not correspond with differences in swimming performance for a given size. We also found that increased chela size in females corresponded strongly with increased strength. This was not necessarily the case for males, which exhibit three times as much variance in chela strength for a given chela size than females, potentially suggesting the use of dishonest signaling in this species. Muscle allocation differences between the sexes could also suggest that males can dishonestly signal their competitive abilities, such that weak males can have large chela. Our data support the idea of tradeoffs and lead us to further hypothesize about the roles of different life history strategies within the western painted crayfish.

AB Swimming performance of pregnant live-bearing fish is presumably constrained by the additional drag associated with the reproductive burden. Yet, it is still unclear how and to what extent the reproductive investment affects body drag of the females. We examined the effect of different levels of reproductive investment on body drag. The biggest measured increase in body volume due to pregnancy was about 43%, linked to a wetted area increase of about 16% and 69% for the frontal area. We printed three-dimensional models of live-bearing fish in a straight body posture representing different reproductive allocation (RA) levels. We measured the drag and visualized the flow around these models in a flow tunnel at different speeds. Drag grew in a power fashion with speed and exponentially with the increase of RA, thus drag penalty for becoming thickerwas relatively lowfor lowspeeds compared to high ones. We show that the drag increase with increasing RA was most probably due to bigger regions of flow separation behind the enlarged belly. We suggest that the rising drag penalty with an increasing RA, possibly together with pregnancy-related negative effects on muscle- and abdominal bending performance, will reduce the maximum swimming speed.

AB Human activities cause introduction of alien species to new areas, which may cause serious problems and threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Omayed biosphere reserve (OBR) at the northwestern desert of Egypt, recognized for its rich flora, has recently encountered new human-induced disturbances. The current study sought to identify alien species that might have invaded OBR as a result of such activities; and to estimate the area affected by alien species using remotely-sensed data. Field surveys of 300 sampling plots representing different habitats were conducted from spring 2011 to spring 2014, whereby occurrences of alien plant species were recorded. We evaluated the use of combined environmental and remotely-sensed data for developing predictive distribution models for 21 alien species recorded in the area using Maxent modeling technique. The inclusion spectral predictors with other environmental predictors has improved the performance of the distribution models (mean test AUC 0.88 +/- 0.06) for most of the alien species. Environmental variables that contributed the most to prediction of alien species distribution included soil, elevation and slope; in addition to predictors that represented disturbance proxies such as distance from irrigation canals and distance from roads. The results revealed that more than 40% of the area is predicted to be infested by at least one alien species. Results also manifest the merit of incorporating remotely-sensed data in prediction of alien species distribution, which hold promise for development of proactive management approaches to identify and control areas of high infestation of alien species and prevent further spread of invasive plants.

AB Investigating habitat use and preferences of a threatened species can be challenging, especially if wild populations have decreased to such low numbers that they occupy only fractions of their former natural range. Hence, assessing habitat suitability of a potential release site for a threatened species before a reintroduction attempt can be difficult because frequently no comparable baseline data are available. In these instances, post-release monitoring data can inform about habitat use and preferences of a reintroduced species. Here, we use monitoring data of an endangered endemic island bird, the Chatham Island black robin Petroica traversi, to investigate habitat preferences and the temporal change in distribution patterns across 26years following a reintroduction. We show that densities and distribution of black robin pairs at the reintroduction site have changed significantly over the years. Spatial distribution of pairs is clustered, and this clustering has intensified as the population increased. We used the maximum entropy method MaxEnt to model habitat suitability on the island, showing that black robins clearly prefer forested areas inland that are within 70m to the forest edge at lower elevations (<40m a.s.l.) and on slopes that have a N-NE aspect. The model also identified one area on the island that comprises suitable habitat, but is currently uninhabited. Applying maximum observed densities to the available area of each suitability class, carrying capacity is estimated as 170 nesting pairs across the island, highlighting the need to find further appropriate habitat urgently. Overall, these topographical and habitat preferences considerably restrict this species' potential distribution, a constraint thathas serious conservation implications for future population growth of current populations and (re)introductions to new locations. This study demonstrates that post-release data can reveal relevant limitations to habitat use of highly threatened species.

AB Rising sea levels threaten coastal safety by increasing the risk of flooding. Coastal dunes provide a natural form of coastal protection. Understanding drivers that constrain early development of dunes is necessary to assess whether dune development may keep pace with sea-level rise. In this study, we explored to what extent salt stress experienced by dune building plant species constrains their spatial distribution at the Dutch sandy coast. We conducted a field transplantation experiment and a glasshouse experiment with two dune building grasses Ammophila arenaria and Elytrigia juncea. In the field, we measured salinity and monitored growth of transplanted grasses in four vegetation zones: (I) nonvegetated beach, (II) E.juncea occurring, (III) both species co-occurring, and (IV) A.arenaria dominant. In the glasshouse, we subjected the two species to six soil salinity treatments, with and without salt spray. We monitored biomass, photosynthesis, leaf sodium, and nutrient concentrations over a growing season. The vegetation zones were weakly associated with summer soil salinity; zone I and II were significantly more saline than zones III and IV. Ammophila arenaria performed equally (zone II) or better (zones III, IV) than E.juncea, suggesting soil salinity did not limit species performance. Both species showed severe winter mortality. In the glasshouse, A.arenaria biomass decreased linearly with soil salinity, presumably as a result of osmotic stress. Elytrigia juncea showed a nonlinear response to soil salinity with an optimum at 0.75% soil salinity. Our findings suggest that soil salinity stress either takes place in winter, or that development of vegetated dunes is less sensitive to soil salinity than hitherto expected.

AB Arnold's 1983 path-analytic paradigm, considering "morphology, performance, and fitness," has been elaborated in several ways. For example, current versions recognize the level of "behavior" (including aspects of motivation) as a filter between performance abilities (only measurable if motivation is maximal) and fitness components. Performance abilities constrain behavior, but behavioral choices may shield performance from selection. Conceptual and empirical issues remain, such as the extent to which individual variation in lower-level subordinate traits (e.g., circulating hormone concentrations) might directly affect behavior, growth rates, sexual maturation, etc., rather than having effects only through paths involving some aspect of performance. Moreover, empirical studies have yet to encompass more than a few possible paths in a given system, in part because life-history researchers rarely communicate with those focused on performance. Most life-history studies ponder trade-offs associated with reproductive effort, but studies of locomotor performance (e.g., maximal sprint speed) have rarely considered trade-offs with reproduction. This lack of connection is surprising because both life history (e.g., clutch size) and locomotor performance (e.g., locomotor stamina) traits require allocation of energy and other resources, so trade-offs between these trait types may be expected. These perspectives and cultures could be bridged by a focus on the ability of organisms to perform components of reproductive biology (e.g., lactation performance could be studied in animals maximally "motivated" by manipulation of litter size or endocrine function). Alternatively, one could study impacts of reproduction on performance, as when bats and live-bearing fishes lose maneuverability during gestation. We also consider sperm performance in the context of the paradigm and illustrate that the paradigm can easily be utilized as a frame-work within which to consider key aspects of sperm biology.

AB In freshwater ecosystems, abiotic factors such as flow regime and water quality are considered important predictors of ecosystem invasibility. The aim of this study was to investigate the critical swimming capacity and metabolism of the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, focusing on sex and size effects, to evaluate the influence of water flow on its invasive success. Specimens of mosquitofish were captured from the Ter Vell lagoon (L'Estartit, north-eastern Spain) in July 2014, and we measured the critical swimming speed (U-crit) and oxygen consumption of individual fish (30 females and 30 males) using a mini swim tunnel. The mean U-crit of this poeciliid fish was estimated at 14.11cms(-1) (range=4.85-22.26), which is lower than that of many other fishes of similar size and confirms that this species is limnophilic and its invasive success might be partially explained by hydrologic alterations. However, the U-crit and maximal metabolic rate vary markedly with fish size and sex, with males having much higher values for the same body mass, and thus probably being more resistant to strong water flows. Multiple regression models illustrate that multivariate analyses might increase the predictive power and understanding of swimming performance and metabolic traits, compared to results from conventional simple regressions.

AB Retrospective estimates of historic abundances and distributions of marine organisms are crucial to understanding the anthropogenic impacts on the structure and species of coastal ecosystems, especially in the case of vulnerable species such as the Dugong (Dugong dugon). The Persian/Arabian Gulf is home to the second largest Dugong population in the world, yet little is known about their current or past abundance, distribution, and ecological role. Here, we examine historical changes in dugong distribution and estimate perceived changes in their abundance. We create a dugong discovery curve' and compile global density estimates as proxies for the overall health of the population in the Gulf. We find that since 1950 dugong range may have contracted by one quarter, and despite their large population, their overall densities in the Gulf are far lower than in other areas within their range. Basic understanding of historical trajectories for Dugongs is needed in order to develop appropriate management plans and conservation targets, particularly in light of large and wide-spread coastal development projects in the region.

AB There is increased interest in understanding how stress reduces coral resistance to disturbances and how acclimatization increases the ability of corals to resist future stress. Most extreme low tides at Gorgona Island, which expose reef flats to air, do not appear to negatively affect corals because corals usually do not undergo lethal bleaching during such events. However, coral physiology and fitness may be impacted by this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether corals exposed to air have modified biological functions to resist bleaching. To test this, an extreme low-tide event was simulated in the field. Colonies of Pocillopora damicornis were exposed to air for 15 or 40 min over the course of one, two, or three consecutive days. This procedure was repeated for one to three months. Colonies of P. damicornis exposed to air had reduced fecundity, decreased zooxanthellae density, and changed color from darker to lighter. However, the growth rate of exposed corals was similar to that of non-exposed colonies. We conclude that short periods of subaerial exposure during extreme low tides are not lethal to P. damicornis, but negatively affect sexual reproduction, which might have deleterious effects at the population level. The periodic occurrence of extreme low tides in the tropical eastern Pacific may be one factor responsible for the high rate of asexual reproduction (e.g., fragmentation) in pocilloporid corals of this region.

AB Bergmann's rule states that organisms at higher latitudes should be larger and thicker than those closer to the equator to better conserve heat, and Allen's rule states that they will have shorter and thicker limbs at higher latitudes. Alternative explanations for latitudinal size clines include plant productivity and seasonality. The rules generally hold in endotherms, but in insects different species within the same genus can respond to latitude in unpredictable ways. We present the first biogeographical analysis of these rules in stick insects (order Phasmatodea), using four European species. Their long and thin bauplan makes the Phasmatodea ideal for ecomorphological studies of body length, which could identify the evolutionary drivers of their remarkable size range (including the world's longest insects). Using preserved specimens from collections across Europe; body segment and limb measurements were taken for both genders of the species Bacillus rossius, Clonopsis gallica, Leptynia attenuata, and Pijnackeria hispanica. Lengths and volumetric features were compared to latitude as well as annual mean temperature, net primary productivity, and annual growing degree days, using weighted linear regressions and ANOVA analyses. At lower latitudes/higher temperatures, B. rossius and L. attenuata had longer limbs [Allen clines] and were larger bodied and/or longer [converse-Bergmann clines], while the other species did not show latitudinal clines per se. This matches what was predicted based on closely related insects and the presence of large Phasmatodea in the tropics, but violates the temperature-size rule. Most variation in size could be attributed to temperature, but untested factors could also play a role Whether these ecogeographic rules hold true for tropical Phasmatodea and whether genetics or environment play are more important in determining adult length are topics for future research.

AB Connectivity among individual marine protected areas (MPAs) is one of the most important considerations in the design of integrated MPA networks. To provide such information for managers in Hawaii, USA, a numerical circulation model was developed to determine the role of ocean currents in transporting coral larvae from natal reefs throughout the high volcanic islands of the Maui Nui island complex in the southeastern Hawaiian Archipelago. Spatially- and temporally-varying wind, wave, and circulation model outputs were used to drive a km-scale, 3-dimensional, physics based circulation model for Maui Nui. The model was calibrated and validated using satellite-tracked ocean surface current drifters deployed during coral-spawning conditions, then used to simulate the movement of the larvae of the dominant reef-building coral. Porites compressa, from 17 reefs during eight spawning events in 2010-2013. These simulations make it possible to investigate not only the general dispersal patterns from individual coral reefs, but also how anomalous conditions during individual spawning events can result in large deviations from those general patterns. These data also help identify those reefs that are dominated by self-seeding and those where self-seeding is limited to determine their relative susceptibility to stressors and potential roadblocks to recovery. Overall, the numerical model results indicate that many of the coral reefs in Maui Nui seed reefs on adjacent islands, demonstrating the interconnected nature of the coral reefs in Maui Nui and providing a key component of the scientific underpinning essential for the design of a mutually supportive network of MPAs to enhance conservation of coral reefs.

AB In the Wadden Sea, mussel beds self-organise into spatial patterns consisting of bands parallel to the shore. A leading explanation for this phenomenon is that mussel aggregation reduces losses from dislodgement and predation, because of the adherence of mussels to one another. Previous mathematical modelling has shown that this can lead to spatial patterning when it is coupled to the advection from the open sea of algae the main food source for mussels in the Wadden Sea. A complicating factor in this process is that the advection of algae will actually oscillate with the tidal flow. This has been excluded from previous modelling studies, and the present paper concerns the implications of this oscillation for pattern formation. The authors initially consider piecewise constant ("square-tooth") oscillations in advection, which enables analytical investigation of the conditions for pattern formation. They then build on this to study the more realistic case of sinusoidal oscillations. Their analysis shows that future research on the details of pattern formation in mussel beds will require an in-depth understanding of how the tides affect long-range inhibition among mussels.

AB Hypersaline habitats are present all over the globe in the form of saline soil, saline water and salted food. Some of the more famous hypersaline habitats are the Dead Sea (Jordan-Israel), the Great Salt Lake (USA), the Solar Lake and lakes at Natrun valley (Egypt), and the inland saltern of La Mala (Spain). Halophilic microorganisms can be classified into halophilic algae, bacteria and fungi, while the halophilic bacteria are further classified into extremely halophilic bacteria, moderately halophilic bacteria, moderately halophilic eubacteria and moderately halophilic archaeobacteria. Two kinds of mechanisms, known as 'salt in' and 'low salt in', are typically exhibited by halophilic microorganisms in their adaptation to high salt concentrations. Several reports have suggested that halophilic microorganisms can be polyextremophilic. Evaluating the physiology of halophilic microorganisms and their adaptation to the environment allows a better understanding of the extremophilic characteristics of the microorganisms. Halophiles have been used in a number of biotechnological applications, making them an interesting and important choice of research topic in this era of biotechnology. This review is an attempt to give a basic understanding of halophilic microorganisms, their habitats, adaptation, as well as their importance in the current biotechnological developments.

AB Freshwater cyanobacteria are hardly used as biological indicators of anthropogenic pressures, possibly for two main reasons: (a) their response to anthropogenic pressures is often poorly known; (b) reliably identifying cyanobacteria species is a challenge for technicians and researchers. We assessed the usefulness of cyanobacteria species as biological indicators of two human stressors: the high orthophosphate input from urban wastewaters; the high nitrate concentration produced by agricultural land use. We analysed variation in benthic cyanobacterial assemblages at 85 sites in South-Central Spain as a response to eight environmental variables: pH, conductivity, temperature, altitude, nitrate, orthophosphate, irrigation land use and non-irrigation land use.
   Results revealed that conductivity was the main environmental factor that contributed to differences between assemblages. Orthophosphate was more influential for community composition than nitrate. Changes in species composition related to human pressures suggested that some cyanobacteria species (e.g. Nostoc verrucosum, Phormidium autumnale, Plectonema tomasinianum, Rivularia haematites, Tolypothrix distorta) could be useful tools for the bioindication of anthropogenic pressures; while others species provide more information about natural physicochemical reference conditions (Nostoc caeruleum, Phormidium fonticola). Further research into cyanobacteria and macroalgae assemblages in different impacted scenarios could help improve macrophyte indices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We analyse the model for vegetation growth in a semi-arid landscape proposed by von Hardenberg et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 87:198101, 2001), which consists of two parabolic partial differential equations that describe the evolution in space and time of the water content of the soil and the level of vegetation. This model is a generalisation of one proposed by Klausmeier but it contains additional terms that capture additional physical effects. By considering the limit in which the diffusion of water in the soil is much faster than the spread of vegetation, we reduce the system to an asymptotically simpler parabolic-elliptic system of equations that describes small amplitude instabilities of the uniform vegetated state. We carry out a thorough weakly nonlinear analysis to investigate bifurcations and pattern formation in the reduced model. We find that the pattern forming instabilities are subcritical except in a small region of parameter space. In the original model at large amplitude there are localised solutions, organised by homoclinic snaking curves. The resulting bifurcation structure is well known from other models for pattern forming systems. Taken together our results describe how the von Hardenberg model displays a sequence of (often hysteretic) transitions from a non-vegetated state, to localised patches of vegetation that exist with uniform low-level vegetation, to periodic patterns, to higher-level uniform vegetation as the precipitation parameter increases.

AB Long-term data with high-precision chronology are essential to elucidate past ecological changes on coral reefs beyond the period of modern-day monitoring programs. In 2012 we revisited two inshore reefs within the central Great Barrier Reef, where a series of historical photographs document a loss of hard coral cover between c.1890-1994 AD. Here we use an integrated approach that includes high-precision U-Th dating specifically tailored for determining the age of extremely young corals to provide a robust, objective characterisation of ecological transition. The timing of mortality for most of the dead in situ corals sampled from the historical photograph locations was found to coincide with major flood events in 1990-1991 at Bramston Reef and 1970 and 2008 at Stone Island. Evidence of some recovery was found at Bramston Reef with living coral genera similar to what was described in c.1890 present in 2012. In contrast, very little sign of coral re-establishment was found at Stone Island suggesting delayed recovery. These results provide a valuable reference point for managers to continue monitoring the recovery (or lack thereof) of coral communities at these reefs.

AB A long sedimentary core has been recently retrieved from the Dead Sea Basin (DSB) within the framework of the ICDP-sponsored Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project. Contrasting climatic intervals were evident by distinctive lithological facies such as laminated aragonitic muds and evaporites. A geomicrobiological investigation was conducted in representative sediments of this core. To identify the microbial assemblages present in the sediments and their evolution with changing depositional environments through time, the diversity of the 16S rRNA gene was analyzed in gypsum, aragonitic laminae, and halite samples. The subsurface microbial community was largely dominated by the Euryarchaeota phylum (Archaea). Within the latter, Halobacteriaceae members were ubiquitous, probably favored by their high salt-in' osmotic adaptation which also makes them one of the rare inhabitants of the modern Dead Sea. Bacterial community members were scarce, emphasizing that the low salt-in' strategy is less suitable in this environment. Substantial differences in assemblages are observed between aragonitic sediments and gypsum-halite ones, independently of the depth and salinity. The aragonite sample, deposited during humid periods when the lake was stratified, consists mostly of the archaeal MSBL1 and bacterial KB1 Candidate Divisions. This consortium probably relies on compatible solutes supplied from the lake by halotolerant species present in these more favorable periods. In contrast, members of the Halobacteriaceae were the sole habitants of the gypsum-halite sediments which result from a holomictic lake. Although the biomass is low, these variations in the observed subsurface microbial populations appear to be controlled by biological conditions in the water column at the time of sedimentation, and subsequently by the presence or absence of stratification and dilution in the lake. As the latter are controlled by climatic changes, our data suggest a relationship between local lacustrine subsurface microbial assemblages and large-scale climatic variations over the Dead Sea Basin.

AB Sex-specific colour polymorphisms have been extensively documented in many different taxa. When polymorphism in colour pattern is restricted to females, the condition is known as female-limited pattern polymorphism (FPP), which has been less commonly addressed in vertebrates. FPP is present in several lizard species, although most research on lizards has focused on carotenoid- and pteridine-based coloration and not on melanin-based polymorphisms. In the present study, we focus on Iberian wall lizards, Podarcis hispanicus, where two female melanin-based dorsal patterns can be clearly distinguished: striped and reticulated-blotched. We indirectly tested the hypothesis that selection acts differentially among P.hispanicus female morphs to create alternative morph-specific phenotypic optima at different levels by investigating whether morphs differ in fitness proxies. We specifically examined whether the two female dorsal pattern morphs differed in adult morphology, dorsal coloration, immune response, reproductive investment, and growth. We did not find a relationship between melanin-based coloration and hatchling growth and immune response, despite a correlation between these traits possibly being expected as a result of pleiotropy in the melanocortin system. However, our results show that female dorsal morphs in P.hispanicus differ in terms of adult morphology, dorsal coloration, and reproductive investment. Reticulated-blotched P.hispanicus females had deeper heads and longer femora, less melanin, and more brownish coloration, and also had larger and heavier hatchlings than striped females.

AB Self-organizing systems rely on positive feedback (amplification of perturbations). In particular, in swarm systems, positive feedback builds up in a transient phase until maximal positive feedback is reached and the system converges temporarily on a state close to consensus. We investigate two examples of swarm systems showing time-variant positive feedback: alignment in locust swarms and adaptive aggregation of swarms. We identify an influencing bias in the spatial distribution of agents compared to a well-mixed distribution and two features, percentage of aligned swarm members and neighborhood size, that allow us to model the time variance of feedbacks. We report an urn model that is capable of qualitatively representing all these relevant features. The increase in neighborhood sizes over time enables the swarm to lock in a highly aligned state but also allows for infrequent switching between lock-in states. We report similar occurrences of time-variant feedback in a second collective system to indicate the potential for generality of this phenomenon. Our study is concluded by applications of methods from renormalization group theory that allow us to focus on the neighborhood dynamics as scale transformations. Correlation lengths and critical exponents are determined empirically.

AB Stress gradient hypothesis predicted that facilitative interactions usually increase in intensity and are importance with abiotic stress. By contrast, facilitation may be lost in time, when it involves the growth of benefactors or beneficiaries. Less is known about which response pattern is more common in arid desert. We present an empirical study to explore shrub-annual interactions at the community and individual level along the course of a single growing season in a desert steppe in northwest China. Here the severity of drought stress may increase in time due to uneven precipitation during plant growing season. We assessed growth responses of annuals in understory where two dominant shrubs were removed. Annuals responses showed a switch from weakly positive to more strongly positive beneath Calligonum mongolicum, whereas from positive to negative beneath Nitraria sphaerocarpa during the growing season. Additionally, annual species with contrasting functional traits showed distinct growth responses to canopies removal. There was evidence of an increase in soil moisture below the canopy of shrubs, but a decrease in potential evaporation rate and photosynthetically active radiation, which can partly explain these species-specific responses. We conclude that the balance between competitive and facilitative effects in shrub-annual interactions is not only governed by the severity of stress but also determined by plant traits, such as canopy structure of shrubs and functional traits of their understory annuals.

AB The software architecture community has advocated design rationale in the last decade. However, there is little knowledge of how much reasoning is performed when software design judgments are made. In this study, we investigated the amount of design reasoning performed before making a decision. We recruited 32 students and 40 professionals to participate in this software architecture design study. We found that most subjects needed only a few reasons before making their decisions. They considered that giving a few reasons were good enough to judge despite that more reasons could be found. This result shows a satisficing behavior in design decision making. We explore the implications of this common behavior on software architecture design.

AB In this study we expanded a recently developed approach for defining acceptable levels of management policy that will allow sustainable management of water quality in a lake ecosystem. A three dimensional solution space was created to define all acceptable scenarios of N loads, P loads and lake water level (WL) thus providing an integrated tool for defining the extent of measures that will allow lake ecosystem sustainability. The approach included use of a lake ecosystem model, a quantitative system of composite water quality indices (CWQIs) and defined sustainability criteria for the ecosystem. The approach was tested on the Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) ecosystem and succeeded in defining the range of acceptable management policy through the use of long term simulations of different scenarios. Using the results of the scenarios, a number of polygons were created, defined as relative solution domain area (RSDA), which denote the permissible ranges of nutrient loads at different water levels. The polygon, and hence RSDA, boundaries represent critical values of nutrient loads allowing conservation of the lake water quality at each WL. By integrating all RSDA, a three dimensional solution space was created which defines all acceptable ranges of N loads, P loads and WL thus providing lake managers with an integrated tool for defining the extent of measures that will allow sustainability of the lake ecosystem. This novel approach is unique, and presents an example of implementation of a management tool that integrates an ecosystem model, multiple stressors and quantified water quality indices to determine limits of management actions. This approach may well be implemented to other lakes around the world suffering from water quality deterioration as a result of changes in water level and nutrients loads. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Models of risk-taking typically assume that the variability of outcomes is important in the likelihood of making a risky choice. In an animal model of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), within-session variability, or the coefficient of variability (CV), was found to be a novel predictor of behavior (Jentsch et al., 2010). Human studies have not investigated how BART performance differs when using the CV versus a traditional BART measure (e.g., number of pumps). This study sought to determine whether the CV provides a unique and valuable alternative index of risk-taking on the BART, and to determine the relationship of the CV to self-reported alcohol consumption. Young adult heavy drinkers (n = 58, 72% male, mean age 21.53) completed an assessment of drinking patterns and a modified version of the BART. Multiple regression results indicated that CV is a unique predictor of total explosions and total money earned on the BART. Higher levels of variability were associated with fewer explosions but less money earned, whereas more pumps was associated with more explosions but more money. Higher CV was also associated with lower lifetime and past 3 months peak drinking quantity, higher levels of self-efficacy to control drinking, and lower levels of drinking acceptability (i.e., injunctive norms). Total pumps was associated with higher lifetime peak drinking, lower self-efficacy to control drinking, and higher levels drinking acceptability. Overall, the CV can provide an alternative method of assessing BART performance and the association of risk-taking with drinking patterns.

AB Different environments are expected to exert differential selective pressures, often generating distinct sets of traits in organisms inhabiting different geographic regions. Starvation endurance is an important trait for organisms in harsh (i.e., extreme climate and/or biotically poor) and unpredictable environments. This is especially true for sit-and-wait predators, such as antlions, which experience stronger fluctuations in prey arrivals than do actively searching predators. We conducted an experimental comparison of starvation endurance in pit-building antlions, originating from semi-arid and hyper-arid environments. We hypothesized that individuals from the climatically harsher and biotically poor environment (i.e., hyper-arid) should be better adapted to endure long starvation periods. Additionally, we posited that faster-growing individuals are expected to be more sensitive to starvation because of their need to sustain higher metabolic rates. We found that antlions originating from the semi-arid region maintained higher activity levels, which led to slightly higher mass loss rates during starvation, but enabled faster recovery when food supply was renewed. Conversely, antlions originating from the hyper-arid region had lower activity levels, consistent with their lower rate of mass loss during starvation, but this came at the expense of decreased response to prey and lower growth rate when food became available again. Each strategy holds its advantages for coping with long starvation periods, and we cannot say decisively which strategy is better. Results from both regions were consistent with the predictions of the growth compensation phenomenon: antlions that were fed less frequently pre-starvation grew at faster rates when food supply was renewed. Our study demonstrates that individuals originating from different environments adopt different strategies in order to endure starvation, exemplifying antlions' ability to compensate for mass lost during starvation.

AB A project to reintroduce the Spanish imperial eagle in the province of Cadiz (Andalusia, Spain) began in 2002. The aim was to restore the former breeding nucleus, to encourage subpopulation interconnection and to ensure the long-term persistence of the southern metapopulation of this endemic Iberian species. A population reinforcement programme also began in 2005 at a location in the Donana area (Andalusia, Spain) to improve the viability of this endangered subpopulation. Between 2002 and 2010, a total of 73 young Spanish imperial eagles were released at these four locations by means of hacking. As a result, in 2010 a released male bred successfully with a non-reintroduced female and two young were reared. This was the first successful breeding event recorded in Cadiz province since 1960. An additional territorial pair also settled in the release area in 2010 and four more translocated individuals have made breeding attempts within nearby breeding subpopulations since 2006. The settlement and breeding of reintroduced individuals is the starting point of a future population and constitutes a relevant indicator for the evaluation of the project.

AB A set of satellite images of chlorophyll a concentration for Lake Kinneret (Israel) from the period February to April 2007 captured the temporal evolution of horizontal patchiness that developed during the typical spring bloom of the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense. Narrow bands of high concentration located adjacent to the shoreline at the start of the bloom were followed by progressive propagation of this high-concentration region from the shoreline toward the center of the lake as the bloom proceeded. A three-dimensional (3-D) hydrodynamic numerical model and an analytical model for a flat-bottomed elliptical basin together explain the observed phenomenon. The spatial structure of Kelvin waves, which were demonstrated to most likely be present in February and April due to resonance, produced regions of high velocity gradient, contributing to horizontal dispersion close to the shoreline. This region of high dispersion was narrow and close to the shoreline at the start of the bloom when the Burger number was relatively small, but it widened over the course of the season as the Burger number increased due to increasing stratification. In addition, an increase in the dispersion rate with time in the lake interior was inferred from numerical simulation due to increasing wind speeds and a thinner surface layer. Physical processes, in this case, horizontal dispersion as a result of both Kelvin waves and wind, can play an important role in governing the dynamics and spatial evolution of dinoflagellate blooms in lakes.

AB As natural ecosystems provide the material basis and fundamental support for regional sustainable development, the sustainability of natural ecosystems is an important prerequisite and a viable approach for the achievement of regional sustainable development. It is also the final criteria to assess whether sustainable development paradigm is successful. Along with the increasing impacts of human activities on natural ecosystems, the evaluation of regional ecological sustainability has become one of the key issues for research on macro ecology and sustainable development. Based on different unit of indicators, this study firstly groups the evaluation frameworks of regional ecological sustainability into three major types: comprehensive index evaluation with dimensionless unit, monetary valuation, and biophysical quantity measurement. We then discuss and compare these types in terms of basic principles, scope of applications, advantages and shortcomings. Finally, drawn on the discussion about characteristics of ecological sustainability, we outline the current trend and future directions of regional ecological sustainability evaluation, for instance, transition from sustainable development evaluation to sustainability science, integration of goal-oriented and problem-solving approaches, combination of spatial pattern analysis and ecological sustainability evaluation, and enhancement of ecological sustainability evaluation at landscape scale.

AB Climate change may be one of the greatest environmental catastrophes encountered by modern human civilization. The potential influence of this global disaster on wildlife populations is subject to question. I interpolated how seasonal variation in weather patterns influences growth and reproduction in the Blanchard's cricket frog (Acris blanchardi). Then I extrapolated the influence of future climate conditions on these life history characteristics using fuzzy regression. Fuzzy regression was an accurate predictor of growth and reproduction based on the climate conditions present from 1900-2007. It predicted that the climate projections expected for Arkansas by 2100 could reduce total reproductive investment in the Blanchard's cricket frog by 33-94%. If these results reflect responses by other poikilotherms, climate change could induce major population declines in many species. Because poikilotherms represent the vast majority of vertebrates and significant ecosystem components, it is imperative that we implement strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and circumvent this possible catastrophe.

AB Sustainability impact assessment tools aim at optimising the development of policy measures. Here, we present an approach to designing policies for multifunctional land use with application to Europe and its regions. After the 35 environmental, social and economic impact issues of the European Impact Assessment Guidelines were reviewed on the basis of spatiotemporal indicators at both the top-down Europe-wide and bottom-up intra-regional resolution level, cluster analysis identified classes with specific sustainability characteristics and thus regions most likely facing similar sustainability problems. Sensitive region types such as post-industrial zones, mountains, coasts and islands were analysed separately. The results of the cluster analysis were tested against evidence-based information such as UNEP priorities and regional stakeholder evidence. Stakeholder evidence was specifically explored for the land use policy 'bioenergy promotion' in Lusatia, Germany. We concluded that these top-down and bottom-up spatiotemporal data classifications with cluster analysis represent useful ex-ante impact assessment tools and need to be supplemented by participatory assessments. This procedure with top-down and bottom-up data analysis, and also participatory evidence, provide a valuable three-step sustainability impact assessment approach in policy making.

AB We investigated the effect of body size, parental behaviour and timing of breeding on the chick growth and energetics of three precocial shorebird (Charadrii) species in a warm sub-tropical environment: the Kittlitz's Plover Charadrius pecuarius, Blacksmith Lapwing Vanellus armatus, and Crowned Lapwing V. coronatus. The three species exhibited slower growth, longer pre-fledging periods and lower energy expenditure during the pre-fledging period than Arctic and temperate zone relatives of similar size. It was found that relative growth rates of charadriid and scolopacid species increased by 1.77% per degree latitude. Blacksmith and Crowned Lapwings are of similar size (i.e. about 160 g), about four times the mass of Kittlitz's Plovers. Taking body mass into account, the resting metabolic rate and daily energy expenditure of the three study species were similar. The relative amounts of energy needed for chicks to grow from a hatchling to a fledgling were low for the three species studied. The relative amount of energy needed to complete growth in charadriid and scolopacid species increased by 2.54% per degree latitude. Because Crowned Lapwings exhibited faster growth than Blacksmith Lapwings but similar daily energy expenditure we suggest that Blacksmith Lapwings compensate for greater energy expenditure in colder weather by growing more slowly. We suggest that small growth rate coefficient, low resting metabolic rate and low daily energy expenditure are adaptations to lower food availability and milder ambient temperatures in sub-tropical breeding habitats compared to temperate or Arctic regions.

AB When reproductive success is constant in one breeding phase, different tactics that increase variation in reproductive success among individuals may evolve in other phases. For instance, in shorebirds, which usually have a limited clutch size of four eggs, variation in reproductive tactics among individuals is expected either before egg-laying (e.g. diverse mating systems) or after hatching of the young (e.g. diverse parental care). In this paper, I studied the pied avocet (Recurvirostra avosetta), a shorebird with a modal clutch size of four eggs, to test whether post-hatch chick adoption as an alternative tactic can be linked to increased variation in annual reproductive success. When predation was high, naturally adopting pairs produced more filial fledglings than did pairs not adopting chicks and not losing chicks to adoption. The number of filial fledglings increased with the number of adopted young, possibly through diluting the chances of predation on filial young. Experimental chick addition did not lead to more fledged young due to low brood integrity as shown by the frequent loss of chicks from some experimental broods. When predation was low, larger broods occupied feeding territories with higher prey abundance than smaller broods, possibly due to their dominance over smaller ones. Pairs that lost chicks to adoption (donors) fledged as many filial young in their broods as did non-adopters/non-donors, whereas the total number of donors' filial fledglings, including those raised in adopting broods, approached that of adopters. These findings show, for the first time, that post-hatch alternative reproductive tactics can lead to variation in annual reproductive success and to higher success for some pairs even in species where past adaptations limit variation in reproductive success in a certain phase of reproduction.

AB Spatial and seasonal patterns of seed removal by rodents, ants and birds were evaluated using seed-dish experiments in a Trachypogon savanna in Venezuela. Four-day experiments were conducted on three dates and at four different sites. Seeds from 10 native plant species representing a broad mass range were offered at densities equivalent to 3145 seeds m(-2). We found that total seed removal and relative importance of granivorous groups varied widely among sites and dates. Rodents were the major seed predators in all the habitats, except for the savanna/forest border where birds dominated. Ants removed more seeds than birds, but since they preferred the smallest seeds, ants ranked last in mass removed. We found a temporally variable relationship between seed removal rates and seed rain or seed bank. We inferred monthly seed predation from seed-dish experiments as well as through the decline of the seed bank in the environment during the dry season, and compared both estimations to evaluate the suitability of the seed-dish technique for estimating granivory. We initially hypothesized that seed-dish experiments that emulate seed availability more closely may yield a better estimate of seed predation, but in fact, they may still overestimate granivory intensity.

AB Fringing coral reefs along coastlines experiencing rapid development and human population growth have declined worldwide because of human activity and of natural causes. The "Mayan Riviera" in Quintana Roo, Mexico, attracts large numbers of tourists in part because it still retains some of the natural diversity and it is important to obtain baseline information to monitor changes over time in the area. In this paper, the condition of the stony corals in the developing coastline of the Akumal-area fore reefs is characterized at the start of the new millennium at two depths, and along an inferred sedimentation gradient. Transect surveys were conducted in five fringing reefs starting at haphazardly chosen points. with respect to species composition, live cover, colony density, relative exposure to TAS mats and, for one species (Diploria strigosa, Dana, 1848), tissue regression rates in the presence of TAS mats. Fish population density and herbivory rates are also assessed. Data from line intercept transects (n=74) show that live stony coral cover, density and relative peripheral exposure of colonies to turf algal/sediment (TAS) mats were inversely related to an inferred sediment stress gradient at 13m. In 2000, live stony coral cover had decreased by 40-50% at two sites studied in 1990 by Munoz-Chagin and de la Cruz-Aguero (1993). About half of this loss apparently occurred between 1998 and 2000 during an outbreak of white plague disease that mostly affected Montastraca faveolata, and M annularis. At a 13 m site, where inferred sedimentation rates are relatively high, time series photography of tagged Diploria strigosa, (n=38) showed an average loss of 70 cm 2 of live tissue/coral/year to encroachment by TAS mats during the same period. Whereas densities of carnivorous fishes and herbivores (echinoids, scarids, acanthurids and Microspathodon chrvsurus) in 2000 were low in belt transects at 10-19 m (n=106), turf-algal gardening pomacentrids were relatively common on these reefs.

AB Effective management of rangelands requires the development of landscape-scale models for predicting spatial and temporal variability of forage. In the Magellanic tussock steppes, as in other cold-temperate regions, grazing capacity is dependent on the winter season. To develop a management tool for the region, we analysed links between winter forage availability, weather, stocking rate and vegetation structure. We studied four paddocks over five years with a range of stocking rates from 0 to 1.53 sheep.ha(-1). We sampled forb and non-tussock graminoid biomass, vegetation structure and faecal pellet abundance at the end of each summer. Daily temperature and rainfall data were also recorded. A regression model explained the amount of winter forage as a positive function of graminoid cover, spring minimum temperature, annual precipitation and a negative function of dwarf shrub canopy, bare soil and stocking rate (R-2 = 0.59). Interactions of structural variables with precipitation and stocking rate were detected, indicating strong fluctuations of forage availability in lawn communities dominated by short graminoids. The most probable causes of this response would be higher utilisation and lack of canopy structure. Our results illustrate how maps of vegetation structure, obtainable from satellite images, with weather and stocking rate data could be used for predicting optimal stocking rates in large, heterogeneous sheep paddocks.

AB Using behavioural bioassays, we measure the cost of both inter- and intraspecific competition to a foraging gerbil, Gerbillus allenbyi. The bioassay is the amount of foraging activity in field enclosures of 2 ha, and the difference between foraging activity in an experimentally manipulated 1-ha subplot compared to the matched, unmanipulated twin hectare next to it. The bioassay depends on assuming that natural selection has fitted the gerbils to assess the comparative values of feeding opportunities and competitive pressures, although these occur in different currencies. The gerbils perform quantitatively and consistently, smoothly adjusting their foraging effort to the combination of disparate opportunities and costs. Measuring their responses as behaviour allowed us to estimate the costs of competition in the currency of energy flow, that is, the rate at which we experimentally add seeds to subplots.

AB I use a co-evolutionary model to investigate the co-existence of species in ecological and evolutionary time in an environment that comprises a continuum of habitat heterogeneity. The model considers the ecology and evolution of communities organized by a trade-off in foraging costs over the environmental continuum. I assume that foragers use an optimal patch departure rule for depleting environments, where the rule itself depends on both the habitat and the forager's phenotype, which is a heritable evolutionary strategy. I consider the effects of three variables on co-evolutionarily stable co-existence: (I) travel cost, (2) maintenance and replacement cost, and (3) the range of habitat heterogeneity. When travel cost is positive, it, as well as the other two variables, affects species richness. Increasing either travel cost or maintenance cost results in a decrease in richness. Increasing habitat heterogeneity can increase species richness.

AB Nitrite (NO2-) concentrations in the upper waters of N polluted Onondaga Lake, New York, are documented for the April through October interval for a 10-yr (1989-1998) period. Inputs of NO2- from a domestic waste treatment facility (METRO) and tributaries (4) to the lake are quantified for four of the gears (1991-1994). The NO2- concentrations measured in Onondaga Lake (e.g., annual maxima in the range 200-1000 mg N m(-3)) are some of the highest reported for lakes and rivers in the literature. These levels represent severe violations of toxicity standards. Annual average concentrations in the METRO effluent ranged from 412 to 1097 mg N m(-3). The METRO load represented >90% of the total external NO2- load to the lake. A mechanistic mass balance model for NO2- and NO3- is developed and applied for the lake to identify occurrences, and quantify the rates, of the first and second stages of nitrification. Nitrite is found to behave in a nearly conservative manner in the upper waters of the lake over the April to July interval. The progressive increases in concentrations over this interval have been largely in response to inputs from METRO. Major deviations from conservative behavior occurred for NO2- in most years over the July to October interval as a result of the irregular operation of the two stages of the nitrification process. This has been manifested as large and abrupt changes in NO2- concentration in the July to October interval, Potential factors responsible for the observed dynamics in nitrification and the NO2- pool are considered.

AB Natural populations of the evergreen shrub, Thymelaea hirsuta (L.) Endl., were studied over 6 years at five desert habitats, in terms of seedling recruitment and adult survival and as a function of plant size and gender class. Habitat and time significantly influenced mortality of both reproductive and non-reproductive plants. Plant size also significantly affected adult mortality. Seedling recruitment varied significantly with habitat and year and approached zero some years. Significant among-year and among-population variation in population growth rates were observed over the 6 years of study, and all populations declined in size (ranging from -1.7% per year at the coastal dune site to -10.9% per year at the inland plateau site). Spearman rank correlation analysis between habitats ranked according to a north-south gradient and demographic variables indicates that this gradient is associated with a pattern of lower seedling emergence and survival and a lower population growth rate and greater mortality for all size-classes of Thymelaea plants. In experimental botanic garden plots, germination of seed collected from five natural populations, and seedling survival in the following year were assessed under conditions of high, medium, and low seedling density. Seedling emergency differed significantly according to maternal habitat. With regular watering, seeding survival to one year was 72% (averaged across habitats and densities). This compares with 64% for seedlings grown at the highest density, suggesting that the intense mortality observed under field conditions is more likely to be a result of water shortage than intraspecific competition.

AB LANDSAT images of the Dead Sea, collected in May 1991 and in April and June 1992, were analyzed to obtain spatial and temporal information on the development of a bloom of unicellular green halophilic algae Dunaliella parva and red halophilic Archaea. While the bacterial carotenoids did not produce a recognizable signal in the images, the presence of chlorophyll-containing algae in high densities in April 1992 was easily detected. The image obtained at the time of the onset of the bloom suggested that the algal bloom originated at the shallow areas near the shore of the lake, and was probably derived from resting cells that survived near the surface of the sediment. Information was also obtained on the mode of mixing of Dead Sea brines with freshwater from the Jordan River and from freshwater springs.

ID SPECIES-DIVERSITY; DISTURBANCE; COMMUNITY; MAINTENANCE; PATTERNS
AB Patterns of the distribution of intertidal fauna in relation to the diversity of habitats were studied in the UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) reserve of the archipelago of Molene and Ouessant (west Brittany, France). A classification of environmental features was developed in order to determine species richness, abundance, biomass and trophic structure of the macrobenthic fauna in this intertidal area which covers 1120 ha. The four descriptors of the environment were: (1) substratum (rock, boulders, sediment, pebbles); (2) height on the shore, based on the macrophytic zones: Pelvetia canaliculata/Fucus spiralis; Flints vesiculosus/Ascophyllum nodosum; Fucus serratus; and Himanthalia elongata/Zostera marina; (3) wave exposure (sheltered, semi-sheltered, exposed); (4) percentage of algal cover (<50%, >50%). Each type was defined by a four-figure number and matched to a map codification. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a posteriori Newman-Keuls test (P=0.05) were applied to the series of species richness and biomass. Among the 308 species sampled, 40 represented 90% of the total biomass. Maximal number of species was reached ir,boulder fields in the Himanthalia zone, under exposed conditions and high algal cover. The lowest number of species was observed in pebble fields of the Pelvetia zone and in the sedimentary areas. Trophic structures were dominated by suspension feeders and herbivores at high levels on the shore and by carnivores at the lowest levels, High vegetation cover and wave-exposed conditions were shown to increase with increasing faunal diversity. Links between patterns of habitat distribution and faunal diversity and biomass in different spatial scales are discussed.

AB Linear programming models of diet selection (LP) have been criticized as being too sensitive to variations in parameter values that have not been or may not be able to be measured with a high degree of precision (small standard error). Therefore, LP's predictions have been questioned, even though the predicted diet choices agree very well with observations in 400 published tests. The philosophical and statistical aspects of this criticism of LP are reviewed in light of the ability to test any nontrivial ecological theory. It is argued that measures of error in field data may not meet simple statistical definitions, and thereby, may make sensitivity analyses that use the error measures overly conservative. Furthermore, the important issue in testing ecological theory may not be the statistical confidence in a single test, but whether or not the theory withstands repeated tests.

AB The small mammal community in Acacia savanna consists of three omnivorous nocturnal rodent species, Mastomys natalensis, Saccostomus campestris and Aethomys chrysophilus, which eat varying proportions of seed in their diet.  From a seed removal experiment, it was found that rodents preferentially selected Acacia tortilis seeds.  The annual Acacia seed consumption by rodents in a South African savanna ecosystem was analysed by using estimates of rodent population densities, diet composition, seed predation by captive rodents and published estimates of field metabolic rates.  Total seed consumption was estimated to represent 1,6-4,1% of the annual seed crop of A. tortilis, 0,7-0,9% of the annual seed crop of A. nilotica and 9,3-25,0% of the annual seed crop of A. karroo.  Granivory of A. nilotica seeds by rodents may have a negligible effect upon seedling recruitment.  However, rodent predation of A. tortilis and A. karroo seeds may have important implications on seed survival and later seedling recruitment.

AB The interaction between plants and herbivores is positive if it promotes overcompensation of biomass grazed and increases in plant reproductive potential or negative if it reduces plant survival and reproductive success. This study evaluates the effect of clipping variation on productivity and survival of individual plants of Indigofera spinosa (Forsk.) Matthew. Plant clippings were established at five browse classes: 0 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 %. In post-clipping experiments, regrowth biomass was defoliated to simulate livestock grazing during: (1) the dormancy season, (2) the growth season, and (3) the full year. The results confirm that I. spinosa is highly tolerant to herbivory. The full year and the growth season defoliations were, however, more detrimental to plant production and survival than the dormancy season defoliations. Moreover, defoliations at higher browse classes were more deleterious than at the lower levels. Highest regrowth cumulative biomass was produced by plants defoliated during the dormancy season, followed by those of the growth season and then, plants defoliated during the full year. In terms of cumulative biomass, the defoliated plants out-produced the control plants. Compensatory growth was positively associated with residual biomass. This study supports the hypothesis that moderate levels of defoliation lead to compensatory growth. It is concluded that grazing of 30 % of annual aboveground biomass production followed by defoliation during the dormancy and growth seasons had little or no detrimental effect on I. spinosa.

AB Hypersaline environments are found around the world, above and below ground, and many are exposed to hydrocarbons on a continuous or a frequent basis. Some surface hypersaline environments are exposed to hydrocarbons because they have active petroleum seeps while others are exposed because of oil exploration and production, or nearby human activities. Many oil reservoirs overlie highly saline connate water, and some national oil reserves are stored in salt caverns. Surface hypersaline ecosystems contain consortia of halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms that decompose organic compounds including hydrocarbons, and subterranean ones are likely to contain the same. However, the rates and extents of hydrocarbon biodegradation are poorly understood in such ecosystems. Here we describe hypersaline environments potentially or likely to become contaminated with hydrocarbons, including perennial and transient environments above and below ground, and discuss what is known about the microbes degrading hydrocarbons and the extent of their activities. We also discuss what limits the microbial hydrocarbon degradation in hypersaline environments and whether there are opportunities for inhibiting (oil storage) or stimulating (oil spills) such biodegradation as the situation requires.

AB The potential biological removal (PBR) formula used to determine a reference point for human-caused mortality of marine mammals in the United States has been shown to be robust to several sources of uncertainty. This study investigates the consequences of the quality of monitoring on PBR performance. It also explores stochastic and demographic uncertainty, catastrophic events, sublethal effects of interactions with fishing gear, and the situation of a marine mammal population subject to bycatch in two fisheries, only one of which is managed. Results are presented for two pinniped and two cetacean life histories. Bias in abundance estimates and whether there is a linear relationship between abundance estimates and true abundance most influence conservation performance. Catastrophic events and trends in natural mortality have larger effects than environmental stochasticity. Managing only one of two fisheries with significant bycatch leads, as expected, to a lower probability of achieving conservation management goals, and better outcomes would be achieved if bycatch in all fisheries were managed. The results are qualitatively the same for the four life histories, but estimates of the probability of population recovery differ.

AB Free-living and mycorrhizal fungi are able to enhance the weathering of rock and other solid substrates. Deciphering the exact mechanisms of these natural processes requires their experimental simulation. Moreover, by performing these simula- tions with genetically amenable rock -weathering fungi, one can knock -out certain fungal traits and consequently identify their weathering -relevant function. Here, the effect of the rock -inhabiting fungus, Knufia petricola A95, on the dissolution kinetics of an Fe -bearing olivine (Mg 1.86 Fe 0.19 SiO 4 ) is investigated at 25 ?C and pH 6 using reproducible batch and mixed flow exper- iments. The availability of a melanin -deficient mutant ( DKppks ) of K. petricola A95, which produces more extracellular poly- meric substances (EPS) than the wild type (WT), enables the comparative study of the role of melanin and EPS in olivine dissolution. In abiotic dissolution experiments, the olivine dissolution rate decreased considerably over time at pH 6 but not at pH 3.5. This inhibition of abiotic olivine dissolution at pH 6 was most likely caused by the in -situ oxidation of ferrous Fe and/or the precipitation of ferric hydroxides at the olivine surface. In corresponding biotic experiments at pH 6, both the wild type K. petricola and its melanin -deficient mutant DKppks solubilised and bound significant amounts of Fe released by olivine dissolution. Fe oxidation and precipitation were thus prevented and olivine dissolution proceeded faster than in the abiotic experiments. By sequestering Fe directly at the olivine surface, the attached wild type K. petricola cells were particu- larly efficient at preventing the oxidation of Fe at the mineral surface: the slowdown of olivine dissolution almost completely disappeared. The attachment capacity of these wild type cells is most likely mediated by wild type -specific EPS. Our presented experimental systems allow the oxidation of mineral -released Fe and include a rock -inhabiting fungus, thus simulating chem- ical, physical and biological conditions that set dissolution rates in a way that is relevant to natural ecosystems.

AB The placenta is a complex life-history trait that is ubiquitous across the tree of life. Theory proposes that the placenta evolves in response to high performance-demanding conditions by shifting maternal investment from pre- to post-fertilisation, thereby reducing a female's reproductive burden during pregnancy. We test this hypothesis by studying populations of the fish species Poeciliopsis retropinna in Costa Rica. We found substantial variation in the degree of placentation among natural populations associated with predation risk: females from high predation populations had significantly higher degrees of placentation compared to low predation females, while number, size and quality of offspring at birth remained unaffected. Moreover, a higher degree of placentation correlated with a lower reproductive burden and hence likely an improved swimming performance during pregnancy. Our study advances an adaptive explanation for why the placenta evolves by arguing that an increased degree of placentation offers a selective advantage in high predation environments.

AB Viviparity (live-bearing) has independently evolved from oviparity (egg-laying) in more than 100 lineages of squamates (lizards and snakes). We might expect consequent shifts in selective forces to affect per-brood reproductive investment (RI = total mass of offspring relative to maternal mass) and in the way in which that output is partitioned (number vs. size of offspring per brood). Based on the assumption that newly born offspring are heavier than eggs, we predicted that live-bearing must entail either increased RI or a reduction in offspring size and/or fecundity. However, our phylogenetically controlled analysis of data on 1,259 squamate species revealed no significant differences in mean offspring size, clutch size or RI between oviparous and viviparous squamates. We attribute this paradoxical result to (1) strong selection on offspring sizes, unaffected by parity mode, (2) the lack of a larval stage in amniotes, favouring large eggs even in the ancestral oviparous mode and (3) the ability of viviparous females to decrease the mass of uterine embryos by reducing extra-embryonic water stores. Our analysis shows that squamate eggs (when laid) weigh about the same as the hatchlings that emerge from them (despite a many-fold increase in embryo mass during incubation). Most of the egg mass is due to components (such as water stores and the eggshell) not required for oviductal incubation. That repackaging enables live-born offspring to be accommodated within the mother's body without increasing total litter mass. The consequent stasis in reproductive burden during the evolutionary transition from oviparity to viviparity may have facilitated frequent shifts in parity modes.

AB Ecosystems can undergo abrupt transitions between alternative stable states when the driver crosses a critical threshold. Dynamical systems theory shows that when ecosystems approach the point of loss of stability associated with these transitions, they take a long time to recover from perturbations, a phenomenon known as critical slowing down. This generic feature of dynamical systems can offer early warning signals of abrupt transitions. However, these signals are qualitative and cannot quantify the thresholds of drivers at which transition may occur. Here, we propose a method to estimate critical thresholds from spatial data. We show that two spatial metrics, spatial variance and autocorrelation of ecosystem state variable, computed along driver gradients can be used to estimate critical thresholds. First, we investigate cellular-automaton models of ecosystem dynamics that show a transition from a high-density state to a bare state. Our models show that critical thresholds can be estimated as the ecosystem state and the driver values at which spatial variance and spatial autocorrelation of the ecosystem state are maximum. Next, to demonstrate the application of the method, we choose remotely sensed vegetation data (Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) from regions in central Africa and northeast Australia that exhibit alternative states in woody cover. We draw transects (8 x 90 km) that span alternative stable states along rainfall gradients. Our analyses of spatial variance and autocorrelation of EVI along transects yield estimates of critical thresholds. These estimates match reasonably well with those obtained by an independent method that uses large-scale (250 x 200 km) spatial data sets. Given the generality of the principles that underlie our method, our method can be applied to a variety of ecosystems that exhibit alternative stable states.

AB Fairy circles (FCs) are extremely ordered round patches of bare soil within arid grasslands of southwestern Africa and northwestern Australia. Their origin is disputed because biotic factors such as insects or abiotic factors such as edaphic and eco-hydrological feedback mechanisms have been suggested to be causal. In this research, we used a multi-scale approach to shed light on the origin of Australian FCs. At a local scale, we investigated the potential cause of FCs using analyses of soil compaction and texture within FCs, the surrounding matrix vegetation, and in nearby large bare-soil areas. We found that soil hardness and day content were similarly higher inside the FCs and in the large bare-soil areas. When compared to the matrix soils with protective grass cover, the 2.6-2.8 times higher clay content in FCs and large bare-soil areas is likely sourced via multiple abiotic weathering processes. Intense rainfall events, particle dispersion, surface heat, evaporation, and mechanical crust building inhibit plant growth in both areas. At the landscape scale, a systematic survey of 154 soil excavations within FCs was undertaken to evaluate the presence of pavement termitaria that could inhibit plant growth. We show that in up to 100% and most of the excavations per plot, no hard pavement termitaria were present in the FCs. This fact is substantiated by the observation that small, newly forming FCs are initiated on soft sand without evidence of termite activity. At the regional scale, we investigated the spatial properties of FCs and common termite-created gaps in Western Australia, using spatially explicit statistics. We mapped three 25-ha FC plots with a drone and compared them with three aerial images of typical vegetation gaps created by harvester and spinifex termites. We demonstrate that the small diameters, the lower ordering, and the heterogeneous patterns of these common termite gaps strongly differ from the unique spatial signature of FCs. Our multi-scale approach emphasizes that FCs are not trivial termite gaps and that partial correlation with termites at some sites does not imply causation. Instead, we highlight the need to study the edaphic and eco-hydrological drivers of vegetation-pattern formation in water-limited environments.

AB Cement manufacturing contributes to the elevation of air pollutants in the atmosphere and thus impact on the nearby communities. This study assessed air quality in a major Cement Plant in Ibese Ogun State, Nigeria, through an ambient air quality monitoring and air emission dispersion modelling. Particulate Matter (PM) and gaseous pollutants were measured using portable samplers and AERMOD View was used for the emission dispersion modelling. Combustion products including SO2, NO, NO2, CO and VOCs were the gaseous pollutants detected along the complex fenceline and in the receptor environments. Pollutants measurements were undertaken at 23 locations within the fence line and receptor locations. The daily SO2 and NO2 Federal Ministry of Environment - Nigeria (FMEnv) limits were exceeded in ten (10) and five (5) locations along the fenceline, respectively. Particulates were detected in all the locations along the fenceline and in the communities. The cumulative gaseous pollutants resulting from simultaneous operations of all the identified plant air emission point sources are 0.01-276.13% of their respective 24-h limits along the fenceline, with 1-h SO2 within the threshold limit at all fenceline locations, but 1-h NOx exceeds the threshold limit at all locations 16-21 times. The 24-h CO and VOCs are within their limits at all fenceline locations; however the 24-h SO2 and NOx are breaching the limits at some locations 30-34 times (0.34-0.39% of the investigation period) and 44-87 times, respectively. Daily and Annual averaging concentrations of PM10 was 14.32-31.54% and 4.90-52.60% of their respective limits. Process facilities are the major point sources of atmospheric emissions identified in the factory. Several fugitive emission sources were also identified during the field work. Comprehensive evaluation of the fugitive emission sources should be carried out in the cement plant for immediate attention.

AB Climate change in recent decades has been identified as a significant threat to natural environments and human wellbeing. This is because some of the contemporary changes to climate are abrupt and result in persistent changes in the state of natural systems; so called regime shifts (RS). This study aimed to detect and analyse the timing and strength of RS in Estonian climate at the half-century scale (1966-2013). We demonstrate that the extensive winter warming of the Northern Hemisphere in the late 1980s was represented in atmospheric, terrestrial, freshwater and marine systems to an extent not observed before or after the event within the studied time series. In 1989, abiotic variables displayed statistically significant regime shifts in atmospheric, river and marine systems, but not in lake and bog systems. This was followed by regime shifts in the biotic time series of bogs and marine ecosystems in 1990. However, many biotic time series lacked regime shifts, or the shifts were uncoupled from large-scale atmospheric circulation. We suggest that the latter is possibly due to complex and temporally variable interactions between abiotic and biotic elements with ecosystem properties buffering biotic responses to climate change signals, as well as being affected by concurrent anthropogenic impacts on natural environments.

AB Variation in body size represents one of the crucial raw materials for evolution. However, at present, it is still being debated what is the main factor affecting body size or if the final body size is the consequence of several factors acting synergistically. To evaluate this, widespread species seem to be suitable models because the different populations occur along a geographical gradient and under contrasted climatic and environmental conditions. Here we describe the spatial pattern of variation in body size and sexual size dimorphism in the snouted treefrog Scinax fuscovarius (Anura, Hylidae) along a 10 degrees range in latitude, 25 degrees longitude, and 2000m in altitude from Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay using an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the support of the data for eight a priori hypotheses proposed in the literature to account for geographical body size, and three hypotheses for sexual size dimorphism variation. Body size of S.fuscovarius varied most dramatically with longitude and less so with latitude; frogs were largest in the northwestern populations. Body size was positively related with precipitation seasonality, and negatively with annual precipitation. Furthermore, the degree of sexual size dimorphism was greatest in the western populations with less annual precipitation, as the increase in body size was stronger for females. Our results on body size variation are consistent with two ecogeographical hypotheses, the starvation resistance and the water availability hypotheses, while our results on sexual size dimorphism in S.fuscovarius supports the differential-plasticity hypothesis but the inverse to Rensch's rule and the parental investment hypothesis. Due to the weak association between environmental variables and body size and sexual size dimorphism variation, we stress that there are other factors, mainly those related to the life history, driving the geographical variation of S.fuscovarius.

AB Since the turn of the millennium various scientific publications have been discussing a re-greening of the Sahel after the 1980s drought mainly based on coarse-resolution satellite data. However, the author's own field studies suggest that the situation is far more complex and that both paradigms, the "encroaching Sahara" and the "re-greening Sahel", need to be questioned.
   This paper discusses the concepts of desertification, resilience, and re-greening by addressing four main aspects: (i) the relevance of edaphic factors for a vegetation re-greening, (ii-iii) the importance of the selected observation period in the debate on Sahel greening or browning, and (iv) modifications in the vegetation pattern as possible indicators of ecosystem changes (shift from originally diffuse to contracted vegetation patterns).
   The data referred to in this paper cover a time period of more than 150 years and include the author's own research results from the early 1980s until today. A special emphasis, apart from fieldwork data and remote sensing data, is laid on the historical documents.
   The key findings summarised at the end show the following: (i) vegetation recovery predominantly depends on soil types; (ii) when discussing Sahel greening vs. Sahel browning, the majority of research papers only focus on post-drought conditions. Taking pre-drought conditions (before the 1980s) into account, however, is essential to fully understand the situation. Botanical investigations and remote-sensing-based time series clearly show a substantial decline in woody species diversity and cover density compared to pre-drought conditions; iii) the self-organised patchiness of vegetation is considered to be an important indicator of ecosystem changes.

AB It is generally assumed that ectothermic vertebrates show a reversed Bergmann's cline, but several studies suggest the opposite for turtles. Here, we assess this issue using the widely distributed European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis), which displays strong geographic size variation. We tested carapace lengths of more than 2000 individuals from the entire distribution range against latitude and climatic factors and estimated the effects of those on female-specific traits such as clutch size and frequency. Also, we compared our data against Pleistocene (Eemian) E. orbicularis from Germany. Regional fluctuations of temperature and precipitation are better predictors of body size than latitudinal temperature clines, especially in females. In addition, female body size, activity period and nesting season might be correlated, as small southern females lay several smaller clutches per season, whereas larger-bodied northern females produce only a single large clutch. In conclusion, although climatic conditions appear to have an effect on the body size of E. orbicularis, the species does not follow Bergmann's rule. Moreover, comparison of extant and fossil E. orbicularis from Germany revealed that fossil pond turtles were generally smaller than extant conspecifics from the same region.

AB Seed dispersal by avian frugivores is one of the key processes influencing plant spatial patterns, but may fail if there is disruption of plant-frugivore mutualisms, such as decline in abundance of dispersers, fragmentation of habitat, or isolation of individual trees. We used simulation model experiments to examine the interaction between frugivore density and behaviour and the spatial arrangement of fruiting plants and its effect on seed dispersal kernels. We focussed on two New Zealand canopy tree species that produce large fruits and are dispersed predominantly by one avian frugivore (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae). Although the mean seed dispersal distance decreased when trees became more aggregated, there were more frugivore flights between tree clusters, consequently stretching the tails of the dispersal kernels. Conversely, when trees were less aggregated in the landscape, mean dispersal distances increased because seeds were deposited over larger areas, but the kernels had shorter tails. While there were no statistically meaningful changes in kernel parameters when frugivore density changed, decreases in density did cause a proportional reduction in the total number of dispersed seeds. However, birds were forced to move further when fruit availability and fruit ripening were low. Sensitivity analysis showed that dispersal kernels were primarily influenced by the model parameters relating to disperser behaviour, especially those determining attractiveness based on distance to candidate fruiting trees. Our results suggest that the spatial arrangement of plants plays an important role in seed dispersal processes - although tree aggregation curbed the mean seed dispersal distance, it was accompanied by occasional long distance events, and tree dispersion caused an increase in mean dispersal distance, both potentially increasing the probability of seeds finding suitable habitats for germination and growth. Even though low frugivore densities did not cause dispersal failure, there were negative effects on the quantity of seed dispersal because fewer seeds were dispersed.

AB Bergmann's rule predicts increasing body sizes at higher elevations. The elevational Rapoport's rule predicts an increase of elevational range size with higher elevations. Both rules have often been related to effects of temperature. Larger bodies allow more efficient heat preservation at lower temperature, explaining Bergmann's rule. Higher temperature variability may select for adaptations that allow increased range sizes, explaining Rapoport's rule. The generality of both rules has been challenged and evidence towards explanatory mechanisms has been equivocal. We investigated temperature and its variability as explanations for Bergmann's and Rapoport's rule in moths along an elevation gradient in Switzerland. In particular, we tested for relationships between elevation, temperature and body size across almost 300 species of Macrolepidoptera along a gradient from 600 to 2400 m a.s.l. The gradient was resampled throughout the vegetation season, which allowed assessing temperature effects independently from elevation. We controlled analyses for covariate traits of moths and their phylogeny. We found a positive relationship between body size and elevation, but no link with temperature. Furthermore, there was no positive link between average elevation and elevational range, but there was between temperature variability and elevational range. We conclude that mechanisms other than temperature can lead to increasing body sizes with elevation (supporting Bergmann's pattern, but not the mechanism). Contrary to that, data support the mechanism for Rapoport's rule: high temperature variability is associated with large ranges. However, because temperature variability is not necessarily increasing with elevation, it may not always lead to the geographic pattern predicted.

AB Reintroductions aim to re-establish species within their historical ranges through the release of wild- or captive-bred individuals following extirpation (or extinction) in the wild. There is no general agreement on what constitutes a successful reintroduction but the probability of the population achieving long-term persistence should be addressed. Here we review a 10-year trial reintroduction of the great bustard Otis tarda, a globally threatened bird species, to the UK and assess the long-term population viability. Despite changes in rearing and release strategy, initial post-release survival probability remained consistently low, with only 11.3% of bustards (n = 167) surviving from release to. year post-release. Nineteen breeding attempts were made by eight females; however, only one chick survived > 100 days after hatching, and no wild juveniles have recruited into the population. Using demographic rates from the UK population and wild populations elsewhere, and stochastic population modelling, we investigate the viability of this reintroduced population by predicting population size over the next 10 years. Under current demographic rates the population was predicted to decline rapidly. Self-sufficiency was predicted only using the highest estimates from the UK population for first-year and adult survival, and recruitment rates from wild populations elsewhere. Although changes have been made in rearing, release strategies, habitat management and release sites used, these changes appear to have a modest effect on long-term viability. Substantial improvements in survival rates and productivity are necessary to establish a viable great bustard population in the UK, and we consider this unlikely.

AB The rapid increase in urban population worldwide is one among the important global environmental issues. The urban ecological system is made up of human society and environments. We cannot exclude humans from the urban ecosystem since humans are an integral component of landscape ecology. Bridging humans and landscape ecology is important to sustainable landscape planning and management from a holistic point of view. Humans' responses to landscape structure are crucial to understand the relationships between humans and nature. In current study, we conducted a field experiment in an urban campus to investigate the relationships between urban open spaces and humans' health benefits. The landscape structure of urban open spaces were derived from land cover maps. The results show that people's psycho-physiological responses are correlated with selected landscape metrics of different land cover types. Overall, dense trees and large artificial structures likely have negative effects on humans, while large continuous grassland patches or water patches enhance humans' positive responses. The findings give some insights into the design and management of urban open spaces that are favorable for ecosystems and the health of urban population. The methodology taken to investigate the relationships between landscape structure and human health in this study may be of value to future efforts in establishing healthy and sustainable urban environments.

AB A distinctive association of rivulariacean-like calcified microfossils is recognized in back-reef lagoon facies on the Bachu-Tazhong Platform in the Lianglitag Formation (Katian Stage, Upper Ordovician) of the Tarim Basin, based on investigation of 4500 thin sections from 35 well drill cores. The genera include Hedstroemia, Ortonella, Zonotrichites, Cayeuxia, and Garwoodia, most of which have features comparable with present-day calcified cyanobacteria such as Rivularia, Calothrix and Dichothrix (Rivulariaceae, Nostocales). A similar association is present in lagoonal and other restricted nearshore shallow-marine carbonate environments during much of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic. This suggests the sustained presence of a rivulariacean-dominated cyanobacterial association characteristic of back-reef/lagoonal environments. At the present-day, uncalcified Rivularia, Calothrix and Dichothrix remain common in back-reef, lagoon, mangrove-swamp, rocky shore, salt-marsh, and saline lake environments. The ability of these cyanobacteria to grow in environments low in inorganic nitrate and phosphate could help to explain this distribution. Cenozoic decline in marine calcified rivulariaceans is attributed to global reduction of seawater carbonate saturation state. The Phanerozoic record of calcified rivulariacean cyanobacteria appears to sensitively reflect long-term variations in the carbonate and nutrient chemistry of marine environments.

AB Background. Knowledge of species-specific vocalization characteristics and their associated active communication space, the effective range over which a communication signal can be detected by a conspecific, is critical for understanding the impacts of underwater acoustic pollution, as well as other threats.
   Methods. We used a two-dimensional cross-shaped hydrophone array system to record the whistles of free-ranging Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in shallow-water environments of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and Beibu Gulf (BG), China. Using hyperbolic position fixing, which exploits time differences of arrival of a signal between pairs of hydrophone receivers, we obtained source location estimates for whistles with good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR >= 10 dB) and not polluted by other sounds and back-calculated their apparent source levels (ASL). Combining with the masking levels (including simultaneous noise levels, masking tonal threshold, and the Sousa auditory threshold) and the custom made site-specific sound propagation models, we further estimated their active communication space (ACS).
   Results. Humpback dolphins produced whistles with average root-mean-square ASL of 138.5 +/- 6.8 (mean +/- standard deviation) and 137.2 +/- 7.0 dB re 1 mu Pa in PRE (N = 33) and BG (N = 209), respectively. We found statistically significant differences in ASLs among different whistle contour types. The mean and maximum ACS of whistles were estimated to be 14.7 +/- 2.6 (median +/- quartile deviation) and 17.1 +/- 3.5 m in PRE, and 34.2 +/- 9.5 and 43.5 +/- 12.2 m in BG. Using just the auditory threshold as the masking level produced the mean and maximum ACSat of 24.3 +/- 4.8 and 35.7 +/- 4.6 m for PRE, and 60.7 +/- 18.1 and 74.3 +/- 25.3 m for BG. The small ACSs were due to the high ambient noise level. Significant differences in ACSs were also observed among different whistle contour types.
   Discussion. Besides shedding some light for evaluating appropriate noise exposure levels and information for the regulation of underwater acoustic pollution, these baseline data can also be used for aiding the passive acoustic monitoring of dolphin populations, defining the boundaries of separate groups in a more biologically meaningful way during field surveys, and guiding the appropriate approach distance for local dolphin-watching boats and research boat during focal group following.

AB The emphasis in recent scientific studies has gradually shifted from merely documenting the numerous biological impacts of global climate change to developing predictive tools that help forecast which organisms, ecosystems and locations are most (and least) likely to be affected. This work often focuses on two very different scales of approach: the impacts of environmental change on individual organisms and their physiological vulnerability; and large-scale, biogeographic shifts in patterns of species distributions. While both scales of research are important and potentially informative of one another, with a few key exceptions, biogeographic (large scale) and physiological (small scale) approaches often operate in isolation from one another. There is a general consensus that a better understanding of mechanistic drivers will likely improve our ability to develop a more predictive framework. To this end, experimental and theoretical research has begun to tease apart the complexities of how changes in climate (as reflected in weather) ultimately translate into changes in growth, survival, productivity, species distribution and abundances, and the provision of ecosystem services. Yet, considerable debate still remains over how much detail is required to make effective predictions. Many authors have raised concerns about the implicit assumptions inherent in biological forecasts and while we cannot wait for perfect models before acting, oversimplifications can lead to unintended consequences. Additionally, what makes one forecasting method "good enough" or one approach "better" than another may depend largely on the application to which the predictions are being made. This review explores and summarizes the concerns raised by researchers working on problems at diverse scales and offers suggestions of how cross-scale research can best avoid potential pitfalls while preparing society for the ongoing impacts of climate change.

AB For many amphibians, high temperatures and limited precipitation are crucial habitat characteristics that limit species ranges and modulate life-history characteristics. Although knowledge of the ability of amphibians to cope with such environmental harshness is particularly relevant in the light of ongoing environmental change, relatively little is known about natural variation in age, maturation and associated life-history traits across species' ranges. We used the analysis of growth rings in bones to investigate the link between environmental harshness and life-history traits, including age and body size distribution, in specimens from 20 populations of the Australian bleating froglet, Crinia pseudinsignifera. Despite the short lifespan of the species, bone slides revealed geographic variation in average age, body size and reproductive investment linked to variation in temperature and rainfall. We found no difference in age at maturation in different climatic harshness regimes. Frogs from harsher environments invested less in their first reproductive event but grew older than their counterparts in more benign environments, thereby allowing for more reproductive events and buffering them against the increased chance of reproductive failure in the harsher environments. For individual frogs, climatic harshness experienced during an individual's life promoted larger body size. Overall, these results illustrate how bone structure analyses from preserved specimens allow both the testing of ecogeographic hypotheses and the assessment of the adaptive potential of species in the light of environmental change.

AB Ecological models are a fundamental tool that archaeologists use to clarify our thinking about the processes that generate the archaeological record. Typically, arguments reasoned from a single model are bolstered by observing the consistency of ethnographic data with the argument. This validation of a model establishes that an argument is reasonable. In this paper, we attempt to move beyond validation by comparing the consistency of two arguments reasoned from different models that might explain corporate territorial ownership in a large ethnographic data set. Our results suggest that social dilemmas are an under appreciated mechanism that can drive the evolution of corporate territorial ownership. When social dilemmas emerge, the costs associated with provisioning the public goods of information on resources or, perhaps, common defence create situations in which human foragers gain more by cooperating to recognize corporate ownership rules than they lose. Our results also indicate that societies who share a common cultural history are more likely to recognize corporate ownership, and there is a spatial dynamic in which societies who live near each other are more likely to recognize corporate ownership as the number of near-by groups who recognize ownership increases. Our results have important implications for investigating the coevolution of territorial ownership and the adoption of food production in the archaeological record. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The theory of stationary spatially localized patterns in dissipative systems driven by time-independent forcing is well developed. With time-periodic forcing, related but time-dependent structures may result. These may consist of breathing localized patterns, or states that grow for part of the cycle via nucleation of new wavelengths of the pattern followed by wavelength annihilation during the remainder of the cycle. These two competing processes lead to a complex phase diagram whose structure is a consequence of a series of resonances between the nucleation time and the forcing period. The resulting diagram is computed for the periodically forced quadratic-cubic Swift-Hohenberg equation, and its details are interpreted in terms of the properties of the depinning transition for the fronts bounding the localized state on either side. The results are expected to shed light on localized states in a large variety of periodically driven systems.

TI Evaluating landowner-based beaver relocation as a tool to restore salmon

DE American beaver; Coho salmon; Dams; Relocation; Restoration; Stress
AB Relocating American beavers (Castor canadensis) from unwanted sites to desirable sites (i.e., where damage exceeds stakeholder capacity) has been posited as a method to enhance in-stream habitat for salmonids in the Pacific Northwest region of the US; however, no studies have evaluated this method. From September-December 2011, we trapped and relocated 38 nuisance beavers using guidelines available to Oregon landowners. Release sites were selected from models that identified high values of beaver dam habitat suitability and where dams would increase intrinsic potential of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Mean distance moved from release sites within 16 weeks post-release was 3.3 +/- 0.2 (SE) stream km (max 29.2 km). Mean survival rate for relocated beavers was 0.47 +/- 0.12 (95% CI: 0.26-0.69) for 16 weeks post-release, while the probabilities of an individual dying to predation or disease/illness during the same period were 0.26 (95% CI: 0.09-0.43) and 0.16 (95% CI: 0.01-0.30), respectively. Dam construction was limited and ephemeral due to winter high flows, providing no in-stream habitat for coho. We conclude beaver relocation options available to landowners in Oregon may not be an effective option for stream restoration in coastal forestlands due to infrequent dam occurrence and short dam longevity.

AB Predicting responses of plant communities to environmental changes is a key challenge in ecology. Here we examined climate-related mechanisms regulating seedling dynamics of a common Mediterranean shrub. Our objective was to analyze effects of water availability on seedling survival and to determine whether geographical gradients can serve as proxy for predicting local climate change effects. We conducted a field experiment along a natural rainfall gradient with additional long-term rainfall manipulations at a Mediterranean site, enabling the investigation of the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors on seedling dynamics. Along the natural and artificial rainfall gradient seedling survival increased with increasing soil water availability. However, seedling survival at the Mediterranean site yielded a clear trend of decreasing seedling survival with artificially increasing aridity whereas at the dry end of the geographical gradient seedling survival was relatively high. We attribute this pattern to biotic interactions, which appeared less negative at the dry end. These findings indicate that ignoring biotic interactions is misleading when predicting shifts in the distribution of species under climate change and that because of the complex interplay between abiotic and biotic factors, environmental gradients can be poor proxies for predicting the response of plant species to climate change.

AB We used 344 mitochondrial control region (717 bp) sequences from the finless porpoise (genus Neophocaena) from the northwestern Pacific to investigate the extent and manner in which past climatic oscillations may have shaped patterns of genetic diversity for this marine mammal. Both SplitsTree and Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) revealed the presence of a deep divergence among N. phocaenoides in subtropical waters compared with N. asiaeorientalis in temperate waters. Results from Migrate-n indicated that migration increased along the continent during the early Pleistocene period. Migration increased, although to a lesser extent than that during the Pleistocene, along the marginal shelf in the Yellow/Bohai Sea during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) due to a shortening coastline. Our results suggest that the current patterns of genetic diversity of Neophocaena vary at a hierarchy on a temporal and spatial scale, and phylogeographic history should be taken into account when examining species population structure and taxonomy.

AB The scarcity of water characterising drylands forces vegetation to adopt appropriate survival strategies. Some of these generate water vegetation feedback mechanisms that can lead to spatial self-organisation of vegetation, as it has been shown with models representing plants by a density of biomass, varying continuously in time and space. However, although plants are usually quite plastic they also display discrete qualities and stochastic behaviour. These features may give rise to demographic noise, which in certain cases can influence the qualitative dynamics of ecosystem models. In the present work we explore the effects of demographic noise on the resilience of a model semi-arid ecosystem. We introduce a spatial stochastic eco-hydrological hybrid model in which plants are modelled as discrete entities subject to stochastic dynamical rules, while the dynamics of surface and soil water are described by continuous variables. The model has a deterministic approximation very similar to previous continuous models of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. By means of numerical simulations we show that demographic noise can have important effects on the extinction and recovery dynamics of the system. In particular we find that the stochastic model escapes extinction under a wide range of conditions for which the corresponding deterministic approximation predicts absorption into desert states.

AB Apium bermejoi is a stoloniferous plant endemic to the island of Menorca (Balearic Islands). It is found only at one locality, and it is listed as Critically Endangered (according to the IUCN criteria). We describe the main results of population restoration actions undertaken under the Recovery Plan for this species, including the following: 1) introduction at two new localities (2008), 2) reinforcement of the original wild and the introduced populations, and 3) a programme for monitoring population dynamics (including both wild and introduced populations) spanning four years (2006-2010). The plant material for the introduction and reinforcement projects was generated from seeds gathered in the wild. We carried out a monthly census of all of the individuals/patches and emerged seedlings, from which we assessed their survival at 3-4months. The survival rates of the planted individuals in the two new localities after three months were found to be 59.0% and 56.3%, and more than 80% of the surviving plants produced fruits. A seasonal pattern was observed based on the minimum cover values recorded in the censuses taken at the end of summer, with an increase detected during autumn, and maximal cover values recorded during May/June. The A. bermejoi populations showed large inter-annual fluctuations in both the number of patches and area of occupancy. The number of seedlings varied across the study years, and their survival was linked to specific meteorological events, such as severe storms and dry and hot spells during autumn. The initial phase of introduction for this species has been overall successful, but a final evaluation can only be made on a long-term basis.

AB The restoration of abalone (Haliotis spp.) populations through supplementation with the offspring of hatchery-spawned wild parents has been attempted in several species, with variable results. Between 2002 and 2005, the Bamfield Huu-ay-aht Community Abalone Project released 4.5 million larvae and 152,000 juveniles of the northern abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana) into Barkley Sound, BC. The purpose of this study was to estimate the long-term survival of outplanted abalone 3-7 years after their release and thus determine their contribution to local population densities at three different outplanting sites. We identified outplanted abalone by genotyping epipodal tentacles sampled from wild-caught abalone for seven microsatellite loci. We then used three different pedigree reconstruction programs: one that used genotypes from hatchery-reared siblings (pedigree 2.2), one that used the wild parent genotypes that were available (cervus 3.0), and one that used both sources of information (colony 2.0). Each program identified different but partially overlapping subsets of hatchery-outplanted offspring. From this we inferred that up to 26% of the individuals sampled at the main outplanting site were from hatchery spawnings. Despite this large contribution of hatchery-reared stock, the density of mature abalone at each site was below the level required for successful fertilization. More intensive outplanting efforts might increase population densities of this broadcast spawner above this minimum sustainable level. However, for supplementation to be successful, other factors that could reduce outplanted juvenile survival, including the low genetic diversity of hatchery-produced offspring and the low habitat quality of some outplanting sites, need to be monitored.

DE Red fox; Golden jackal; Cape hare; Temporal change; Body size; Israel
ID BODY-SIZE; EARLY NUTRITION; GROWTH; VULPES
AB Among mammals, food availability, especially during the growth period, is a key predictor in determining final body size, and improved nutrition may lead to an increase in their body size. In Israel during the last century food availability for animals commensal with humans increased greatly, due to a 16-fold increase in the human population and the accompanying changes, such as a 135-fold increase in the area of irrigated agriculture and the availability of large quantities of organic garbage.
   Using museum material, we studied temporal changes in skull size of a sample of 89 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes Linnaeus, 1758), 108 golden jackals (Canis aureus Linnaeus, 1758) and 117 Cape hares (Lepus capensis Linnaeus, 1758) collected during the 20th century. Four measurements (condylobasal length, zygomatic breadth, the length of the upper cheek teeth row and the length of the mandible) were taken for each skull, and principal component analysis was used to combine the measurements into principal components.
   We found that skull size of the red fox increased significantly during the 20th century, possibly due to improved food availability from man-made resources such as agricultural produce and garbage. No temporal trend in body size was detected for the jackal and hare. These differences are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB The many definitions of Bergmann's rule have resulted in confusion and debate over how and in what organisms to test the original rule. Watt et al. published a paper in 2010, based directly on Bergmann's original paper, in the hopes of clarifying the rule and presenting direct translations to resolve uncertainties. Recently, Olalla-Tarraga has criticized our publication, stating that we assumed the rule was a causal law, which has narrowed our epistemological scope of the rule. We argue we did not assume the rule was a law and suggest that Olalla-Tarraga has only focused on the observed pattern and has ignored the proposed mechanism, which is inherent in the definition. We also discuss the proposed mechanism and describe why it cannot apply to ectotherms. Despite this, we encourage a thorough investigation of the mechanisms responsible for maintaining Bergmann's pattern in ectotherms and support Olalla-Tarraga's quest for a unifying mechanism to explain body size gradients in endotherms and ectotherms.

AB Context The roles of woody-plant islands are well documented in low-altitude regions, but research related to such shrub effects in high-altitude regions is scant.
   Aims Four common shrub species (Cerasus trichostoma, Ribes glaciale, Rosa omeiensis and Salix sphaeronymphe) in a high-altitude forest cutover of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, were chosen to evaluate the effects of both species and size of shrub islands on microhabitats, herbaceous communities and woody seedling regeneration.
   Methods Total 86 shrubs with different sizes were investigated; The shrub size, herb community structure and species composition, litter, soil nutrient and microclimate parameters beneath the shrub canopies were also measured.
   Results All shrubs significantly ameliorated microclimates, increased content of soil organic matter and total nitrogen, both grass and forb species richness, and litter cover and biomass, and promoted woody seedling recruitment (richness and number), but decreased cover and biomass of the herbaceous community beneath them. These effects were greater for larger shrubs, and also varied among shrub species with different crown architectures. We also found differences in species-dependency of the shrub effect for the responses of the herbaceous and woody seedling species, suggesting that shrubs also indirectly facilitate forbs and seedling regeneration through competition release of grasses. We conclude that shrub-island effects are size-and species-dependent. In order to accelerate natural succession and restoration in alpine cutovers, shrub island preservation and their effective utilization as reforestation microhabitats should be integrated into vegetation management procedures.

AB Crop-wild hybridization has been documented in many cultivated species, but the ecological and genetic factors that influence the likelihood or rate that cultivar alleles will introgress into wild populations are poorly understood. Seed predation is one factor that could mitigate the spread of otherwise advantageous cultivar alleles into the wild by reducing seedling recruitment of crop-like individuals in hybrid populations. Seed predation has previously been linked to several seed characters that differ between cultivated and wild sunflower, such as seed size and oil content. In this study, seed morphological and nutritional characters were measured in a segregating population of sunflower crop-wild hybrids and wild and cultivated lines. Seed predation rates among lines were then assessed in the field. The relationship between seed predation and seed characters was investigated and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were mapped for all traits. There was no effect of seed type (hybrid vs. parents) on seed predation, although a trend toward more early predation of wild seeds was observed. Within the hybrids, seed predators preferred seeds that contained more oil and energy but were lower in fibre. The relationship between seed predation and oil content was supported by co-localized QTL for these traits on one linkage group. These results suggest that oil content may be a more important determinant of seed predation than seed size and provide molecular genetic evidence for this relationship. The cultivar allele was also found to increase predation at all QTL, indicating that post-dispersal seed predation may mitigate the spread of cultivar alleles into wild populations.

AB A dynamic bioeconomic model that examines economically optimal stocking rate decisions while taking into account changes in forage availability is presented. The model presented here focuses on economically optimal stocking decisions while taking into account changes in the forage resource. The model is parameterized for a stocker operation in central Wyoming. Regardless of the scenario analyzed, the general rule of 50% utilization is determined to be an economically sound management strategy. The factors most heavily influencing economically optimal stocking rate decisions are forage growth rates and the Michaelis Constant. Both grain prices and cattle prices impact financial returns yet do not directly impact optimal stocking decisions by cattle producers.

AB Semi-annual averaged values of photosynthetic carbon fixation (PCF), community respiration (CR), bacterial productivity (BP) and zooplankton carbon biomass, measured biweekly or monthly, were used to obtain long-term estimates of bacterial respiration (BR) and bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) in Lake Kinneret from 2001 through 2007. We posited that CR=BR+phytoplankton respiration (PR)+zooplankton respiration (ZR). Based on the results of independent experimental series, PR was estimated as 0.3 x gross primary production (GPP) and GPP as 1.5 x PCF. ZR was determined by multiplying zooplankton carbon biomass, measured biweekly, with published respiration rates for major zooplankton groups. From these data, we calculated BR and consequently BGE, determined as BP/(BR+BP). Over the entire study period, BR averaged 49 (+/- 10)% of CR and was consistently higher during the first half of the year. Semi-annual averaged BGE ranged from 26% to 53%, mean 39 (+/- 9)%. Similar values of BGE were obtained if we did not use the measured values for ZR, but estimated BR+ZR from CR-PR and then assumed that BR ranged from two to three times ZR. The approach outlined in this paper can be useful for determining BGE in aquatic systems where long-term data sets of PCF, CR and BP are available.

AB This work presents a retrospective analysis of long-term trends in loading of forms of nitrogen (N) from the Metropolitan Syracuse Wastewater Treatment Plant (Metro), N concentrations in the receiving urban lake (Onondaga Lake, New York), and related water quality status for the period from 1972 to 2007. The history of the evolution of treatment and discharge at Metro, as it affected N loading, is reviewed and forms the basis for identification of five regimes during which unifying conditions of loading and in-lake conditions prevailed. Changes in industrial waste inputs have complicated the effects of upgrades in treatment at Metro from primary (until 1978) to advanced (starting in 2004). Current N loading from Metro is approximately 35% lower than the peak levels observed in the late 1980s to late 1990s, but the areal rate to the lake remains extremely high (approximately 97 g/m(2).y), representing approximately 75% of the overall N load. Implementation of year-round nitrification treatment has resulted in transformation of the composition of the N load from Metro from ammonia (T-NH(3)) to nitrate (NO(3)(-)) dominance.
   High N concentrations have prevailed in the upper waters of the lake throughout the study period with averages of total N ranging from 2.6 to 4.3 mg/L for the five regimes. Total N levels and partitioning among the forms in the lake generally have tracked Metro loading conditions for the five regimes. The effects of Metro loading on seasonal in-lake patterns are demonstrated to be modified by both hydrologic inputs from tributaries and in-lake operation of biochemical processes. Resolution of these effects is supported by application of both empirical and dynamic mass balance models. Water quality problems related to high concentrations of forms of N are documented, including (1) augmentation of dissolved oxygen depletion during fall mixing from in-lake nitrification events, enabled by high T-NH3 levels; (2) violations of ammonia toxicity limits; and (3) violations of nitrite toxicity standards. These problems were either greatly ameliorated or eliminated by Metro's most recent treatment upgrades. Prevailing conditions are considered in a management context, including (1) likelihood of exceedances of toxicity limits in the future and (2) potential role of elevated nitrate levels in preventing mobilization of methyl mercury from the lake's sediments.

   CONSEQUENCES; PERFORMANCE; MOONLIGHT
AB Activity levels and foraging success of ectotherms are dependent both on extrinsic factors (e.g., ambient temperature) and intrinsic factors (e.g., hunger level). We focus here on activity and foraging of sand vipers (Cerastes vipera (L., 1758)) (Squamata: Viperidae) in the northwestern Negev desert of Israel. Viper activity is bounded by a specific thermal range, but within this range, temperature does not affect the distance moved. Movement distances are, however, positively correlated with relative humidity. The capture success of lizards, the main prey of this viper, is strongly related both to movement distances of the snake and to the number of the lizard burrows scanned. Body size and shape have a direct effect on the number of burrows scanned and on the number of lizards captured. The increase in capture success with size is probably due to the consequent increase in the range of prey items the sand viper can subdue or handle. Vipers are larger and have a higher mass to length ratio in one of the three study sites, characterized by higher mean annual rainfall and vegetation cover. Finally, females tend to have a higher mass to length ratio than males, which may provide some space within the female body for reproductive materials such as eggs.

AB Occupancy of new habitats through dispersion is a central process in nature. In particular, long-distance dispersal is involved in the spread of species and epidemics, although it has not been previously related with cancer invasion, a process that involves cell spreading to tissues far away from the primary tumour.
   Using simulations and real data we show that the early spread of cancer cells is similar to the species individuals spread and we suggest that both processes are represented by a common spatio-temporal signature of long-distance dispersal and subsequent local proliferation. This signature is characterized by a particular fractal geometry of the boundaries of patches generated, and a power-law scaled, disrupted patch size distribution. In contrast, invasions involving only dispersal but not subsequent proliferation ("physiological invasions") like trophoblast cells invasion during normal human placentation did not show the patch size power-law pattern. Our results are consistent under different temporal and spatial scales, and under different resolution levels of analysis.
   We conclude that the scaling properties are a hallmark and a direct result of long-distance dispersal and proliferation, and that they could reflect homologous ecological processes of population self-organization during cancer and species spread. Our results are significant for the detection of processes involving long-range dispersal and proliferation like cancer local invasion and metastasis, biological invasions and epidemics, and for the formulation of new cancer therapeutical approaches.

AB Geographic variation in body size and reproductive traits has been reported in a wide range of organisms, including amphibians. Most studies have focused on latitudinal and/or altitudinal variation where differences in temperature and duration of the growing season are the main causes for population divergence. We describe a steep variation in body size and reproductive traits in two anuran species in southwestern Spain, associated with changes in the geological substrate. Pelobates cultripes and Bufo calamita (= Epidalea calamita) drastically reduced their size (a 71.6% and 76.1% reduction in body mass for R cultripes and B. calamitia, respectively) in just about 60 km. This extreme size reduction was more pronounced at the boundary between two different geological substrates (hercinic and sandy soil). Mean clutch mass, egg size, and clutch size were all smaller in B. calamita populations in the sandy environment. Likewise, clutch mass and egg size were both smaller in sandy P. cultripes populations. We observed a negative correlation between size-adjusted fecundity and egg size for both species, suggesting the existence of a reproductive trade-off that could explain the differences in reproductive allocation between populations and species. In P. cultripes, small-bodied populations had relatively higher fecundities and smaller eggs than large-bodied ones, whereas in B. calamita populations from the sandy area we found both populations with high fecundity and small eggs, and populations with low fecundity and large eggs. Common environmental effects associated with the sandy substrate produce a similar reduction in size in both toad species.

AB The genetic diversity of cyanobacterial communities was studied at various depths in Lake Kinneret (Israel). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of specific 16S rRNA gene PCR products showed significant differences in the cyanobacterial community structure between epi- and hypolimnetic waters. Sequences of clone libraries prepared from 16S rRNA gene PCR products from epi- and,hypolimnion revealed the presence of at least 11 different groups of cyanobacteria. Clones related to the unicellular cyanobacteria (Chroococcales and picocyanobacteria) dominated the clone libraries from both depths. New primers to amplify the gene coding for the photosystem 11 reaction centre (psbA) and the nitrogen regulator gene (ntcA) of cyanobacteria were developed and used for further characterization of the cyanobacterial communities from the lake. Sequences of psbA amplicons clustered with those from 2 different groups of marine Synechococcus and Chroococcales. Cloned ntcA amplicons from the lake were closely related and did not cluster with sequences from cultured cyanobacteria or other environmental sequences from this gene. All the molecular markers analyzed here showed similarity to sequences from some groups of cyanobacteria in the lake and those so far found in marine habitats.

AB We examined the skulls of 72 bottlenose dolphins from the Indian and western Pacific Oceans to clarify the systematics in genus Tursiops. We also examined type skulls of Tursiops aduncus (Ehrenberg, 1832), T. eurynome (Gray, 1846), T. catalania (Gray, 1862), Delphinus (Steno) gadamu Owen 1866, T. dawsoni Lydekker 1908, and T. truncatus (Montagu, 1821). The specimens were divided into two groups, A and B, based on rostrum length and characters of the basal part of the rostrum. The rostrum of group A was longer and tapered abruptly near the base, whereas that of group B was shorter and tapered more gradually throughout its length. Group A contained specimens from western, central, and eastern Asia, Africa, and Australasia. Group B contained specimens from central and eastern Asia and Australasia. The six type skulls were also clearly divided into two groups; the type skulls of T. aduncus, T. catalania, and Delphinus (Steno) gadamu were included in group A, whereas the type skulls of T. truncatus, T. eurynome, and T. dawsoni were included in group B. This grouping was consistent with the genetic status. Therefore, we identified group A specimens as T. aduncus and group B specimens T. truncatus, the oldest scientific names related to the two groups.

AB Thorny, spiny, and prickly plants including annuals, hemicryptophytes, shrubs, and trees dominate many habitats in the Near East, as the outcome of a long history of large-scale grazing. This study focuses on the quantitative aspect of the number of thorns per plant and per unit ecosystem area. Specifically, we quantitatively characterized the thorn system of two common shrub species, the low and compact Sarcopoterium spinosum and the taller and less compact Calicotome villosa. For each species we sampled 25 plants of various sizes, in each of two populations (for a total of 50 plants of each species). Large S. spinosum shrubs covering an area of more than 0.5 m(2) had ca. 9,700-19,000 thorns per plant. We found that in S. spinosum there were more thorns per unit plant area on average in the grazed population (26,000 per m(2)) than in the non-grazed population (16,228 per m(2)). This, if repeated in additional populations and ecologies may serve as an indication that, thorns in S. spinosum, as well as in other taxa, may increase in number as an induced defense response to browsing. In C. villosa, large shrubs taller than 1.0 m had ca. 900-22,500 thorns per plant. The average thorn density per m(2) was 6,290 in one population and 10,950 in the other.

AB Dendropoma maximum is a sessile marine gastropod that inhabits reef flats along a distinct, shallow, sub-tidal zone and uses mucus nets for passive suspension feeding. We tested the hypothesis that surface waves improve food capture by animals inhabiting the surf zone. D. maximum feeds mainly on suspended detrital particles that are highly abundant in its habitat. Its feeding strategy depends on ambient currents, not only for the transport of suspended particles to the filtering apparatus but also for the spreading of the mucus net and for determining its shape and size. Using an in situ experiment, we observed a 1.7-fold decrease in prey capture rates among animals transplanted from the surf zone to 5 m depth, where most of the flow was unidirectional. Part of the reduction in feeding rate could be attributed to a lower concentration of detrital particles at the deeper habitat. However, laboratory experiments in a recirculating flume showed that the mucus net produced by the animals under oscillatory flow was larger than under unidirectional flow. D. maximum is well-adapted for trapping detrital particles under the unique hydrodynamic conditions in the surf zone.

AB We investigated the pollination system and movement patterns of pollinators among flowers of the nectarless, monoecious vine Akebia quinata in natural populations and experimental floral arrays. Female flowers did not offer any rewards for pollinators and were larger than male flowers. Pollinators of A. quinata , such as small solitary bees and hoverflies, clearly discriminated between male and female flowers. Hoverflies always visited male flowers and rarely visited female flowers. In contrast, solitary bees tended to visit female flowers first when entering the array, but then switched to male flowers within the same foraging bout. This tendency disappeared when the sepal size of female flowers was experimentally reduced to the size of male flowers. Thus, observed non-randomness in flower choice by solitary bees may be caused by female > male sexual dimorphism and may increase the chance of cross-pollination and lower the probability of geitonogamous pollination in a single visit to a plant. Therefore, floral sexual dimorphism in A. quinata is considered to be an adaptation for deceptive pollination associated with discriminating pollinators.

AB The development, calibration, and application of a dynamic two-dimensional mass balance model for dissolved oxygen (DO) for rivers are documented for the first time accommodating the oxygen demand associated with zebra mussels. The test system is a short (2.3 km) phytoplankton-rich section of the Seneca River, N.Y., which is believed to represent an upper bound of the impact of this exotic invader on oxygen resources because of the unusually high population densities and limited turbulent mixing that prevail. Model calibration is supported by comprehensive measurements of DO, which resolve diurnal and seasonal patterns, and various forcing conditions over a four-month period. Wide temporal variations in the areal consumption rate of DO by zebra mussels [zebra mussel oxygen demand (ZOD), g . m(-2) . day(-1)] were determined through model calibration. These determinations are supported by closure with earlier estimates based on simple DO budget calculations, and with laboratory biomass-specific oxygen consumption rates published in the scientific literature, Values of ZOD at times (e.g., > 50 g . m(-2) . day(-1)) were an order of magnitude greater than the sediment oxygen demand associated with organically enriched deposits. The model performs well in simulating important features of the complex patterns of DO observed, including (1) DO depletion across the study section; (2) vertical DO stratification, and (3) diurnal changes. ZOD was the dominant sink for DO over the river study section; it was entirely responsible for the substantial observed DO depletion, and it was the major cause of the DO stratification during periods of low flow. A preliminary extension of the model is demonstrated to be successful in simulating the persistence of DO depletion 15 km downstream. The model is expected to have management utility for this and other phytoplankton-rich rivers that have been, or will be, invaded by zebra mussels.

AB We studied the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, inhabiting parks, cemeteries, suburban woods, and other green areas in the city of Prague. To assess the character displacement and (or) release hypothesis we compared seven samples from local populations occurring sympatrically with Apodemus flavicollis with 10 samples from those localities in which A. flavicollis has never been recorded. The analysis included 1410 specimens of A. sylvaticus collected during the years 1980-1990. Seventeen skull and body characters were measured. Then the data were age- or size-adjusted and treated by principal-component analyses. Factor scores were further subjected to statistical testing. Although the results revealed considerable variation among localities, they did not suggest character displacement and (or) release. Apodemus sylvaticus from populations sympatric with A. flavicollis were morphometrically similar to their conspecifics from other populations collected at the periphery of the city. However, slight but statistically highly significant differences were found between samples from localities in the city centre and those from the periphery. This phenomenon may be interpreted as the effect of urbanisation or isolation by built-up areas.

AB In 1995 we initiated a study in a nature preserve invaded by Alliaria petiolata (Bieb.) Cavara & Grande (garlic mustard) to determine if repeated dormant-season bums would affect A. petiolata abundance and understory community composition. Preburn data were collected in summer 1995 at lowland and upland sites. Mid-intensity fall burns occurred in 1995 and 1996 at the lowland site and in 1995, 1996, and 1997 at the upland site. We monitored the understory community in the summers of 1995 to 1998 along permanent transects, conducted a one-time plot study of the spring under story community in 1998, and also recorded information on the populations of woody seedlings and saplings in 1995 and 1998. Mid-summer sampling showed that unburned and burned plots had similar long-term trends in A. petiolata populations. At both sites there was no significant effect of burning on either A. petiolata abundance or relative importance. In spring 1998 burned plots had significantly higher densities of A. petiolata flowering stems, lower densities of seedlings, and higher importance of A. petiolata. Although garlic mustard is not fire-tolerant, several factors contribute to population persistence under a repeated burning regimen. Our research corroborates previous studies demonstrating that dormant-season burning is not a viable approach for A. petiolata control. Repeated long-term monitoring of thr summer plant community suggested that burning induced a directional change in lowland plots hut not in the upland plots. Eupatorium rugosum Houtt. and Pilea pumila (L.) Gray responded positively to burning. Monitoring of the spring 1998 community showed that A. petiolata responded to burning with increased importance, whereas Galium aparine (L.) and Stellaria media (L.) Cyrillo (lowland site) responded to burning with decreased importance. Burning had no significant effect on species richness. Responses of woody seedlings and saplings to burning were site-specific. At the upland site, burning accelerated the loss of woody seedlings and saplings. The utility of dormant-season burning in deciduous forests probably will depend on a choice between management goals for understory structure and those far species composition.

AB The Mediterranean coast in Egypt extends almost 900 Irm, the major part of which is bordered by sand dunes of different natures and types. Along the coastline between Alexandria and El-Alamein, a distance of some 100 km, the sand dunes represent a particular landscape with special characteristics and features, and consequently plants with particular attributes. In this area, the belt of sand dunes has developed immediately south of the shore and these dunes may rise up to 10 m in height and extend about 0.5-1.5 km inland from the shore. These dunes are famous as a habitat for the fig (Ficus carica L.) cultivation depending on the irregular rainfall. They also represent a landing station and a cross-road for birds such as quail migrating from Europe in the north. In the past, summer resort areas were confined to limited areas with few people, these same areas support the growth of some important plant species, for example, sand binders, medicinal and range plants.
   For more than two decades, there has been considerable socio-economic change and an open-door policy in the economy of the country has been adopted. One of the consequences of this change is that a great part of the coastal dune belt west of Alexandria till El-Alamein, has been subjected to destruction, due to the continuous construction of summer resort villages. These were built at a distance of about 100 m of the shoreline, extending 400-600 m inland and a breadth of 400 m or more along the shoreline. The area already covered by the dunes is now almost occupied by new buildings, gardens and other infrastructure.
   The consequences of these human activities are numerous and include impacts on the soil, water resources, the flora and the fauna, migrating birds, trends of the indigenous people, and the cultural environment. The present paper gives a concise environmental setting of the dune belt before the advent of the new activities, and the socio-economic and political attitudes which threaten the dunes. The ecological consequences of the recent human activities and recommendations are presented. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB Lake Kinneret (Israel) has undergone several prominent chemical and biological changes since 1970. Between 1970 and 1991 significant, long-term gradual increase were recorded in epilimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (about 20%), and in pH levels (0.2 units). Concomitantly there was a significant increase in hypolimnetic H2S concentrations (about 75%) and a long-term gradual drop in zooplankton biomass (50%). Since 1994 these trends were reversed and the levels of the three chemical parameters have returned to those found in the 1970's and that of zooplankton to mid 1980's levels. The present study is an attempt to relate some of these long term changes by means of yearly oxygen budgets, based on fluxes of oxygen producing and consuming processes. This analysis raises the possibility that part of the long-term increase in epilimnetic DO and pH between 1970 to 1990 may be attributed to reduced inputs of organic matter from alochthonous sources and possibly to enhanced burial of organic matter in the bed sediments. However, the major cause for the observed increase in epilimnetic DO and pH is increased sedimentation of organic matter to the hypolimnion during stratification. As indicated by the amount of H2S formed in the hypolimnion during stratification added to the amount of oxygen entrapped in this layer at the onset of thermal stratification, between 1970 to 1991 the sedimentation flux of organic matter increased by approximately 40%. It is estimated that during these two decades hypolimnetic respiration increased from ca. 8% of the annual amount of oxygen evolved due to photosynthesis during the early 1970's to ca. 12.5% during the 1980's. The shift in the layer of oxidative processes is suggested to be the result of a multi-annual decline in zooplankton grazing pressure, which led to increased sedimentation of organic matter. The reversed trends for DO, pH;md H2S since 1994 may have partially been due to the increase in zooplankton activity and partially due to changes in phytoplankton community structure.

However, a delay in seed dispersal has been observed in at least 10 species of geophytes inhabiting the Negev Desert. These species can be divided into three groups according to their life cycle, time of flowering, seed maturation as well as seed dispersal (synaptospermy). At least some of their seeds are retained in the dry inflorescences until October or even January. These seeds are not collected by ants, which is a great advantage for the survival of the species.

AB We studied the distribution of niches in the resource space and niche patterns of a 9-rodent-species community of the Thar desert (Western Rajasthan, India) using discriminant function analysis. We measured eighteen quantitative parameters of the environment (soil structure and vegetation) at 375 sample plots within 15 1-ha grids. The first two canonical axes of resource space account for 95 % of the variance ; the first axis accounting for 89.6 % of the variance represents a general landscape gradient from sand desert with sparse shrub vegetation to sandy - clay soils with dense annual grass vegetation of semi-savannah type. The second axis reflects a gradient of increasing gravel in the substrata with decreasing crown volumes of perennial vegetation. The distribution of niches in the resource space reflects the complex structure of the environment. Considerable opposition of a typical desert psammophilous Gerbillus gleadowi to all other species is a characteristic of geographical location and young age of Rajasthan sand desert. There were no significant correlations between niche position (distance from species centroid to the center of the resource space) and maximal population density or biomass. Also, there were no significant correlations between the niche breadth and the niche position due to the absence of species with quite broad niches. The rodent biomass increased along the first, and, to a lesser extent along the second axis of the resource space and peaked in the most productive semi-savannah areas. Rodent species diversity also increased in parallel fashion, but a more complex, hump-shaped pattern of variation was noted. This could be viewed as a result of a complex structure of the environment and historical events in origin of the fauna.

AB The biofilter system proposed and tested here, for upgrading irrigation water, is based upon the use of a carbonaceous material, such as wheat straw, as a substrate for microbial activity. Microorganisms degrading a carbon-rich and nitrogen-poor substrate are expected to take up nitrogen from the water. When wastewater flows along a column of the carbonaceous substrate, a sequence of nitrification and denitrification is also possible. Moreover, the biofilter may ''trap'' phosphorus, suspended matter and possibly soluble organic matter. Each biofilter (a l m3 PVC tank containing 50 kg of wheat straw) was fed by water from an oxidation pond at a rate of 60-65 l h-1. The biofilter system performed with no clogging or other hydraulic problems for a period of 63 days. The capacity of the filter was at least 2 m3 water for each kg of straw.
   The biofilter removed 50% of the ammonium from the input water, 65% of the suspended matter and 75% of the algal biomass. In addition, the leachates from the biofilter were more uniform than the raw pond water, the composition of which fluctuated within a wide range.
   Besides its smooth operation, the raw straw was enriched with protein during the operation of the filter. The initial protein content of the straw (about 3%) rising to 12-15% by the end of the experiment. It is anticipated that the spent straw may be used as a manure, or, probably following silage, as a valuable feed material.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS

DT Article
DE BIOECONOMIC; INTENSIVE EARLY STOCKING; SEASON-LONG STOCKING
AB This paper examines the bioeconomic conditions under which the recently popular intensive-early-stocking (IES) strategy outperforms the conventional season-long-stocking (SLS) strategy as a response to the deterioration of forage nutrients over the latter stages of the grazing season.  The economic performances of the IES and SLS strategies are compared to a dynamically optimal grazing policy that continually fine tunes stocking rates to account for declining forage nutrients.  The comparisons yield a range of qualitative properties under which the IES strategy tends to approximate better the optimal strategy, some of which are investigated in a numerical illustration.

AB The development of desalination has been essential to the rapid economic development of the countries bordering the Arabian Gulf. The current production capacity of sea water desalination plants drawing water from Gulf is over 20 million m(3) day(-1), which may rise to 80 million m(3) day(-1) by 2050. Whilst supporting aspects of sustainable development related to water and sanitation, desalination impacts the marine environment through impingement and entrainment of organisms in intakes, and through thermal, brine and chemical discharges. This may compromise other objectives for sustainable development related to sustainable use of the oceans. Under business as usual scenarios, by 2050, the impact of individual desalination plants will combine causing a regional scale impact. Without mitigating actions to avoid the business as usual scenario, by 2050, desalination in combination with climate change, will elevate coastal water temperatures across more than 50% of the Gulf by at least 3 degrees C, and a volume of water equivalent to more than a third of the total volume of water between 0 and 10 m deep will pass through desalination plants each year. This will adversely impact the coastal ecosystem of the Gulf, with impacts on biodiversity, fisheries and coastal communities and may cause potential loss of species and habitats from the Gulf. Given the significant implications of these preliminary findings, and in light of the precautionary approach to management, it is recommended that mitigating options addressing behavioural, regulatory and technological change are rapidly evaluated and implemented to avoid the development of desalination in the region along a business as usual pathway, and multidisciplinary research studies should be conducted to reduce uncertainty in predictions of future impacts.

AB The cement manufacturing industry has played a fundamental role in global economic development, but its production is a major facilitator to anthropogenic CO2 release and solid waste generation. Nigeria has the largest cement industry in West Africa, with an aggregate capacity of 58.9 million metric tonnes (MMT) per year. The Ministry for Mines and Steel Development asserts that the nation possesses total limestone deposits of around 2.3 trillion MT with 568 MMT standing as established reserves and 11 MMT used. Cement industries are largely responsible for releasing air pollutants and effluents into water bodies with apparent water quality deterioration over the years. Air pollution from lime and cement-producing plants is seen as a severe instigator of occupational health hazards and work-related life threats, negatively affecting crop yields, buildings, and persons residing in the vicinity of these industries. World Bank observed in 2015 that 94% of the Nigerian populace is susceptible to air pollutants that surpass WHO guidelines. In 2017, World Bank further reported that 49,100 premature deaths emanated from atmospheric PM2.5, with children beneath age 5 having the greatest vulnerability owing to lower respiratory infections, thereby representing approximately 60% of overall PM2.5-induced deaths. Cement manufacturing involves the significant production of SO2, NOx, and CO connected to adverse health effects on humans. Sensitive populations such as infants, the aged, and persons having underlying respiratory ailments like asthmatics, emphysema, or bronchitis are seen to be most affected. Consequently, in addressing this challenge, growing interests in enacting carbon capture, usage, and storage in the cement industry is expected to alleviate the negative environmental impact of cement production. Still, no carbon capture technology is yet to achieve commercialization in the cement industry. Nonetheless, huge advancement has been made in recent years with the advent of vital research in sorption-enhanced water gas shift, underground gasification combined cycle, ammonium hydroxide solution, and the microbial-induced synthesis of calcite for CO2 capture and storage, all considered sustainable and feasible in cement production.

AB Vegetation patterning in water-limited and other resource-limited ecosystems highlights spatial self-organization processes as potentially key drivers of community assembly. These processes provide insight into predictable landscape-level relationships between organisms and their abiotic environment in the form of regular and irregular patterns of biota and resources. However, two aspects have largely been overlooked; the roles played by plant - soil-biota feedbacks and allelopathy in spatial self-organization, and their potential contribution, along with plant-resource feedbacks, to community assembly through spatial self-organization. Here, we expand the drivers of spatial self-organization from a focus on plant-resource feedbacks to include plant - soil-biota feedbacks and allelopathy, and integrate concepts of nonlinear physics and community ecology to generate a new hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, below-ground processes can affect community assemblages through two types of spatial self-organization, global and local. The former occurs simultaneously across whole ecosystems, leading to self-organized patterns of biota, allelochemicals and resources, and niche partitioning. The latter occurs locally in ecotones, and determines ecotone structure and motion, invasion dynamics, and species coexistence. Studies of the two forms of spatial self-organization are important for understanding the organization of plant communities in drier climates which are likely to involve spatial patterning or re-patterning. Such studies are also important for developing new practices of ecosystem management, based on local manipulations at ecotones, to slow invasion dynamics or induce transitions from transitive to intransitive networks of interspecific interactions which increase species diversity.

AB Climate models project greater weather variability over the coming decades. High yielding systems that can maintain stable crop yields under variable environmental scenarios are critical to enhance food security. However, the effect of adding a trophic level (i.e. herbivores) on the long-term stability of agricultural systems is not well understood. We used a 16-year dataset from an integrated soybean-beef cattle experiment to measure the impacts of grazing on the stability of key crop, pasture, animal and whole-system outcomes. Treatments consisted of four grazing intensities (10, 20, 30 and 40 cm sward height) on mixed black oat (Avena strigosa) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) pastures and an ungrazed control. Stability of both human-digestible protein production and profitability increased at moderate to light grazing intensities, while over-intensification or absence of grazing decreased system stability. Grazing did not affect subsequent soybean yields but reduced the chance of crop failure and financial loss in unfavorable years. At both lighter and heavier grazing intensities, tradeoffs occurred between the stability of herbage production and animal live weight gains. We show that ecological intensification of specialized soybean systems using livestock integration can increase system stability and profitability, but the probability of win-win outcomes depends on management.

AB In his seminal work in the 1970s, Robert May suggested that there is an upper limit to the number of species that can be sustained in stable equilibrium by an ecosystem. This deduction was at odds with both intuition and the observed complexity of many natural ecosystems. The so-called stability-diversity debate ensued, and the discussion about the factors contributing to ecosystem stability or instability continues to this day. We show in this work that dispersal can be a destabilising influence. To do this, we combine ideas from Alan Turing's work on pattern formation with May's random-matrix approach. We demonstrate how a stable equilibrium in a complex ecosystem with trophic structure can become unstable with the introduction of dispersal in space, and we discuss the factors which contribute to this effect. Our work highlights that adding more details to the model of May can give rise to more ways for an ecosystem to become unstable. Making May's simple model more realistic is therefore unlikely to entirely remove the upper bound on complexity.

AB Aim The eco-geographical Bergmann's rule predicts that animals have smaller body size in warmer regions than in cold environments because of thermoregulatory reasons. Although this rule has been widely investigated, intraspecific analyses on cosmopolitan taxa are rare. We examined whether geographical variation in wing length, a proxy of body size, shows a Bergmannian pattern and can be explained by three mechanisms known to affect animal body size (heat conservation, resource availability and starvation resistance) in seven species of nocturnal raptors of the genusTyto. Location World. Taxon GenusTyto. Methods We measured wing length of 9,033 museum specimens covering the entire distributional range of each species and linked it with geographical (absolute latitude, elevation) and climatic predictors associated with heat conservation, resource availability and starvation resistance hypotheses of spatial variation in body size. Results All the species show a trend of increasing wing length with increasing latitude and/or elevation, and in five of them either or both geographical predictors are statistically significant. In all the species showing a Bergmannian pattern, wing length significantly decreases with temperature, thus supporting the heat conservation hypothesis. Conversely, we found less generalized support for the other hypotheses, although in some species significant trends between wing length and proxies of climatic seasonality and/or primary productivity emerged. Main conclusions Consistent clines in body shrinking in warm environments are observed in species living in different continents at different latitudinal and temperature ranges, as well as exploiting different habitats. These findings thus support the hypothesis that body size is, at least partly, selected for heat maintenance depending on the thermal environment, even in nocturnal species which are not directly exposed to solar radiation. However, different selective pressures may also have concomitantly acted to promote body size evolution in this bird group.

AB Streptomycesare involved in the deterioration of cultural heritage materials through several pathways, the most important of these are biomineralization and bio-pigment production. The biomineralization pathway can occur through the precipitation of calcite, silica, barytes, hydromagnesite and iron compounds on colonized paintings and on stone surfaces with paintings in relief.Streptomycesbiomineralize boron although it was confirmed in biodeterioration of cultural heritage materials. The other pathway occurs via bio pigment production and the most common of these biopigments are melanin with colors ranging from black through brown to olive, carotenoids with colors ranging from red, yellow, and pink through to violet and thirdly, actinorhodin-related blue pigments.

AB The shifts among bloom-forming cyanobacteria have attracted increasing attention due to the reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus during the eutrophication mitigation process. However, knowledge is limited regarding the pattern and drivers of the shifts among these cyanobacterial genera. In this study, we performed a 7-year long, monthly investigation in Lake Chaohu, to analyze the interannual and seasonal shifts between Microcystis and Dolichospermum. Our results showed that Microcystis was the dominant cyanobacterium in the western lake region in summer, whereas Dolichospermum was dominant in the other regions and seasons. The Microcystis biomass and ratio were driven primarily by total phosphorus and temperature. The sensitivity of Dolichospermum to nutrients and temperature was relatively weak compared to that of Microcystis. The shifts between Microcystis and Dolichospermum might be led by Microcystis. If the temperature and phosphorus level were relatively high, then Microcystis grew rapidly, and competitively excluded Dolichospermum. If the nutrient level, especially the phosphorus level, was low, then the exclusive power of Microcystis was weak, and Dolichospermum maintained its dominance, even in summer. The key temperature (similar to 17 degrees C) determined the dominance of the two cyanobacteria. Microcystis never dominated, while Dolichospermum was always dominant below the key temperature. Microcystis and Dolichospermum had different means of responding to the interaction of temperature, nitrogen and phosphorus. The Dolichospermum biomass was sensitive to the variation in nitrogen level, and the sensitivity depended on temperature. While the Microcystis biomass was sensitive to the variation in phosphorus level, and the sensitivity depended on temperature and total nitrogen. The different ways might contribute to the succession of the two cyanobacteria. Our findings will be helpful for improving the understanding of the shift process between Microcystis and Dolichospermum.

AB The "resource availability hypothesis" predicts occurrence of larger rodents in more productive habitats. This prediction was tested in a dataset of 1,301 rodent species. We used adult body mass as a measure of body size and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of habitat productivity. We utilized a cross-species approach to investigate the association between these variables. This was done at both the order level (Rodentia) and at narrower taxonomic scales. We applied phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) to correct for phylogenetic relationships. The relationship between body mas and NDVI was also investigated across rodent assemblages. We controlled for spatial autocorrelation using generalized least squares (GLS) analysis. The cross-species approach found extremely low support for the resource availability hypothesis. This was reflected by a weak positive association between body mass and NDVI at the order level. We find a positive association in only a minority of rodent subtaxa. The best fit GLS model detected no significant association between body mass and NDVI across assemblages. Thus, our results do not support the view that resource availability plays a major role in explaining geographic variation in rodent body size.

AB Disentangling the multiple factors controlling species diversity is a major challenge in ecology. Island biogeography and environmental filtering are two influential theories emphasizing respectively island size and isolation, and the abiotic environment, as key drivers of species richness. However, few attempts have been made to quantify their relative importance and investigate their mechanistic basis. Here, we applied structural equation modelling, a powerful method allowing test of complex hypotheses involving multiple and indirect effects, on an island-like system of 22 French Guianan neotropical inselbergs covered with rock-savanna. We separated the effects of size (rock-savanna area), isolation (density of surrounding inselbergs), environmental filtering (rainfall, altitude) and dispersal filtering (forest-matrix openness) on the species richness of all plants and of various ecological groups (terrestrial versus epiphytic, small-scale versus large-scale dispersal species). We showed that the species richness of all plants and terrestrial species was mainly explained by the size of rock-savanna vegetation patches, with increasing richness associated with higher rock-savanna area, while inselberg isolation and forest-matrix openness had no measurable effect. This size effect was mediated by an increase in terrestrial-habitat diversity, even after accounting for increased sampling effort. The richness of epiphytic species was mainly explained by environmental filtering, with a positive effect of rainfall and altitude, but also by a positive size effect mediated by enhanced woody-plant species richness. Inselberg size and environmental filtering both explained the richness of small-scale and large-scale dispersal species, but these ecological groups responded in opposite directions to altitude and rainfall, that is positively for large-scale and negatively for small-scale dispersal species. Our study revealed both habitat diversity associated with island size and environmental filtering as major drivers of neotropical inselberg plant diversity and showed the importance of plant species growth form and dispersal ability to explain the relative importance of each driver.

AB Aim We mapped the geographical pattern of body sizes in sphingid moths and investigated latitudinal clines. We tested hypotheses concerning their possible environmental control, that is, effects of temperature (negative: temperature size rule or Bergmann's rule; positive: converse Bergmann rule), food availability, robustness to starvation during extreme weather and seasonality. Location Old World and Australia/Pacific region. Methods Body size data of 950 sphingid species were compiled and related to their distribution maps. Focusing on body length, we mapped the median and maximum size of all species occurring in 100 km grid cells. In a comparative approach, we tested the predictions from explanatory hypotheses by correlating species' size to the average environmental conditions encountered throughout their range, under univariate and multivariate models. We accounted for phylogeny by stepwise inclusion of phylogenetically informed taxonomic classifications into hierarchical random-intercept mixed models. Results Median body sizes showed a distinctive geographical pattern, with large species in the Middle East and the Asian tropics, and smaller species in temperate regions and the Afrotropics. Absolute latitude explained very little body size variation, but there was a latitudinal cline of maximum size. Species' median size was correlated with net primary productivity, supporting the food availability hypothesis, whereas support for other hypotheses was weak. Environmental correlations contributed much less (i.e. <10%) to explaining overall size variation than phylogeny (inclusion of which led to models explaining >70% of variability). Main conclusion The intuitive impression of larger species in the tropics is shaped by larger size maxima. Median body sizes are only very weakly related to latitude. Most of the geographical variation in body size in sphingid moths is explained by their phylogenetic past. NPP and forest cover correlate positively with the body size, which supports the idea that food availability allowed the evolution of larger sizes.

AB Aim We examined body size scaling relationships for two developmental life stages of parasitic helminths (egg and adult) separately in relationship to latitude (i.e. Bergmann's rule), temperature and temperature seasonality. Given that helminth eggs experience environmental conditions more directly, whereas adults live inside infected host individuals, we predict stronger environmentally driven gradients of body size for eggs than for adults. Location Global. Time period Present day. Major taxa studied Parasitic helminths. Methods We compiled egg size and adult body size data (both minimum and maximum) for 265 parasitic helminth species from the literature, along with species latitudinal distribution information using an extensive global helminth occurrence database. We then examined how the average helminth egg and adult body size of all helminth species present (minimum and maximum separately) scaled with latitude, temperature and temperature variability, using generalized linear models. Results Both the egg size and the adult body size of helminths tended to decrease towards higher latitudes, although we found the opposite body size scaling pattern for their host species. Helminth sizes were also positively correlated with temperature and negatively, but more weakly, with temperature seasonality. Main conclusions Instead of following the body size patterns of their hosts, helminth parasites are more similar to other ectotherms in that they follow the converse Bergmann's rule. This pattern did not differ between helminth developmental stages, suggesting that mean annual temperature and seasonality are unlikely to be related mechanistically to body size variation in this case.

AB Soundscapes are vital to acoustically specialized animals. Using passive acoustic monitoring data, the temporal and spectral variations in the soundscape of a Chinese white dolphin hotspot were analyzed. By cluster analysis, the 1/3 octave band power spectrum can be grouped into three bands with median overall contribution rates of 35.24, 14.14 and 30.61%. Significant diel and tidal soundscape variations were observed with a generalized linear model. Temporal patterns and frequency ranges of middle frequency band sound matched well with those of fish vocalization, indicating that fish might serve as a signal source. Dolphin sounds were mainly detected in periods involving low levels of ambient sound and without fish vocalization, which could reflect noise avoidance and passive eavesdropping behaviors engaged in by the predator. Pre-construction data can be used to assess the effects of offshore windfarms on acoustic environments and aquatic animals by comparing them with the soundscape of postconstruction and/or postmitigation.

AB 1. Body size is associated with many aspects of the life history, ecology and physiology of animals. Within a species, body size can vary substantially across space and time, and the mechanisms generating these patterns have been the focus of evolutionary and ecology research.
   2. Bergmann's rule predicts a negative relationship between body size and temperature across the geographic range of endothermic animals; larger animals have a lower surface to volume ratio, which would allow for greater heat conservation. Despite the broad support for this pattern, its underlying mechanisms are heavily debated. Numerous alternative explanations have been proposed to explain why larger animals are found in colder climates and vice versa, including heat dissipation, environmental seasonality and resource availability.
   3. We used the Pallid bat, Antrozous pallidus, as a model to evaluate Bergmannian size patterns and the relative support for major explanatory hypotheses of geographic body size variation. We tested the hypothesis that geographic size variation is predicted by productivity, as opposed to seasonality, heat conservation or dissipation, or some combination of these processes. Additionally, we investigated the potential ecomorphological consequences of size variation in Pallid bats by determining if skull shape (an indicator of bite performance) varies with size.
   4. Whereas we did find that Pallid bat populations in northern latitudes are composed of larger individuals, our results suggest that net primary productivity and, to a lesser extent heat conservation, best explain size variation throughout the western range of this species. We also found that skull shape in Pallid bats changes in tandem with skull size, with larger bats having cranial traits associated with greater bite force production.
   5. The results of our study indicate that variation in resource availability may be a key factor underlying spatial patterns in size, morphology and, possibly, feeding performance within wide-ranging bat species.

AB Semiarid ecosystems (including arid, semiarid and dry-subhumid ecosystems) span more than 40% of extant habitats and contain a similar percentage of the human population. Theoretical models and palaeoclimatic data predict a grim future, with rapid shifts towards a desert state, with accelerated diversity losses and ecological collapses. These shifts are a consequence of the special nonlinearities resulting from ecological facilitation. Here, we investigate a simple model of semiarid ecosystems identifying the so-called ghost, which appears after a catastrophic transition from a vegetated to a desert state once a critical rate of soil degradation is overcome. The ghost involves a slowdown of transients towards the desert state, making the ecosystem seem stable even though vegetation extinction is inevitable. We use this model to show how to exploit the ecological ghosts to avoid collapse. Doing so involves the restoration of small fractions of desert areas with vegetation capable of maintaining a stable community once the catastrophic shift condition has been achieved. This intervention method is successfully tested under the presence of demographic stochastic fluctuations.

AB A live-bearing reproductive strategy can induce large morphological changes in the mother during pregnancy. The evolution of the placenta in swimming animals involves a shift in the timing of maternal provisioning from pre-fertilization (females supply their eggs with sufficient yolk reserves prior to fertilization) to post-fertilization (females provide all nutrients via a placenta during the pregnancy). It has been hypothesised that this shift, associated with the evolution of the placenta, should confer a morphological advantage to the females leading to a more slender body shape during the early stages of pregnancy. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying three-dimensional shape and volume changes during pregnancy and in full-grown virgin controls of two species within the live-bearing fish family Poeciliidae: Poeciliopsis gracilis (non-placental) and Poeciliopsis turneri (placental). We show that P. turneri is more slender than P. gracilis at the beginning of the interbrood interval and in virgins, and that these differences diminish towards the end of pregnancy. This study provides the first evidence for an adaptive morphological advantage of the placenta in live-bearing fish. A similar morphological benefit could drive the evolution of placentas in other live-bearing (swimming) animal lineages.

AB Although widespread, actions aiming at the restoration of native species populations within their indigenous range still lack a clear definition of success, given the high degree of variability in species needs. In this sense, to understand and manage the mechanisms that lead to reintroduction or reinforcement failures may be a more feasible alternative to ensure conservation objectives. In this study, we aimed to systematize the main drivers that can negatively impact bird population restoration according to researchers and practitioners. Thus, a systematic review was performed in peer-reviewed journals, identifying 75 attempts, conducted from 1990 to 2016, in 30 countries involving 64 bird species and subspecies. Thirteen drivers that negatively impact reintroduction or reinforcement attempts were identified, where predation, unexpected dispersal movement and diseases were the main factors. We believe that if these drivers were prioritized during pre-release planning and post-release monitoring, restoration population programs would be more successful.

AB Many crab fisheries around the world are managed by size, sex and season, where males are given at least one opportunity to reproduce before being harvested. Golden king crab (Lithodes aequispinus) supports a commercial fishery in Southeast Alaska and legal size is based on growth and maturity information from other parts of their range. Size-at-maturity estimates varied for crabs among Seven management areas in Southeast Alaska, where male maturity estimates increased in size with increases in latitude, while maturity estimates across their North Pacific range decreased in size with increases in latitude. Depth, temperature and harvest history were not related to variation observed in male maturity estimates. Management implications from this research include reducing legal size in some areas to maximize harvest potential and increasing in others to allow male crabs the opportunity to reproduce before being harvested. A more conservative strategy would incorporate the largest maturity estimate, thus increasing the legal size which would have a negative impact to the commercial fishery, but allow male crabs the opportunity to reproduce before being harvested. This study shows the importance of understanding how life-history characteristics change over space and the challenge incorporating spatial variability for improved fisheries management.

AB Natural populations of a Rivularia-like cyanobacterium were collected from the carbonate deposits of the temporarily flooded littoral zone of a hypersaline, high elevation lake, The Laguna Negra, Andes, Argentina. Subsequently, the cyanobacterial strain PUNA-NP3, named after its origin (Puna Volcanic Plateau) was isolated from these Rivularia-like rounded, pillow-like, black microbial mats. None of the previously described species of the genus Rivularia occupy inland, hypersaline aquatic environments. After morphological examination of this strain, we found clear morphological autapomorphies, such as mucilaginous pads at the bases of the young trichomes, wide trichomes and filaments, and uniquely branched trichomes. Furthermore, based on results from 16S rRNA phylogeny and analysis of the 16S-23S ITS region, PUNA-NP3 was found to be an independent lineage of the evolutionary tree. Based on the combination of ecological, morphological and molecular evidence, we name strain PUNA-NP3 Rivularia halophila sp. nov. a new species under requirements of the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi and Plants.

AB Background. Repetitive species-specific sound enables the identification of the presence and behavior of soniferous species by acoustic means. Passive acoustic monitoring has been widely applied to monitor the spatial and temporal occurrence and behavior of calling species.
   Methods. Underwater biological sounds in the Pearl River Estuary China, were collected using passive acoustic monitoring with special attention paid to fish,sounds. A total of 1,408 suspected fish calls comprising 18,942 pulses were qualitatively analyzed using a customized acoustic analysis routine.
   Results. We identified a diversity of 66 types of fish sounds. In addition to single pulse, the sounds tended to have a pulse train structure. The pulses were characterized by an approximate 8 ms duration, with a peak frequency from 500 to 2,600 Hz and a majority of the energy below 4,000 Hz. The median inter-pulsepeak interval (IPPI) of most call types was 9 or 10 ms. Most call types with median IPPIs of 9 ms and 10 ms were observed at times that were exclusive from each other, suggesting that they might be produced by different species. According to the literature, the two section signal types of 1 + 1 and 1 + Nic, might belong to big-snout croaker (Johnius macrorhyuus), and 1 + N-19 might be produced by Belanger's croaker (J. belarigerii).
   Discussion. Categorization of the baseline ambient biological sound is an important first step in mapping the spatial and temporal patterns of soniferous fishes. The next step is the identification of the species producing each sound. The distribution pattern of soniferous fishes will be helpful for the protection and management of local fishery resources and in marine environmental impact assessment. Since the local vulnerable Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chineusis) mainly preys on soniferous fishes, the fine-scale distribution pattern of soniferous fishes can aid in the conservation of this species. Additionally, prey and predator relationships can be observed when a database of species-identified sounds is completed.

AB The ability to acquire water from the soil is a major driver in interspecific plant competition and it depends on several root functional traits. One of these traits is the excretion of gel-like compounds (mucilage) that modify physical soil properties. Mucilage secreted by roots becomes hydrophobic upon drying, impedes the rewetting of the soil close to the root, the so called rhizosphere, and reduces water availability to plants. The function of rhizosphere hydrophobicity is not easily understandable when looking at a single plant, but it may constitute a competitive advantage at the ecosystem level. We hypothesize that by making the top soil hydrophobic, deep-rooted plants avoid competititon with shallow-rooted plants. To test this hypothesis we used an individual-based model to simulate water uptake and growth of two virtual plant species, one deep-rooted plant capable of making the soil hydrophobic and a shallow-rooted plant. We ran scenarios with different precipitation regimes ranging from dry to wet (350, 700, and 1400 mm total annual precipitation) and from high to low precipitation frequencies (1, 7, and 14 days). Plant species abundance and biomass were chosen as indicators for competitiveness of plant species. At constant precipitation frequency mucilage hydrophobicity lead to a benefit in biomass and abundance of the tap-rooted population. Under wet conditions this effect diminished and tap-rooted plants were less productive. Without this trait both species coexisted. The effect of root exudation trait remained constant under different precipitation frequencies. This study shows that mucilage secretion is a competitive trait for the acquisition of water. This advantage is achieved by the modification of the soil hydraulic properties and specifically by inducing water repellency in soil regions which are shared with other species.

AB Atmospheric dust pollution, especially particulate matter below 2.5 mu m, causes 3.3 million premature deaths per year worldwide. Although pollution sources are increasingly well known, the role of ecosystems in mitigating their impact is still poorly known. Our objective was to investigate the role of forests located in the surrounding of industrial and urban areas in reducing atmospheric dust pollution. This was tested using lichen transplants as biomonitors in a Mediterranean regional area with high levels of dry deposition. After a multivariate analysis, we have modeled the maximum pollution load expected for each site taking into consideration nearby pollutant sources. The difference between maximum expected pollution load and the observed values was explained by the deposition in nearby forests. Both the dust pollution and the ameliorating effect of forested areas were then mapped. The results showed that forest located nearby pollution sources plays an important role in reducing atmospheric dust pollution, highlighting their importance in the provision of the ecosystem service of air purification.

   CONSERVATION; CRITERIA; EAGLE
AB Reintroductions have been increasingly used for species restoration and it seems that this conservation tool is going to be more used in the future. Nevertheless, there is not a clear consensus about the better procedure for that, consequently a better knowledge of how to optimize this kind of management is needed. Here we examined the dynamics of released long-lived bird populations (lesser kestrel, Falco naumanni, Bonelli's eagle Aquila fasciata, and bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus) in object-oriented simulated reintroduction programs. To do that, number of young per year and number of years of released necessary to achieve a successful reintroduced population were calculated. We define a successful reintroduction as one in which when the probability of extinction during two times the maximum live-span period for the species (20, 50, and 64 years respectively) was less than 0.001 (P<0.001) and they showed a positive trend in population size (r>0.00). Results showed that a similar total number of young (mean 98.33 +/- 5.26) must be released in all the species in all the scenarios in order to get a successful reintroduction. Consequently, as more young per year are released the new population is going to be larger at the end of the simulations, the lesser the negative effects in the donor population and the lowest the total budget needed will be.

AB Numerous environmental factors can influence body size. Comparing populations in different ecological contexts is one potential approach to elucidating the most critical of such factors. In the current study, we found that the body size of the land hermit crab Coenobita rugosus was significantly larger on Dongsha Island in the South China Sea than on other eco-islands around Southern Taiwan. We hypothesized that this could be due to differences in (1) shell resources, (2) parasite impact, (3) competition, (4) predation, and (5) food. We found no supporting evidence for the first three hypotheses; the shells used by the hermit crabs on Dongsha were in poorer condition than were those used elsewhere, extremely few individuals in the region had ectoparasites, and the density of hermit crabs varied considerably among localities within each island. However, significantly higher percentages of C. rugosus reached age 3 years on Dongsha than at Siziwan bay in Taiwan. Two growth rate indices inferred from size structures suggested faster growth on Dongsha than at Siziwan. The condition index (i. e., the body mass/shield length ratio of C. rugosus) was also greater on Dongsha than at Siziwan. Therefore, Dongsha hermit crabs seem to have superior diet and growth performance. Seagrass debris accumulation at the shore of Dongsha was considerable, whereas none was observed at Siziwan or on the other islands, where dicot leaves were the dominant food item for the vegetarian hermit crabs. We then experimentally evaluated the possible role of seagrass as food for C. rugosus. The crabs on Dongsha preferred seagrass to dicot leaves, and their growth increment was faster when they fed on seagrass than when they fed on dicot leaves; no such differences were found in the Siziwan hermit crabs. The aforementioned results are compatible with the food hypothesis explaining the size differences among the islands. The predator hypothesis could explain the greater life span but not the other findings. Populations of C. rugosus on islands with seagrass debris piles probably contribute more to the gene pool of the species because higher proportions of these populations could achieve high fecundity. The fate of these terrestrial hermit crabs may rely on the health of underwater seagrass ecosystems that are under threat from global change.

AB In the Mediterranean, the gastropod Dendropoma cristatum (sin. D. petraeum (Monterosato, 1884)) is the primary builder of the vermetid reef, an intertidal bioconstruction of exceptional ecological importance. Despite awareness of the need for conservation of this key species, the biology of D. cristatum remains poorly understood. The recruitment of D. cristatum deserves particular attention because the absence of a planktonic larval stage limits its dispersal ability. We examined the temporal pattern of recruitment during the breeding season of D. cristatum from June to September in 2013. Specifically, we compared the two portions of the vermetid reef (i.e. the inner edge and the outer edge) at localities with different exposures to wave motion. The number of recruits peaked in July, when it was significantly higher in the outer than in the inner edge. No differences emerged between localities with different wave exposures; however, the width of the reef was significantly related to the exposure index. Although there are still several gaps in our knowledge of the recruitment dynamics of D. cristatum, this study contributes to characterising recruitment rate variation at small spatial and temporal scales.

AB The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) is the most widely distributed nonhuman primate species in the world, with six subspecies distributed through China. From 2012 to 2014, we conducted studies on the body mass and morphological variation of the southernmost subspecies M. m. brevicaudus in Nanwan Nature Reserve for Rhesus Macaque, Hainan, China. We compared measurements with other populations of this species. We also investigated the inter-group body mass variation from seven provisioned free-ranging groups in our study site. Our results show that M. m. brevicaudus has the smallest body size, the smallest bodymass, and the shortest tail among rhesus macaque subspecies. Its sexual dimorphism score is also among the lowest, which is similar to other southern distributed subspecies in China, but smaller than northern distributed subspecies. We found that the average body mass of female macaques is not correlated with their dominance ranks. There are significant differences in body mass among the seven adjacent study groups at the same site, suggesting the existence of inter-group competition. Average body mass of a group is better described by a quadratic function of group size than a linear one as predicted by the socio-ecological model. Am. J. Primatol. 78: 679-698, 2016.

AB Sub-aerial biofilms (SAB) are ubiquitous, self-sufficient microbial ecosystems found on mineral surfaces at all altitudes and latitudes. SABs, which are the principal causes of weathering on exposed terrestrial surfaces, are characterized by patchy growth dominated by associations of algae, cyanobacteria, fungi and heterotrophic bacteria. A recently developed in vitro system to study colonization of rocks exposed to air included two key SAB participants - the rock-inhabiting ascomycete Knufia petricola (CBS 123872) and the phototrophic cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC29133. Both partners are genetically tractable and we used them here to study weathering of granite, K-feldspar and plagioclase. Small fragments of the various rocks or minerals (1-6 mm) were packed into flow-through columns and incubated with 0.1% glucose and 10 mu M thiamine-hydrochloride (90 mu L min(-1)) to compare weathering with and without biofilms. Dissolution of the minerals was followed by: (i) analysing the degradation products in the effluent from the columns via Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy and (ii) by studying polished sections of the incubated mineral fragments/grains using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analyses. K. petricola/N. punctiforme stimulated release of Ca, Na, Mg and Mn. Analyses of the polished sections confirmed depletion of Ca, Na and K near the surface of the fragments. The abrupt decrease in Ca concentration observed in peripheral areas of plagioclase fragments favored a dissolution-reprecipitation mechanism. Percolation columns in combination with a model biofilm can thus be used to study weathering in closed systems. Columns can easily be filled with different minerals and biofilms, the effluent as well as grains can be collected after long-term exposure under axenic conditions and easily analyzed.

AB Extremely high recruitment events can have profound impacts on marine population dynamics. To demonstrate the complexities surrounding extremely high recruitment and its impact on population assessments, Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) recruitment patterns from 2003 to 2014 were analyzed and the influence of these events on exploitable biomass and harvest numbers was examined. Since 2003, 2 extreme recruitment events have occurred within the scallop stock assessment area on Georges Bank and in the Mid-Atlantic. In 2003, about 12 billion (12 x 10(9)) recruits were present in the Mid-Atlantic, while the total scallop population was about 21 billion scallops. In 2014, about 31 billion recruits were present on Georges Bank, the largest recruit abundance ever recorded, while the total scallop population was about 39 billion scallops. A similar event was also observed outside of the traditional stock assessment area in the Gulf of Maine during 2009. These events dramatically improved the status of the resource. They were not correlated to increases in spawning stock biomass in prior years, suggesting scallop populations do not grow at a constant rate. This growth pattern may be explained based upon scallop fecundity, heterogeneity in scallop distribution, and the importance of early life-history factors. This scenario is not exclusive to scallops and suggests a mismatch between marine population ecology and fisheries management. This mismatch might be rectified through better recognition of ecological and environmental factors, but the complexities surrounding recruitment, exemplified by extremely high recruitment events, suggest a continued need for adaptable management based upon empirical data.

AB Bergmann's rule is one of the most known biological rules and relates the body size variation to changes in latitude or temperature. Most recently, a "resource rule" had been presented, which explains several trends in body size, as a consequence of availability of resources. South American Conepatus chinga is one of the most widespread small carnivores in the Neotropics, being geographically distributed from Peril and Brazil to southern Argentina and Chile. This widely distributed species encounters a high environmental variability, which could affect body size and morphological variations. Here, I analyze geographical patterns of variation in body size and morphology estimated using a geometric morphometric approach from museum specimens. The associations between geographical patterns of variation in body size and morphometry and climatic and/or environmental variables were evaluated, using several databases and multiple regressions and redundancy analysis. Throughout the study, the presence of spatial autocorrelation was analyzed, and Spatial Eigenvector Mapping (SEVM) was used. The arid diagonal was identified as containing the smaller specimens of C chinga, primarily related to net primary productivity (NPP). Bergmann's rule seems not to be valid for this species. Instead, evidence seems to support the "resource rule" as the primarily explanation for body size variation. A lower amount of morphological variation was explained by NPP, mainly related to relative size variation of premolar and molars. (C) 2014 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

AB Some coral restoration efforts are involving cultivation of coral microfragments in land-based pools under controlled conditions until they reach viable size for outplanting. However, gaps in knowledge with these efforts include effects of changing pH on regeneration rates of tissue lesions and other physiological responses on different size fragments. To address this, two fragment sizes of Porites porites and Porites astreoides were artificially inflicted with lesions and incubated in two pH treatments to follow effects on recovery and physiological performance. Recovery was significantly reduced at reduced pH for P. porites in both fragment sizes; while recovery of P. astreoides was reduced only in the larger fragments. Different responses were also seen for Symbiodinium density and total protein with pH and fragment size. Effects on lesion recovery rate from pH and fragment size were species specific and may be related to morphology and/or energetic constrains. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The spatial competition between two plant species that make different compromises in capturing soil water and sunlight is studied using a mathematical model. A precipitation range along the rainfall gradient is identified where two alternative stable states coexist. The first state describes a uniform distribution of a plant species that specializes in capturing soil water, whereas the second state describes a periodic pattern of a species that specializes in capturing light. We show that this bistability range generally divides into three parts according to the dynamics of the front or ecotone that separates the two plant populations: a low precipitation range where the superior competitor for water displaces the superior competitor for light, a high precipitation range where the displacement is reversed, and an intermediate range where neither species displaces the other. While in the low and high precipitation ranges one species outcompetes the other, the intermediate range allows for species coexistence in the form of a multitude of stable localized solutions consisting of fixed domains of one species in areas otherwise occupied by the other species. These localized solutions can only be realized when one of the alternative stable states is spatially patterned. We further study two factors that affect the size of the species coexistence range: the strength of the competition for light and the form of the tradeoff between the competitive abilities to capture water and light.

AB 1. Most of what we know about placentas comes from mammals, yet little can be learned from them about the adaptive significance of the placental mode of reproduction because they all derived their placenta from a single common ancestor that lived over 100 million years ago. We can make inferences about the adaptive significance of placentation from fish in the family Poeciliidae because there have been multiple, recent origins of placentation, affording an opportunity to compare close relatives with and without placentas and to seek properties that are common to each origin of placentation.
   2. Here, we used field collections and a common garden study to quantify the degree of placentation and related it to aspects of the life history in two clades of live-bearing fish from the genus Poeciliopsis that each contains an independent origin of placentation. Doing so enables us to test the 'life history facilitation hypothesis', or the proposal that the placenta evolved to facilitate the evolution of some other feature of the life history.
   3. We found that the evolution of placentation in each clade is tightly correlated with the evolution of other components of the life history, but that the nature of the association is radically different across the two clades. In the Northern Clade the magnitude of post-fertilization maternal provisioning is negatively correlated with age at maturity, mass at maturity, offspring dry mass and interlitter interval. In contrast, degree of matrotrophy in the Southern Clade is positively correlated with age at maturity, mass at maturity, offspring dry mass and inter-litter interval.
   4. There is thus no consistent relationship between the evolution of placentas and other features of the life history, which negates those proposals that the placenta evolved to facilitate the evolution of other features of the life history. However, there is a negative correlation between degree of placentation and ovary dry mass and reproductive allocation common to both clades, suggesting that placentation may be an adaptation that facilitates a reduction in reproductive allocation.

AB 1. Exaggerated morphological structures that evolve under sexual selection have the potential to alter functional relationships and hence affect aspects of movement. These effects may be more pronounced when the exaggerated morphological trait is coupled to the propulsive system.
   2. Many studies have examined the effects of sexually selected traits on whole-organism performance, but few have documented their effects on the kinematics of locomotion.
   3. Using four swordtail (Xiphophorus) species that vary naturally in their expression of the sexually selected sword, and an experimental manipulation for the species in our sample with the longest sword (X. alvarezi), we examined how variation in sword length affects the kinematics of swimming.
   4. Among the four species, we found few differences in tail beat kinematics, despite the large variation in sword length among species. In particular, the two species with long swords did not differ from the species lacking a sword, suggesting no locomotor 'cost' of having long swords.
   5. Using experimental manipulation, sword removal significantly increased tail beat amplitude, but not frequency, suggesting a potential increase in thrust production.
   6. Our comparative results suggest that swimming kinematics do not vary much with sword length, despite the variation in this sexually selected trait among the four species. This result suggests that other physiological mechanisms may be compensating for sword length, or as has been suggested recently, the sword may not impose a significant swimming cost.

AB Many endemic species, particularly those on remote islands, have been driven to extinction or near extinction by anthropogenic influences. The short-tailed albatross Phoebastria albatrus once numbered in the millions but was thought to be extinct by the mid 20th century. Albatrosses, of the family Diomedeidae, are among the most threatened birds globally as a result of commercial exploitation, introduced predators, and mortality in commercial fisheries. We applied an experimental approach over 5 years to evaluate the translocation and hand-rearing of albatross chicks by comparing growth, physiological health indices, post-fledging survival, and migration patterns with a control group of naturally reared chicks in the source population. Hand-reared chicks had comparable or superior health and similar rates of immediate post-fledging mortality (15%), with mortality strongly female-biased in both groups. Hand-reared birds had longer post-fledging drift periods before attaining sustained flight (also female-biased) but comparable, albeit somewhat wider ranging, migration patterns to naturally reared chicks during their first 6 months at sea. Recruitment to the translocation site of a breeding pair that included a hand-reared bird occurred within 5 years of the first translocation. Success will ultimately depend on continued recruitment and breeding over the coming decades, given delayed breeding in these long-lived species. The results to date, however, have exceeded initial expectations and can inform potential reintroductions of other long-lived, migratory avian species with strong natal philopatry, and reintroductions of native species to former breeding islands.

AB It is well documented that deforestation results in an increase in landslide frequency due to the control that forest roots have on slope stability. The loss of forest vegetation leads to a reduction in soil cohesion and a decrease in the shear strength of the soil profile. As a result, the slope becomes more susceptible to landsliding and the return time of landslides decreases. When a landslide removes the soil profile, there may not be adequate time for seedlings to grow and enhance soil stability. In this study, we investigate whether bistable dynamics emerge from the interaction of forest vegetation with the formation and accumulation of colluvial deposits in soil-mantled landscapes. To that end, we develop deterministic and stochastic models of landslide occurrence with a dynamic vegetation component. Results show that bistability exists for the deterministic case for both steep and shallow hollows under event and supply limited conditions. However, for the stochastic case, the randomness of landslide occurrence largely changed the states of the system such that the system only exhibited one stable state, which was the fully vegetated condition. Examining different management practices under stochastic conditions showed that the system eventually recovered; however, management practices influenced the recovery time of the forest. Thus, different management practices could render the land in a state of low vegetation over economically significant time periods.

AB Anthropogenic environmental degradation transforms mature vegetation into sites in succession, and actions to restore these altered environments must be based on ecological theories. Nucleation, promoted by facilitation, is an ecological process that can be applied to the restoration of altered environments. The original vegetation of many semi-arid regions has been profoundly altered, and is difficult to recuperate due to rigorous climates. Observations of secondary succession sites raise the following question: do some semi-arid plant species promote nucleation processes and can they therefore be considered nurse species? To address this question, vegetation surveys were undertaken in different environments: under the canopy of the shrub Combretum leprosum and in adjacent open areas. Shrubs in different stages were classified by canopy size: small, intermediate and large. Diversity and number of seedlings increased as the size of the C. leprosum canopies increased. Some of the environmental variables examined supported the role of C. leprosum as a facilitator species, such as the improvement in soil conditions under its canopy. Thus C leprosum could be of significant importance in restoring degraded areas of the semi-arid region where it is present, by allowing the establishment of other plant species.

AB Spatial variation in biological traits reflects evolutionary and biogeographical processes of the history of clades, and patterns of body size and range size can be suitable to recover such processes. In the present study, we test for latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in both body and range sizes in an entire family of tropical anurans, Centrolenidae. We partition the species latitudinal, and altitudinal distributions into an indirect measure of tolerance, and then test its effect on the body size gradient. We use an assemblage-based approach to correlate the traits with altitudinal and latitudinal axes, taking into account both phylogenetic and spatial autocorrelation in data. Centrolenids lack any gradient in range size but show a positive cline of both body size and adaptive body enlargement with altitude. This pattern is also positively correlated with an altitudinal gradient of cold tolerance, thus lending support to the heat balance hypothesis as an explanation of the body size cline. By using an entire Neotropical clade of anurans, we add further support for Bergmann's rule in ectotherms, warn for a likely effect of environmental steepness in fashioning the gradient, and offer evidence for an historical scenario (the OligoceneEocene Andean uplift) as its likely trigger.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London

AB Investigations of biomass, production, and anthropogenic impact require knowledge of the spatial distribution of the species concerned. Studies of the spatial distribution of soft-sediment infauna are inherently difficult, because the organisms are generally not readily visible, necessitating painstaking excavation. Although the large-scale (tens of km) distribution patterns of infaunal bivalves have been studied previously, the fine-scale (1 to tens of meters) has received much less attention. We investigated the fine-scale spatial distribution of the edible cockle Cerastoderma edule at a fishing-impacted site and a non-impacted site on an intertidal mudflat in Bourgneuf Bay, France, in 2009-2010. A preliminary study using a 1 m spatial lag was performed to determine the optimum lags for a nested sampling design. Cohorts were identified using Bhattacharya-resolved size-frequency distributions and verification of isotropy, and the spatial characteristics of each cohort were determined using Moran's I auto-correlation coefficient. The non-impacted site presented one strongly-aggregated main cohort, C3, (Moran's I=0.67 to -0.34, spatial range 16 to 20 m, inter-patch distance 41 to 51 m). The impacted site presented two main cohorts, C2 (131 cm mean shell length, SL) and C3 (2.11 cm SL) both of which also showed a patchy spatial distribution (C2: Moran's 1=0.7 to -0.72, spatial range 22 to 35 m; inter-patch distance 63 to 90 m; C3: Moran's 1=0.41 to -0.63, spatial range 36 to 58 m, inter-patch distance not defined). The C3 cohort was less aggregated than the C2; possibly due to the homogenizing effect of fishing, which typically proceeds via a Levy walk foraging model.
   Our results show that the spatial distributions of C edule retained a strongly aggregated character over the 8 months of the study, suggesting that these characteristics are powerfully maintained by recruitment/post-recruitment processes, despite intense fishing pressure throughout the sampling period, and indeed for decades, prior to this study. These data also show that we cannot assume a random or a regular spatial distribution for this species in studies of biomass, production, trophic relations, or anthropogenic impact; rather, close attention must be paid to the spatial characteristics of studied populations in order to reduce the confounding effects of auto-correlation.

AB Water availability is a major environmental driver affecting riparian and wetland vegetation. The interaction between water table fluctuations and vegetation in a stochastic environment contributes to the complexity of the dynamics of these ecosystems. We investigate the possible emergence of spatial patterns induced by spatio-temporal stochastic resonance in a simple model of groundwater-dependent ecosystems. These spatio-temporal dynamics are driven by the combined effect of three components: (i) an additive white Gaussian noise, accounting for external random disturbances such as fires or fluctuations in rain water availability, (ii) a weak periodic modulation in time, describing hydrological drivers such as seasonal fluctuations of water table depth, and (iii) a spatial coupling term, which takes into account the ability of vegetation to spread and colonize other parts of the landscape. A suitable cooperation between these three terms is able to give rise to ordered structures which show spatial and temporal coherence, and are statistically steady in time. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB To enable visitors to enjoy nature while protecting endangered species is the key challenge for national parks around the world. In our optimal dynamic control model, a park management maximizes tourism revenues and conservation benefits net of control costs by choosing optimal dynamic levels of conservation and visitor management. The optimization is constrained by an extended food chain model representing species-habitat-visitor interactions. We illustrate for a game bird in an Alpine national park that ecotourism can indeed lead to ecosystem degradation when the park management is more concerned about increasing tourism revenues than about achieving the conservation target and if the endangered species is unknown to most visitors. If, however, the park management is well aware of the potentially negative consequences of ecotourism and hence cares for species conservation, limited ecotourism can provide funding for species conservation which ensures population levels above the uncontrolled steady state.

AB Several studies have shown that non-linear deterministic dynamical systems forced by external random components can give rise to unexpectedly regular temporal behaviors. Stochastic resonance and coherence resonance, the two best known processes of this type, have been studied in a number of physical and chemical systems. Here, we explore their possible occurrence in the dynamics of groundwater-dependent plant ecosystems. To this end, we develop two eco-hydrological models, which allow us to demonstrate that stochastic and coherence resonance may emerge in the dynamics of phreatophyte vegetation, depending on their deterministic properties and the intensity of external stochastic drivers.

AB In the Mediterranean Sea, the vermetid Dendropoma petraeum (Monterosato, 1884) forms highly bio-diverse reefs that have received increasing attention in recent years although very little is known about the food habit of this species. The main goal of this study was to describe the trophic role of planktonic and benthic food sources for D. petraeum. Specimens from three morphological zones of the reef (inner edge, cuvette and outer edge) at two sites with different wave exposure along the north-western coast of Sicily (Italy; western Mediterranean) were compared for delta C-13 and delta N-15. Isotopic determinations were also carried out on potential food sources identified in epilithon, reef macroalgae and suspended particulate organic matter. delta C-13 for D. petraeum showed significantly more depleted values in the more exposed conditions (i.e. the site with higher wave exposure and outer edge of the reef), while delta N-15 did not differ appreciably. These results suggest greater exploitation of benthic sources in the sheltered than in the exposed site and reveal diet shift and trophic flexibility at a small spatial scale for the reef-former D. petraeum.

AB Since the first description of the Bergmann's rule, body size dines along environmental gradients have been examined in a wide variety of taxa. Broad support for Bergmann's rule has been found for endotherms and even ectotherms; many species, however, do not follow Bergmann's rule or the converse to Bergmann's rule. We tested the relationship between body size (body weight (BW), body length (BL), and 12 skull size measurements) of a typical subterranean rodent plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) collected from different geographic localities and two geographic variables (latitude and altitude) as well as some environmental factors that usually change with geographical gradients on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A total of 523 (212 males and 311 females) adult individuals from 21 sampling sites were analyzed. The results indicated that body size of both males and females was positively correlated with latitude, annual temperature (AT), and annual net primary production (ANPP) and negatively correlated with altitude and annual precipitation (AP). These results indicated that the plateau zokor latitudinally followed Bergmann's rule but altitudinally followed the converse to Bergmann's rule. The environmental factors which may influence the zokors' water balance and food availability were the major driving forces latitudinally and altitudinally shaping the body size of this species, respectively.

AB Food web studies often examine density and behaviourally mediated effects of predators on herbivores, but are less likely to assess the plant targeted by the herbivore. We conducted a study that incorporated four trophic levels examining the effect of two generalist predators (damsel bugs, Nabis kinbergii Reuter; and lynx spiders, Oxyopes molarius L. Koch) on damage to cotton bolls caused by green mirids (Creontiades dilutus (Stal)). First we tested whether lynx spiders and damsel bugs could control mirid numbers and cotton boll damage in field cages. We found that in cages containing mirids and only lynx spiders, lynx spiders reduced both mirid numbers and boll damage. However, in cages which contained mirids and both predators (lynx spiders and damsel bugs) only mirid numbers were reduced. To explain the negative effect of damsel bugs on boll damage, we examined the interactions between lynx spiders, damsel bugs and mirids. We found that lynx spiders were better mirid predators than damsel bugs, and that lynx spiders attacked damsel bugs, but not vice versa. Behaviourally, mirids responded to increasing predator pressure regardless of whether the predators were lynx spiders or damsel bugs. However, damsel bugs seemed to alter the behaviour of lynx spiders because in their presence, a higher proportion of lynx spiders moved to the top of the plant, towards the damsel bugs but away from the bolls found lower on the plant. These results suggest that the most likely explanation for the increase in boll damage in the presence of damsel bugs was that lynx spiders moved to the top of the plant in the presence of damsel bugs, which then exposed the bolls lower down on the plant to mirid attack. This work emphasizes the importance of behaviourally mediated effects in food webs extending over four trophic levels.

AB Shell length-frequencies were determined for samples of Dreissena rostriformis bugensis collected <2 m depth from Las Vegas Boat Harbor (LVBH), Callville Bay Marina (two samples, CBM-1 and CBM-2), and Lake Mead Marina (LMM) in the Boulder Basin of Lake Mead and Katherine Landing Marina (KLM) in the lower end of Lake Mohave within two months of initial discovery of D. rostriformis bugensis in Lake Mead at LVBH on 06/01/2007. Two annual shell length (SL) cohorts were present at all four sites consisting of individuals presumed to have settled during spring-fall of 2005 and 2006, respectively. Members of the most recently settled 2006 cohort numerically dominated all samples; relative ratios of individuals in the LVBH, CBM-2, LMM, and KLM 2006 versus 2005 cohorts being 174:1, 95:1, 172:1 and 65:1, respectively. Mean shell lengths of the LVBH, CBM-1, CBM-2, KLM and LMM 2006 cohorts were 6.86 (s.c. = +/- 0.126), 9.59 (+/- 0.080), 9.31 (+/- 0.194), 10.49 (+/- 0.287) and 12.15 mm (+/- 0.105), respectively. The mean shell lengths of the 2005 cohorts in the LVBH, CBM-2, KLM and LMM samples were 17.5 mm (n = 1), 18.9 mm (n = 4), 21.2 mm (n = I) and 20.1 mm (n = 4), respectively. The occurrence of the 2005 cohort in all four sampled sites suggested that quagga mussel introduction to the Boulder Basin occurred prior to 2005. This supposition is based on the very low probability of individuals from a localized initial introduction appearing in the samples. It is hypothesized that a reproducing quagga mussel population must have been established somewhere in the Boulder Basin by 2003 or 2004 in order to generate enough veliger larvae to settle as relatively wide-spread members of the 2005 cohort and be transported downstream to establish a 2005 cohort at KLM in lower Lake Mohave. Essentially equivalent population structures at all three sampled sites makes speculation on the original site of quagga mussel introduction to the Boulder Basin difficult.

AB The long-term persistence of populations and species depends on the successful recruitment of individuals. The generative recruitment of plants may be limited by a lack of suitable germination and establishment conditions. Establishment limitation may especially be caused by the competitive effect of surrounding dense vegetation, which is believed to restrict the recruitment success of many plant species to small open patches ('safe sites'). We conducted experiments to clarify the roles of germination and seedling establishment as limiting processes in the recruitment of Juncus atratus Krock., a rare and threatened herbaceous perennial river corridor plant in Central Europe. Light intensity had a positive effect on germination. However, some seedlings emerged even in total darkness and the germination rate at 1% light intensity was more than half of that at 60% light intensity. Seedling establishment in the field after 10 weeks was 30% on bare ground, but it was close to zero in grassland. Establishment in the growth chamber after 8 weeks was close to 75% for seedlings that germinated underwater, but only about 35% for seedlings that germinated afloat. Furthermore, establishment decreased with flooding duration on bare ground, but increased with flooding duration in grassland. These data indicate that establishment, rather than germination, is a critical life stage in Central European populations off. atratus. They furthermore indicate that the competition of surrounding vegetation for water limits seedling establishment under field conditions without flooding, largely restricting establishment success to bare ground habitats. In contrast, grassland is more suitable for the recruitment off. atratus than bare ground under prolonged flooding. Grassland may facilitate the establishment off. atratus seedlings during long-lasting floods by supplying oxygen to the soil through aerenchyma. The shift from competition to facilitation in grassland occurred after 30 days of flooding, i.e. within the ontogeny of individual plants. The specific recruitment requirements off. arrows may be a main cause of its rarity in modern Central Europe. In order to prevent regional extinction off. atratus, we suggest maintaining or re-establishing natural hydrodynamics in the species' habitats. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB The subject of this paper is the views of farmers concerning their local landscape. In two contrasting Danish case study areas previously analysed in the 1990s, a small number of farmers have been interviewed regarding their views of the landscape and recent changes in their respective area including landscape changes. One of the areas (Hvorslev) is characterized by good conditions for agriculture, intensive husbandry production and a relatively stable landscape history. The other (Nees) has more marginal conditions and major changes in land use characterize the recent landscape history. We analyze the way in which the landscape is perceived by farmers and compare their views of the changing landscapes with the actual recorded changes on the one hand, and with other significant changes on the other. Farmers in both areas emphasized the same type of structural changes in agriculture and in the villages as significant, whereas only farmers in Nees indicated that the landscape had changed. When asked to characterize the landscape, farmers in Nees replied with a greater degree of detail and were more locally focused compared to farmers in Hvorslev who mainly referred to (well known) sites located a few kilometres outside the area in question. Long-term experiences with landscape changes and collective actions concerning landscape issues are suggested as the main reasons that farmers in Nees share a well developed awareness of their local landscape. We conclude by discussing some implications of this study for landscape research and policy.

AB Both theoretical ecology and lake management practices acutely need quantitative assessment tools for the analysis of structural changes taking place in the plankton community. Size spectrum, a tool allowing such assessment, is usually based on size distributions of organisms irrespective of their taxonomy. The size-frequency distribution of taxonomic units in an assemblage, named by us 'traditional taxonomic size spectrum' (TTSS), has been applied for over 70 years, but seldom in aquatic ecology. Longterm consistency of phytoplankton TTSS, evidenced even during pronounced ecosystem changes, was described for the subtropical and eutrophic Lake Kinneret, Israel. In the present study, we examine whether consistent TTSS patterns prevail across ecosystems, and apply the TTSS to the phytoplankton of the temperate and oligotrophic Lake Tahoe, USA. A typical annual TTSS pattern was revealed, and its details were analyzed quantitatively by hierarchical cluster analysis. The Tahoe TTSS similarity level during 4 years (Pearson r=0.92 to 0.99) is comparable to that of the Kinneret during its stable period; even for pairs divided by > 20 years, r > 0.8. While the Tahoe TTSS general pattern resembles that of Lake Kinneret, the two lakes are distinguishable by means of cluster analysis. A high similarity (r=0.91) was found between the eight-year averaged TTSSs of the two lakes. The above results let us suppose that the longterm consistency of the aquatic assemblage taxonomic size structure pattern is a general phenomenon. This pattern deserves special attention at times of accelerated global climate change, acerbated by burgeoning anthropogenic impacts.

AB Rehabilitated mine sites are suitable environments for the study of primary ecological succession. Following the monitoring of Plant and Orthoptera communities for 4 years on 7 sites in the Limousin region (France), covering 9 years of rehabilitation, three grasshopper seres were defined. It is expected that these seres are conditioned by both displacement capacities and reproductive characteristics. This study compares by field experiments the jumping flights and walking speed of the most abundant Caelifera belonging to the defined Seres. A strong link emerged between the successional stages, the distances covered by jumping flights and sexual dimorphism. Walking speed is poorly related to the successional stage. We show that the high density of some species, as observed in the medium stage of succession, significantly reduces the walking distance of late colonisers, suggesting a mechanism that reduces further colonisation.

AB Natural resource management agencies and governmental programs that fund research are increasingly calling for interdisciplinary research that integrates biological ecology and the social sciences in a way that can inform policy. One fundamental impediment to collaboration derives from the emphasis that biological scientists place on experimentation, which is generally not considered a viable option for anthropologists. We suggest that anthropologists could have additional influence on policy by collaborating with biological ecologists in manipulative experiments that include human subjects. Critical to this approach are the participation of research subjects in research planning and willingness on the part of social and biological scientists to rapidly adopt new hypotheses and control scenarios that may emerge from shifting political and ethical contexts-what we call "adaptive experimentation." We provide an example of an adaptive experiment being conducted at Arizona State University, which situates urban landscaping, water conservation, and human behavior within the context of problem definition in water management policy.
