AB We describe and quantify the process of space occupation by the dwarf shrub, Sarcopoterium spinosum, in mesic and xeric Mediterranean environments. The shrubs were sampled in fifteen 2 m x 1 m plots in an and Mediterranean site (Lahav, northern Negev, Israel) and in a 10-m(2) patch in a sub-humid Mediterranean site (Elkosh, Galilee). The results revealed three clear stages of development that follow the seedling stage (first year): "Sapling", "Young", and "Adult" stages, each of which contributes differently to the persistence of the individual shrub and its population in space and time. The timelines in the xeric and mesic sites were very similar, though development was more intense in the mesic site. The "Sapling" stage is characterized by rapid elongation of only a few stem axes during the first 5 years. The transition to the "Young" stage is marked by the onset of canopy expansion and the proliferation of stem axes, and during this stage clonal structures are formed, i.e., the connected ramets (stem-axes), the split proximate ramets, and the integrated ramets (layering branches with or without daughter shrubs). The "Adult" stage starts around the age of 15 years. Although only small fractions of the population survive to this age, this stage is highly viable and it is characterized by escapes from senescence, manifested in proliferation of clonal structures and canopy expansion. The minimum age for sexual reproduction observed in the field was 4 years, however, this reproduction mode varied greatly between environments and in the xeric environment, peaking was at the "Adult" stage, with 60% of this age class exhibiting sexual reproduction.

AB An experiment was conducted along the reefs off west Maui, Hawaii, during the summer of 2003 to monitor the spawning of the reef-building coral Montipora capitata and to determine the role of ocean currents in dispersing the larvae from the natal reef. Instruments documented the environmental forcing during the coral spawning season; drifters were deployed on three successive nights following direct observations of coral spawning. Both the timing and relative magnitude of the coral spawning were identifiable in acoustic backscatter data and correlated to plankton tow data. Each drifter track showed that the surface water containing coral eggs and planula larvae were transported rapidly offshore and not locally retained. Wind and current patterns during the previous year and during subsequent coral spawning events later in the summer were similar to those observed during the drifter releases. This suggests that the trajectories observed during the focused experiment are representative of the general pattern of larval dispersal off west Maui. These findings demonstrate the application of acoustic profilers for remotely imaging coral spawning and predicting their initial dispersal patterns.

AB The concept of sustainability has several, sometimes contrasting, meanings that may generate confusion, misunderstanding, and conflict concerning conservation and restoration practices. It is therefore desirable to clarify the concept of sustainability, thereby potentially contributing to mutual understanding, especially when social conflicts arise. This article discusses a recently published typology of three conceptions of sustainability that range from economic to ecocentric valuations of nature. We argue that the typology is incomplete because it does not include the arcadian approaches. For this reason, we introduce a "tripolar model" for conceptions of sustainability, applying it to the debate on shellfish harvesting in the Dutch Wadden Sea. We conclude that the particular visions or conceptions of sustainability held by relevant actors may have an impact on strategies for conservation.

AB Hoarding strategies range between scatterhoarding (small multiple hoards) and larderhoarding (large single hoard). We hypothesized that spatial distribution of food affects hoarding strategy of 2 nocturnal psammophilic rodents, Gerbillus pyramidum and G. allenbyi. We used a modular arena to test the prediction that hoarding strategy would tend toward scatterhoarding as travel distance during foraging increases. We manipulated travel distance and studied its effect on hoarding behavior. G. allenbyi, as predicted, tended to scatterhoard as travel distance increased. G. pyramidum, however, reacted to changes in travel distance by moving the location of its larderhoard but did not scatterhoard. We suggest that hoarding strategy may be scale dependent and that gerbils will increase their number of hoards when energy costs of travel are sufficiently high.

AB Food intake carries many potential risks which may impair an animal's reproductive success not only in the current breeding cycle, but also for the rest of its lifetime. We examine the lifetime trade-off between the costs and benefits of food intake by presenting a simple animal foraging model, where each unit of food eaten carries with it a risk of mortality. We show that the optimal food intake rate over an animal's lifetime, for both semelparous and iteroparous animals, is not maximal. Instead, animals are required to strike a balance between the immediate reproductive benefits of gathering food and the future reproductive costs incurred by the food's mortality risk. This balance depends upon the lifespan of the animal as well as the nature of the risk. Different mortality risks are compared and it is shown that a mortality risk per unit time spent foraging is not, in general, equivalent to a mortality risk per unit of food consumed. The results suggest that a mortality risk per unit of food consumed, such as that presented by the presence of a toxin or of a parasite in the diet, has important consequences for feeding behaviour and is a possible factor involved in food intake regulation.

AB There has been much modeling and experimentation on factors affecting fertilization success in free-spawning marine invertebrates, but for many species spawning has rarely been observed in nature, if at all, and then mostly qualitatively. Understanding the dynamics of spawning and fertilization is especially important for species, such as the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (O.F. Muller), that have been widely depleted by harvesting. Time-integrated fertilization assays provide measures of sperm-availability adjacent to spawning populations for extended periods and with unprecedented temporal resolution. In such assays unfertilized eggs are held in baskets permeable to sperm and suspended in the water column as long as the eggs remain viable. In a consecutive series of 24- to 72-h assays the time course and spatial extent of sperm availability were measured near an aggregation of 250 sea urchins suspended in a cage at a field site in West Boothbay Harbor, Maine, USA. The assays were conducted in March and April, 2000, the spawning season of the green sea urchin. The distribution of embryonic stages within the assays revealed fine-scale temporal information on the timing of fertilization. The time series of multiple assays indicated that over a substantial portion of the spawning season there was an almost continuous low level of male spawning, a pattern consistent with a slow decline in gonad index observed in both male and female urchins. Fertilization rates averaged only 17% for the eggs in the basket nearest the spawning urchins (20 cm away), and the rates declined sharply over a distance of <1 m. Thus, despite the potential benefits of long egg life in integrating sperm supply over several days, the spatial effects on fertilization success were marked. Owing to the urchins' captivity and the lack of site replication, the generality of the observed spawning pattern must be confirmed. Nonetheless, the method lends itself to wider application among natural populations.

AB Macrofaunal colonization was studied using coral plates fixed at 10m depth on a fringing reef in Barbados, West Indies. Two sites were compared: Spring Garden, a site that is affected by eutrophication, and Six Men's Bay which is relatively free of this effect. Two sets of plates were immersed in winter and spring 1990 at each site and monitored for 28 and 19 weeks, respectively. Green and brown algae colonized first, followed 2 weeks later by ostracods, cumaceans, amphipods and polychaetes: terebellids, nereidids and syllids. Most colonizers either nestled or encrusted. A total of 11017 invertebrates belonging to 145 species were collected. Polychaetes were the most abundant and diverse zoological group. Considering polychaetes, crustaceans and molluscs, the study sites shared around 75% of the species. Overall, densities were higher on lower (shaded) surfaces while diversities were higher on upper (illuminated) sides. Similarity coefficients and correspondence analysis showed different macrobenthic assemblages and colonization patterns in light and shaded and in polluted and unpolluted sites. Coral plates were associated according to their immersion time' and were closely linked to their stage of development. Spring Garden (polluted) presented a higher number of soft-bottom and deposit-feeder species (e.g., Capitella capitata).

AB The stripping of bark from young timber trees by wild cervids is of commercial concern in many parts of Fennoscandia. We review the occurrence of this habit in moose (Alces alces) in relation to region, forestry practices, site productivity, and quality of available forage in the vicinity of areas with bark stripping. The greatest commercial loss from bark stripping is seen in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), with lesser impacts on Norway spruce (Picea abies). In stands of young Scots pine subject to bark stripping, generally less than 5% of trees are affected each year. In central Sweden, the damage to pine is confined to sapling stands 1.5-4 m tall, but to the north older trees in 'thinning-stage stands' are also frequently barked. Bark stripping in central Sweden occurs primarily during spring, while in the north it occurs throughout the year with a higher frequency in mid- to late winter. Bark stripping of Norway spruce has previously occurred only to a small extent, but in the past decade it has increased in importance in parts of southern Fennoscandia. In these new occurrences there is an apparent association with areas of high acidification from anthropogenic sources. Various authors have suggested why cervids seek tree bark, particularly red deer (Cervus elaphus). For moose, however, no single hypothesis has been verified. Possible mechanisms inducing bark stripping are discussed here, including the role of nutrient deficiencies in moose. Finally, methods for reducing bark stripping damage by moose are discussed.

SO AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID SWARD
AB A general model of rotational grazing is constructed where in each of P consecutive time periods a mob of animals grazes one of m paddocks. The optimal grazing sequence is that which maximises their total herbage intake and satisfies the physical. constraints of the grazing system. The total herbage intake is compared for four grazing strategies: continuous grazing, strict cyclic rotation, greedy rotation and optimal rotation. A branch-and-bound algorithm is used to find the global optimum strategy. A 100 ha system is simulated carrying 300-400 dairy cows for 60 days in late winter and early spring with a range of subdivisions and grazing durations to ascertain the effectiveness of the different strategies in maximising intake.
   It is shown that (1) continuous grazing maximises intake when pasture growth is in surplus to animal requirements, (2) that animals' herbage intake under rotational grazing is likely to be poor unless the rate of rotation is carefully synchronised to the pasture growth rate, (3) that grazing management makes little difference to productivity in comparison to stocking rate and average initial pasture, (4) that there is no reason to expect subdivision of land to increase productivity unless reasons such as pasture trampling on wet soil mitigate against long grazing durations. Greedy rotational grazing is found to increase herbage intake on multi-paddock systems with an initially inhomogeneous distribution of pasture.

AB Research on the response of livestock gain to stocking rate tends to cluster into 5 ''invisible colleges'', represented by 5 citation networks which only occasionally intersect. Each college is built around a paradigm of the stocking rate-gain response as developed in 2 key papers sharing 1 or more authors. Researchers tend to cite the paradigm developed by authors in their field of research or in their geographic area. Therefore conficting pardigms have existed side-by-side for decades, an unusual occurrence in most fields of science. Research is needed to critically evaluate the empirical and conceptual soundness of these paradigms.

AB The pattern of nitrate production and consumption in an eutrophic lake was studied during the transition from winter mixing to summer stratification. Nitrification in the sediment was undetectable at the end of the mixing period and net nitrate production before the lake restratified was only equivalent to about 50 % of the ammonia made available at destratification. Rapid hypolimnetic deoxygenation followed by denitrification and dissimilation of nitrate to ammonia prevented any hypolimnetic accumulation of nitrate after stratification. Factors contributing to the rapid hypolimnetic oxygen consumption rate in this lake and its effects on components of the nitrogen cycle are examined. The role of the sediments and water column in nitrate consumption are compared and the consequences of low nitrification on the nitrogen dynamics of the lake are discussed.

   POINT; STABILITY; SYSTEMS; THRESHOLDS; PERTURBATIONS; INFORMATION;
   ECOSYSTEMS
AB The question of what and how to measure ecological resilience has been troubling ecologists since Holling 1973s seminal paper in which he defined resilience as the ability of a system to withstand perturbations without shifting to a different state. This definition moved the focus from studying the local stability of a single attractor to which a system always converges, to the idea that a system may converge to different states when perturbed. These two concepts have later on led to the definitions of engineering (local stability) vs ecological (non-local stability) resilience metrics. While engineering resilience is associated to clear metrics, measuring ecological resilience has remained elusive. As a result, the two notions have been studied largely independently from one another and although several attempts have been devoted to mapping them together in some kind of a coherent framework, the extent to which they overlap or complement each other in quantifying the resilience of a system is not yet fully understood. In this perspective, we focus on metrics that quantify resilience following Holling's definition based on the concept of the stability landscape. We explore the relationships between different engineering and ecological resilience metrics derived from bistable systems and show that, for low dimensional ecological models, the correlation between engineering and ecological resilience can be high. We also review current approaches for measuring resilience from models and data, and we outline challenges which, if answered, could help us make progress toward a more reliable quantification of resilience in practice.

AB Species traits have much to offer conservation science. However, the selection and application of trait data in conservation requires rigor to avoid perverse or unexpected outcomes. To guide trait use, we review how traits are applied along the conservation continuum: the progression of conservation actions from assessing risk, to designing and prioritizing actions, to implementation and evaluation. We then provide a framework for their use as proxies for more nuanced empirical data on species and ecosystems. Framework steps include (1) identifying information needs relative to conservation goals, (2) choosing relevant traits using theory and expanding via expert elicitation, and (3) defining and addressing the limits of trait information. Worked examples for contemporary plant and amphibian conservation show how traits should be selected and applied based on theory and/or evidence (rather than data availability or untested assumptions). Finally, we forecast the use of trait data in several conservation applications globally.

AB Considerable amounts of heavy metals have contaminated the soil from potential manmade point and nonpoint sources such as industry, urbanisation and agriculture. In both managed and natural ecosystems, beneficial plant-microbe interactions play a significant role improving the growth and health of plants, and could be applied for improving soil fertility as well as crop productivity. Additionally, plant microbe interactions could be utilised in bioremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soils. The efficiency of phytoremediation can be improved with the aid of plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), which can change metals to bioavailable and soluble forms. PGPB perform remediation through processes such as production of siderophores, organic acids and biosurfactants, biomethylation, redox processes, phosphorus solubilisation, nitrogen fixation and iron sequestration. These processes improve plant growth and increase plant biomass along with phytoremediation. A crucial solution to the problem of heavy metal contamination might be an appropriate understanding of hyperaccumulator plants and their interaction with microbes. Emerging strategies for either enhancing or reducing the bioavailability of heavy metals in the rhizosphere, such as improving plant establishment, growth and health can significantly accelerate the heavy metal bioremediation process. In this review, we feature the function of PGPB to assist phytoremediation of heavy metals as an eco-friendly and economical approach.

AB Habitat islands can be defined as distinct patches of habitat surrounded by less contrasting matrix types. In contrast to true island biogeography (traditionally the study of islands surrounded by water), there have been less efforts to synthesize the myriad habitat island biogeography studies that have been published, particularly syntheses that cover the full range of habitat island types. By building on previous work, I aim to provide a review of habitat island biogeography in order to provide a blueprint for future research on habitat islands, including both naturally and anthropogenically fragmented systems. The review is organized into three main parts. First, the differences between habitat and true islands are summarized. Second, the main theoretical frameworks currently used to analyze habitat island systems are reviewed. Third, the findings of habitat island studies focused on various biological patterns are synthesized. Drawing on this synthesis, I put forward two main points regarding improving our understanding of habitat island biogeography: first, increasing the integration of matrix properties (including matrix variation across space and time) into habitat island biogeographic models and, second, testing for, and understanding the implications of, the potential prevalence of mass effects and source-sink dynamics in habitat island systems.

AB Weathering plays a crucial role in a number of environmental processes, and the microstructure and evolution of multi-scale pore space is a critically important factor in weathering. In igneous rocks the infiltration of meteoric water into initially relatively dry material can initiate disaggregation, increasing porosity and surface area, and allowing further disaggregation and weathering. These processes, in turn, allow biota to colonize the rock, further enhancing the weathering rate. In some rocks this may be driven by primary mineral oxidation. One such mineral, biotite, has been repeatedly mentioned as a cause of cracking during oxidation. However, the scale-dependence of the processes by which this occurs are poorly understood. We cannot, therefore, accurately extrapolate laboratory reaction rates to the field in predictive numerical models.
   In order to better understand the effects of oxidation and test the hypothesis that fracture and disaggregation are initiated by swelling of oxidizing biotites, we reacted granite cores in a selenic acid-rich aqueous solution at 200 degrees C for up to 438 days. Elevated temperatures and selenic acid were used to provide relatively fast reaction rates and highly oxidizing conditions in sealed reaction vessels. These experiments were analyzed using a combination of imaging, X-ray diffraction, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and small- and ultra-small angle neutron scattering to interrogate porosity and microfracture formation. The experimental results show little observable biotite swelling, but significantly more observable fractures and growth of iron oxides and/or clays along grain boundaries. Pyrite disappeared from the reacted sample. Significant increases in porosity were also observed at the sample rim, likely associated with feldspar alteration. Fractures and transport were observed throughout the core, suggesting that stresses due to crystallization pressures caused by the growing iron phases may be the initiating factors in granite weathering, possibly followed by biotite swelling after sufficient permeability is achieved.

AB 1935 gecko species (and 224 subspecies) were known in December 2019 in seven families and 124 genera. These nearly 2000 species were described by similar to 950 individuals of whom more than 100 described more than 10 gecko species each. Most gecko species were discovered during the past 40 years. The primary type specimens of all currently recognized geckos (including subspecies) are distributed over 161 collections worldwide, with 20 collections having about two thirds of all primary types. The primary type specimens of about 40 gecko taxa have been lost or unknown. The phylogeny of geckos is well studied, with DNA sequences being available for similar to 76% of all geckos (compared to similar to 63% in other reptiles) and morphological characters now being collected in databases. Geographically, geckos occur on five continents and many islands but are most species-rich in Australasia (which also houses the greatest diversity of family-level taxa), Southeast Asia, Africa, Madagascar, and the West Indies. Among countries, Australia has the highest number of geckos (241 species), with India, Madagascar, and Malaysia being the only other countries with more than 100 described species each. As expected, when correcting for land area, countries outside the tropics have fewer geckos.

AB Although stone surfaces seem unlikely to be habitable, they support microbial life. Life on these surfaces are subjected to many varying harsh conditions and require the inhabitants to exhibit resistance to environmental factors including UV irradiation, toxic metal exposure, and fluctuating temperatures and humidity. Here we report the effect of hosting stone geochemistry on the microbiome of stone ruins found in Tamil Nadu, India. The microbial communities found on the two lithologies, granite and granodiorite, hosted distinct populations of bacteria. Geochemical composition analysis of sampled stones revealed quartz mineral content as a major driver of microbial community structure, particularly promoting community richness and proportions of Cyanobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus. Other geochemical parameters including ilmenite, albite, anorthite, and orthoclase components or elemental concentrations (Ti, Fe, Mn, Na, and K) also influenced community structure to a lesser degree than quartz. Core members of the stone microbiome community found on both lithologies were also identified and included Cyanobacteria (Chroococcidiopsaceae andDapisostemonumCCIBt 3536),Rubrobacter, andDeinococcus. A cluster of taxa includingSphingomonas,Geodermatophilus, andTrueperawere mostly found in the granodiorite samples. Community diversity correlated with quartz mineral content in these samples may indicate that the microbial communities that attach to quartz surfaces may be transient and regularly changing. This work has expanded our understanding of built-stone microbial community structure based on lithology and geochemistry.

AB Soil salinization poses an important threat to terrestrial ecosystems and is expected to increase as a consequence of climate change and anthropogenic pressures. Conventional methods such as salt-leaching or application of soil amendments, or nature-based solutions (NBSs) such as phytoremediation, have been widely adopted with contrasting results. The use of cyanobacteria for improving soil conditions has emerged as a novel biotechnological tool for ecosystem restoration due to the unique features of these organisms, e.g., ability to fix carbon and nitrogen and promote soil stabilisation. Cyanobacteria distribute over a wide range of salt concentrations and several species can adapt to fluctuating salinity conditions. Their application in agricultural saline soil remediation has been demonstrated, mostly in laboratory studies, but there is a lack of research regarding their use in natural ecosystems restoration. In this article, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on cyanobacteria in the context of ecosystem restoration. Examples of the application of cyanobacteria in alleviating salt-stress in plants and soils are presented. Furthermore, we acknowledge gaps regarding the extensive application of cyanobacteria in salt-affected soils remediation and discuss the challenges of NBSs in salt-affected soils restoration.

Based on stable isotope composition (delta C-13, delta O-18) of fossil vermetid shells, radiocarbon ages and altimetric survey, the upper Holocene upwelling system of the Cabo Frio area (southeastern Brazil, Rio de Janeiro) is assessed. In the studied region, at 3700 cal. years BP the maximum relative sea level (RSL) was + 4.0 m with a SST of 20.7 degrees C. Subsequently, vermetid-based SST decreased from similar to 22.8 to similar to 17 degrees C (at similar to 3300 cal. years BP), with the coldest temperatures recording a strong upwelling event at around 2000 cal. years BP when the RSL was at + 2 m. The intensification in upwelling water masses is identified by the C-13 enrichment, along with higher delta O-18, in the vermetid shells. The decreasing SST trend assessed from similar to 3300 to similar to 2000 cal. years BP can be related to more frequent South Atlantic Coastal Water intrusions on the surface layer in the mid-shelf, increasing the nutrient concentration in the upper layer. From similar to 1900 to similar to 1300 cal. years BP, a higher SST up to similar to 21 degrees C occurred during the continuous sea-level fall.

AB Swimming performance is a key feature that mediates fitness and survival in many fish species. Using a swim tunnel respirometer, we compared prolonged swimming performance and energy use for two competing species: an endangered, endemic toothcarp (Aphanius iberus) and a worldwide invasive mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Critical (U-crit) and optimal swimming speeds, standard and maximal metabolic rates, absolute aerobic scope, as well as the minimum cost of transport were estimated and compared between species and sexes. Body streamlining and caudal peduncle depth were also measured to explain the differences in swimming performance and efficiency. Both sexes of A. iberus presented similar swimming capacity and metabolic traits, whereas males of G. holbrooki showed higher critical swimming speeds, maximal metabolic rate and absolute aerobic scope than females. We also found marked differences between species in most of the response variables examined. Aphanius iberus showed lower swimming capacity (U-crit mean <10 cm s(-1)), higher maximal metabolic rate and absolute aerobic scope than the invasive species. By contrast, G holbrooki swam faster and had lower cost of transport at a given fish mass and speed, thereby leading to a higher swimming efficiency. The observed differences in swimming efficiency were closely related to differences in morphological characteristics and therefore to drag pressures and propulsion. Our results add a mechanistic basis to the ecological understanding of these two species and suggest that although both are poor swimmers compared to many other similarly sized species, the native species likely has more restricted water flow tolerance and dispersal capacities.

AB Superfetation, the ability to simultaneously carry multiple litters of different developmental stages in utero, is a reproductive strategy that evolved repeatedly in viviparous animal lineages. The evolution of superfetation is hypothesized to reduce the reproductive burden and, consequently, improve the locomotor performance of the female during pregnancy. Here, we apply new computer-vision-based techniques to study changes in body shape and three-dimensional fast-start escape performance during pregnancy in three live-bearing fishes (family Poeciliidae) that exhibit different levels of superfetation. We found that superfetation correlates with a reduced abdominal distension and a more slender female body shape just before parturition. We further found that body slenderness positively correlates with maximal speeds, curvature amplitude and curvature rate, implying that superfetation improves the fast-start escape performance. Collectively, our study suggests that superfetation may have evolved in performance-demanding (e.g. high flow or high predation) environments to reduce the locomotor cost of pregnancy.

AB Background Two previous studies on interspecific body size variation of anurans found that the key drivers of variation are the species' lifestyles and the environments that they live in. To examine whether those findings apply at the intraspecific level, we conducted a study of the Asian common toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus), a terrestrial anuran distributed in tropical regions. The body size of toads from 15 locations, covering the majority of their geographic range, and local environmental data were summarized from published literature. We used a model selection process based on an information-theoretic approach to examine the relationship between toad body size and those environmental parameters. Results We found a positive correlation between the body size of the Asian common toad and the water deficit gradient, but no linkage between body size and temperature-related parameters. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the seasonality of precipitation and body size of females from different sampled populations. Conclusions As a terrestrial anuran, the Asian common toad should experience greater pressure from environmental fluctuations than aquatic species. It is mainly distributed in tropical regions where temperatures are generally warm and stable, but water availability fluctuates. Therefore, while thermal gradients are not strong enough to generate selection pressure on body size, the moisture gradient is strong enough to select for larger size in both males and females in dryer regions. Larger body size supports more efficient water conservation, a pattern in accordance with the prediction that lifestyles of different species and their local habitats determine the relationship between body size and environment. In addition, larger females occur in regions with greater seasonality in precipitation, which may happen because larger females can afford greater reproductive output in a limited reproductive season.

   INTRODUCED PREDATOR
AB Human activities are dramatically altering ecosystems worldwide, often resulting in shifts in selection regimes. In response, natural populations sometimes undergo rapid phenotypic changes, which, if adaptive, can increase their probability of persistence. However, in many instances, populations fail to undergo any phenotypic change, which might indicate a variety of possibilities, including maladaptation. In freshwater ecosystems, the impoundment of rivers and the introduction of exotic species are among the leading threats to native fishes. We examined how the construction of the Panama Canal, which formed Lake Gatun, and the subsequent invasion of the predatory Cichla monoculus influenced the morphology of two native fishes: Astyanax ruberrimus and Roeboides spp. Using a 100-year time series, we studied variation in overall body shape over time (before vs. after impoundment and invasion) as well as across space (between an invaded and an uninvaded reservoir). In addition, we examined variation in linear morphological traits associated with swim performance and predator detection/avoidance. Notwithstanding a few significant changes in particular traits in particular comparisons, we found only limited evidence for morphological change associated with these two stressors. Most observed changes were subtle, and tended to be site- and species-specific. The lack of a strong morphological response to these stressors, coupled with dramatic population declines in both species, suggests they may be maladapted to the anthropogenically perturbed environment of Lake Gatun, but direct measures of fitness would be needed to test this. In general, our results suggest that morphological responses to anthropogenic disturbances can be very limited and, when they do occur, are often complex and context-dependent.

AB Aim Geographical variations in endotherm body size (e.g. Bergmann's rule/James's rule and Allen's rule) have long been tested. However, the patterns and causes of geographical variation in body size within bat species, especially within widespread hibernating species, are little known. Here, we evaluated the possible causes of geographical size variation patterns in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), a bat species widely distributed across the Palearctic. Location Palearctic. Methods We collected body size data (body mass and forearm length) from 1,172 adult bats via direct measurements or from the literature. We used high-resolution environmental data for the sampled sites. We applied multiple linear regressions and an information-theoretic approach on separate female and male datasets to estimate the support for various hypotheses. Results Temperature and latitude failed to predict body mass in both females and males. The best model showed that populations with longer forearms in both sexes were associated with higher mean temperatures (in the warmest quarter) and lower mean temperatures (in the coldest quarter). The independent contribution of these temperature parameters to forearm length in both sexes was higher than that of all other variables. Main conclusion The observed relationship between temperature and body mass was not consistent with James's rule, and thus failed to support the heat conservation hypothesis. Our results are consistent with the predictions of Allen's rule and indicated that direct heat dissipation from the wing may be the most likely mechanism underlying geographical variation in forearm length. We suggest that the evaluation of the relative importance of multiple causal mechanisms may improve our understanding of patterns of geographical variation in endotherms.

AB Aim The relationship size-environment has been continuously debated for ectotherms. Surface-to-volume ratios are recurrently suggested as the cause of body size responses to climate, but most inferences on organismal size clines stem from single linear measurements of body length. Here, we illustrate how new photogrammetric techniques can be applied to characterize amphibian morphologies with 3D models. Using the natterjack toad (Epidalea calamita) as model organism, we compared the performance of climatic models in accounting for body size (measured as snout-to vent length, SVL) and body geometry (surface area-to-volume ratios) variation across macroclimatic gradients. Location Palaearctic. Taxon Epidalea calamita (former genus Bufo). Methods We used photogrammetry techniques to reconstruct 104 museum specimens of Epidalea calamita into 3D models and to collect geometric data (volume and surface area) to calculate surface area-to-volume ratios (SA:V). We then apply spatial and non-spatial regression to examine the relationships between SA:V, SVL and a set of bioclimatic variables. Results In accordance with the water conservation hypothesis, SA:V decreased towards more arid environments, a pattern that remained consistent after accounting for spatial autocorrelation effects. Only mean annual temperature was significant correlated with SVL. The contrast between both sets of models indicates that more traditional body size metrics (SVL) and body geometry (SA:V) do not operate the same constraints. Main conclusions We show that the variation in SA:V can be explained by the geographical variation in aridity. Evaporative water loss in wet-skinned ectotherms is highly dependent on the surface area of the skin exposed to the air. In contrast, SVL models detected that body length was more associated with mean annual temperature. This finding stresses the importance of selecting different metrics of body geometry and body size when examining variation across climatic gradients.

AB Northwestern coastal desert of Egypt is under pressure of human-induced changes due urban sprawl and agricultural practices leading to negative impacts on existing natural habitats. Assessing the impact of land-use changes on the ecological integrity is crucial for management and conservation efforts in the region. Floristic quality (FQ) assessment indices are important bioassessment tools that can be used to evaluate how anthropogenic changes may influence vegetation quality, species composition and environmental integrity. The approach is primarily stationed on floristic composition and disturbance tolerance at study sites. The objectives of this study were to: 1) study how anthropogenic disturbances due to land use/cover changes in the northwestern coastal desert affected its ecological quality as indicated by FQ indices; and 2) to evaluate the use of FQ indices as tools for characterizing anthropogenic disturbance among the habitats of Mediterranean desert ecosystem. Stands representing the main habitats were surveyed during 2011 through 2015 and data were compared to historic data collected before the developmental activities. The study revealed a trend of decline with time in the floristic quality of the study area as was indicated by floristic quality measures used (mean coefficient of conservatism, FQAI, and adjusted FQAI). Similar trend of decline in native and perennial species richness, and increase in non-native and annual species richness was observed for the period investigated from 1980s to time. At the habitat level, similar trend of decline in the floristic quality was observed, with the current time attaining the least values of FQ indices for all the habitats. The anthropogenic disturbance index (ADI) was developed in the current study as a quantitative measure of the level of disturbance and as an indicator to evaluate site's ecological condition. The ADI exhibited significant negative relationship with the FQ indices, revealing that it can be recognized as useful index of anthropogenic disturbance that would complement the use of FQ indices in evaluating site ecological condition. The high association between ADI and the adjusted FQAI compared to the FQAI, confirms that the former signals the level of disturbance better than later. Although the adjusted FQAI has been developed and used in assessing vegetation quality of wetland, the current study revealed that it can be employed successfully for assessing and monitoring changes in vegetation quality and ecological integrity of deserts and arid ecosystems. For full and comprehensive evaluation of site's ecological condition, the use of multiple bioindicators is recommended.

AB The climate system occasionally experiences an abrupt change. However, it is very difficult to predict this change at present. Fortunately, some generic properties have been revealed before several different types of dynamical system near their own critical thresholds. These properties provide a possible way to give an early warning for an impending abrupt climate change. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the applicability of an early warning indicator of an abrupt change. On the basis of several simple fold models, we have systematically investigated the performance of the kurtosis coefficient as an early warning signal for an upcoming abrupt climate change. The testing results indicate that the kurtosis coefficient is a reliable warning indicator in most of cases whether a critical control parameter or the strength of an external forcing approaches a critical point. However, the strong noise can greatly shorten the effective warning time, and also can result in the reduction of the magnitude of a kurtosis coefficient when a dynamical system approaches its critical threshold. The missing data has almost no effect on the kurtosis coefficient in all of tests, even it is true when the missing data accounts for 20% of the total sample. We also found that the kurtosis coefficient does not work in some cases, which means that the kurtosis coefficient is not a universal early warning signal for an upcoming abrupt change.

AB The importance of ecologically mediated divergent selection in accelerating trait evolution has been poorly studied in the most species-rich biome of the planet, the continental Neotropics. We performed macroevolutionary analyses of trait divergence and diversification rates across closely related pairs of Andean and Amazonian passerine birds, to assess whether the difference in elevational range separating species pairs - a proxy for the degree of ecological divergence - influences the speed of trait evolution and diversification rates. We found that elevational differentiation is associated with faster divergence of song frequency, a trait important for pre-mating isolation, and several morphological traits, which may contribute to extrinsic post-mating isolation. However, elevational differentiation did not increase recent speciation rates, possibly due to early bursts of diversification during the uplift of the eastern Andes followed by a slow-down in speciation rate. Our results suggest that ecological differentiation may speed up trait evolution, but not diversification of Neotropical birds.

AB Purpose Cement industry for both developed and developing countries is important from the economic point of view. It is playing a vital role in economic development of a developing country like Pakistan. However, these industries are posing threat to the environment, human health and plant species. The purpose of this paper is to identify the most critical factors of cement industry that have a negative impact on the environment, human health and plant species in the context of Pakistan.
   Design/methodology/approach The factors are categorized into air pollution, noise pollution, soil pollution, human health and plant species. These factors are categorized on the basis of previous literature and environmental safety reports. Air pollution is caused by iron and sulphur while noise pollution is mainly caused by crusher room and rotatory kiln end. The soil is being polluted by zinc and lead while human health and plant species are being damaged by sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. For the analysis purpose, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique, i.e., decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) is used.
   Findings The result shows that the major cause of air pollution is sulphur while crusher room and rotatory kiln end are responsible for noise pollution. On the other hand, mercury is responsible for causing soil pollution while human health and plant species are influenced by the toxic effect of nitrogen dioxide.
   Research limitations/implications The results obtained are specific to cement manufacturing industry of Pakistan and cannot be generalized for any other manufacturing sector.
   Practical implications The proposed methodology shows the most critical factors toward which concertation should be given for mitigating their impact. This study will help the government and the cement industry to focus on all those elements that are the most responsible for causing different types of pollution.
   Originality/value No such work is reported in previous research that proposes a framework using DEMATEL technique for analysis of critical factors of cement industries that have a dangerous impact on the environment and human health, especially in a developing country, like Pakistan.

AB Dimethylaminium (DMA(+)) and trimethylaminium (TMA(+)) ions in size-segregated atmospheric particles are measured across the marginal seas of China and the northwest Pacific Ocean (NWPO) in March-May 2014. The concentrations of DMA(+) and TMA(+) in particles with diameters of 0.056-10 mu m (PM0.056-10) collected from the eutrophic seas are 0.22 +/- 0.38 nmol/m(3) and 0.11 +/- 0.23 nmol/m(3), respectively. Surprisingly, an average TMA(+) concentration that is 1 order of magnitude higher and a slightly higher average DMA(+) concentration are observed across the oligotrophic NWPO. However, the concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the NWPO are approximately 5 times lower than those in the marginal seas. The maximum concentrations of TMA(+) (4.39 nmol/m(3)) and DMA(+) (0.92 nmol/m(3)) in PM0.056-10 are observed close to the largest cyclonic eddy in the NWPO under an average wind speed of 14 m/s. The concentrations of TMA(+) increase with decreasing particle size in the sample, whereas those of DMA(+) exhibit a condensation mode at 0.2 mu m and a droplet mode at 1-2 mu m. The bimodal size distribution of DMA(+) is conventionally interpreted in terms of secondary reactions in the atmosphere. The unique size distribution of TMA(+) suggests that it very likely originates from sea-spray aerosols. Based on their size distributions in other samples collected over the NWPO, these conclusions may generally apply for TMA(+) and DMA(+). Moreover, we propose a novel conceptual model to explain how the largely increased primary TMA(+) and secondary DMA(+) are linked to emissions of sea-spray aerosols and gaseous precursors from various cyclonic eddies.

AB We present a detailed taxonomic and lithologic analysis of fossil reefs in the Granitic Seychelles to improve constraints on global mean sea level behavior during the last interglacial sea-level highstand, similar to 129,000-116,000 years ago. In particular, we have assessed the coralgal reef outcrops for any sedimentalogic evidence of sub-orbital sea level oscillations that may have occurred during this warm, interglacial period. At the outcrop scale, we observe at least three distinct episodes of reef growth punctuated by two discontinuities that typically manifest as coral rubble layers or extensive lateral encrustations of the hydrozoan coral Millepora exaesa. Hiatuses in reef growth at other sites around the world have been interpreted as relative sea level falls and/or environmental disturbances. We have tested the hypothesis that these discontinuities, that we refer to as disturbance horizons, are related to ephemeral drops in sea level that have been inferred at last interglacial reef sites from other sites around the globe. At two sites, there is sedimentological evidence in the form of extensive dissolution and freshwater cements associated with the disturbance horizons that would require subaerial exposure followed by marine inundation. At the remaining sites, evidence is consistent with, but not necessarily indicative of, an ephemeral drop in sea level. To establish if these disturbance horizons are coeval between the outcrops and if they are local or global features, requires high-precision dating of the disturbance horizons along with a critical analysis of sedimentary and chronological evidence from other sites around the globe. If the disturbance horizons observed in the Seychelles represent transient sea-level falls or still stands during the last interglacial, this would imply a dynamic behavior of the polar ice sheets during this past warm period.

AB In soils characterized by nutrient-poor conditions trees have developed strategies to maximize the exploration of the environment through their root system. Notably, in shallow soils, trees adopt a deep rooting strategy to access appropriate levels of water and nutrients from the bedrock. Despite the critical importance of microorganisms in nutrient access in topsoil, understanding their involvement in subsoil was rarely addressed. Our study provides the first comprehensive picture of the bacterial communities colonizing deep roots at the bedrock interface. Particularly, we aimed at deciphering if the subsoil edaphic conditions allowed the enrichment of specific bacterial communities in the rhizosphere. To answer such questioning, we focused on a shallow soil dominated by deep-rooting beech trees (Fagus sylvatica). The taxonomic and functional structures of bacterial communities were investigated through 16S rRNA-pyrosequencing analyses and in vitro bioassays on culturable representatives isolated from the saprolite, the limestone rocks and the roots penetrating those two compartments at the bedrock interface. Our taxonomic analyses revealed a rhizosphere effect, with no difference between the limestone-and saprolite-rhizosphere bacterial communities. Notably, our functional assays highlighted a significant enrichment of bacteria effective at mineral weathering in the limestone-rhizosphere compared to the surrounding environment, whereas organic matter decomposing bacteria were exclusively enriched in the saprolite-rhizosphere. Altogether our results suggest that tree roots select specific bacterial communities in subsoil as potential allies to improve nutrient availability and tree nutrition. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Identifying species most vulnerable to environmental change requires reliable estimates of population trends and identification of traits that tend to be associated with these trends. Using state-space models that explicitly describe how the population size changes over time, we estimated population trends of 25 non-migratory African, 13 intra-African migrants, and 16 Palaearctic migratory waterbird species during 1995-2009 in South Africa. Using the average of the slope of the last five years (2005-2009), we used phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses to identify relationships with life-history (parental care, extent of polygamy, chick development, body size, average brood size) and ecological traits (migratory status, breeding latitude, foraging guild, wintering habitat type). The significant predictors of population trend were migratory status, average brood size, type of chick development (altricial, semiprecocial, precocial), and extent of male polygamy (0%, = < 20%, > 20%). Long-distance Palaearctic migrants and African non-migratory species on average suffered the greatest magnitude of decline, intra-African migrants showed population increase. There was a negative relationship between population trend and average brood size with an increase in brood size resulting in negative trends. Altricial species and species with some extent of polygamy (= < 20%) had the greatest population increase. Our results provide evidence that these recent population trends were non-random with respect to life-history traits. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Aims
   Animals in search of fleshy fruits forage mostly according to the number of available fruits and then select individual fruits based on reward quality or advertised subtle traits. This hierarchical pattern of fruit choice would be translated into patterns of selection strength mediated by frugivores on fruit display traits. Thus, frugivores would exert higher selection pressures on fruit crop size and lower selection pressures on within-plant variation of phenotypic traits (infructescence, fruit and seed size). However, no attempt to link this behavioral mechanism of hierarchical trait selection to natural selection patterns has been made. Therefore, we sought to determine the relationship between the hierarchical decision-making process of fruit choice and patterns of natural selection on fruit traits.
   Methods
   We recorded bird visits and measured fruit-related traits (fruit crop size, fruit diameter and seed weight) in a natural population of Psychotria carthagenensis, a bird-dispersed treelet, in a Yungas forest from Argentina. To assess phenotypic selection patterns on fruit display traits, we performed multivariate selection analysis, and to explicitly identify a hierarchy of fruit trait choice we used a classification tree as a predictive model.
   Important Findings
   Selection patterns on fruit display traits were in agreement with a hierarchical process of fruit choice made by birds. The strength of directional selection on the total number of fruits in a plant (i.e. fruit crop size) was nearly two times higher than on fruit size, and the classification tree analysis supported this hierarchical pattern. Our results support previous evidence that seed dispersers shape fruit crop size with higher intensity than subindividual fruit traits. Also, high levels of subindividual phenotypic variation of fruit display traits may be explained by relaxed selection pressures exerted by frugivores. Empirical studies also show that this pattern may constitute a general phenomenon among other plant-animal interactions.

AB Contemporary climate change has been linked to widespread changes in phenology and in the geographic distribution of species. Based on Bergmann's rule, body sizes of birds have been predicted to decline as global temperatures increase. We examined changes in body size of 20 resident and short-distance migrant passerine species in eastern North America between 1980 and 2012, and how changes in resident species related to annual mean summer and mean winter temperatures. We found that wing length generally increased and that fat-free mass did not change significantly. Fat score, a measure of body condition, declined over time. However, changes in wing length, fat-free mass, and fat score all showed significant variation across species. For resident species, increasing mean summer temperatures were generally associated with shorter wing lengths, but were not related to fat-free mass or fat score. Increasing mean winter temperatures were associated with reduced fat-free mass but not with wing length or fat score. Temperature effects did not vary significantly across species for any of the three measures. Across resident species, the magnitude of body size change over time was not related to the influence of mean winter or mean summer temperatures, and may have been driven by other factors. Our findings contrast with those from a study at a nearby bird banding station, in which widespread decreases in wing length and fat-free mass were observed. Our results demonstrate that populations of the same species can exhibit opposing changes in body size over short geographic distances (< 250 km). We conclude that changes in body size are heterogeneous over short time scales and can vary across and within species over short distances. Continued advances in understanding how body size changes relate to climate change must embrace this inherent complexity and consider alternative hypotheses.

AB Eilat Bay is located at the southernmost tip of Israel in the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea). The list of hydroids currently known from there includes 51 species, and when extending it to the entire Red Sea, it includes 157 species belonging to 41 families. Nevertheless, the information regarding hydroids in the Gulf of Aqaba, and in particular in Eilat Bay, is not exhaustive. The aim of this work is to improve knowledge of hydroid biodiversity in this area. The specimens collected during the HyDRa project (Hydroid Diversity of the Northern Red Sea) revealed the presence of 27 species, 13 Anthoathecata and 14 Leptothecata, belonging to 17 families and 20 genera. Two families, Cladonematidae and Corynidae, and five genera, Cladonema, Slabberia, Campanularia, Nemalecium and Lafoeina, are new findings for the Red Sea. Furthermore, Nemalecium lighti, Zanclea gallii and the new species Zanclea eilatensis sp. nov. have never before been recorded in the Red Sea. Zanclea eilatensis sp. nov. lives in association with a bryozoan, has a monomorphic colony lacking a perisarc and only has stenoteles in the polyps. The medusa stage has two prominent perradial exumbrellar nematocyst pouches and two tentacles with about 50 cnidophores having long flagella and containing macrobasic euryteles. In the present work, 54% of the species were associated with other organisms, such as hydroids, corals and bryozoans. New ecological data about the Zanclea-scleractinian coral association are documented. The present investigation provides new information about diversity in the Red Sea, and in particular in Eilat Bay. In addition, our data also have significance for Mediterranean and Red Sea biodiversity conservation due to the recent expansion of the Suez Canal and the consequent possible increase in the introduction of nonindigenous species in both directions. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:C9EA7333-B9DF-4888-A643-4D45E6CD31CB

AB Ecogeographical patterns of morphological variation were studied in the Eurasian pygmy shrew Sorex minutus aiming to understand the species' morphological diversity in a continental and island setting, and within the context of previous detailed phylogeographical studies. In total, 568 mandibles and 377 skulls of S.minutus from continental and island populations from Europe and Atlantic islands were examined using a geometric morphometrics approach, and the general relationships of mandible and skull size and shape with geographical and environmental variables were studied. Samples were then pooled into predefined geographical groups to evaluate the morphological differences among them using analyses of variance, aiming to contrast the morphological and genetic relationships based on morphological and genetic distances and ancestral state reconstructions, as well as assess the correlations of morphological, genetic, and geographical distances with Mantel tests. We found significant relationships of mandible size with geographical and environmental variables, fitting the converse Bergmann's rule; however, for skull size, this was less evident. Continental groups of S.minutus could not readily be differentiated from each other by shape. Most island groups of S.minutus were easily discriminated from the continental groups by being larger, indicative of an island effect. Moreover, morphological and genetic distances differed substantially and, again, island groups were distinctive morphologically. Morphological and geographical distances were significantly correlated, although this was not the case for morphological and genetic distances, indicating that morphological variation does not reflect genetic subdivision in S.minutus. Our analyses showed that environmental variables and insularity had important effects on the morphological differentiation of S.minutus.

AB Superfetation is an unusual reproductive strategy that consists of the presence of multiple broods at different developmental stages within a single female. One hypothesis that was proposed to explain its adaptive significance suggests that, in fishes, superfetation is a response to selective pressures that promote a thin and streamlined body shape, such as high-velocity water systems. Superfetation may allow for reduction in ovary size and hence improve streamlining because superfetating females carry few large, full-term embryos at any given time. We tested this morphological constraint hypothesis using reproductive and morphological data from several populations of two viviparous fishes of the family Poeciliidae (Poeciliopsis gracilis and Poeciliopsis infans). We found no evidence to support the morphological constraint hypothesis. In both species the degree of superfetation varied as a function of a complex interaction between source population and female size, and this interpopulation variation was not associated with the velocity of the water current. Contrary to what we expected, females of P. gracilis with more streamlined bodies were observed in rivers where water velocity is slow or moderate. In P. infans the velocity of the water current did not predict variation in body shape. Our results are noteworthy because a previous study which focused on a congeneric species (Poeciliopsis turrubarensis) demonstrated strong support for this hypothesis. However, based on our evidence we conclude that the association among increased superfetation, streamlined morphologies, and fast-flowing environments is not a general rule and that the adaptive value of superfetation may differ among species.

AB QuestionsCan theory about plant-plant interactions along climate gradients help us predict how climate change will affect shrub establishment? How does a predicted reduction in rainfall affect the outcome of the interactions between shrub seedlings and herbaceous plants in a dryland ecosystem?
   LocationThree field sites along a rainfall gradient and an adjacent experimental site at the Botanical Gardens of Tel Aviv University, Israel.
   MethodWe measured seedling survival of a dominant shrub species in response to the presence of herbaceous neighbours and to rainfall amount using two approaches: First, we employed a space-for-time approach and studied seedling survival along an aridity gradient that was shown to mimic the predicted rainfall changes. Second, we monitored seedling survival in a common garden experiment in which we simulated drought using rainout shelters. In both experiments we contrasted the importance of water availability relative to the presence of herbaceous neighbours and the origin of the shrub seedlings.
   ResultsOur results showed that neighbours always had a negative effect on shrub seedling survival. In contrast to theoretical predictions, the intensity of competition increased with reduction in water availability. Shrub seedlings originating from drier conditions showed higher survival than seedlings from mesic origin.
   ConclusionsThese results emphasize the importance of incorporating biotic interactions in studies predicting changes in plant dynamics under climate change. Moreover, plant species growing in ecosystems prone to high rainfall variability showed a greater ability to cope with dry conditions, which suggests more nuanced origin-specific predictions than suggested by recent climate models.

ID CHOICE; BEHAVIOR; BIOLOGY
AB The risk-sensitive foraging theory formulated in terms of the (daily) energy budget rule has been influential in behavioural ecology as well as other disciplines. Predicting risk aversion on positive budgets and risk proneness on negative budgets, however, the budget rule has recently been challenged both empirically and theoretically. In this paper, we critically review these challenges as well as the original derivation of the budget rule and propose a 'gradual' budget rule, which is normatively derived from a gradual nature of risk sensitivity and encompasses the conventional budget rule as a special case. The gradual budget rule shows that the conventional budget rule holds when the expected reserve is close enough to a threshold for overnight survival, selection pressure being significant. The gradual view also reveals that the conventional budget rule does not need to hold when the expected reserve is not close enough to the threshold, selection pressure being insignificant. The proposed gradual budget rule better fits the empirical findings including those that used to challenge the conventional budget rule. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The widely used term "stability" has multiple meanings and is rarely quantified in limnological studies. The main objective of this study was to develop an approach for quantifying the stability of a phyto-plankton community using Lake Kinneret as a case study. It is a first attempt of calculating an index of stability for each of the five main taxonomic groups of the Kinneret phytoplankton (Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, Cyanophyta and Dinophyta), and for the entire community. A simple statistical approach to calculate the stability index was devised, using phytoplankton wet-weight biomass as the parameter being manipulated. The period 1970-1979 was selected as a reference period. The following stability indices were established and applied (each at three time scales): (1) a stability index for each of five main taxonomic groups; (2) a combined index of the stability, aggregating the stabilities of the individual taxonomic groups and (3) a stability index of entire community based on total phytoplanIcton biomass. The dynamics of these indices during 1969-2011 were examined. Destabilization of the community structure was triggered by an increase in the variability of Bacillariophyta biomass shortly after the reference period, in 1981-1983. Only 10 years later, the community destabilization become associated with progressively increasing biomass of Cyanobacteria. Dinophyta were the last to destabilize in the mid 1990s. Despite notable changes in the community structure, the total phytoplankton biomass remained relatively stable. Therefore, in 1969-2011 the stability index based on total phytoplankton biomass was higher than the combined index based on the stabilities of the individual taxonomic groups. Only weak relationships were found between the stability index values and potential driving forces (lake water level fluctuations and nutrient loads). While this approach was applied to Lake Kinneret, the concept presented is not lake specific and could be applied to other lakes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil surface sealing is a widespread natural process occurring frequently in bare soil areas between vegetation patches. The low hydraulic conductivity that characterizes the seal layer reduces both infiltration and evaporation fluxes from the soil, and thus has the potential to affect local vegetation water uptake (VWU). This effect is investigated here using experimental data, 2-D physically based modeling, and a long-term climatic data set from three dry sites presenting a climatic gradient in the Negev Desert, Israel. The Feddes VWU parameters for the dominant shrub at the study site (Sarcopoterium spinosum) were acquired using lysimeter experiments. The results indicate that during the season surface sealing could either increase or decrease VWU depending on initial soil water content, rainfall intensity, and the duration of the subsequent drying intervals. These factors have a marked effect on interannual variability of the seal layer effect on VWU, which on average was found to be 26% higher under sealed conditions than in the case of unsealed soil surfaces. The seal layer was found to reduce the period where the vegetation was under water stress by 31% compared with unsealed conditions. This effect was more pronounced for seasons with total rainfall depth higher than 10 cm/yr, and was affected by interseasonal climatic variability. These results shed light on the importance of surface sealing in dry environments and its contribution to the resilience of woody vegetation.

AB Traditional rural landscapes emerged from the long term interaction of the natural and anthropogenic environment. These landscapes are now threatened by drastic social-ecological changes. Recent international trends on sustaining cultural landscapes place great emphasis on understanding of multiple values, presented in the landscape, by considering various stakeholder perspectives. It is now recognized that strong community engagement with the landscape should be translated into conservation and management practices. This paper aims to examine the recent conservation activities around endangered traditional rural landscapes in Korea through a case study of Gacheon village. In this village, since 2000, a series of central administrative measures have been implemented to revive the local community, and to conserve its distinctive landscape. By analyzing challenges to the site, by discussing conservation experience and lessons, and by recommending future strategies for sustaining its cultural landscapes, this paper is expected to provide a basis for future policy-making for safeguarding traditional rural landscapes.

AB The island of Mauritius has experienced five reptile extinctions since the 1600s. Approximately half of the remaining herpetofauna has been restricted to offshore islets, resulting in small populations at high risk of extinction. Under the combined pressures of invasive species, habitat loss and fragmentation and climate change, translocations are considered a powerful tool in conservation of threatened and endangered species. The Bojer's skink, Gongylomorphus bojerii, on the offshore island on Ilot Vacoas represents the remnant population of the species in the southeast of Mauritius. Given the geographic isolation and its genetic distinctiveness, individuals were translocated to the neighbouring island of Ile aux Fouquets in order to re-establish historical range, minimize extinction risk and maintain genetic variation within the species. Using fifteen microsatellite loci, we assessed the genetic structure of the population on Ilot Vacoas in relation to a northern offshore population (on Round Island) and evaluated the genetic consequences of the translocation. Results revealed that the population on Ilot Vacoas exhibits significantly lower levels of genetic variation and strong differentiation (F (ST) = 0.16) compared to the northern population. The inbreeding coefficient was low and no recent bottleneck event was detected from its genetic signature. The translocation on Ile aux Fouquets did not provide evidence of negative genetic effects. The newly established population retained much of the source's genetic material, though the effective population size was found to be relatively small. These findings confirmed the importance of incorporating genetic management and continuous monitoring to detect changes in the long-term survival of translocated populations.

AB Using Japanese sika deer from boreal and subtropical forests, we investigated the effects of environmental factors on body size variation and tested the following ecological hypotheses pertaining to Bergmann's rule in mammals: (1) heat conservation, (2) heat dissipation, (3) starvation resistance, (4) food availability and (5) insularity. Data on body sizes and habitats of sika deer from 31 populations on the Japanese archipelago were collected. Body mass and cranial greatest length (CGL; reflecting skeletal body size) were measured and analysed separately among gender groups. Path analyses were used to clarify inter-variable relationships and estimate direct and indirect effects of environmental variables on body size. Consistent with Bergmann's rule, a clear latitudinal cline of body size was found for sika deer. Subsequent path analyses showed that the abiotic factors, specifically mean annual temperature and annual precipitation, had significant negative effects on body size, and annual temperature had the greatest effect among tested environmental variables. Winter severity and food availability during spring were significantly associated with body mass but not with CGL. Both heat conservation and dissipation hypotheses were accepted and food availability and starvation resistance hypotheses were applicable to variation of body mass but not to CGL, indicating that phenotypic changes in fat reserves strongly influence variation in body mass. Path diagram modelling of inter-variable relationships fit well for females but not for males, and unexplained variation of male body size suggested the presence of unidentified factors. Variation in mating systems among populations may effect body size variation of the male sika deer.

AB Limited toxicology data are available regarding oil dispersant exposure to coral species. Corexit (R) EC9500A (Corexit) is a commonly applied dispersant most well known for its use after the Deepwater Horizon spill in April, 2010. There is limited evidence that Corexit can cause a bleaching response in corals. The aims of the study were: (1) to determine the extent of bleaching after acute 24 h and 72 h exposures of sublethal concentrations (0-50 ppm) of Corexit to the pulsing soft coral Xenia elongata and (2) to investigate a percent symbiont loss calculation using zooxanthellae density. The percent symbiont loss calculation was compared to a traditional metric of normalizing zooxanthellae density to soluble protein content. Percent symbiont loss was an effective measure of coral stress in acute Corexit exposures, while protein normalized zooxanthellae density was more variable. The bleaching data suggest a positive relationship between dispersant concentration and percent symbiont loss, culminating in excessive tissue necrosis and coral mortality within 72 h in high concentration exposures (p < 0.001). Percent beaching ranged from 25% in 5 ppm exposures to 100% in 50 ppm exposures. Corexit also caused a significant decrease in pulse activity (p < 0.0001) and relative oxygen saturation (p < 0.001), possibly indicating a reduction in photosynthetic efficiency. This study and other similar research indicate that dispersant exposure is highly damaging to marine organisms, including ecologically important coral species.

AB Greenhouses form favourable conditions for establishing stable populations of native as well as invasive alien microinvertebrates. Investigations of palm houses have a long tradition and native, alien and new species for science have been found in many of them. The examined pond and some microreservoirs in Bromeliaceae and Agavoideae in Poznan Palm House (Poland) sampled in 2012, appeared to contain representatives of Rotifera (64 species), Copepoda (2 species), Polychaeta, Acari and Insecta larvae. The most abundant Rotifera species were: Anuraeopsis fissa Gosse, 1851, Ascomorpha ecaudis Perty 1850, Euchlanis dilatata Ehrenberg, 1832, Pompholyx sulcata Hudson, 1885 and Trichocerca rousseleti Voight, 1902. Moreover, rotifers considered to be rare in Poland, i.e., Asplanchna herricki De Guerne, 1888, Collotheca pelagica Rousselet, 1893, Colurella sulcata Stenroos, 1898, Gastropus minor Rousselet, 1892 were also detected in Poznan Palm House. Two recorded Copepoda species were Phyllognathopus viguieri (Maupas, 1892) found in agave microreservoirs and Mesocyclops leuckarti (Claus, 1857) found in reservoir with aquatic plants. For biodiversity evaluation of rotifers Margalef's and Shannon-Wiener's indexes were used and in order to determine species richness the Simpson index was calculated. Additionally, a complete list of all aquatic invertebrates is presented, i.e., Plathelmintes (11 species), Nemeretea (2 species), Oligochatea (13 taxa), Polychaeta (7 species), Gastrotricha (13 taxa) and Copepoda (1 species) previously recorded in Poznan Palm House. To sum up, Palm houses create a convenient habitat for a prevalence of native and introduced invertebrates and are a putative source of alien species, possibly facilitating their release to the environment.

AB According to the acoustic adaptation hypothesis, abiotic noise generated by streams should promote the evolution of high-pitched signals in acoustically communicating animals. The putatively selective effect is best demonstrated by studying trait-environment correlations across recently or currently diverging lineages, and when we understand the ecological interactions that underlie the selective pressures. We studied microclimate, frog distribution, abiotic noise, and the frequency of the advertisement call of the Andean poison frog Andinobates bombetes across variable environmental clines at five localities. Our general hypothesis involves three steps: microclimatic clines determine frogs' distribution, which in turn is associated with different levels of abiotic noise that select for differentially pitched calls. Microclimate changed more abruptly with distance to streams in comparatively dry localities. There, frogs were more aggregated alongside streams and, in turn, experienced higher levels of abiotic noise. As predicted, frogs living alongside streams in dry forests called at higher frequencies, and thus attained comparable signal-to-noise ratios, compared with stream-away frogs. Our data support a role for microclimate in determining frog distribution and thereby the noise conditions that promoted a divergence in a mate-recognition signal.
   Resumen La hipotesis de adaptacion acustica predice que el ruido abiotico en quebradas podria promover la evolucion de cantos a altas frecuencias en animales que utilizan senales auditivas en su comunicacion. Esta hipotesis de evolucion adaptativa se demuestra mejor mediante el estudio de correlaciones entre el rasgo fenotipico de interes y una caracteristica ambiental en linajes recientemente divergentes, y cuando entendemos las interacciones ecologicas que subyacen a las presiones selectivas. Estudiamos el microclima, la distribucion de individuos, el ruido abiotico y la frecuencia de la llamada de anuncio de la rana venenosa Andinobates bombetes a traves de clinas ambientales en cinco localidades. Nuestra hipotesis general consta de tres pasos: clinas microclimaticas determinan la distribucion de individuos, lo que a su vez, implica que algunas ranas deban comunicarse en ambientes con alta exposicion a ruido abiotico y de ahi, se promoveria la evolucion de cantos a altas frecuencias. El microclima cambio mas abruptamente con la distancia a las quebradas en localidades de bosque seco que en localidades de bosque humedo. En las primeras localidades, las ranas estuvieron mas agregadas hacia las quebradas y a su vez, experimentaron mayores niveles de ruido abiotico en su entorno. Como se predijo, las ranas que viven cerca de quebradas en bosques secos exhibieron cantos con frecuencias mas altas y por lo tanto, lograron una relacion senal-ruido comparable a la de ranas viviendo lejos de quebradas en localidades con bosque humedo. Nuestros datos apoyan el rol del microclima en determinar la distribucion de las ranas y de este modo, su exposicion a las condiciones de ruido que promovieron la divergencia en una senal importante en procesos de seleccion de pareja y reconocimiento de conespecificos.

AB Anatomical specimens used in human or veterinary anatomy laboratories are usually prepared with formaldehyde (a cancerous and teratogenic substance), glycerin (an expensive and viscous fluid), or ethanol (which is flammable). This research aimed to verify the viability of an aqueous 30% sodium chloride solution for preservation of anatomical specimens previously fixed with formaldehyde. Anatomical specimens of ruminant, carnivorous, equine, swine and birds were used. All were previously fixed with an aqueous 20% formaldehyde solution and held for 7days in a 10% aqueous solution of the same active ingredient. During the first phase of the experiment, small specimens of animal tissue previously fixed in formaldehyde were distributed in vials with different concentrations of formaldehyde, with or without 30% sodium chloride solution, a group containing only 30% sodium chloride, and a control group containing only water. During this phase, no contamination was observed in any specimen containing 30% sodium chloride solution, whether alone or in combination with different concentrations of formaldehyde. In the second phase of the experiment, the 30% sodium chloride solution, found to be optimal in the first phase of the experiment, was tested for its long-term preservation properties. For a period of 5years, the preserved specimens were evaluated three times a week for visual contamination, odors, and changes in color and texture. There was no visual contamination or decay found in any specimen. Furthermore, no strange odors, or changes in color or softness were noted. The 30% sodium chloride solution was determined to be effective in the preservation of anatomic specimens previously fixed in formaldehyde.

Thus, it can be considered a fossil analog of the present-day Mediterranean Dendropoma reefs. The bioconstruction developed on top of a flat palaeotopographic high formed by pre-Pliocene substrate in a sheltered embayment Submarine cliff sediments, consisting of big blocks and boulders, were deposited along the margin of the palaeohigh. Crusts of coralline algae, intergrowing with serpulids and vermetids, extend from the flat top downwards along the talus. Gray-bluish marl, yellowish silt and fine-grained sand, were deposited in the surrounding low areas. A rich and diverse dweller assemblage occurs in the buildup: bivalves (pectinids, venerids, Lithophaga), gastropods (muricids, nassarids, olivids, cancellarids), ahermatypic coral Cladocora ?, barnacles of the family Pyrgomatidae, Balanus trigonus and regular echinoids. In the talus deposits, clusters of Neopycnodonte cochlear, Hinnites ercolanianus and Balanus sp. dominate the faunal assemblage. Further, the blocks of the talus are densely bored, showing Gastrochaenolites, Entobia, Maeandropolydora and Caulostrepsis. Faunal and boring assemblages indicate that the buildup settled and developed in very shallow conditions (most likely less than 10 m water depth). The whole fossil assemblage, framework and dweller community, are preserved in situ, maintaining their original growth positions. Development in a protected setting, together with rapid burial due to progradation of siliciclastics on top of the palaeotopographic high, accounts for this exceptional preservation in such a shallow environment.
   The vermetid bioconstruction of Sant Onofre represents the only carbonate deposits found in the lower Pliocene basins of NE Spain. Sequence stratigraphic architecture indicates that these carbonates represent the maximum flooding deposits. Thus, maximum carbonate production took place due to sediment starvation in the palaeohigh while terrigenous deposits were formed in the surrounded low areas.(c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The grazing of goats and sheep is regarded as an important factor for soil degradation in semiarid landscapes. Nevertheless, hardly any data can be found in literature. In the presented study, the process dynamics of material disaggregation and translocation directly caused by trampling animals was quantified by means of experimental methods on test plots. Gerlach troughs were installed in order to quantify material mobilization in different directions. The slope angle and the running speed of the animals were varied. Additionally, the amount of material that was loosened by the hooves of the goats was measured.
   The translocation rates were surprisingly high and slope angles as well as running speed turned out to be important influencing factors. In downslope direction, each goat translocated rock fragments from an amount of 0.6 g up to 6.5 g on each square meter, depending on slope. The maximum translocation rate in movement direction reached 4.5 g m(-2) per goat for fast running and 1.3 g m(-2) per goat for slow motion. Additionally, each goat could loosen 14 g of soil material per square meter; this material could easily be removed by wind or water. Experiments with marked rock fragments on slopes of 4 degrees and 11 degrees showed that a flock of 45 goats translocates rock fragments (empty set 3 cm) by a mean distance of 8.8 cm. While rock movement occurred in all directions, most often the rock fragments were kicked forward downslope. Net mean downslope translocation rates varied between 1.5 cm and 6.6 cm corresponding with slope and the total number of rock fragments moved.

AB Rodents affect soil microbial communities by burrow architecture, diet composition, and foraging behavior. We examined the effect of desert rodents on nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) communities by identifying bacteria colony-forming units (CFU) and measuring nitrogen fixation rates (ARA), denitrification (DA), and CO2 emission in soil from burrows of three gerbil species differing in diets. Psammomys obesus is folivorous, Meriones crassus is omnivorous, consuming green vegetation and seeds, and Dipodillus dasyurus is predominantly granivorous. We also identified NFB in the digestive tract of each rodent species and in Atriplex halimus and Anabasis articulata, dominant plants at the study site. ARA rates of soil from burrows of the rodent species were similar, and substantially lower than control soil, but rates of DA and CO2 emission differed significantly among burrows. Highest rates of DA and CO2 emission were measured in D. dasyurus burrows and lowest in P. obesus. CFU differed among bacteria isolates, which reflected dietary selection. Strains of cellulolytic representatives of the family Myxococcaceae and the genus Cytophaga dominated burrows of P. obesus, while enteric Bacteroides dominated burrows of D. dasyurus. Burrows of M. crassus contained both cellulolytic and enteric bacteria. Using discriminant function analysis, differences were revealed among burrow soils of all rodent species and control soil, and the two axes accounted for 91 % of the variance in bacterial occurrences. Differences in digestive tract bacterial occurrences were found among these rodent species. Bacterial colonies in P. obesus and M. crassus burrows were related to bacteria of A. articulata, the main plant consumed by both species. In contrast, bacteria colonies in the burrow soil of D. dasyurus were related to bacteria in its digestive tract. We concluded that gerbils play an important role as ecosystem engineers within their burrow environment and affect the microbial complex of the nitrogen-fixing organisms in soils.

AB Cold stress syndrome (CSS) is the term used to describe the range of clinical signs and chronic disease processes that can occur in Florida, USA, manatees Trichechus manatus latirostris exposed to water temperatures below 20 degrees C for extended periods. Although no cold-related adverse events have been described in the closely related dugong Dugong dugon thus far, it has been established that they make movements in response to water temperatures lower than about 17 to 18 degrees C. In this study, archive reports for dugong carcasses submitted to The University of Queensland School of Veterinary Science for post mortem examination during 2010 to 2012 were examined. These animals had been recovered from Moreton Bay, southeast Queensland, Australia, and 10 out of 14 fulfilled the criteria for 'potential cold stress cases.' Epidermal hyperplasia and secondary bacterial infection, serous atrophy of pericardial adipose tissue, and multi-system abscessation were features commonly noted in these cases. Water temperature data were correlated with the time of year that carcasses were submitted for examination. Higher numbers of carcasses diagnosed with potential CSS were noted during sustained periods in which water temperature was below 20 degrees C. Given the pattern of increased submission of non-specifically, chronically unwell animals in the colder months and evidence that environmental conditions known to precipitate CSS occur in southeast Queensland, it is probable that, like manatees, dugongs in this area are affected by CSS. Further investigation to confirm and to better characterize the syndrome is recommended to refine management practices and improve treatment of affected animals.

AB As part of a conservation initiative, we released captive-bred individuals of European mink (Mustela lutreola) onto a Baltic island 'sanctuary', Hiiumaa (Estonia), and investigated the development of their diet in the wild. Fifty-four animals out of the 172 released were equipped with radio collars and tracked in 2000-2003 intensively after release. Based on the analysis of the contents of 564 collected scats, we monitored how the diet of released individuals changed after release and how this was affected by habitat and by season. Diet changed as they adapted to the wild: some prey consumed immediately after release were later substituted with prey more typical of wild European mink elsewhere. The mink's tendency to take typical prey increased (crayfish, 3; fish, 1.5; and small mammals, 2 times), while the proportion of atypical prey decreased more than five times in 60 days after release. Once established in the wild, the composition of the diet and its variation between seasons, habitats or weather conditions were similar to that reported elsewhere for wild European mink. There is no indication therefore that the components of the diet provided in captivity persisted in the wild after the adaptation period. We suggest that the adaptation of released carnivores to natural prey merits more attention in reintroduction projects.

AB For many years after the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, text analysis and fragment attribution were the main concern of the scholars dealing with them. The uncertain archaeological provenance of a large part of the collection added difficulties to the already formidable task of sorting thousands of fragments. After 60 years of scholarly research the questions of origin, archaeological provenance and correct attribution of the fragments are still debated. To help address these questions we have developed a methodology suitable for the material studies of the scrolls using combinations of X-ray, FTIR and Raman techniques. On the one hand, an accurate characterization of the highly heterogeneous writing media of the Dead Sea Scrolls leads to a reliable reconstruction of their history and, thus, contributes significantly to the current debate. On the other hand, it provides new information on the production of ancient parchment towards the end of the Second Temple period, opening a new page in the historical study of technology.

AB Vegetation coverage plays an important role in hindering the erosion in grassland. The grasslands around the world are suffering from the overgrazing which usually causes coverage decrease. Thus, an urgent objective of ecology is to understand how the vegetation coverage varies with overgrazing in the grassland. Although overgrazing has been studied for a long time, its influence on the change of coverage is not well understood. This work modified Noy-Meir's model of stability in grazing systems by modeling vegetation coverage instead of biomass. The grassland of Maqu (Gansu, China), which is located on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, was chosen as the case study site. The modified model and the introduced parameters were tested, and the relationship between coverage change and the overgrazing sheep units was discussed. The modified model proved to be more suitable to describe the change of vegetation coverage under overgrazing than the published classic models. The results reveal the variation of coverage is determined corporately by grazing intensity, natural conditions and property of grassland. Besides, these results give a reasonable explanation on the difference of coverage change under various grazing situations in previous works. Moreover, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity were studied through introducing some parameters, i.e., the ideally discontinuous grazing period, the proportion that the time of overgrazing occupies in the period, homogeneous factor and restraining constant. Also, the potential positive impact of grazing on the change of coverage was discussed through increasing the growth rate, based on its role in nutrient deposition. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Translocation and reintroduction are used to reduce extinction risk associated with a small population and range size in threatened mammal species. We evaluated the outcome of a reintroduction of the bridled nailtail wallaby Onychogalea fraenata to Avocet Nature Refuge, a private refuge in central Queensland, Australia. This macropod was also reintroduced to Idalia National Park in western Queensland in 1996 and occurs in one natural population in central Queensland. We estimated population growth, adult and juvenile survival, and distribution changes since the last release of O. fraenata to Avocet in 2005, and evaluated female reproductive success and health. Although animals were in good condition, population size was a tenth of that of the 1996 Idalia reintroduction reported after 3 years and, unlike at Idalia, juvenile survival at Avocet was low. The likely causes are consistent with predictors of translocation and reintroduction failures in mammals. These are predation, the small number of individuals in each release, the likely suboptimal health status of reintroduced individuals, drought, and possibly lack of dispersal from the small area of preferred habitat. The lessons of this reintroduction are that future attempts are likely to have the best chance of success if they occur in non-drought years, at sites with large, non-fragmented areas of brigalow forest, involve the release of large groups of animals together, and are accompanied by intensive, long-term baiting to control introduced predators.

AB Most of the studies that have evaluated the interplay between interference and facilitation have been done at the interspecific level, whereas studies at the intraspecific level are scarce. The montane sclerophyllous forests of central Chile are dominated by the tree Kageneckia angustifolia, a semi-deciduous species that lose part of its foliage during summer. It has been reported that during winter snow accumulates in lower amounts beneath the canopy of K. angustifolia favoring the recruitment of new individuals compared to open areas (i.e., facilitation effect). However, it has also been reported that the leaf litter accumulated beneath parental trees contains allelopathic compounds that decrease seed germination, suggesting that recruitment beneath parental plants can be disfavored (i.e., interference effect). Hence, this system seems appropriate to assess the net-outcome between facilitative and negative effects during the emergence and survival of seedlings during the first year. In this study, we asked (i) what is the net-outcome between facilitative and interfering effects for K. angustifolia? (ii) does this net-outcome varies with the distance to parental trees? (iii) are positive and negative effects consistent through the seedling emergence and first year seedling survival phases? (iv) what are the main mechanisms behind the observed net-outcome? and (v) which is the optimal microhabitat for successful recruitment of this species? In an experimental plot of 10,000 m(2), we selected ten K. angustifolia trees and evaluated the effect of leaf litter on the emergence and survival of seedlings produced by experimentally sown seed seeds in three different microhabitats: beneath adult trees, edge of canopy and in open areas. In addition, we sampled three K. angustifolia stands to evaluate the microhabitat where the natural recruitment of this species actually occurring. Results showed that (1) seedling emergence was greater beneath canopy, intermediate in canopy edge and low in open areas, (2) whilst leaf litter significantly reduced seed germination, the magnitude of this negative effect was lower than the positive effect of beneath canopy microhabitat, (3) seedling survival was affected by microhabitats but not by the presence of leaf litter, (4) that the main mechanisms behind the observed patterns are the lower and delayed emergence of seedlings in open areas due to the longer duration of snow cover, decreasing the time to growth before the onset of summer drought, and (5) the greatest natural recruitment of K. angustifolia seedlings occurs beneath parental plants. Therefore, our findings suggest that the net-outcome between facilitative and interfering effect during the first year is mostly facilitative, indicating that adult trees of K. angustifolia are exerting a conspecific nurse effect on the recruitment of new individuals, a form of parental care in plants.

AB Relocating ground squirrels within their natural distribution range is a popular tool in wildlife management in Central Eastern Europe. Nevertheless, wildlife management lacks both a carefully developed and tested translocation guide and methods. We evaluated conditions of release method (time of release and retention of animals) that affect short-term settlement of translocated ground squirrels in the central region of Hungary. In a field experiment, we translocated 117 individuals from an international airport to a protected site in 2000. We found that release time should precede the animals' natural, daily activity peak. The use of retention caps combined with artificial burrows instead of complex acclimation cages works successfully to prevent animals from dispersing from the release site.

ID PORTFOLIO MANAGERS; CAPITAL GOODS; FARMERS
AB P>The paper studies the economy and ecology of sheep farming at the farm level and includes 2 different categories of the animals, ewes (adult females) and lambs. The model is analyzed in a Nordic economic and biological setting. During the outdoor grazing season, animals face limited grazing resources so that the weight gain of lambs is determined by the per-animal vegetation consumption. On the other hand, the number of grazing animals, lambs as well as ewes, determines the grazing pressure. This problem is studied under the assumption of a rational and well-informed farmer who aims to maximize profit in ecological equilibrium with zero animal and vegetation growth. We find that lamb-only slaughtering is optimal and that it is never beneficial for the farmer to keep livestock that overgraze pasture. It is also shown that higher meat prices and more profitable slaughtering make it economically rewarding for the farmer to keep more animals. A numerical illustration indicates that the optimal sheep farming decision may be more sensitive to changes in pasture quality and productivity than changes in economic conditions.

AB We examined the floral display size and potential pollinators of female and male Rhus trichocarpa in northern Kyoto, Japan, in June 2005. The entomophilous pollination system comprised 431 insects and one spider belonging to 124 species. Most pollinators were non-social bees and occasional Diptera and Coleoptera, whereas eusocial bees were not dominant in the pollination system. Male-biased frequencies were observed in the eusocial bees and in some of the non-social bees, probably because they are sensitive to the larger male floral rewards. A pollinator introduction experiment confirmed that male-biased, unbiased and infrequent non-social bees can pollinate R. trichocarpa, indicating that non-social bees can contribute to fruit set. The results suggest that there are likely to be two different functional groups of generalist pollinators: (i) the majority of the pollinators may contribute to reproductive success through unbiased and occasional visits; and (ii) a minority group of eusocial bees may contribute to reproductive success through male-biased visits.

AB Dugongs (Dugong dugon) were monitored using simultaneous passive acoustic methods and visual observations in Thai waters during January 2008. Chirp and trill calls were detected by a towed stereo hydrophone array system. Two teams of experienced observers conducted standard visual observations on the same boat. Comparisons of detection probabilities of acoustic and visual monitoring between two independent observers were calculated. Acoustic and visual detection probabilities were 15.1% and 15.7%, respectively, employing a 300 s matching time interval. When conspecific chirp calls were broadcast from an underwater speaker deployed on the side of the observation boat, the detection probability of acoustic monitoring rose to 19.2%. The visual detection probability was 12.5%. Vocal hot spots characterized by frequent acoustic detection of calls were suggested by dispersion analysis, while dugongs were visually observed constantly throughout the focal area (p<0.001). Passive acoustic monitoring assisted the survey since detection performance similar to that of experienced visual observers was shown. Playback of conspecific chirps appeared to increase the detection probability, which could be beneficial for future field surveys using passive acoustics in order to ensure the attendance of dugongs in the focal area.

AB Traits strongly related to fitness, such as offspring number, are expected to show intraspecific variation among individuals. However, offspring number is invariant in several reptiles, birds, and mammals. Most shorebirds (210+ species), for example, have an invariant clutch size of four eggs, which is unexpected in such an ecologically, behaviourally and socially diverse group.
   The incubation-limitation hypothesis (ILH) suggests that shorebird clutch size is limited by the inability of adults to incubate clutches larger than four eggs. Several recent studies reported no overall costs of incubating experimentally enlarged clutches and concluded no support for the traditional ILH. However, most studies have not measured all potential costs, and none has quantified costs beyond egg hatching. We conducted a clutch-enlargement experiment and measured potential costs both during incubation and chick rearing in pied avocets (Recurvirostra avosetta L.).
   Hatching was more asynchronous and egg hatchability was marginally lower in enlarged clutches than in controls. Nonetheless, more young hatched from enlarged clutches (mean: 4.2 +/- 0.17 SE) than from controls (3.4 +/- 0.09), and the two groups did not differ in incubation period, complete or partial clutch failure, or hatchling body size, apparently refuting the ILH.
   However, pairs incubating enlarged clutches occupied poorer feeding territories during chick rearing, experienced higher chick mortality, and eventually raised fewer young to independence (mean adjusted for season: 0.7 +/- 0.16 SE juveniles) than did control pairs (1.2 +/- 0.13). Chick survival was primarily associated with prey availability, and predation risks were not higher in larger broods.
   Our results provide evidence that incubating unusually large clutches can affect post-hatching performance and lead to lower annual reproductive success in shorebirds. This study, therefore, supports the ILH and points to the importance of monitoring reproductive success beyond the hatching of the chicks.

AB We studied the interaction between the ant Goniomma kugleri and Cistaceae in a Cistus ladanifer-dominated scrubland, in southwestern Spain. We monitored seed harvesting, and studied ant preferences among Cistaceae seeds and their capture efficiencies for preferred seeds. For the stand of C. ladanifer, we estimated seed losses due to the ants. Harvesting was restricted to two seasons: mid-autumn to late winter, and late spring. Ant diet relied on Cistaceae seeds: during autumn and winter 90% of seeds returned to nests were of C. ladanifer, and the remaining fraction also comprised Cistaceae seeds. At this time, the ants harvested seeds directly from the plants. In late spring, the ant diet consisted of Tuberaria guttata s.l. seeds. Goniomma kugleri selectively collected Cistaceae seeds. For preferred species, seed removal rates at the colony level and seed capture times invested by individual workers were correlated with seed size. Because of shorter capture time and higher success frequency, capture efficiency in terms of number of seeds captured per unit time was higher for small-seeded species. Although each ant colony collected large numbers (up to 10(5)) of C. ladanifer seeds over the autumn-winter season, the impact of ant removal on the annual seed output was moderate, at around 20%. It is likely that, in C. ladanifer, the staggered seed release period, and the pulsed exposure of seed clumps in capsules through progressive locule dehiscence, effectively minimise seed losses to the ants.

AB Exploitation of freshwater resources is having catastrophic effects on the ecological dynamics, stability, and quality of those water resources on a global scale, especially in arid and semiarid regions. Lake Kinneret, Israel (the Biblical Sea of Galilee), the only major natural freshwater lake in the Middle East, has been transformed functionally into a reservoir over the course of; 70 years of hydrological alterations aimed mostly at producing electrical power and increasing domestic and agricultural water supply. Historical changes in lake chemistry and biology were reconstructed using analysis of sedimentary nutrient content, stable and radioisotope composition, biochemical and morphological fossils from algae, remains of aquatic invertebrates, and chemical indices of past light regimes. Together, these paleolimnological analyses of the lake's bottom sediments revealed that this transformation has been accompanied by acceleration in the rate of eutrophication, as indicated by increased accumulation rates of phosphorus, nitrogen, organic matter, phytoplankton and bacterial pigments, and remains of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Substantial increases in these indices of eutrophication coincide with periods of increased water-level fluctuations and drainage of a major upstream wetland in the early to middle 20th century and suggest that management of the lake for increased water supply has degraded water quality to the point that ecosystem stability and sustainability are threatened. Such destabilization may be a model for eutrophication of freshwater lakes in other arid regions of the world in which management emphasizes water quantity over quality.

AB In this article, we respond to concerns raised by Brooks and Jones (2008) about recent advances in sea lice and salmon population dynamics in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia. We show that the assessment by Brooks and Jones (2008) is thoroughly mistaken and that their conclusions are based on a combination of obfuscation, misrepresentation, and fundamental misunderstandings. The extinction hypothesis is not actually a hypothesis at all, but rather an inevitable consequence of sustained population decline. Local extinction of Broughton Archipelago pink salmon can be prevented if population declines are turned around, and the data and models suggest this can be achieved if the infestations are stopped. We have organized our responses in an itemized manner according to the headings and subheadings in Brooks and Jones (2008).

AB To prevent the decline of the brown hare Lepus europaeus, especially as a result of hunting pressure, restocking programmes, using hares from elsewhere, were carried out in Greece up to 2001. Using diagnostic RFLP mitochondrial DNA markers we traced the origins of released captive-bred brown hares. We provide evidence that released animals survived long enough to have at least one reproductive cycle and to transmit their genome. If, in the long-term, introgressed foreign genes survive, forming new genotypes with indigenous genes, this would demonstrate that they are successful in terms of competition. As nuclear gene pools are not markedly divergent between Greek and other European hares foreign nuclear genes should not be a serious handicap. Hence, in certain situations release programmes may be appropriate.

AB The importance of animal selection behaviour in determining spatial structure of grazing systems has implications for sustainable grazing management. Although changes in stocking density provide a mechanism for direct control of animal impact, grazing behaviour is also responsible for influencing vegetation dynamics. A spatially explicit grazing model was used to explore the impact of movement in search of higher intake (search rate) and search distance on spatial sward structure, specifically the distribution of sward surface height. The model simulated a two-stage grazing process in heterogeneous environments i.e. searching then biting. As search rate and search distance increased so the spatial variance of sward structure decreased. Changes in herbivore search rate have a greater impact on spatial variance of pastoral grazing systems than search distance. Herbivores foraging in heterogeneous environments with greater search rates may better utilise the available forage resources. Higher search rates in natural and agricultural systems may determine herbivore fitness and survival or production, respectively. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seveso is a town (40,000 inhabitants) 16 km north of Milan, which from 10 July 1976 became synonymous with the chemically induced ecological catastrophe because of the large number of people affected by dioxin exposure and of the large area involved. The most polluted area (about 43 ha) was artificially reconstructed and transformed into a wood composed mainly of oaks with some scattered green fields and some bushy areas, the Bosco delle Querce urban park. A four-year survey monitoring the present ecological and biological risk parameters of the artificially reconstructed ecosystem shows its full ecological recovery as an urban park. Plant and animal coenoses are well composed and the park has been colonized by annelids, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. All these animals are useful biological reagents for risk-assessment because of their potential long-term exposure to TCDD. When some of the endpoints of the xenoestrogen-like molecules' action were studied (i.e., gametogenesis and the gross morphology of genital organs in rabbits and house mice), no signs of TCDD effects were detected. Mutagenicity tests and the house mouse sperm DNA COMET assay do not reveal the presence of any biological risk. The study of the carabidocoenosis and the housefly cytogenetics corroborates this last indication, thus guaranteeing the successful ecological recovery of the formerly most polluted Seveso area.

AB According to the situations encountered in extensified breeding farms, three important pieces of ecological knowledge allow to understand grassland ecosystem dynamics, in order to settle sustainable pasture management in both production and environmental aims. i) The interaction between vegetation and herbivores must be considered as well as the long term adaptation between vegetation status and stocking rate, or as the instantaneous modulation of grassland production and structure under herbivore predation. ii) The dynamics of botanical composition must be represented in terms of sensitivity and resilience to perturbations or to management changes, which condition primary phytomass production and accumulation. Extensifying grassland management induces reversible effects on the seasonal dynamics of the phytomass, but cumulative negative effects on botanical composition. Species strategies are involved in the dynamics of the spatial structure and diversity of the vegetation. iii) The management of the nitrogen cycle allows to manipulate in a long term the soil nitrogen supplying capacity, for improving the perennity of sowed swards, or making easier the control of the phytomass under low stocking rates. The implications for N leaching are discussed. (C) Elsevier/Inra.

AB During July, 1990 - June, 1992 we collected stomach contents of necropsied rodents that totalled 494 Arvicanthis niloticus (Desmarest, 1822), 356 Mastomys natalensis (Smith, 1834) and 273 Tatera valida (Wroughton, 1906) from natural, savanna fields in Nigeria, and 528 Arvicanthis and 367 Mastomys from nearby irrigated fields, where Tatera was never trapped. The materials were processed and microscopically analyzed to determine patterns of diet selection. Sites were sampled for vegetative cover and rodent food resources. More than 90% of the stomach materials could be identified to one of four categories: dicots (vegetative), monocots (vegetative), seeds, and insects. Seeds constituted approximately 50% by mass of foods consumed by all species in both sites during the rains. Mastomys (in both sites) and Tatera maintained the same levels of seed intake year around. Unlike Mastomys, the amount of seeds consumed by Arvicanthis was enhanced by irrigation. In both sites during the rains, monocots and insects made up 12-46% and 14-26% of the rodents diet respectively, but their importance diminished in the natural site during the dry seasons. Tests of MANOVA indicated significant species differences and effects of site, season and their interactions on foods selected. A few plant species dominated the vegetative cover, and dramatic differences in the quality of seasonal herbage were observed.

TI IMPACT OF PHOSPHORUS LOADINGS ON MACRO-ALGAL COMMUNITIES IN THE RED-SEA
   COAST OF EGYPT
SO WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION

AB This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of phosphorus loadings on the seasonal abundance and diversity of macro-algal communities at three sites of the Egyptian coastal region of the Red Sea. Sea-water analysis revealed no significant variations in the levels of dissolved inorganic carbon at these sites. Nitrate content was highest during the winter season especially at Ghardaqa. The localized phosphate pollution at the two other sites significantly increased the phosphate level in water which led to significant decreases in biomass of the macroalgae as compared to Ghardaqa.
   The intertidal zone at one of the impacted sites supported very poor algal vegetation, dominated by Phaeophyta in winter and spring and Rhodophyta in summer and autumn; at Quseir it was dominated by microfilamentous Rhodophya. At Ghardaqa, the intertidal macro-algal community was dominated by Phaeophyta. The results also showed that the abundance of marcroalgae reached its maximum in August at all the study sites, and that species diversity was significantly higher at Quseir than at the other two sites.

AB Two primarily granivorous rodents of Old World deserts, Gerbillus allenbyi (mean adult body mass=26 g) and G. pyramidum (mean adult body mass=40 g), coexist in sandy habitats in the northwestern Negev desert. Both species are burrow dwellers and are nocturnal; however, in their overall distributions, G. pyramidum occurs in more extreme deserts than does G. allenbyi. In comparing field metabolic rate (FMR) and water influx of the two Gerbillus species, we considered two alternative hypotheses: (1) given the difference in their overall distributions, G. pyramidum has a lower FMR and water influx than G. allenbyi, and (2) given the similarity in their diets, and that we worked with sympatric populations, FMR and water influx are similar. The latter alternative proved to be correct. Field metabolic rates in summer were 7.29 kJ . g-0.51 . day-1 for G. allenbyi and 7.74 kJ . g-0.51 . day-1 for G. pyramidwn, values that were 69.3% and 74.5%, respectively, of those predicted for rodents of their body masses. Summer water influx of G. allenbyi was 0.167 ml . g-0.90 . day-1 and that of G. pyramidum was 0.144 ml . g-0.90 . day-1; these values were 79.4% and 68.6%, respectively, of water influxes predicted for rodents of their body masses. When compared allometrically, there were no interspecific differences in any of the measurements.

AB Rensch's rule relates to a pattern whereby sexual size dimorphism is more female-biased in small-sized species and more male-biased in large-sized ones. We collected literature and museum data on the body size of males and females belonging to 4032 lizard species, as well as data on their reproductive modes and clutch sizes. We used phylogenetic comparative analyses, and general linear mixed models, to test Rensch's rule and examined how reproductive mode and clutch size affect sexual size dimorphism. Sexual size dimorphism was independent of clutch size in lizard species with variable clutch sizes and in oviparous lizards. Large litters were associated with female-biased sexual dimorphism in viviparous and in scincomorph lizards. Inference regarding Rensch's rule depended on the analytical method used to identify it. The widely used, but less conservative, reduced major axis regression usually support Rensch's rule while ordinary least squares regressions mostly show isometric relationships. The rule tended to apply more to oviparous than to viviparous lizards. We infer that Rensch's rule is, at best, a weak pattern in lizards. This is especially true in viviparous lineages where females reproduce infrequently and therefore evolve large sizes to maximise fecundity, resulting in female-biased dimorphism.

AB Large carnivores have experienced widespread extirpation and species are now threatened globally. The ecological impact of the loss of large carnivores has been prominent in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique, after most were extirpated during the 1977-92 civil war. To remedy this, reintroductions are now being implemented in Gorongosa, initiating with endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), hereafter 'wild dogs'. We describe the first transboundary translocation and reintroduction of founding packs of wild dogs to Gorongosa over a 28-month study period and evaluate the success of the reintroduction based on five key indicator categories. We also assess how wild dog space use and diet influenced their success. We found that pre-release, artificial pack formation in holding enclosures aided group cohesion and alpha pair establishment. Post-release, we also observed natural pack formations as a result of multiple dispersal events. Founder and naturally formed packs produced pups in two of the three breeding seasons and packs successfully recruited pups. Survival rate for all wild dogs was 73% and all mortality events were from natural causes. Consequently, the population grew significantly over the study period. All indicators of success were fully achieved and this study documents the first successful reintroduction of wild dogs into a large, unfenced landscape in Mozambique and only the second on the continent. Potential mechanisms underlying these early successes were the avoidance of habitats intensively used by lions, dietary partitioning with lion, avoidance of human settlements, and Gorongosa's management strategy. We predict further population expansion in Gorongosa given that 68% of the park is still unused by wild dogs. This expansion could be stimulated by continued reintroductions over the short- to medium-term. Recovery of wild dogs in Gorongosa could aid in the re-establishment of a larger, connected population across the greater Gorongosa-Marromeu landscape.

TI What factors increase the vulnerability of native birds to the impacts
   of alien birds?
SO ECOGRAPHY
LA English
DT Article

AB Biodiversity impacts caused by alien species can be severe, including those caused by alien birds. In order to protect native birds, we aimed to identify factors that influence their vulnerability to the impacts of alien birds. We first reviewed the literature to identify native bird species sustaining such impacts. We then assigned impact severity scores to each native bird species, depending on the severity of the impacts sustained, and performed two types of analyses. First, we used contingency table tests to examine the distribution of impacts across their severity, type and location, and across native bird orders. Second, we used mixed-effects models to test factors hypothesised to influence the vulnerability of native birds to the impacts of alien birds.
   Ground-nesting shorebirds and seabirds were more prone to impacts through predation, while cavity-nesting woodpeckers and parrots were more prone to impacts through competition. Native bird species were more vulnerable when they occupied islands, warm regions, regions with climatic conditions similar to those in the native range of the invading alien species, and when they were physically smaller than the invading alien species. To a lesser extent, they were also vulnerable when they shared habitat preferences with the invading alien species.
   By considering the number and type of native bird species affected by alien birds, we demonstrate predation impacts to be more widespread than previously indicated, but also that damaging predation impacts may be underreported. We identify vulnerable orders of native birds, which may require conservation interventions; characteristics of native birds that increase their vulnerability, which may be used to inform risk assessments; and regions where native birds are most vulnerable, which may direct management interventions. The impacts sustained by native birds may be going unnoticed in many regions of the world: there is a clear need to identify and manage them.

AB Context Forest landscape restoration (FLR) was first defined in 2000 and has emerged from several disciplines, including conservation biology and landscape ecology. As it has gained in popularity, it is useful to go back to its origins and explore its similarities and differences with the discipline of landscape ecology. Objective This article aims to identify the relationship between forest landscape restoration (FLR) and landscape ecology. Methods It draws on a historical overview of FLR, an analysis of the definition of FLR and examples from existing FLR projects to illustrate this relationship. The article then analyses the convergence and divergence between FLR and landscape ecology. Results Three areas of convergence - landscapes, integration and connectivity - and three areas of divergence - process versus analysis, transformative and political nature of FLR- are identified and described. Conclusions Going forward, some areas of integration between the two disciplines are proposed.

AB The Laguna Madre-Tamaulipas is the world's largest hypersaline lagoon and is equally located in south Texas, USA, and Tamaulipas, Mexico. Over 40% of its American surface area is covered by wind-tidal sand flats containing cyanobacteria as the major autotrophic component of the microbial community. A recent laboratory examination of these microbial mats revealed the presence of a boring, filamentous cyanobacterium which, in culture, 'drilled' through an agar substrate. The observed clockwise/counterclockwise rotation, gliding, and boring ability of the filaments was atypical for any known cyanobacterium. The isolate from Laguna Madre produces nine toxins that were originally described from both marine and freshwater habitats. Presence of a diverse array of bioactive metabolites in our unialgal culture agrees with earlier work demonstrating diverse toxin production by marine cyanobacteria. Initial comparison of this new taxon with its polyphasically closest genus,Oxynema,showed several morphological, physiological, and phylogenetic differences, warranting establishment of a new family Laspinemaceae, containingPerforafilum tunnelli gen.&sp. nov.

AB Calcium silicate slag (CSS) is an industrial waste residue produced by the extraction of Al2O3 from highalumina fly ash. CSS, along with cement, is used as a cementing material to reduce land pollution and to utilize industrial waste effectively. The effects of the replacement rate and age of CSS on the compressive strength and hydration degree of the cementitious composite system are examined, and a model for predicting compressive strength is constructed. Results show that the strength and hydration degree of the cementitious composites decrease slightly with the increase in the replacement rate of CSS. When the replacement rate did not exceed 50%, the strengths of the cementitious composites could still reach the 32.5 MPa standard. Microstructural analysis indicated that amorphous C-(A)-S-H, flaky CH, and a small amount of rod-like ettringite (e.g., AFt) made the sample structure compact. The compressive strengths of the cementitious composites were calculated using the response surface method (RSM), and the results show that RSM could predict the compressive strength of cementitious composites accurately. This study shows that CSS can be used as a substitute for cement, thereby providing an effective method for the large-scale utilization of CSS. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Modern stromatolites are key to the record of past microbial activity preserved in fossil carbonate deposits. Mono-phototrophic cultures dominated by the cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. were obtained from a laboratory-maintained, low magnesium-calcite stromatolite originating from Lagoa Vermelha, Brazil. This lagoonal system has been described as a Precambrian analog, illustrating a period of photosynthetically induced atmospheric oxygenation, which created a global sanctuary from shortwave solar radiation and enabled the evolution of modern life on Earth. The enrichment cultures precipitate carbonates in minimal media, suggesting that cyanobacterial photosynthesis and extracellular polymeric substance production may be crucial in the mineralization of the studied stromatolite. We further show that Geitlerinema sp. can build and maintain filamentous mats under long-term UV-C exposure. Our results suggest that present day stromatolites dominated by cyanobacteria may be interpreted as biosignatures of atmospheric oxygenation and have implications for the search for putative biological traces on Mars.

AB We investigate stationary, spatially localized patterns in lattice dynamical systems that exhibit bistability. The profiles associated with these patterns have a long plateau where the pattern resembles one of the bistable states, while the profile is close to the second bistable state outside this plateau. We show that the existence branches of such patterns generically form either an infinite stack of closed loops (isolas) or intertwined s-shaped curves (snaking). We then use bifurcation theory near the anti-continuum limit, where the coupling between edges in the lattice vanishes, to prove existence of isolas and snaking in a bistable discrete real Ginzburg-Landau equation. We also provide numerical evidence for the existence of snaking diagrams for planar localized patches on square and hexagonal lattices and outline a strategy to analyse them rigorously.

AB Terrestrial breeding is a derived condition in frogs, with multiple transitions from an aquatic ancestor. Shifts in reproductive mode often involve changes in habitat use, and these are typically associated with diversification in body plans, with repeated transitions imposing similar selective pressures. We examine the diversification of reproductive modes, male and female body sizes, and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in the Neotropical frog genera Cycloramphus and Zachaenus, both endemic to the Atlantic rainforest of Brazil. Species in this clade either breed in rocky streams (saxicolous) or in terrestrial environments, allowing us to investigate reproductive habitat shifts. We constructed a multilocus molecular phylogeny and inferred evolutionary histories of reproductive habitats, body sizes, and SSD. The common ancestor was small, saxicolous, and had low SSD. Terrestrial breeding evolved independently three times and we found a significant association between reproductive habitat and SSD, with shifts to terrestrial breeding evolving in correlation with decreases in male body size, but not female body size. Terrestrial breeding increases the availability of breeding sites and results in concealment of amplexus, egg-laying, and parental care, therefore reducing male-male competition at all stages of reproduction. We conclude that correlated evolution of terrestrial reproduction and small males is due to release from intense male-male competition that is typical of exposed saxicolous breeding.

AB Species simultaneously compete with and facilitate one another. Size can mediate transitions along this competition-facilitation continuum, but the consequences for demography are unclear. We orthogonally manipulated the size of a focal species, and the size and density of a heterospecific neighbour, in the field using a model marine system. We then parameterised a size-structured population model with our experimental data. We found that heterospecific size and density interactively altered the population dynamics of the focal species. Size determined whether heterospecifics facilitated (when small) or competed with (when large) the focal species, while density strengthened these interactions. Such size-mediated interactions also altered the pace of the focal's life history. We provide the first demonstration that size and density mediate competition and facilitation from a population dynamical perspective. We suspect such effects are ubiquitous, but currently underappreciated. We reiterate classic cautions against inferences about competitive hierarchies made in the absence of size-specific data.

AB Adult body size, mass and condition predict reproductive success and survival, and hence fitness, in mammals and many other animals. Here, we assessed morphological variation and body condition in populations of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) along an urban to natural land use gradient in the Sydney region, Australia. The red fox was introduced into Australia in the mid-19th century and is a recent but successful urban adapter as well as a highly effective predator of naive native species. As the red fox has successfully invaded urban environments in many parts of the world where it readily exploits anthropogenic sources of food, we hypothesized that individuals should be larger and in better condition in urban than in natural habitats. We found that individuals (N = 135) of both sexes had larger body mass and skeletal measurements in urban than in more natural habitats; body condition, by contrast, showed no consistent variation. Thus, the urban environment of Sydney provides conditions that favour an increase in size in red foxes so that individuals are now larger than, but in similar body condition as, their non-urban counterparts. Increased body size and mass may enable red foxes to hunt a broader array of prey species, and as such would be of added concern for the management of native wildlife in Australia's urban environments, a possibility that warrants further investigation.

AB Aim Understanding the mechanisms determining species richness is a primary goal of biogeography. Richness patterns of sub-groups within a taxon are usually assumed to be driven by similar processes. However, if richness of distinct ecological strategies respond differently to the same processes, inferences made for an entire taxon may be misleading. We deconstruct the global lizard assemblage into functional groups and examine the congruence among richness patterns between them. We further examine the species richness - functional richness relationship to elucidate the way functional diversity contributes to the overall species richness patterns. Location Global. Methods Using comprehensive biological trait databases we classified the global lizard assemblage into ecological strategies based on body size, diet, activity times and microhabitat preferences, using Archetypal Analysis. We then examined spatial gradients in the richness of each strategy at the one-degree grid cell, biome, and realm scales. Results We found that lizards can best be characterized by seven "ecological strategies": scansorial, terrestrial, nocturnal, herbivorous, fossorial, large, and semi-aquatic. There are large differences among the global richness patterns of these strategies. While the major richness hotspot for lizards in general is in Australia, several strategies exhibit highest richness in the Amazon Basin. Importantly, the global maximum in lizard species richness is achieved at intermediate values of functional diversity and increasing functional diversity further result in a slow decline of species richness. Main conclusions The deconstruction of the global lizard assemblage along multiple ecological axes offers a new way to conceive lizard diversity patterns. It suggests that local lizard richness mostly increases when species belonging to particular ecological strategies become hyper-diverse there, and not because more ecological types are present in the most species rich localities. Thus maximum richness and maximum ecological diversity do not overlap. These results shed light on the global richness pattern of lizards, and highlight previously unidentified spatial patterns in understudied functional groups.

AB The magnitude and direction of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) varies greatly across the animal kingdom, reflecting differential selection pressures on the reproductive and/or ecological roles of males and females. If the selection pressures and constraints imposed on body size change along environmental gradients, then SSD will vary geographically in a predictable way. Here, we uncover a biogeographical reversal in SSD of lizards from Central and North America: in warm, low latitude environments, males are larger than females, but at colder, high latitudes, females are larger than males. Comparisons to expectations under a Brownian motion model of SSD evolution indicate that this pattern reflects differences in the evolutionary rates and/or trajectories of sex-specific body sizes. The SSD gradient we found is strongly related to mean annual temperature, but is independent of species richness and body size differences among species within grid cells, suggesting that the biogeography of SSD reflects gradients in sexual and/or fecundity selection, rather than intersexual niche divergence to minimize intraspecific competition. We demonstrate that the SSD gradient is driven by stronger variation in male size than in female size and is independent of clutch mass. This suggests that gradients in sexual selection and male-male competition, rather than fecundity selection to maximize reproductive output by females in seasonal environments, are predominantly responsible for the gradient.

ID WAVE-SOLUTIONS; SYSTEMS; STATES
AB Spatially localized patterns have been observed in numerous physical contexts, and their bifurcation diagrams often exhibit similar snaking behavior: symmetric solution branches, connected by bifurcating asymmetric solution branches, wind back and forth in an appropriate parameter. Previous papers have addressed existence of such solutions; here we address their stability, taking the necessary first step of unifying existence and uniqueness proofs for symmetric and asymmetric solutions. We then show that, under appropriate assumptions, temporal eigenvalues of the front and back underlying a localized solution are added with multiplicity in the right half plane. In a companion paper, we analyze the behavior of eigenvalues at lambda = 0 and inside the essential spectrum. Our results show that localized snaking solutions are stable if, and only if, the underlying fronts and backs are stable: unlike localized non-oscillatory solutions, no interaction eigenvalues are present. We use the planar Swift-Hohenberg system to illustrate our results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim We use ecogeographical rules to understand the relationship between biogeography and morphological evolution in Sorex (Linnaeus, 1758) shrews. Specifically, we test for climatic correlations in body size (Bergmann's rule; larger species in colder habitats) and pelage brightness (Gloger's rule; darker species in more humid/warmer habitats). Location North America and Eurasia (Holarctic). Taxon Sorex spp. (Mammalia: Soricomorpha: Soricidae). Methods We compiled body size data for 51 species of Sorex and measured pelage brightness from museum specimens for 43 species. We sourced bioclimatic data across the geographical range of each species as well as specific to the museum specimen localities. For comparative purposes, we also estimated a Sorex phylogeny using existing sequence data. To test Bergmann's and Gloger's rules, we constructed phylogenetic least squares models considering latitude, altitude, and bioclimatic variables as predictors of interspecific variation in body size and pelage brightness across Sorex. We then performed these tests separately for the Palaearctic and Nearctic lineages. Results Sorex exhibits wide variation in both body size and pelage brightness. In models of the entire genus and of the Nearctic clade, neither trait is significantly predicted by the variables tested. A decrease in pelage brightness in the Palaearctic clade is significantly predicted by increasing mean annual temperature and annual precipitation, but only when considering climatic data specific to the measured specimen localities. Main conclusions Sorex does not conform to Bergmann's rule. This result aligns with intraspecific studies suggesting Bergmann's rule is less evident in smaller taxa, but it counters others that found support for the rule in North American and European assemblages. Different patterns in pelage evolution across the Nearctic and Palaearctic clades may result from different historical climatic pressures; however, the significance of the relationship between climate and pelage evolution is dependent on the specificity of the climatic data. Sorex may be a useful focal taxon for exploring the relationship between intra- and interspecific ecogeographical patterns as well as the relative roles of morphological, behavioural, physiological, and life history characteristics in explaining the ability to persist in climatically challenging environments.

AB 1. Some ecosystems show nonlinear responses to gradual changes in environmental conditions, once a threshold in conditions-or critical point-is passed. This can lead to wide shifts in ecosystem states, possibly with dramatic ecological and economic consequences. Such behaviours have been reported in drylands, savannas, coral reefs or shallow lakes for example. Important research effort of the last decade has been devoted to identifying indicators that would help anticipate such ecosystem shifts and avoid their negative consequences.
   2. Theoretical and empirical research has shown that, as an ecosystem approaches a critical point, specific signatures arise in its temporal and spatial dynamics; these changes can be quantified using relatively simple statistical metrics that have been referred to as "early warning signals" (EWS) in the literature. Although tests of those EWS on experiments are promising, empirical evidence from out-of-laboratory datasets is still scarce, in particular for spatial EWS. The recent proliferation of remote-sensing data provides an opportunity to improve this situation and evaluate the reliability of spatial EWS in many ecological systems.
   3. Here, we present a step-by-step workflow along with code to compute spatial EWS from raster data such as aerial images, test their significance compared to permutation-based null models, and display their trends, either at different time steps or along environmental gradients. We created the R-package spatial-warnings (MIT license) to help achieve all these steps in a reliable and reproducible way, and thereby promote the application of spatial EWS to empirical data.
   4. This software package and associated documentation provides an easy entry point for researchers and managers into spatial EWS-based analyses. By facilitating a broader application, it will leverage the evaluation of spatial EWS on real data, and eventually contribute to providing tools to map ecosystems' fragility to perturbations and inform management decisions.

AB The Arabian Gulf is one of the most heavily impacted water bodies raising serious concerns about the conservation status of many marine species. A limited coastal range and near-shore distribution make Indian Ocean humpback dolphins particularly vulnerable to mortality and traumatic injuries from heavy maritime traffic and gill-netting practices. Prior to the present study, no research had focused on the ecology of this species in the Arabian Gulf despite the potential for human impacts. The mark-recapture method of photo-identification, undertaken during 55 boat-based surveys conducted between 2014 and 2015, was used to assess the occurrence, abundance and use of habitat of this endangered species along the coast of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi (UAE). In all, 368 h and 6703 km of observation were carried out over a period of 5 months, and 54 encounters were made with humpback dolphins. The group size ranged from 1 to 24 individuals and group composition showed that 79% of the observed dolphins were adults. Abundance estimates were calculated and fitted with open population models. A review of all available data indicates that the studied population is the largest reported in the world with 701 (95% CI = 473 - 845) individuals. While their occurrence within Abu Dhabi near-shore waters is frequent, the survey area appears to be only a part of a much larger home range for this humpback dolphin population.

AB A reintroduction project for the endangered Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon was conducted in Ningshan County (Shaanxi Province) on May 31, 2007. Post-release monitoring of the survival of the reintroduced population was carried out extensively from 2008 to 2015. Data collected over eight years after release were used to estimate the annual survival rate for different cohorts using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model with capture-recapture data. The mean annual survival rates for all individuals were estimated to be 0.738 (95% CI: 0.547-0.801) and 0.752 (95% CI: 0.478-0.887) for released birds. For different age classes in the recipient population, the survival rates were estimated to be 0.384 (95% CI: 0.277-0.504), 0.853 (95% CI: 0.406-0.978), and 0.812 (95% CI: 0.389-0.950) for yearlings, juveniles and adults, respectively. The higher mortality for yearlings has greatly decreased the survival rate and our focal population was indeed sensitive to changes in yearling survival. Therefore, effective protection of yearlings was crucial to population persistence, as well as to juveniles and adults. The large proportion of mature individuals in our focal population indicated a gradually growing population. There was a slight bias towards males in the adult sex ratio with the increase of wild-born offspring, but it was not statistically significant. Therefore, we conclude that the primary goal of establishing a self-sustaining population of the Crested Ibis in part of their historical range has been achieved. Finally, we discuss factors affecting the survival of the reintroduced population and we propose some changes for future management of endangered species.

AB The density, size, and morphology of coastal invertebrate species often predictably vary with latitude. In this study we evaluate whether the density, size, and morphology of the pulmonate limpet, Siphonaria lessonii, in the Southwestern Atlantic varies in agreement to the predictions of the abundance-centre hypothesis (i.e., higher densities by the center of the species range), Bergmann's rule (i.e., increasing body size with latitude), and Allen's rule (i.e., decreasing body surface to volume ratio with latitude). Our results indicate that the upper density bounds of S. lessonii decrease with latitude across our study range, which may either contradict expectations of the abundant-centre model (i.e, if assuming a Temperate Southwestern Atlantic/Magellanic distribution; 27 degrees S in the Atlantic to 42 degrees S in the Pacific) or represent a partial trend within a broader scale, abundant-centre pattern (i.e., when considering a panmictic distribution from the Temperate Southwestern Atlantic to the Temperate Southeastern Pacific; 27 degrees S in the Atlantic to 5 degrees S in the Pacific). Limpet shell length (i.e., a surrogate of body size) was not significantly related to latitude (cf. Bergmann's rule). The two principal components of morphological variation in limpet shells-which increased with decreasing shell surface to volume ratio-showed positive and negative relationships with latitude (i.e., contradictory support to Allen's rule). From these analyses, we conclude (a) that the size and morphology of S. lessonii are primarily controlled by local conditions rather than broad-scale climatic or environmental gradients and, (b) that geographic marginality does not means reduced performance in this species at least as it concerns to abundance and maximum size.

AB Mammal species contribute in different ways to seed dispersal effectiveness, acting as endozoochorous dispersers, scatter-hoarders and seed predators. Seed removal by these functional mammal groups could be affected by anthropogenic drivers, such as grazing management, a common practice in drylands. We evaluated removal of seeds from a native tree species (Prosopis flexuosa) by terrestrial wildlife mammals with different functional roles, on grazed and ungrazed sites and at different times during the fruiting period of Prosopis. We offered Prosopis fruits, each containing 15 seeds, to animals and used camera traps to identify the species removing them. We obtained the number of seeds removed (1 fruit removed = 15 seeds removed) by each animal species and each functional group. Native and domestic mammals removed 65.4% of the total seeds offered; 69.5% of offered seeds were removed from the grazed area and 61% from the ungrazed site. Considering removal times, 64.25% of offered seeds were removed during the beginning of the fruiting period of Prosopis and 67% towards the end of this period. Small mammals acting either as seed predators (Graomys griseoflavus and Akodon dolores) or scatter-hoarders (Microcavia australis) were the functional mammal groups removing the highest amount of seeds. Seed predators removed more seeds from the ungrazed site, whereas the scatter-hoarder did so at the grazed site. In the ungrazed area, it would be important to ensure habitat heterogeneity in order to improve seed removal by functional groups that disperse seeds, such as endozoochorous dispersers and scatter-hoarders.

AB 1. Allometric scaling of net primary production (NPP) with plant biomass (B) is important to ecological carbon dynamics and energetics. Metabolic theory predicts a nonlinear power law for NPP scaling, based on fractal vascular systems, resulting in a linear model when using log NPP/log B axes that are standard in allometry. Alternatively, two other hypotheses predict nonlinear models for log-transformed data, with potential tipping points. Size-based competition may cause a quadratic curve as larger plants limit NPP by smaller plants. More inclusively, the plant adaptive strategies hypothesis predicts a sigmoidal curve to represent those same competitive effects, plus stress and ruderal adaptations that maintain relatively low NPP in habitats that are abiotically limiting or disturbed.
   2. We evaluated all three hypotheses for terrestrial vascular plants, using information theoretic model selection based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). Published data (N = 709) were organised in subsets according to reported organisational level and plant growth form. Alternative curves were compared for a general model (using all data) and per subset. Potential tipping points were estimated using segmented regression.
   3. The plant adaptive strategies hypothesis was supported in general (AICc weight = 1.00) and via internal consistency for five of six subsets (86% of data). Competition was supported as affecting NPP at greater B, where quadratic and sigmoidal models often coincided. Only non-woody assemblages most plausibly fit a power law model, perhaps related to sparse data at lowest B.
   4. Synthesis. Adaptive strategies and corresponding environmental conditions appear to constrain terrestrial net primary production scaling relative to metabolic theory's ideal. Moreover, tipping points in general nonlinear net primary production scaling (at c. 38 and 360 g m(-2) B) indicate thresholds for rapid changes in net primary production given changing B that occurs via changing climate, human appropriation and land use.

   Evident 15 Years after Translocation

AB Duvaucel's Geckos (Hoplodactylus duvaucelii) are large-bodied, long-lived, and slow-breeding geckos endemic to New Zealand. Translocation is considered an important tool for conservation of this species. The first translocation of these geckos occurred in 1998 when 40 geckos were released on a pest-free island. Despite multiple survey efforts within the decade after release, captures were too sparse to determine whether the population had successfully established. We revisited the population to investigate establishment over a longer time period (11-15 yr post release). We utilized a recently developed outcome assessment framework that assesses a translocation's success as a progression through four, time-bound 'Stages.' We recaptured 12 founder animals and all were larger than at release (Stage 1). Recruitment was evident (Stage 2) with 91.7% of all geckos captured between 2009 and 2013 being island-born. Mark-recapture results from 144 individuals estimated that 245 geckos (95% confidence interval: 179-336) were present in the population by February 2013, an approximately 6-fold increase in number since 1998 (Stage 3). Population viability analysis indicated the population has become self-sustaining, with an average population increase rate of 6.35-10.14% per year and a negligible probability of extinction within 50 yr (Stage 4). In this case, a 10-15 yr time period appeared to be a sufficient time frame for identification of translocation success by both traditional and time-bound criteria. Fulfilment of each time-bound indicator of short-term success therefore appears to have been a reliable predictor of ultimate translocation success in this long-lived, slow-breeding lizard species.

AB Experiments and computer simulations are carried out to investigate phase separation in a granular gas under vibration. The densities of the dilute and the dense phase are found to follow a lever rule and obey an equation of state. Here we show that the Maxwell equal-areas construction predicts the coexisting pressure and binodal densities remarkably well, even though the system is far from thermal equilibrium. This construction can be linked to the minimization of mechanical work associated with density fluctuations without invoking any concept related to equilibrium-like free energies.

TI A Coupled Vegetation-Crust Model for Patchy Landscapes
SO PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID PATTERN-FORMATION; NEGEV DESERT; ECOSYSTEM; SOIL; REGIME
AB A new model for patchy landscapes in drylands is introduced. The model captures the dynamics of biogenic soil crusts and their mutual interactions with vegetation growth. The model is used to identify spatially uniform and spatially periodic solutions that represent different vegetation-crust states, and map them along the rainfall gradient. The results are consistent extensions of the vegetation states found in earlier models. A significant difference between the current and earlier models of patchy landscapes is found in the bistability range of vegetated and unvegetated states; the incorporation of crust dynamics shifts the onset of vegetation patterns to a higher precipitation value and increases the biomass amplitude. These results can shed new light on the involvement of biogenic crusts in desertification processes that involve vegetation loss.

AB In semi-arid ecosystems, successful use of the limited water resources is of central importance in determining the evolutionary trends of the vegetation. The competition between different species and individuals for this resource is driven by variations in physiology and metabolic regulation strategies, expressed by such parameters as rooting depth, wilting point or stomatal opening, among others. It is typically not practical to simulate the full evolutionary dynamics of every plant individual in the landscape because of the difficulties introduced by the spatial heterogeneity, as well as the many timescales involved, ranging from hourly up to intergenerational. Instead, the amount of biomass of a given species assimilated per unit area of the landscapemay serve as a proxy for its competitiveness and evolutionary success. It is the behaviour of the biomass, which must be described probabilistically due to the stochasticity of the rainfall, which is the subject here. This paper develops a new analytical description of the stationary and transient joint behaviour of plant biomass and soil moisture. Additionally, the effects of climatic fluctuations are considered, including the important case of a bi-seasonal climate regime consisting of alternating wet and dry seasons, which is characteristic of many ecosystems of interest.

AB Since wild badgers were first connected with outbreaks of bovine TB (bTB) in UK cattle herds in the early 1970s, the question of whether to cull them to control infections in cattle has been the subject of a protracted public and policy controversy. Following the recommendation of Prof. John Krebs that a "scientifically based experimental trial" be carried out to test the effectiveness of badger culling, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) was commissioned by Government in 1998. One of the largest field experiments ever conducted in the UK, the RBCT sought to recreate the conditions of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) across approximately 3000 km(2) of the South West of England. Despite widespread expectations that the RBCT would provide the necessary evidence to resolve the controversy, its findings have instead been widely contested and reinterpreted, while arguments over badger culling have become increasingly polarised. This paper will investigate the complexities of field experimental knowledge by following the story of the RBCT from this initial proposal, through processes of research design, implementation, analysis, interpretation and reinterpretation of the findings by multiple actors. It asks what kind of experiment the RBCT actually was, and examines how it has contributed to the protracted controversy over whether to cull badgers in order to control bTB in cattle. Finally, it will explore the wider implications of this case for contemporary debates over the contribution that RCTs can make to formulating public policy.

AB Abundant microbial mats, recently discovered in underwater freshwater springs in the hypersaline Dead Sea, are mostly dominated by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. We investigated the source of sulfide and the activity of these communities. Isotopic analysis of sulfide and sulfate in the spring water showed a fractionation of 39-50 parts per thousand indicative of active sulfate reduction. Sulfate reduction rates (SRR) in the spring sediment (< 2.8 nmol cm(-3) day(-1)) are too low to account for the measured sulfide flux. Thus, sulfide from the springs, locally reduced salinity and O-2 from the Dead Sea water are responsible for the abundant microbial biomass around the springs. The springs flow is highly variable and accordingly the local salinities. We speculate that the development of microbial mats dominated by either Sulfurimonas/Sulfurovum-like or Thiobacillus/Acidithiobacillus-like sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, results from different mean salinities in the microenvironment of the mats. SRR of up to 10 nmol cm(-3) day(-1) detected in the Dead Sea sediment are surprisingly higher than in the less saline springs. While this shows the presence of an extremely halophilic sulfate-reducing bacteria community in the Dead Sea sediments, it also suggests that extensive salinity fluctuations limit these communities in the springs due to increased energetic demands for osmoregulation.

AB Genetic variation in a population can sometimes arise so fast as to modify ecosystem dynamics. Such phenomena have been observed in natural predator-prey systems and characterized in the laboratory as showing unusual phase relationships in population dynamics, including a p phase shift between predator and prey (evolutionary cycles) and even undetectable prey oscillations compared to those of the predator (cryptic cycles). Here we present a generic individual-level stochastic model of interacting populations that includes a subpopulation of low nutritional value to the predator. Using a master equation formalism and by mapping to a coherent state path integral solved by a system-size expansion, we show that evolutionary and cryptic quasicycles can emerge generically from the combination of intrinsic demographic fluctuations and clonal mutations alone, without additional biological mechanisms.

AB Archaeal metabolism was studied in aragonitic and gypsum fades of the Dead Sea subsurface using high-throughput DNA sequencing. We show that the communities are well adapted to the peculiar environment of the Dead Sea subsurface. They harbor the necessary genes to deal with osmotic pressure using high- and low-salt-in strategies, and to cope with unusually high concentrations of heavy metals. Methanogenesis was identified for the first time in the Dead Sea and appears to be an important metabolism in the aragonite sediment. Fermentation of residual organic matter, probably performed by some members of the Halobacteria class is common to both types of sediments. The latter group represents more than 95% of the taxonomically identifiable Archaea in the metagenome of the gypsum sediment. The potential for sulfur reduction has also been revealed and is associated in the sediment with EPS degradation and Fe-S mineralization as revealed by SEM imaging. Overall, we show that distinct communities of Archaea are associated with the two different facies of the Dead Sea, and are adapted to the harsh chemistry of its subsurface, in different ways.

AB The extinct taxon Dasypus bellus has long been considered identical to the extant Dasypus novemcinctus osteologically when disregarding allometric differences. In this study, we undertake a preliminary investigation into this extinct taxon and an extant relative D. novemcinctus, by comparing the calcanea of these two dasypodids. Clear osteological differences are observed including a mediolaterally-reduced facet region, an anteriorly-shortened calcaneal head, a reduced peroneal process, and a curved and dorsoventrally-shortened calcaneal foot in D. bellus. Such characters are not allometric and likely correlate to distinct behavioral differences. Specifically, we suggest that D. novemcinctus maintains a more fossorial lifestyle, while the larger D. bellus was likely more terrestrial, with potentially little digging behavior. Such lifestyle differences could not only explain the osteological differences present, but also why fossils of D. bellus have been recovered farther north than the present range of D. novemcinctus. Fossils of Dasypus may need to be re-evaluated to determine how these two taxa relate temporally and geographically, which may have further implications regarding some past interpretations and provide new details on the behavior and potential relationships between these (and other) xenarthrans.

AB Imantodes cenchoa (Linnaeus, 1758) is distributed from the east coast of Mexico to Argentina. In Brazil, it occurs in the north, central-west and northeast regions. We present information on the reproductive biology and diet of I. cenchoa from analysis of 314 specimens deposited in the Herpetological Collection of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi (MPEG). Imantodes cenchoa displays sexual dimorphism in the snout-vent length, where sexually mature females are larger than mature males (t = 4.02, p < 0.01; N males = 150, N females = 71), head length (f(1.218) = 98.29, p < 0.01; N males = 150, N females = 71), and head width (f(1.218) = 112.77, p < 0.01, N males = 150; N females = 71). Bi-sexual maturity is observed, with males becoming sexually mature earlier than females. Females with eggs were recorded from November to January (rainy season) and from April to July (dry season), suggesting two reproductive peaks throughout the year, with recruitment occurring mainly during the rainy season, when there is a greater supply of food. Imantodes cenchoa is a nocturnal active forager, capturing prey that are asleep on the vegetation. In 32.80% of the analyzed specimens, food contents were present, of which 84.11% were lizards of the genera Norops (69.16%, N = 74) and Gonatodes (14.95%, N = 16). The other 15.89% of the contents were made up of items in an advanced state of digestion, preventing their identification. Some specimens had more than one food item in their digestive tract, accounting for 107 prey items in total. There was no ontogenetic variation in the diet of I. cenchoa, and the predominant direction of prey ingestion was antero-posterior (71.96%). Larger snakes tended to feed on larger prey, although these did not exclude small prey from their diet.

AB Silicate weathering improves soils by releasing bioessential nutrients from the bedrock to the soil ecosystem. However, whether bacteria are capable of inhabiting subsurface critical zones (zone of active rock weathering), and their role therein, are unknown. Next-generation sequencing and community fingerprinting permitted us to characterize communities from an Icelandic critical zone environment. Communities were compared with respect to physico-chemical properties of the environment to determine the factors influencing bacterial diversity. We showed that land coverage influenced critical zone communities. Analysis of tree-covered site (TCS) soils exhibited high cell densities (TCS=2.25x 10(7)g(-1)), whereas lichen- and moss-covered sites (LMS) had lower cell densities (LMS=1.06x10(7)cellsg(-1)), thought to be a result of the organic carbon produced by the trees. Differences in the bacterial community were observed from the abundance of 16S rRNA gene sequences affiliated with Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria, with TCS possessing higher abundances of Proteobacteria [no of sequences: LMS=1526 (+/- 497); TCS=2214 (+/- 531)], specifically Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria, and lower Acidobacteria numbers [no of sequences: LMS=1244 (+/- 338); TCS=598 (+/- 140)]. Diversity indices and 16S rRNA gene rarefaction showed that communities from TCS soils had lower -diversity than sites without, indicative of specialized communities at sites with root-forming plants.

TI Energy hierarchy and landscape sustainability
SO LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Emergy; Energy hierarchy; Landscape sustainability; Transformity
ID ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS; TRANSFORMITY
AB The study of ecosystems suggests principles by which energy flows generate hierarchies in all systems. All ecosystems in the landscapes are associated with energy transformation and the convergence of transformed products toward higher hierarchical levels, the recycling of materials to dispersed backgrounds, and feedbacks to reinforce the supporting environment. A hierarchy can be seen as an organized pattern with many small units at one level contributing to fewer units at the next higher level. Due to spatial variability in the natural environment, different types and amounts of energy received on the earth are not homogeneous; this in turn generates a heterogeneous pattern on the landscape. Energy from life-support and production systems of a heterogeneous landscape is transformed and converged spatially toward consumption centers. All energy transformation can be arranged in a series. The concept of transformity is used in this paper to indicate the position of an energy flow in the series. A hierarchical system can help to explain how energy and matter can be produced and recycled through each level of energy transfer. Building on the brief reviews of the concept of hierarchy in the landscape and the theoretical development of the concept of an ecological energetic hierarchy, this paper proposes two principles of energetic hierarchy for landscape sustainability. First, the landscape must be arranged spatially according to its energy hierarchy. Evaluation of normalized energy flows (emergy) can help identify zones of different spatial hierarchies, which will help establish the strategies needed for the landscapes to be sustainable. Second, a sustainable landscape must comprise a hierarchy of self-organizing ecosystems that can enable the systems to maximize useful power at all levels of the energy hierarchy.

AB Sarcopoterium spinosum L. (S.p.) is a common type of dwarf shrub in the eastern Mediterranean area. This study focuses on the semi-arid south-western Judean foothills (Shephelah) in Israel, characterized by a hilly landscape with variable coverage of hard calcrete rock outcrops (Nari) on chalk. The following research questions were addressed: 1) What is the effect of calcrete rock outcrops on S.p. and the spatial composition of the vegetative landscape? 2) What are the landscape conditions in which S.p. dominates the vegetation? 3) What is the spatial structure and occupation strategy of S.p. in relation to rocky and non-rocky landscape surfaces?
   A field study was conducted to measure visual surface coverage of five components: S.p., shrub (excluding S.p. and including other dwarf shrubs and trees), annuals, rock, and bare soil. The results show that rock, an abiotic component, plays an important role in the semi-arid landscape of the research area. When rocky coverage is more than 14% of the surface, its presence contributes to high heterogeneity and advanced ecological niches, and governs the appearance and distribution of biotic components such as S.p. and others. Among the studied components, the relationship between rock and S.p. was found to be the strongest. Furthermore, rock and S.p. seem to fill interchangeable functions. As rock presence decreases, S.p. distribution increases. When rock coverage is less than 14%, S.p. becomes the dominant landscape component, covering 37%-77% of the surface, characterized by large patches with a high level of homogeneity along the entire slope. Our results show that the rock/S.p. ratio controls changes in the landscape structure varying from stable heterogenic mosaic to stable homogeneous S.p. matrix. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB A case study of the Lessepsian invasion of the Mediterranean Sea was carried out during the 1970s by a Hebrew University of Jerusalem team that included Uzi Ritte and his research students. The study zoomed on two mollusk "trios" of mytilid bivalves and cerithiid gastropods, each including an invader, a closely related and ecologically similar indigenous Red Sea species and a Mediterranean indigenous competitor. This paper revisits the results, conclusions and projections made by the 1970s study in the context of a recent unified invasion biology framework, and in the view of the dynamic development of the Lessepsian invasion and research into it throughout the more than 30 years since the case study took place. The approach of studying "trios" to detect potential invaders and project the course of invasions has not been repeated in the Lessepsian system since the 1970s case study. But the findings that opportunistic life history traits linked with a match of habitat in the invaded range to a species' ecological niche make this species a potential invader and enable it to coexist with an encountered competitor remain robust. Recent human-induced and other environmental changes in the Mediterranean have however highlighted a potential significance of propagule pressure in intensifying competitive exclusion and resource monopolization by the invader, to the point of potentially impacting the invaded ecosystem.

AB Background: Ecological replacement involves the introduction of non-native species to habitats beyond their historical range, a factor identified as increasing the risk of failure for translocations. Yet the effectiveness and success of ecological replacement rely in part on the ability of translocatees to adapt, survive and potentially reproduce in a novel environment. We discuss the welfare aspects of translocating captive-reared non-native tortoises, Aldabrachelys gigantea and Astrochelys radiata, to two offshore Mauritian islands, and the costs and success of the projects to date.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Because tortoises are long-lived, late-maturing reptiles, we assessed the progress of the translocation by monitoring the survival, health, growth, and breeding by the founders. Between 2000 and 2011, a total of 26 A. gigantea were introduced to Ile aux Aigrettes, and in 2007 twelve sexually immature A. gigantea and twelve male A. radiata were introduced to Round Island, Mauritius. Annual mortality rates were low, with most animals either maintaining or gaining weight. A minimum of 529 hatchlings were produced on Ile aux Aigrettes in 11 years; there was no potential for breeding on Round Island. Project costs were low. We attribute the success of these introductions to the tortoises' generalist diet, habitat requirements, and innate behaviour.
   Conclusions/Significance: Feasibility analyses for ecological replacement and assisted colonisation projects should consider the candidate species' welfare during translocation and in its recipient environment. Our study provides a useful model for how this should be done. In addition to serving as ecological replacements for extinct Mauritian tortoises, we found that releasing small numbers of captive-reared A. gigantea and A. radiata is cost-effective and successful in the short term. The ability to release small numbers of animals is a particularly important attribute for ecological replacement projects since it reduces the potential risk and controversy associated with introducing non-native species.

AB How can animals learn the prey densities available in an environment that changes unpredictably from day to day, and how much effort should they devote to doing so, rather than exploiting what they already know? Using a two-armed bandit situation, we simulated several processes that might explain the trade-off between exploring and exploiting. They included an optimising model, dynamic backward sampling; a dynamic version of the matching law; the Rescorla-Wagner model; a neural network model; and e-greedy and rule of thumb models derived from the study of reinforcement learning in artificial intelligence. Under conditions like those used in published studies of birds' performance under two-armed bandit conditions, all models usually identified the more profitable source of reward, and did so more quickly when the reward probability differential was greater. Only the dynamic programming model switched from exploring to exploiting more quickly when available time in the situation was less. With sessions of equal length presented in blocks, a session-length effect was induced in some of the models by allowing motivational, but not memory, carry-over from one session to the next. The rule of thumb model was the most successful overall, though the neural network model also performed better than the remaining models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Western sandpiper (Calidris mauri) chicks are precocial and leave the nest shortly after hatch to forage independently. Chicks require thermoregulatory assistance from parents (brooding) for 5-7 days posthatch, and parents facilitate chick survival for 2-3 weeks posthatch by leading and defending chicks. Parental vocal signals are likely involved in protecting chicks from predators, preventing them from wandering away and becoming lost and leading them to good foraging locations. Using observational and experimental methods in the field, we describe and demonstrate the form and function of parent-chick communication in the western sandpiper. We document 4 distinct calls produced by parents that are apparently directed toward their chicks (brood, gather, alarm, and freeze calls). Through experimental playback of parental and non-parental vocalizations to chicks in a small arena, we demonstrated the following: 1) chicks respond to the alarm call by vocalizing relatively less often and moving away from the signal source, 2) chicks respond to the gather call by vocalizing relatively more often and moving toward the signal source, and 3) chicks respond to the freeze call by vocalizing relatively less often and crouching motionless on the substrate for extended periods of time. Chicks exhibited consistent directional movement and space use to parental and non-parental signals. Although fewer vocalizations were given in response to non-parental signals, which may indicate a weaker response to unfamiliar individuals, the relative number of chick calls given to each type of call signal was consistent between parental and non-parental signals. We also discovered 2 distinct chick vocalizations (chick-contact and chick-alarm calls) during arena playback experiments. Results indicate that sandpiper parents are able to elicit antipredatory chick behaviors and direct chick movement and vocalizations through vocal signals. Future study of parent-offspring communication should determine whether shorebird chicks exhibit parental recognition though vocalizations and the role of chick vocalizations in parental behavior.

AB The regeneration and patch dynamics of Sarcopoterium spinosum shrubs may have profound effects on rangeland productivity in Mediterranean semiarid shrublands. Yet little is known about the role of the soil seed bank in seedling recruitment of S. spinosum and whether grazing has any effect on the size and spatial distribution of its seed bank and seedling emergence. We studied the effects of sheep grazing on the soil seed bank and seedling emergence of S. spinosum in a Mediterranean semiarid shrubland in the northern Negev Desert in Israel. The variation in density of the seed bank in autumn and of seedling emergence in the spring was measured during two years, beneath shrub canopies and in the open space matrix, inside and outside exclosures that prevented sheep grazing. Seed density beneath the shrubs ranged between 2000 and 3000 seeds m(-2), and was about ten times as great as that in the adjacent open space patches. Moreover, beneath the shrubs, the proportion of the autumn seed bank that emerged as seedlings in the spring was three times as great as in the open space patches. Grazing caused a 60% increase in soil seed bank density beneath the shrub canopy but had no effect on the seed bank in the open space patches. Variation in spring seedling density between grazing treatments and patch types was strongly related to the availability of seeds in the previous autumn.

Plant diversity in Marmarica (Libya and Egypt): a catalogue of the vascular plants reported with their biology, distribution, frequency, usage, economic potential, habitat and main ecological features, with an extensive bibliography. Candollea 59: 259-308. In English, English and French abstracts.
   Marmarica, as it is called since antiquity, is the natural region located between the Jebel Lakhdar of Cirenaica and the Nile Delta over an E-W distance of 750 km. It covers an area of 220000 km(2) along the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea between longitudes 23degreesE and 30degreesE. It is a typically Mediterranean and zone in the northern fringe along the shoreline, shifting slowly to absolute desert southwards on a depth of ca. 300 km. Mean annual rainfall is slightly below 200 mm in the northernmost sites dropping to 10 mm at the oases of Jarabub and Siwa 300 km further south. The flora belongs to the Ibero-Maghribian entity of the Mediterranean phytogeographic region with some Saharo-Arabian and Irano-Turanian elements. It includes an overall 1015 vascular taxa representing 48% of the Egyptian flora and 53% of the Libyan flora. Eighteen taxa are endemic to the region. Flora and vegetation are very homogenous and strongly influenced by 3 types of farming: 1) irrigation between Alexandria and El Alamein (ca. 100 km W of the Nile); 2) runoff farming in the valleys along the wadis of the coastal plains with episodic mixed dry fanning of cereals; 3) grazing on fallow, stubble and the depleted steppes on the interfluves. Vegetation and flora are strongly influenced by the impact of man: virtually all of the pristine steppe vegetation still present, and mapped in the years 1960's have now been cleared for opportunistic farming. This situation has heavily imprinted on the flora and vegetation now dominated by <<weeds>>. The present study presents a catalogue of the native taxa reported in both the Libyan and Egyptian part of Marmarica with their biology, abundance, frequency of occurrence, geographic distribution, economic and grazing potential, utilization and ecological requirement traits in terms of climate and soils. An extensive bibliography is provided.

AB We report a case of successful reproduction in wild-released orphan chimpanzees. Using non-invasive genetic analysis, we determined the paternity of an infant born to a female chimpanzee released by HELP (Habitat Ecologique et Liberte des Primates) Congo into the Conkouati-Douli National Park, Republic of Congo. The sire was a released male, thus demonstrating successful reproduction in both male and female released chimpanzees. These results provide evidence that release into the wild may be a viable response to the plight of orphan chimpanzees in Africa, and we discuss further applications of non-invasive genetic tagging to release programs.

AB Over the last two centuries, the marine life of the Eastern Mediterranean has been influenced by two major factors: one is beneficial, and concerns species migration, such as the opening of the Suez Canal, which enriched the impoverished eastern Mediterranean Sea with over 300 species of fish and invertebrates of Red Sea origin; while the other, a negative and possibly wider-reaching factor, is that of man-made pollution, which has induced unpredictable changes, destabilizing the biological world in both magnitude and duration. Initially cryptic, the effects caused by pollutants first occur at the biochemical and cellular levels of an organism, causing alterations and deviations from the normal, strongly mobilizing its defense systems. Conventional methodologies of ecological analyses, based on species and specimen numbers, cannot detect such alterations. Studying several mollusk populations from polluted and reference sites of the Red Sea and Mediterranean littoral of Israel, we used specific markers for in vivo and in vitro studies to expose the state of micronucleation; levels of defense transport systems such as membrane transport system of organic anions (SATOA) and organic cations (OCT); the state of the multi-xenobiotic resistance-mediating transporter (MXRtr). Based on fluorescent microscopy and microfluorometry, these markers offer powerful tools to expose cryptic changes in the affected populations and provide data necessary for planning and management to protect animal communities and preserve their biological diversity. Comparative analysis of general gene-expression in polluted and reference sites indicates that stress factors have differentially affected the various biological taxa and separated phenotypic sub-populations, producing a novel type of punctuated selection. Such factors, although negative in their influences, in some instances altering the qualities of organisms, and establishing alterations in their hereditary information, pre-adapt them to survive and succeed in new situations.

AB A site that covers over 20 acres of coastal saline depression in the western Mediterranean coastal desert of Egypt (El-Hammra station, the main crude oil pipeline terminal in Al-Alamein) is contaminated with crude oil spill as a result of activities from refineries, oilfield blowouts, tanker and pipeline break-ups. This area, prior to contamination, was dominated by different common halophytes. However, Limoniastrum monopetalum is now the only species found growing in the oil-contaminated soil. A specific question addressed in the present study was: what are the biochemical changes occurring in a desert plant growing in oil-contaminated soils? Major metabolites such as proline, betaine, free amino acids, fatty acid esters and mineral elements were studied. The plant samples were collected from the oil-contaminated, as well as noncontaminated, sites. The higher concentration in the selected organic metabolites in the plants growing in the contaminated site compared to those in noncontaminated site may be due to differences in a number of receptors. The sensitivity of such receptors for the environmental signal that cause differences in genetic expression leads to differences in physiological processes. The change in the landscape of the contaminated area and the elimination of the natural vegetation, except L. monopetalum, may explain the competitive balance toward the oil-resistant species.

AB We documented solitary and aggregative spacing patterns in Semipalmated Plovers (Charadrius semipalmatus) near Churchill, Manitoba. Pairs nesting on gravel directly on the coast nested in larger aggregations and closer to other pairs than inland pairs. Coastal areas were similar to inland areas in (1) density of birds, (2) available gravel nesting habitat, and (3) climatic conditions. The number of pairs per gravel area deviated significantly from that expected from a Poisson distribution. Inland nests were significantly uniform in distribution, whereas coastal nests were distributed randomly among four sites. In 1988, pairs nesting on the coast also nested later and had heavier eggs and chicks than pairs nesting inland. Reproductive success in two years of study was higher at coastal nests than at inland nests. We suggest that the differences in spacing between the two sites may be due to different predator populations at the two sites.

ID ORCHIDACEAE
AB Asphodelus aestivus exhibits six distinct phenophases during the annual development of its life cycle. The annual growth process is characterized by a continuously changing balance of above- and below-ground biomass satisfying the functional and structural requirements of die plant. The greatest percentage of allocated biomass and nutrients is located in the below-ground storage structures. The synchronization of the timing of A. aestivus phenophases with the periodicity of the Mediterranean type climate is to be accomplished by means of biomass and nutrient trade-offs which take place within the different plant parts.
   It was demonstrated by gain and loss analysis that the significance of assimilation, translocation, leaching and litter fall in A. aestivus changes with time according to the unstable environmental conditions caused by the seasonality of the Mediterranean climate.
   In A. aestivus the onset of reproduction depends on materials stored in previous years while flowering and seed production depend mainly on the annual biomass production.
   Two main paths were described with respect to the transfer of nutrients among plant parts. The first regards the dynamic transfer from the below-ground to the above-ground structures, and vice versa, while the second one concerns the ''self-fertilization'' phenomenon during which a partial self-damage and decomposition of below-ground structures take place.

The mutant has potential applications in the commercial production of glycerol on a large scale since there is no need to extract glycerol from the cells. The mutant was compared with the wild type and it was found that, despite the leakage of glycerol, the mutant showed the same growth rate as the wild type. However, when the rates of oxygen evolution and uptake and intracellular starch content between mutant and wild type were compared at high salinity, considerable differences were found.

AB Context The European Lndscape Convention (ELC) of the Council of Europe represents the first international treaty that envisages all aspects when planning European landscapes. Through the ELC, public authorities have been encouraged to adopt policies and measures at local, national and international levels to protect, manage and properly plan landscapes in a sustainable manner. Objectives Our study aims to provide a better understanding of the landscape governance research trends by using an innovative methodology based on network analysis to investigate ELC research performed and highlight ways to improve and optimize ELC implementation. Methods We analysed articles published in international journals directly connected to ELC implementation between 2000 and 2020 (n = 450). We use bibliometric indicators and co-occurrence analysis with overlay visualization in time, to discover the landscape research trends and evolution over the past 20 years. We reviewed 119 selected most cited articles and assigned different attributes to perform a more detailed analysis of the specific ELC aspects covered in research. Results Our findings identify the key players in promoting the ELC principles and show how the ELC has impacted the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research, by identifying the prospects for landscape sustainability science, while considering ELC as driver of change. Conclusions We present the ELC research evolution in time to better understand the basics of landscape ecology from an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary perspective. We illustrate the ELC most promoted concepts in literature which can provide scientific basis for integrating new research trends such as landscape sustainability science and landscape governance.

AB The theory of island biogeography postulates that size and isolation are key drivers of biodiversity on islands. This theory has been applied not only to true (e.g. oceanic) islands but also to terrestrial island-like systems (e.g. edaphic islands). Recently, a debate has opened as to whether terrestrial island-like systems function like true islands. However, identifying the effect of insularity in terrestrial systems is conceptually and methodologically challenging because recognizing species source(s) and measuring isolation is not as straightforward as for true islands. We contribute to the debate by proposing an approach to contextualize the definition of insularity and to identify the role of isolation in terrestrial island-like systems. To test this approach, we explored the relationship between insularity predictors and specialist species richness of edaphic islands in three systems in Europe (spring fens, mountaintops, and outcrops). We detected that insularity affected specialist richness of edaphic islands through island size and target effect (i.e. an emergent property of islands depending on their isolation and size). As predicted by the Theory of Island Biogeography, species richness decreased with increasing isularity. Given the comprehensiveness and ease of implementation of our approach, we encourage its extension to other island-like systems.

ID DETERIORATION; MICROORGANISMS; ROCKS
AB Dimension stone is natural rock prepared for building use. It is rapidly colonised by microorganisms that cause discoloration (mainly cyanobacteria, algae and fungi) and structural damage. Microbial mobilisation of ions leads to new superficial or internal deposits, weakening the structure. Cyanobacteria and fungi may penetrate, filling pores or creating new spaces. Lichens, fungus/phototroph associations, colonise surfaces and damage stone through ingrowing rhizines and acid production. Initial degradation produces conditions suitable for germination of seeds of higher plants and further destruction. Emerging techniques to elucidate stone-cell interactions and control of initial biofilm formation that eventuates in stone disintegration are discussed.

AB Modern biological research often uses global datasets to answer broad-scale questions using various modelling techniques. But detailed information on species-habitat interactions are often only available for a few species. Australian geckos, a species-rich group of small nocturnal predators, are particularly data-deficient. For most species, information is available only as scattered, anecdotal, or descriptive entries in the taxonomic literature or in field guides. We surveyed gecko communities from 10 sites, and 15 locations across central and northern Queensland, Australia, to quantify ecological niche and habitat use of these communities. Our surveys included deserts, woodlands, and rainforests, examining 34 gecko species. We assigned species to habitat niche categories: arboreal (9 species), saxicoline (4), or terrestrial (13), if at least 75% of our observations fell in one microhabitat; otherwise we classified geckos as generalists (8). For arboreal species, we described perch height and perch diameter and assigned them to ecomorph categories, originally developed for Anolis lizards. There was lower species richness in rainforests than in habitats with lower relative humidity; the highest species richness occurred in woodlands. Most arboreal and generalist species fit the trunk-ground ecomorph, except those in the genus Strophurus, whose members preferred shrubs, twigs of small trees, or, in two cases, spinifex grass hummocks, thus occupying a perch space similar to that of grass-bush anoles. Habitat use by Pseudothecadactylus australis, Saltuarius cornutus, and Gehyra dubia fit the trunk-crown ecomorph. We provide quantified basic ecological data and habitat use for a large group of previously poorly documented species.

AB The integrity of regional and local biological diversity is under siege as a result of multiple anthropogenic threats. The conversion of habitats, such as rain forests, into agricultural ecosystems, reduces the area available to support species populations. Rising temperatures and altered rainfall patterns lead to additional challenges for species. The ability of conservation biologists to ascertain the threats to a species requires data on changes in distribution, abundance, life history, and ecology. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) uses these data to appraise the extinction risk for a species. However, many species remain data deficient (DD) or unassessed. Here, I use 14 morphological traits related to locomotor function, habitat, and feeding to predict the threat status of over 400 species of lizards in the infraorder Iguania. Morphological traits are an ideal proxy for making inferences about a species' risk of extinction. Patterns of morphological covariation have a known association with habitat use, foraging behavior, and physiological performance across multiple taxa. Results from phylogenetic general linear models revealed that limb lengths as well as head characters predicted extinction risk. In addition, I used an artificial neural network (ANN) technique to generate a classification function based on the morphological traits of species with an assigned IUCN threat status. The network approach identified eight morphological traits as predictors of extinction risk, which included head and limb characters. The best supported model had a classification accuracy of 87.4%. Moreover, the ANN model predicted >18% of DD/not assessed species were at risk of extinction. The predicted assessments were supported by other sources of threat status, for example, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species appendices. Because of the functional link between morphology, performance, and ecology, an ecomorphological approach may be a useful tool for rapid assessment of DD or poorly known species.

AB Does the adoption of environment-oriented actions by individuals necessarily improve the state of an ecosystem in the most effective way? We address this question with the example of eutrophication in shallow lakes. When exposed to fertilizers, such lakes can undergo a critical transition called eutrophication, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. We couple a generic model of eutrophication with a best-response model of human behaviour, where agents can choose to pollute the lake at a high level (defection) or at a low level (cooperation). It is known that feedbacks between the interacting lake pollution and human behaviour can give rise to complex dynamics with multiple stable states and oscillations. Here, we analyze the impact of all model parameters on the shape of the nullclines. S-shaped nullclines are a condition for complex dynamics to occur. Moreover, we find that agents decreasing their pollution discharge into the lake is not necessarily the most effective way to reduce the pollution level in the lake. This is due to coexisting counterintuitive stable equilibria where the lake is in a clear state despite a high level of pollution discharge. We analyze the complex dynamics of the system and describe in detail Hopf, saddle-node, homoclinic and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations. The complex dynamics with potential multistability and counterintuitive equilibria suggests that generic management recommendations holding for every level of pollution and of cooperation are impossible. Apart from the direct perturbation of an ecological variable, we identify three ways a management strategy can influence the social-ecological system: it can change the location, the resilience and the existence of stable equilibria.

AB Environmental monitoring, using the techniques of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS), allows the production of time efficient, cost-effective, and reliable surveillance and tracking data. Anthropogenic activities appear to be the major trigger of environmental changes, including land use and land cover (LULC) changes, while natural causes have only a minor impact in most cases. The Omayed Biosphere Reserve (OBR) stands as one of the Egyptian protected areas most highly affected by massive unplanned human activities. Thus, the main objective of this study is to determine the spatio-temporal changes in the OBR over a 35-year period using five Landsat (5 ETM images and 8 OLI-TIRS) imageries, with the specific aim of measuring change rates, trends, and magnitudes of LULC changes between 1984 and 2019 with the topography for planning and selection of developmental strategies. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index is used to identify the vegetation characteristics of different eco-regions and delivers useful information for the study of vegetation health and density. Normalised Difference Built-up Index can likewise be used to quote built-up areas. Unsupervised classification was used to classify LULC patterns. Six classes were recognised: water bodies, coastal sand, urban areas, cultivated land, newly reclaimed areas, and bare soil. Our results reveal that about 33.55% of OBR land cover has transformed into other forms. Cultivated land and urban regions increased by about 143.5 km(2)and 56.17 km(2)from 1984 to 2019, respectively. Meanwhile, bare soil decreased to around 209.5 km(2)in 2019. In conclusion, the conversion of bare soil into urban land and cultivated areas is the major change in the last 35 years in the OBR. Over the past three decades, the OBR has faced radical and imbalanced changes in its natural habitats. Therefore, monitoring and management of LULC changes are crucial for creating links between policy decisions, regulatory actions, and following LULC activities in the future, especially as many potential risks still exist in the remaining regions of the OBR.

AB Desertification is a major global environmental issue exacerbated by climate change. Strategies to combat desertification include prevention which seeks to reverse the process before the system reaches the stable desertified state. One of these initiatives is to implement early warning tools. This paper presents SAT (the Spanish acronym for Early Warning System), a decision support system (DSS), for assessing the risk of desertification in Spain, where 20% of the land has already been desertified and 1% is in active degradation. SATrelies on three versions of a Generic Desertification Model (GDM) that integrates economics and ecology under the predator-prey paradigm. The models have been programmed using Vensim, a type of software used to build and simulate System Dynamics (SD) models. Through Visual Basic programming, these models are operated from the Excel environment. In addition to the basic simulation exercises, specially designed tools have been coupled to assess the risk of desertification and determine the ranking of the most influential factors of the process. The users targeted by SAT are government land-use planners as well as desertification experts. SAT tool is implemented for five case studies, each one of them representing a desertification syndrome identified in Spain. Given the general nature of the tool and the fact that all United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) signatory countries are committed to developing their National Plans to Combat Desertification (NPCD), SAT could be exported to regions threatened by desertification and expanded to cover more case studies.

AB The first escape probability (FEP) and the mean first exit time (MFET) are utilized to explore the stability of the high vegetation basin in an extended ecosystem with the two important features: the randomness and the delay. The more realistic non-Gaussian colored noise is chosen as a stochastic perturbation. In order to overcome the effects of the system inherent parameters, two novel basin stability indexes are proposed based on the FEP and the MFET. The unified colored noise approximation and the small delay approximation are exploited to further simplify the system and obtain the stability indexes. The results show that either increased herbivores or reduced rainfall can increase the FEP and decrease the MFET of the high vegetation ecosystem, and non-Gaussian colored noise disturbance also exacerbates the problem. Conversely, the time delay can control deterioration of the ecosystem. Furthermore, by comparing the theoretical analysis results and Monte Carlo simulation results of the original system, it is found that both the approximation methods and the process of solving the FEP and the MFET are feasible.

AB Global change may induce changes in savanna and forest distributions, but the dynamics of these changes remain unclear. Classical biome theory suggests that climate is predictive of biome distributions, such that shifts will be continuous and reversible. This view, however, cannot explain the overlap in the climatic ranges of tropical biomes, which some argue may result from fire-vegetation feedbacks, maintaining savanna and forest as bistable states. Under this view, biome shifts are argued to be discontinuous and irreversible. Mean-field bistable models, however, are also limited, as they cannot reproduce the spatial aggregation of biomes. Here we suggest that both models ignore spatial processes, such as dispersal, which may be important when savanna and forest abut. We examine the contributions of dispersal to determining biome distributions using a 2D reaction-diffusion model, comparing results qualitatively to empirical savanna and forest distributions in sub-Saharan Africa. We find that the diffusion model resolves both the aforementioned limitations of biome models. First, local dispersive spatial interactions, with an underlying precipitation gradient, can reproduce the spatial aggregation of biomes with a stable savanna-forest boundary. Second, the boundary is determined not only by the amount of precipitation but also by the geometrical shape of the precipitation contours. These geometrical effects arise from continental-scale source-sink dynamics, which reproduce the mismatch between biome and climate. Dynamically, the spatial model predicts that dispersal may increase the resilience of tropical biome in response to global change: the boundary continuously tracks climate, recovering following disturbances, unless the remnant biome patches are too small.

AB Hydrophobicity is common in plants and animals, typically caused by high relief microtexture functioning to keep the surface clean. Although the occurrence and physical causes of hydrophobicity are well understood, ecological factors promoting its evolution are unclear. Geckos have highly hydrophobic integuments. We predicted that, because the ground is dirty and filled with pathogens, high hydrophobicity should coevolve with terrestrial microhabitat use. Advancing contact-angle (ACA) measurements of water droplets were used to quantify hydrophobicity in 24 species of Australian gecko. We reconstructed the evolution of ACA values, in relation to microhabitat use of geckos. To determine the best set of structural characteristics associated with the evolution of hydrophobicity, we used linear models fitted using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS), and then model averaging based on AIC(c) values. All species were highly hydrophobic (ACA > 132.72 degrees), but terrestrial species had significantly higher ACA values than arboreal ones. The evolution of longer spinules and smaller scales was correlated with high hydrophobicity. These results suggest that hydrophobicity has coevolved with terrestrial microhabitat use in Australian geckos via selection for long spinules and small scales, likely to keep their skin clean and prevent fouling and disease.

AB Patterns of vegetation are a characteristic feature of many semi-arid regions. The limiting resource in these ecosystems is water, which is added to the system through short and intense rainfall events that cause a pulse of biological processes such as plant growth and seed dispersal. We propose an impulsive model based on the Klausmeier reaction-advection-diffusion system, analytically investigate the effects of rainfall intermittency on the onset of patterns, and augment our results by numerical simulations of model extensions. Our investigation focuses on the parameter region in which a transition between uniform and patterned vegetation occurs. Results show that decay-type processes associated with a low frequency of precipitation pulses inhibit the onset of patterns and that under intermittent rainfall regimes, a spatially uniform solution is sustained at lower total precipitation volumes than under continuous rainfall, if plant species are unable to efficiently use low soil moisture levels. Unlike in the classical setting of a reaction-diffusion model, patterns are not caused by a diffusion-driven instability but by a combination of sufficiently long periods of droughts between precipitation pulses and water diffusion. Our results further indicate that the introduction of pulse-type seed dispersal weakens the effects of changes to width and shape of the plant dispersal kernel on the onset of patterns.

AB Purpose Preliminary to evaluate geometric indices (vessel sphericity and cylindricity) for volume-rendered optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in healthy and diabetic eyes. Methods Twenty-six eyes of 13 healthy subjects and 12 eyes of patients with central ischemic, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were included. OCTA volume and surface area of the foveal vessels were measured and compared to determine OCTA sphericity and cylindricity indices and surface efficiency (SE). Results The overall average OCTA volume in healthy was 0.49 +/- 0.09 mm(3) (standard deviation [SD]), compared to 0.44 +/- 0.07 mm(3) (SD) in the diabetic eyes (difference in means 0.06 mm(3), p = 0.054). The overall average OCTA surface area in the healthy eyes was 87.731 +/- 9.51 mm(2) (SD), compared to 76.65 +/- 13.67 mm(2) (SD) in the diabetic eyes (difference in means 11.08 mm(2), p = 0.021). In relation to total foveolar tissue volume, the proportion of blood vessels was 22% in healthy individuals and only 20% in diabetics. The difference between the groups was more pronounced with respect to the total OCTA surface area, with a decrease of 13% in diabetics. A diabetic eye was most likely using geometric vessel indices analysis if the sphericity value was >= 0.190, with a cylindricity factor of >= 0.001. Reproducibility of the method was good. Conclusions A method for OCTA surface area and volume measurements was developed. The application of the novel OCTA sphericity and cylindricity indices could be suitable as temporal biomarker to characterize stable disease or disease progression and may contribute to a better understanding in the evolution of diabetic retinopathy.

AB South American foxes are included in the monophyletic genus Lycalopex, with several recent species. Here, the influence of environment about cranial size and shape variations of Lycalopex gymnocercus was explicitly addressed. 3D landmark-based methodology was used to acquire morphometric data. Each record locality was georeferenced and assigned both environmental variables and ecoregion membership. Size and shape changes were analyzed with regression and redundancy analyses, including the study of -spatial autocorrelation. An association of smaller specimens with arid and colder environments was found. Bergmann's rule does not hold for this species. Pampas foxes from humid and warm areas display morphological traits related to more carnivorous diets, whereas those from arid and cold environments should display more hypocarnivorous traits. We found that 15% of shape variation explained by environment was independent of allometry, suggesting that both are independent components of the total cranial shape in Pampas foxes.

AB Estimation of trade-offs between current reproduction and future survival and fecundity of long-lived vertebrates is essential to understanding factors that shape optimal reproductive investment. Black brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans) fledge more goslings, on average, when their broods are experimentally enlarged to be greater than the most common clutch size of four eggs. Thus, we hypothesized that the lesser frequency of brant clutches exceeding four eggs results, at least partially, from a future reduction in survival, breeding probability, or clutch size for females tending larger broods. We used an 8-year mark-recapture data set (Barker robust design) with 5 years of clutch and brood manipulations to estimate long-term consequences of reproductive decisions in brant. We did not find evidence of a trade-off between reproductive effort and true survival or future initiation date and clutch size. Rather, future breeding probability was maximized (0.92 +/- 0.03 [SE]) for manipulated females tending broods of four goslings and was lower for females tending smaller (one gosling; 0.63 +/- 0.09 [SE]) or larger (seven goslings; 0.52 +/- 0.15 [SE]) broods. Our results suggest that demographic trade-offs for female brant tending large broods may reduce the fitness value of clutches larger than four and, therefore, contribute to the paucity of larger clutches. The lack of a trade-off between reproductive effort and survival provides evidence that survival, to which fitness is most sensitive in long-lived animals, is buffered against temporal variation in brant.

AB Native bird species show latitudinal gradients in body size across species (Bergmann's rule), but whether or not such gradients are recapitulated in the alien distributions of bird species are unknown. Here, we test for the existence of Bergmann's rule in alien bird species worldwide, and investigate the causes of the observed patterns. Published databases were used to obtain the worldwide distributions of established alien bird populations, the locations of alien bird introductions, and bird body masses. Randomisation tests and linear models were used to assess latitudinal patterns in the body masses of introduced and established alien bird populations. Established alien bird species exhibit Bergmann's rule, but this is largely explained by where alien bird species have been introduced: latitudinal variation in the body masses of established alien bird species simply reflects latitudinal variation in the body masses of introduced species. There is some evidence that body mass is implicated in whether or not established species' alien ranges spread towards or contract away from the Equator following establishment. However, most alien bird ranges are encompassed by the latitudinal band(s) to which the species was introduced. Bergmann's rule in alien birds is therefore a consequence of where humans have introduced different species, rather than of natural processes operating after population introduction.

AB Low dissolved oxygen (hypoxia) can severely limit fish performance, especially aerobically expensive behaviours including swimming and acquisition of sensory information. Fishes can reduce oxygen requirements by altering these behaviours under hypoxia, but the underlying mechanisms can be difficult to quantify. We used a weakly electric fish as a model system to explore potential effects of hypoxia on swim performance and sensory information acquisition, which enabled us to non-invasively record electric signalling activity used for active acquisition of sensory information during swimming. To quantify potential effects of hypoxia, we measured critical swim speed (U-crit) and concurrent electric signalling activity under high-and low-dissolved oxygen concentrations in a hypoxia-tolerant African mormyrid fish, Marcusenius victoriae. Fish were maintained under normoxia for 6 months pnor to experimental treatments, and then acclimated for 8 weeks to normoxia or hypoxia and tested under both conditions (acute: 4 h exposure). Acute hypoxia exposure resulted in a significant reduction in both U-crit and electric signalling activity in fish not acclimated to hypoxia. However, individuals acclimated to chronic hypoxia were characterized by a higher U-crit under both hypoxia and normoxia than fish acclimated to normoxia. Following a 6 month re-introduction to normoxia, hypoxia-acclimated individuals still showed increased performance under acute hypoxic test conditions, but not under normoxia. Our results highlight the detrimental effects of hypoxia on aerobic swim performance and sensory information acquisition, and the ability of fish to heighten aerobic performance through acclimation processes that can still influence performance even months after initial exposure.

AB Animal paths are analogous to intractable mathematical problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the shortest path problem (SPP). Both the TSP and SPP require an individual to find the shortest path through multiple targets but the TSP demands a return to the start, while the SPP does not. Vervet monkeys are very efficient in solving TSPs but this species is a multiple central place forager that does not always return to the same sleeping site and thus theoretically should be selected to find solutions to SPPs rather than TSPs. We examined path choice by wild vervets in an SPP experimental array where the shortest paths usually differed from those consistent with common heuristic strategies, the nearest-neighbor rule (NNR-go to the closest resource that has not been visited), and the convex hull (put a mental loop around sites, adding inner targets in order of distance from the edge)-an efficient strategy for TSPs but not SPPs. In addition, humans solving SPPs use an initial segment strategy (ISS-choose the straightest path at the beginning, only turning when necessary) and we looked at vervet paths consistent with this strategy. In 615 trials by single foragers, paths usually conformed to the NNR and rarely the slightly more efficient convex hull, supporting that vervets may be selected to solve SPPs. Further, like humans solving SPPs, vervets showed a tendency to use the ISS. Paths consistent with heuristics dropped off sharply, and use of the shortest path increased, when heuristics led to longer paths showing trade-offs in efficiency versus cognitive load. Two individuals out of 17, found the shortest path most often, showing inter-individual variation in path planning. Given support for the NNR and the ISS, we propose a new rule-of-thumb termed the "region heuristic " that vervets may apply in multi-destination routes.

AB Despite the huge interest in network resilience to stress, most of the studies have concentrated on internal stress damaging network structure (e.g., node removals). Here we study how networks respond to environmental stress deteriorating their external conditions. We show that, when regular networks gradually disintegrate as environmental stress increases, disordered networks can suddenly collapse at critical stress with hysteresis and vulnerability to perturbations. We demonstrate that this difference results from a trade-off between node resilience and network resilience to environmental stress. The nodes in the disordered networks can suppress their collapses due to the small-world topology of the networks but eventually collapse all together in return. Our findings indicate that some real networks can be highly resilient against environmental stress to a threshold yet extremely vulnerable to the stress above the threshold because of their small-world topology.

AB On screening of endolithic actinobacteria from a granite rock sample of Meghalaya for antibacterial compound, a novel antibacterial compound CCp1 was isolated from the fermentation broth of Actinomadura sp. AL2. On purification of the compound based on chromatographic techniques followed by characterization with FT-IR, UV-visible, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and mass spectrometry, the molecular formula of the compound was generated as C20H17N3O2, a furopyrimidine derivative. In vitro antibacterial activity of the compound was evaluated against both Gram positive and negative bacteria by agar well diffusion assay. The compound had lowest MIC (2.00 mu g/ml) for Bacillus subtilis and highest MIC (>64 mu g/ml) for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study revealed that the compound has potential antibacterial activity. The mode of action of the antibacterial compound was evaluated through in silico studies for its ability to bind DNA gyrase, 30S RNA molecules, OmpF porins and N-Acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU). The antibacterial compound demonstrated more favorable docking with DNA gyrase, 30S RNA molecules and OmpF porins than GlmU which support the antibacterial compound CCp1 can be as a promising broad spectrum antibiotic agent with "multitarget" characteristics.

AB There are risks from disease in undertaking wild animal reintroduction programmes. Methods of disease risk analysis have been advocated to assess and mitigate these risks, and post-release health and disease surveillance can be used to assess the effectiveness of the disease risk analysis, but results for a reintroduction programme have not to date been recorded. We carried out a disease risk analysis for the reintroduction of pool frogs (Pelophylax lessonae) to England, using information gained from the literature and from diagnostic testing of Swedish pool frogs and native amphibians. Ranavirus and Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis were considered high-risk disease threats for pool frogs at the destination site. Quarantine was used to manage risks from disease due to these two agents at the reintroduction site: the quarantine barrier surrounded the reintroduced pool frogs. Post-release health surveillance was carried out through regular health examinations of amphibians in the field at the reintroduction site and collection and examination of dead amphibians. No significant health or disease problems were detected, but the detection rate of dead amphibians was very low. Methods to detect a higher proportion of dead reintroduced animals and closely related species are required to better assess the effects of reintroduction on health and disease.

AB The food web of Lake Kinneret contains intraguild predation (IGP). Predatory invertebrates and planktivorous fish both feed on herbivorous zooplankton, while the planktivorous fish also feed on the predatory invertebrates. In this study, a complex mechanistic hydrodynamic-ecological model, coupled to a bioenergetics-based fish population model (DYCD-FISH), was employed with the aim of revealing IGP dynamics. The results indicate that the predation pressure of predatory zooplankton on herbivorous zooplankton varies widely, depending on the season. At the time of its annual peak, it is 10-20 times higher than the fish predation pressure. When the number of fish was significantly higher, as occurs in the lake after atypical meteorological years, the effect was a shift from a bottom-up controlled ecosystem, to the top-down control of planktivorous fish and a significant reduction of predatory and herbivorous zooplankton biomass. Yet, seasonally, the decrease in predatory-zooplankton biomass was followed by a decrease in their predation pressure on herbivorous zooplankton, leading to an increase of herbivorous zooplankton biomass to an extent similar to the base level. The analysis demonstrates the emergence of non-equilibrium IGP dynamics due to intra-annual and inter-annual changes in the physico-chemical characteristics of the lake, and suggests that IGP dynamics should be considered in food web models in order to more accurately capture mass transfer and trophic interactions.

AB Lack 18:125-128 (1967) proposed that clutch size in precocial species was regulated by nutrients available to females during breeding. Drent and Daan 68:225-252 (1980) proposed the individual optimization hypothesis, whereby individual state determines the optimal combination of breeding date and clutch size. Neither hypothesis accounts for variation in nutrients among females at the end of egg laying, strong right truncations in clutch size distributions, or the fact that many species with precocial young are determinate layers. One solution is that there is a maximum clutch size, above which the number of fledged young declines. We manipulated brood size in Black Brent geese to decouple brood size from maternal quality and produce broods larger than the natural maximum. We recaptured marked goslings to assess variation in prefledging survival as a function of brood size and we estimated relative prefledging survival of goslings using a Bayesian hierarchical approach. We considered effects of natural clutch size, brood size and their interaction on probability that we captured goslings at about 4 weeks of age. Prefledging survival declined with increasing brood size ( = -0.53; 95% CI -0.91 to -0.16), while laid clutch size had little influence on prefledging survival ( = -0.04; 95% CI -0.42 to 0.32). Despite declining per capita survival with increasing brood size, the most productive brood size was six goslings, which is greater than the typical maximum clutch size of five. Thus, reduced survival in large broods, by itself, is not the sole mechanism that limits maximum clutch size. We suggest elsewhere that incubation limitation and lower residual reproductive value for females tending larger broods may be other mechanisms limiting maximal clutch size in brent.

AB Increasing knowledge of post-release survival and habitat requirements of translocated animals is critical to improve success of conservation programs. We estimated survival of reintroduced captive-bred Asian houbara bustards (Chlamydotis macqueenii) in reserves of western United Arab Emirates where plantations exist as supplementary feeding sites. We explored factors influencing short- (3 months after release) and long-term (tri-monthly periods after third month of release) survival rates of released birds. We modeled life histories of individually tracked houbara using Program MARK. Mean short-term survival probability (0.76 +/- 0.14SD) was lower than mean long-term survival (0.86 +/- 0.03SD), and observed group size and the age of released birds positively correlated with short-term survival. We hypothesize that higher quality habitat (plantations) affected survival; larger groups occurred in plantations and older birds might be better able to maintain access to plantations. Long-term survival was negatively influenced by subsequent release events. Releasing more individuals increases local houbara density. This may lead to food depletion, increase in density-dependent mechanisms between individuals, or both. Short- and long-term survival rates suggest that food availability at the release sites, together with intraspecific interactions, may influence survival of newly released and established individuals. To improve the management of translocated animals, the impact of managed food resources should be quantified to assess how it might affect population vital rates. (c) 2016 The Wildlife Society.

AB Maximizing survival in reintroduced, captive bred animals requires evaluation to identify best practices. This is particularly true for critically endangered species like the Vancouver Island marmot, endemic to British Columbia, Canada. From 2003 to 2010, 301 captive bred marmots were implanted with transmitters and released at extinct colony locations and other potentially preferred sites to bolster wild populations and establish new colonies. We evaluated release success based on three criteria: (1) site fidelity in the first summer, (2) survival to hibernation in fall, and (3) survival through winter. We used generalized linear mixed models and information theory to estimate the influence on release success of sex, age, and release practices, as well as local and landscape level habitat attributes. Our results suggest that overwinter survival most limited release success in the first year postrelease. In all years, overwinter survival was lower for newly released captive bred marmots than for wild or previously released marmots. Release date best predicted overall success, and was positively related to site fidelity and survival to hibernation but negatively related to overwinter survival. Our findings suggest that focused attempts to optimize release dates are likely to maximize long term reintroduction success.

AB A total of 98 marine mammal records from Iranian coastal waters of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman were compiled of which 66 are previously unpublished new records. Seventy-nine were from the Persian Gulf and 16 from the Gulf of Oman coast. The largest numbers of records were from Qeshm Island and Bushehr Provinces. Records of finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides), Indo-pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) and Indo-pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) were by far the most numerous probably reflecting their inshore distribution and local abundance. Other species recorded are common dolphin (Delphinus capensis tropicalis), rough-toothed dolphin (Steno bredanensis), Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and dugong (Dugong dugon). Evidence of 22 Mysticetes were obtained eight of which were tentatively identified as Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni), three as fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) and three as Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The largest threat to marine mammals in Iran is likely to be incidental capture in fishing gear. Six by caught finless porpoises were recorded and this species may be particularly vulnerable to incidental mortality in gillnets. Recommended marine mammal research, conservation and management small projects in Iran are described.

AB In arid and semi-arid ecosystems, the effect of shrubs on their understory plants has been frequently reported. Many previous studies have shown that both facilitation and competition act simultaneously, and their balance changes in response to spatial or temporal variations in environmental stresses. Yet, we know little about how the interaction varies between shrubs and their understory plants in vegetation patches with different characteristics. Here, an empirical investigation was conducted in Hexi desert region of northwest China, to evaluate how the net effect of Nitraria sphaerocarpa shrubs on the herbaceous species varies across different sizes of N. sphaerocaipa patches. Our study showed that herbaceous species perform better on small shrub patches. But the magnitude of this facilitative effect decreased with increasing patch size, and finally shifted to interference in large patches. The results indicated that these negative shifts in plant interactions were not clearly related to 'shrub-island effect' in terms of nutrient accumulation or soil properties improvement, but may be explained by the variation in other abiotic factors, such as soil moisture and available light. Changes in root distribution and canopy structure of N. sphaerocarpa shrubs with the increase of patch size seem to also partly explain the variation in shrub-understory species interactions, as a result of increased above- and below-ground niche overlaps.

AB The responses of eco-hydrological system to anthropogenic and natural disturbances have attracted much attention in recent years. The coupling and simulating feedback between hydrological and ecological components have been realized in several recently developed eco-hydrological models. However, little research has been carried out to study the estimation of threshold parameters in the ecohydrological models. The aim of this paper is to infer the groundwater threshold parameter that connects the ecological and hydrological processes inside eco-hydrological models. A simplified vegetation dynamic model was set up, and used to simulate the vegetation dynamic along the lower reach of the Tarim River. Bayesian inference approach was applied with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling method used to infer the probability distribution of the groundwater threshold parameter. The result showed that the simplified model has the capacity to model the vegetation dynamic in the study area. The mean values of inferred groundwater threshold parameters for Yinsu, Kardayi, Alagan, and Yiganbjima are 4.99, 5.59, 5.74, and 5.85 m respectively, which are comparable with prior research, and showed significant spatial variability. The 90% confidence interval of the groundwater threshold parameter is larger than 1.27 m. This threshold parameter inference approach was suggested to be carried out before complex ecohydrological modeling is performed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB A 17-yr grazing trial was conducted in the eastern Galilee of Israel to quantify trade-offs among the responses of pasture and livestock productivity, duration of grazing, amount of supplementary feed, and profitability to higher stocking density during the growing season of a Mediterranean grassland. Treatments included two stocking densities and two grazing protocols. The stocking densities throughout the grazing period were 0.55 animal unit (AU).ha(-1), which is common in this region, and 1.1 AU.ha(-1), which is considered high. The grazing protocols were continuous grazing throughout the grazing season and split-paddock grazing in which the herd grazed one subpaddock from the onset of grazing until the pasture was depleted, after which the herd was moved to the second ungrazed subpaddock. Under both protocols, heavier stocking density reduced standing biomass of the whole paddock at the end of the growing season by 43% and grazing duration during the subsequent dry season by 38% but increased the daily consumption of supplementary feed and the weaned live-weight production per unit area. Under continuous grazing the high stocking density of 1.1 AU.ha(-1) was maintained throughout the grazing season for 17 consecutive yr with no detectable effect on productivity of the pasture, typical to the resilience of Mediterranean grasslands that have been grazed for thousands of years. The lower pasture biomass production was compensated by higher weaned calf production. At the current local prices, the heavier stocking density was close to the economically optimal stocking density for the pasture in the region. It is concluded that on Mediterranean grassland intensive use of the pasture with high stocking density during the growing season can be economically feasible in those cases where the feed requirement of the herd can be maintained throughout the growing season.

AB The stress-gradient hypothesis states that individual and species competitive and facilitative effects change in relative importance or intensity along environmental gradients of stress. The importance of the number of facilitators in the neighborhood of a potential beneficiary has not been explored. Evenly distributed and stress-correlated facilitation and the increase in the intensity of facilitation with neighbors as linear, logarithmic, and unimodal functions is simulated for two hypothetical species, both of which improve the local environment. The mutualism is unbalanced in that the establishment of one species is enhanced by neighbors more than the other. Compared to no facilitation or evenly distributed facilitation, the stress gradient produces more edges in the spatially advancing population, more overall intensity of facilitation, and more individuals further advanced into the area of higher stress; the more enhanced species has increased population relative to the other - to the point where they are equal. Among three neighborhood functions, little difference exists in outcomes between the linear and logarithmic functions, but the unimodal function, which shifts peak facilitation intensity to fewer neighbors, increases the above state variables more than the differences between the even and stress gradient facilitation scenarios; the population of the beneficiary species exceeds that of the other. Different neighborhood functions change the effects of spatial pattern on the biological outcome. The unbalanced mutualism may be important where additional species alter the basic interaction in the high stress area of the environmental gradient, such as ecotones where the spatial pattern becomes central to facilitation.

AB Melozone biarcuata (Prevost's Ground-sparrow) has traditionally been divided into two allopatric groups based on differences in vocalizations and plumage characteristics: M. b. cabanisi in Costa Rica and M. b. biarcuata/M. b. hartwegi in northern Central America. However, the relationship between these subspecies has not been studied using a modern taxonomic approach. In this study, our objective was to provide the first detailed taxonomic comparison between these three subspecies using an integrative multi-trait analysis. We analyzed morphometric features, qualitative plumage patterns, and quantitative plumage measurements using spectral reflectance from all three subspecies, and we analyzed vocalizations for subspecies M. b. biarcuata and M. b. cabanisi. Our results show that M. b. cabanisi can be readily distinguished from the two other subspecies on the basis of morphometrics (M. b. cabanisi are smaller), plumage patterns (M. b. cabanisi have different facial markings and plumage patches), color differences (M. b. cabanisi have plumage patches that differ in color and brightness), and vocalizations (M. b. cabanisi have songs and calls that are acoustically distinct from those of M. b. biarcuata). By contrast, the two northern subspecies M. b. biarcuata and M. b. hartwegi were very similar for most traits, supporting previous suggestions that the two northern subspecies should be considered a single subspecies. Our data reveal that the differentiation in phenotypic characteristics between M. b. cabanisi versus M. b. biarcuata and M. b. hartwegi is similar to that reported for other complexes of subspecies where species status has been recognized. We argue that M. b. cabanisi should be treated as a species separate from M. biarcuata and propose that it be called Melozone cabanisi, White-faced Ground-sparrow. Our findings will contribute to the conservation efforts of the White-faced Ground-sparrow, which is endemic to Costa Rica's Central Valley and Turrialba Valley, by bringing focus to conservation policies that preserve ground-sparrow habitat (thickets, shade coffee plantations, and young secondary forest).

TI Role of density in aggregation patterns and synchronization of spawning

AB In broadcast spawners, low densities and poor spawning synchronization can reduce fertilization success. In wild populations, individuals in close proximity tend to spawn more synchronously than those further apart, suggesting that low spawner densities may reduce gamete production by lessening the efficacy of pheromone signalling. This study assessed the role of adult density in aggregation patterns and spawning synchronization in a semi-sessile, hermaphroditic scallop, Pecten fumatus. The study was carried out in Great Bay, Tasmania, Australia (147.335 W, 43.220 S) in 2010-2012 by assessing (1) the relationship between density, small-scale aggregation patterns and nearest neighbour distance (NND), (2) the temporal pattern of spawning synchronization, and (3) the effect of site density and conspecific proximity on the probability of spawning. Densities observed in the field ranged from 1.455 to 0.021 ind m(-2). Sites with lower densities had less small-scale aggregation and greater NNDs. Patterns of small-scale aggregation and NNDs in P. fumatus were comparable to those observed in a gonochoristic species. Spawning synchronization was highly variable, ranging between 3.5 and 59.8 % of individuals spawning. P. fumatus was more likely to engage in spawning activity when at greater densities and at closer proximity to conspecifics. This strongly suggests that lower densities in this scallop reduce not only the number of individuals contributing to the production of gametes, but also reduces the synchronization of spawning.

TI Combining Aesthetic with Ecological Values for Landscape Sustainability
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PREFERENCES; QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; PEOPLE; RIVER
AB Humans receive multiple benefits from various landscapes that foster ecological services and aesthetic attractiveness. In this study, a hybrid framework was proposed to evaluate ecological and aesthetic values of five landscape types in Houguanhu Region of central China. Data from the public aesthetic survey and professional ecological assessment were converted into a two-dimensional coordinate system and distribution maps of landscape values. Results showed that natural landscapes (i.e. water body and forest) contributed positively more to both aesthetic and ecological values than semi-natural and human-dominated landscapes (i.e. farmland and non-ecological land). The distribution maps of landscape values indicated that the aesthetic, ecological and integrated landscape values were significantly associated with landscape attributes and human activity intensity. To combine aesthetic preferences with ecological services, the methods (i.e. field survey, landscape value coefficients, normalized method, a two-dimensional coordinate system, and landscape value distribution maps) were employed in landscape assessment. Our results could facilitate to identify the underlying structure-function-value chain, and also improve the understanding of multiple functions in landscape planning. The situation context could also be emphasized to bring ecological and aesthetic goals into better alignment.

   Welfare?
SO ACTA BIOTHEORETICA

DT Article
DE Animal welfare; Group welfare; Inclusive welfare; Phenotypic variation
ID STRESS; SCIENCE; BEHAVIOR; WILD; COOPERATION; EMOTIONS
AB Currently assessment and management of animal welfare are based on the supposition that welfare status is something experienced identically by each individual animal when exposed to the same conditions. However, many authors argue that individual welfare cannot be seen as an 'objective' state, but is based on the animal's own self-perception; such perception might vary significantly between individuals which appear to be exposed to exactly the same challenges. We argue that this has two implications: (1) actual perceived welfare status of individuals in a population may vary over a wide range even under identical environmental conditions; (2) animals that appear to an external observer to be in better or poorer welfare condition may all in fact perceive their own individual status as the same. This would imply that optimum welfare of a social group might be achieved in situations where individual group members differ markedly in apparent welfare status and perceive their own welfare as being optimal under differing circumstances. Welfare phenotypes may also vary along a continuum between self-regarding and other-regarding behaviour; a variety of situations exist where (social) individuals appear to invest in the welfare of other individuals instead of maximising their own welfare; in such a case it is necessary to re-evaluate individual welfare within the context of a social group and recognise that there may be consequences for the welfare of individuals, of decisions made at the group level or by other group members.

AB The largest species of many invertebrate taxa occur in tropical regions. Nevertheless systematic studies on temperature and latitudinal trends in body size distributions of specific taxa have given inconclusive results and did not unequivocally corroborate existing models of body size evolution. We studied regional body size distributions of tenebrionid beetles across Europe to infer climate dependent trends that could be linked to the postglacial colonization of Europe. Even after correction for sample size effects and phylogenetic relatedness we found an increase in average and maximum body length towards southern Europe. Body size distributions were right skewed and skewness and the width of the distribution decreased significantly with temperature, indicating a more homogeneous species composition with respect to body size at lower latitudes. Our study supports the view that maximum size of heterothermic arthropods is limited by ambient temperature, which triggers the rate of metabolism. Our results contradict models that predict an increase in body size at higher latitudes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Interactions between cetacean species are common events that can lead to the formation of mixed-species groups, which have been reported in both captive and wild odontocetes. However, mixed groups containing Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) and the finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides) rarely have been seen, and detailed interactions between these 2 species have been limited. For the first time, this paper describes wild Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins assisting a finless porpoise (N. p. sunameri) calf in Xiamen waters, China. A group of 8 humpback dolphins amicably herded a finless porpoise calf for more than 3 h. The humpback dolphins accompanied the finless porpoise calf and took turns pushing the calf out of the water to breathe. This paper provides a detailed behavioral description of these interactions, and we discuss the potential causes of this event.

AB Fruits are highly important food resources for mammals in Mediterranean Europe, and due to the dominance of oaks (Quercus sp.), acorns are among those used by a vast array of species, including rodents. The metabolic yield of acorn intake may determine a selection pattern: preference for fat, carbohydrate, and consequently energy-rich fruits; or avoidance of fruits containing high concentrations of secondary chemical compounds (e.g., tannic acid). We studied the acorn feeding selection pattern of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) inhabiting a mixed oak woodland, southwest Portugal, using an experiment conducted in an open-air enclosure. We tested which variables associated with the wood mouse (e.g., sex) and acorns (e.g., size and nutrient content) from three oak species (holm Q. rotundifolia, Portuguese Q. faginea and cork Q. suber oak) could be constraining acorn consumption. Our results indicate that wood mice are selecting acorns of the most common oak species (Q. suber), probably due to their previous familiarization with the fruit due to its dominance in the ecosystem but probably also because its chemical characteristics (sugar contents). Rodent gender and acorn morphology (width) are also influential, with females more prone to consume acorns with smaller width, probably due to handling limitation. This selective behaviour may have consequences for dispersion and natural regeneration of the different oak species.

AB In New Zealand, black swans have been observed to graze a moderate to large proportion of the biomass of intertidal seagrass (Zostera muelleri) meadows. To evaluate the resilience of seagrass meadows to swan grazing, we performed a grazing simulation experiment at four sites in a large temperate estuary (Tauranga Harbour). In late summer, when swan grazing pressure typically peaks, we established control (0% biomass removed), low grazing intensity (similar to 40% biomass removed) and high grazing intensity (similar to 100% biomass removed) plots (025 m(2)) to mimic the grazing scars created by black swans. For one year, percentage seagrass above-ground cover of plots and a wider area surrounding the plots (0.75 m(2)) was monitored monthly. Seagrass biomass and leaf size were measured at the start and end of the experiment. Results showed no significant grazing treatment effect on seagrass leaf size (length and width). The low grazing intensity treatment had no detectable effect on seagrass cover or biomass relative to controls. For the high grazing intensity plots at all sites seagrass cover was restored within 8 months but biomass was not fully restored (only 25-42% of controls) one year later. This suggests that it may take several years (2.4-4.0, assuming a constant recovery rate) for seagrass below-ground biomass and leaf layering to regenerate completely in the grazing scars created by swans.

AB Models of foraging behaviour often assume either that animals are searching for resources, and therefore have no prior knowledge of resource locations, or that they are effectively omniscient, with a comprehensive knowledge of their habitat. By contrast, few attempts have been made to examine the actual conditions under which spatial memory will provide net benefits to foragers. To redress this balance, a model is developed that relates the sensory acuity of the forager and key indices of resource structure to the expected foraging efficiency via calculation of inter-patch distances. Efficiencies of 'ignorant' and 'prescient' foragers are examined in order to derive sets of conditions under which natural selection will favour the evolution of spatial memory capabilities. Results suggest that when resources are densely distributed or sensory acuity is high, spatial memory for resource locations provides no increase in efficiency over that of an 'ignorant' forager encountering resources at random.

AB Humans bargaining over money tend to reject unfair offers, whilst chimpanzees bargaining over primary rewards of food do not show this same motivation to reject. Whether such reciprocal fairness represents a predominantly human motivation has generated considerable recent interest. We induced either moderate or severe thirst in humans using intravenous saline, and examined responses to unfairness in an Ultimatum Game with water. We ask if humans also reject unfair offers for primary rewards. Despite the induction of even severe thirst, our subjects rejected unfair offers. Further, our data provide tentative evidence that this fairness motivation was traded-off against the value of the primary reward to the individual, a trade-off determined by the subjective value of water rather than by an objective physiological metric of value. Our data demonstrate humans care about fairness during bargaining with primary rewards, but that subjective self-interest may limit this fairness motivation.

AB Translocating European ground squirrels Spermophilus citellus has become a popular conservation tool. However, few release techniques have been carefully evaluated. To contribute to an evidence-based ground squirrel translocation guide for wildlife managers, we evaluated conditions of habitat manipulation (grass height and artificial burrow entrance angle) which we expected to affect. settlement of translocated ground squirrels during the critical period after release. In a field experiment, we translocated 173 individuals in southeastern Hungary in 2007. We released the animals into angled or vertical artificial burrows and manipulated grass height. We found that animals preferred angled (similar to 30 degrees) artificial burrows, which facilitate digging, and medium-height grass (18 cm +/- 1.5). Moreover, although ground squirrels generally are associated with short grass habitats, overhead protection by grasses is valuable after a translocation. This result implies that in order to accomplish a translocation, it is not sufficient to only know the habitat preference of a species in undisturbed situations, but also how and to what extent habitat characteristics should be manipulated to increase the chances of success.

AB Protective mechanisms in pregnancy include Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy (NVP) (Fessler, 2002; Flaxman and Sherman, 2000), increased sensitivity to health cues (Jones et al., 2005), and increased vigilance to out-group members (Navarette, Fessler, and Eng, 2007). While common perception suggests that pregnancy results in decreased cognitive function, an adaptationist perspective might predict that some aspects of cognition would be enhanced during pregnancy if they help to protect the reproductive investment. We propose that a reallocation of cognitive resources from nonessential to critical areas engenders the cognitive decline observed in some studies. Here, we used a recognition task disguised as a health rating to determine whether pregnancy facilitates face recognition. We found that pregnant women were significantly better at recognizing faces and that this effect was particularly pronounced for own-race male faces. In human evolutionary history, and today, males present a significant threat to females. Thus, enhanced recognition of faces, and especially male faces, during pregnancy may serve a protective function.

AB Total suspended particles mass concentrations (TSP) and bulk depositions of particulate matter (PM depositions) were measured around a cement plant located in the multi-impacted area to assess the affect of the plant on the ambient air in the vicinity in Izmir, Turkey. TSP samples were collected five times a month whereas PM depositions were sampled monthly at four sites between August 2003 and January 2004. The concentrations of Al, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn in TSP and PM depositions (except Cu) were reported. Chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model with local source profiles was run in order to calculate the source contributions of the PM sources to the concentrations of TSP, PM depositions, and trace elements. Traffic was found to be the major contributor to TSP whereas PM depositions dominantly result from area sources including several stone quarries, concrete plants, lime kilns, and asphalt plants in the region. CMB model results indicate that the cement plant is a significant contributor to TSP, PM depositions, and trace elements, particularly Cd.

AB This paper analyzes coalition formation in a livestock-pasture system where livestock are privately owned and the pasture is a common property. While standard models predict rather low prospects of cooperation, this paper introduces a cost advantage of cooperation based on Saami reindeer herding that may explain higher coalition participation. In contrast to the existing fishery literature on coalition formation, all players are assumed ex ante homogenous but may differ ex post due to the cost advantage. A stable equilibrium with cooperation can be reached and a moderate exploitation level can be sustained compared to the "tragedy of the commons" outcome. (JEL Q24)

AB A computer simulation was conducted to study the effects of densities, abundances. and aggregations of adult abalone populations on the fertilization success (amount of fertilization per spawning female). Impacts of densities were examined by having different numbers of adult abalone in spawning grounds of the same size. Impacts of abundances were studied by having different numbers of adult abalone in spawning grounds of different sizes with constant densities. Impacts of aggregations were investigated by having different spatial distributions for adult abalone with constant densities and sizes of spawning grounds. The fertilization success increased with the adult density. and the rate of increase in the fertilization success decreased with increasing densities, exhibiting atypical Allee effect. If the density remained the same for a single population, changes in the adult abundance had minimal impact on the fertilization success unless the abundance was really low. Adult aggregation would only considerably increase the fertilization success at relatively low adult densities. The fertilization success was greater for large population than the combined fertilization success for two smaller and isolated populations with the summed abundance of the two small populations equivalent to the abundance of the large population.

AB The hardbottom, patch, and bank reefs of Biscayne National Park (BNP) are among the most northern reef communities in the Florida Keys reef tract. The close proximity of BNP reefs to highly developed areas (i.e., the greater Miami metropolitan area) make them both heavily used and susceptible to a multitude of anthropogenic stresses. This study analyzes a unique 1977-1981 data set on stony-coral abundances and percent cover, collected from eight reefs in BNP, and compares this more than 25-year old data set with published data from surveys conducted from 1994-1996 and 1998-2000. In 1977-81, stony-coral cover on the eight reefs ranged between 8% and 28% whereas coral cover reported from surveys in 1998-2000 ranged between 0.4% and 10%. Significant declines in cover of all coral species were seen at BNP reefs in the similar to 20 years between data sets, although few changes were observed in species richness and taxonomic distinctness values. Spatial differences were observed between lagoonal patch reefs and outer bank reefs, consistent with previous reports of greater loss of coral cover on offshore reefs. Previous reports have suggested that high juvenile coral mortality due to fish predation, physical stresses, and thermal stresses have contributed to reduced cover at offshore BNP reefs.

AB Through the use of mitochondrial DNA (ATP8 gene), the prediction of intermediate genetic structuring was investigated in two species of estuarine glassfish (Ambassis marianus and Ambassis jacksoniensis) ( Perciformes : Ambassidae) to determine the possibility of a generalised 'estuarine' genetic structure. Individuals were collected from estuaries in eastern Australia between Tin Can Bay (Queensland) in the north and Kempsey ( New South Wales) in the south. Analysis of the haplotype frequencies found in this region suggested panmictic populations with star-like phylogenies with extremely high levels of genetic diversity, but with no correlation between geographic distance and genetic distance. Non-significant FST and Phi(ST) suggested extensive dispersal among estuaries. However, Tajima's D and Fu's F-S values suggest 'mutation-genetic drift equilibrium' has not been reached, and that population expansions occurring 262 000 (A. marianus) and 300 000 (A. jacksoniensis) years ago may obscure any phylogeographic structuring or isolation by distance. The finding of panmixia was contrary to the prediction of genetic structuring intermediate between that of marine fish (shallowly structured) and freshwater fish (highly structured), suggesting high dispersal capabilities in these species.

AB Many species that compete for space live on heterogeneous landscapes and interact at local scales. The quality, amount, and structure of landscapes may have considerable impact on the ability of species to compete or coexist, yet basic models of space competition do not include that level of detail. We model space competition between two species with positive feedback through recruitment facilitation, which creates the potential for alternative stable states to occur. We compare the predictions of a spatially implicit model with a simulation model that includes explicit space and landscape structure. We create structured landscapes in which we specify the amount of habitat and degree of fragmentation and ask how landscape structure, dispersal strategy, and scale affect the presence of alternative stable states, or bistability. We find that structured landscapes can reduce the range of parameter values that lead to bistability in our model, but they do not eliminate bistability. The type of landscape and the dispersal distance for each species also influence the amount of environmental change needed for abrupt community shifts to occur. Coexistence of the two competitors is possible under certain conditions when connectivity is low. Consequently, landscape structure may lead to considerable disparity between the predictions of simple models and actual dynamics on complex landscapes during environmental change.

AB 1. The abundance of cysts of the bloom-forming dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense in the sediments of Lake Kinneret and the effects of environmental conditions on encystment were studied in relation to bloom dynamics. Peak cyst formation coincided with the highest growth rate of the population, prior to bloom peak.
   2. Peridinium cysts were counted in water and sediment corer samples from 2000 to 2003 and in archived sediment trap samples collected during 1993-94. The cyst data were examined in relation to ambient temperature and nutrient records, and revealed no direct correlation.
   3. In laboratory encystment experiments with Peridinium cells collected from the lake, 0.2-3% of the vegetative cells encysted. Temperature, light and cell density had no significant effect on the percentage of encystment.
   4. Cysts were always present in the lake sediments but their abundance in 'non Peridinium' years was much lower than after a massive bloom. Vegetative cells were always present in the water column after the collapse of the annual dinoflagellate bloom, potentially serving as the inoculum for the next bloom. We propose that the hardy cysts serve as an emergency 'gene bank' to initiate population build up following catastrophic die outs.

AB It is of great theoretical interest and applied importance to assess the structural change of the aquatic community or assemblage as a whole. Size spectrum, a tool allowing such assessment, most often describes the size distribution of organisms, irrespective of their taxonomy. The size-frequency distribution of taxonomic units in an assemblage is applied more and more often as another special case of size spectrum, and is called here traditional taxonomic size spectrum (TTSS). The Lake Kinneret (Israel) phytoplankton database was used to compare two periods of four years each, one typical and one of an extremely abnormal, perturbed community state. All eight annual TTSS curves had a similar pattern. Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to quantify the similarity between TTSS histograms. For the stable period (1982-1985), the similarity measures (Pearson r) between TTSS of any pair of years were close to the 'ideal' value of 1, ranging from 0.927-0.985. For the extremely abnormal period (1996-1999), they had a wider range (0.896-0.980), where the lowest estimates correspond to explicit distortions of the TTSS pattern. So the similarity comparison of TTSS histograms reveals persistent ecosystem characteristics, also giving information on strong perturbations.

AB The centrifugal community organization model describes the habitat-use pattern of competing species that share a primary habitat preference but differ in their secondary habitat preferences. Our goal was to study the gradients underlying centrifugal organization in a community of 2 gerbil species, Gerbillus pyramidum (the greater Egyptian sand gerbil) and G. andersoni allenbyi (Allenby's gerbil), in the Southern coastal plain of Israel. Theory suggests that the ideal combination of food and safety should occur in the semistabilized-sand habitat. However, our measurements showed that this combination actually occurs at the stabilized-sand habitat. Yet, both species prefer the semistabilized-sand habitat. By using artificial seed patches, we show that foraging at the stabilized- sand substrate is at least twice as costly as foraging at the nonstabilized substrate. This, together with potential differences in resource renewal rates and predation risk may underlie the shared-preference for the semistabilized-sand habitat and thus affect the community organization.

AB Akebia quinata is a nectarless monoecious vine and has a flower-size dimorphism in which female flowers are twice as large as male flowers. In a field experiment, we examined the effects of resemblance between male and female flowers on pollinator behavior and the amount of geitonogamous pollination. When the same numbers of female and male flowers were presented in an artificial floral array, solitary bees tended to visit female flowers first and then visit male flowers in a foraging sequence. However, when sepals of male flowers were glued to female flowers from which the original sepals had been removed to produce floral monomorphism, solitary bees frequently moved from male to female flowers. Consequently, the amount of pollen deposited on stigmas per array visit was increased. The results show that floral monomorphism increases geitonogamous pollination, and flower-size dimorphism in A. quinata can avoid geitonogamous female 1 male pollination. We discuss the effect of pollinator selectivity on the evolution of flower-size dimorphism and intersexual floral mimicry.

AB Intraspecific variation in acoustic signals may reflect local variation in the intensity of natural and sexual selection and random drift. We examined intraspecific variation in the advertisement call of Spicospina flammocaerulea, a southwestern Australian frog species with a limited distribution, fragmented range, small population sizes, and specific breeding habitat requirements. Of the six populations examined, one in particular differed significantly in dominant frequency and body size. There was no relationship between among-population geographic distance and among-population divergence in call structure suggesting that the divergence is not caused by random drift. A correlation analysis detected a positive relationship between the size of males and females found in amplexus. However, there was no evidence of mated males differing in size from unmated males indicating that the differences in dominant frequency are unrelated sexual selection. Call structure variation may reflect differences in recruitment and resultant age structure of local populations.

AB House mice (Mus domesticus) are an important vertebrate pest in Australian agriculture. We studied the uptake of non-toxic placebo bait pellets targeted on house mice from bait stations in the grain-growing region of southeastern Australia. Bait stations allowed access for either ants; ants and mice or ants, mice, and birds. Soy meal bait pellets offered in December were of low preference for both ants and mice, but were eaten by birds in one study plot. In January, there were no differences between bait stations in the amount of wheat bait pellets removed indicating that the pellet bait had been primarily removed by ants. Most pellet bait was removed during the first 12 h after distribution. The results indicate that non-target species consumed pellet bait quicker than house mice. This has to be taken into account if similar bait pellets are to be used as carriers of lethal or sterility agents to manage house mouse populations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Small mammal communities were studied in eight vegetation types of the Prince Edward Island National Park, Prince Edward Island. Ten species were trapped. Shannon-Weiner index of diversity was high in Red Pine plantations (1.33 and 1.55) and a bog (1.47), and low for opened habitats such as a dune (0.19), and a freshwater wetland (0.60). Evenness was highest in Red Pine plantations, and lowest for wooded habitats including an Acadian forest. Relative abundance varied among species and habitats. Although the most widespread species was Sorer cinereus, the greatest abundance (16.8 individuals/100 trapnights) was reached by Tamias striatus in the Acadian forest. We hypothesized that natural factors such as predation and population fluctuations may explain the levels of abundance of small mammal species in the park. In some areas, visitor accommodations and current human activity may have also modified the dynamics of some species.

AB To improve ecological relevance, regulatory agencies are promoting assessments of effects at higher levels of organization, an objective that requires an understanding of current ecological theories. One such theory, hierarchy theory, contends that the effects of a disturbance acting at one level of organization (e.g., population) are not, as a rule, transmitted to higher levels of organization (e.g., community). Conversely, effects at higher levels of organization only occur if lower level variables have been affected. Further, responses to disturbance depend on disturbance history. In this study, I determined the effects of a disturbance treatment at the population, guild, and community levels of organization for vegetation in five wetlands with a disturbance history ranging from highly to rarely disturbed. The 2-year field experiment revealed that the effects of the disturbance treatment were most strongly felt at the population level of organization in wetlands without a history of disturbance. These observed impacts took place against a backdrop of constant change. Thus, the eventual disappearance of treatment effects was not due to a return to the pre-treatment state, but rather a return to a trajectory similar to that exhibited by the control plots. The implications of these results for ecological risk assessment are: (1) the observed effects of a stressor in a system cannot be extrapolated to other systems unless they have similar disturbance histories, (2) detecting effects before they become serious requires monitoring at lower levels of organization, (3) recovery to a naturally innate state is not a viable concept, and (4) the traditional approach of using one post-treatment measurement to determine if reference and impact sites differ is of very questionable value.

AB Policies for the management of natural resources and the resources themselves interact to form complex systems. In this paper, we present a highly simplified model that can be used to study the general features of those systems. The model has three state variables, the abundance of the resource, environmental pollution, and the capital devoted to pollution control. We analyse it graphically using the singular perturbation approach. Two modes of behavior are possible; stationary and cyclic. When the abundance of the resources varies cyclically, the length of the period of resource scarcity depends on population size, economic activity, pollution per unit of output, and policy constraints. We distinguish between two classes of policies, one in which decision-makers base their investments in pollution control capital on the abundance of the resource, and another in which those decisions depend on the amount of pollution. We show that policies based on the observation of pollution are safer than those based on resource abundance, because in the latter case, small changes in policy variables can lead much more easily to a collapse of the resource. Increases in population size, even when accompanied by an equiproportional increase in the pollution control budget can lead to a change from stationary to cyclic behavior, especially where policies are based on resource abundance.

AB (1) The influence of sheep grazing of moderate grazing (MG), heavy grazing (HG), inordinate grazing (IG), over grazing (OG), and extinct grazing (EG) on vegetation succession was studied in the Stipa baicalensis steppe during 1984-1986.
   (2) The relationships between the relative sum of dominance ratio (RSDR) and the degree of succession (DS) at all stages of grazing succession in the Stipa baicalensis steppe were revealed in terms of the method of mathematical analysis under five grazing intensities mentioned above.
   (3) The dynamic models of grazing succession that are based on accurate grazing intensities in relation to succession courses were constructed using RSDR5, and DS.  The models may explain the rules of grazing succession in the Stipa baicalensis steppe.

AB Fungi, cyanobacteria and algae are specific microbial groups associated with the deterioration and safety of stone monuments. In this study, high-throughput sequencing analysis was used to investigate the diversity, distributions, ecological functions, and interaction patterns of both the fungal and microalgal (including cyanobacteria and algae) communities on sandstone in the Beishiku Temple, located on the ancient Silk Road. The results showed that the core phyla of fungi were affiliated with unclassified Lecanoromycetes, Engyodontium, Knufia, Epicoccum, Endocarpon, and Cladosporium of Ascomycota whereas the phyla of microalgae were dominated by prokaryotic Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic Chlorophyta. The environmental factors of temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity were monitored simultaneously. The structure of the microbial communities was much more strongly shaped by soluble Cl-, Na+, NO3- ions than by the light intensity, moisture content or temperature, especially for the weathered sandstone located outside the caves. The co-occurrence network analysis suggested that a more stable community structure was evident outside the caves than inside. The stronger positive connections and coexistence patterns that were detected indicate a strong adaptability of fungi and microalgae to the distinct oligotrophic microhabitats on sandstone.

AB According to the stress gradient hypothesis (SGH), ecological interactions between organisms shift positively as environmental stress increases. In the case of associational resistance, habitat is modified to ameliorate stress, benefitting other organisms. The SGH is contentious due to conflicting evidence and theoretical perspectives, so we adopted a meta-analytic approach to determine if it is widely supported across a variety of contexts, including different kingdoms, ecosystems, habitats, interactions, stressors, and life history stages. We developed an extensive list of Boolean search criteria to search the published ecological literature and successfully detect studies that both directly tested the hypothesis, and those that were relevant but never mentioned it. We found that the SGH is well supported by studies that feature bacteria, plants, terrestrial ecosystems, interspecific negative interactions, adults, survival instead of growth or reproduction, and drought, fire, and nutrient stress. We conclude that the SGH is indeed a broadly relevant ecological hypothesis that is currently held back by cross-disciplinary communication barriers. More SGH research is needed beyond the scope of interspecific plant competition, and more SGH research should feature multifactor stress. There remains a need to account for positive interactions in scientific pursuits, such as associational resistance in tests of the SGH.

AB Teeth act as tools for acquiring and processing food, thus holding a prominent role in vertebrate evolution. In mammals, dental-dietary adaptations rely on tooth complexity variations controlled by cusp number and pattern. Complexity increase through cusp addition has dominated the diversification of mammals. However, studies of Mammalia alone cannot reveal patterns of tooth complexity conserved throughout vertebrate evolution. Here, we use morphometric and phylogenetic comparative methods across fossil and extant squamates to show they also repeatedly evolved increasingly complex teeth, but with more flexibility than mammals. Since the Late Jurassic, multiple-cusped teeth evolved over 20 times independently from a single-cusped common ancestor. Squamates frequently lost cusps and evolved varied multiple-cusped morphologies at heterogeneous rates. Tooth complexity evolved in correlation with changes in plant consumption, resulting in several major increases in speciation. Complex teeth played a critical role in vertebrate evolution outside Mammalia, with squamates exemplifying a more labile system of dental-dietary evolution.
   Tooth morphology has provided many insights into the tempo and mode of dietary evolution in mammals. A study of fossil and extant squamates shows that this group also repeatedly evolved increasingly complex teeth with more flexibility than mammals, and that higher tooth complexity and herbivory likely led to higher speciation rates.

AB Weathering represents severe destruction to outdoor cultural rock heritages. In the process, biological weathering caused by microorganisms is known to be the key process. With abundantly available nutrients and a suitable climate, there is a higher abundance and diversity of microorganisms in moss and lichen biocrusts than on bare rock surfaces. However, few studies have been conducted on weathering in these microhabitats. In this review, we emphasize the role of microorganisms, mosses, and lichens in weathering; expound the various bioweathering phenomena on rock cultural heritages; discuss the major pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and archaea on rock cultural heritages; and compare the different bioweathering mechanisms on calcareous and siliceous rock substrates. More deeply, we explain the interaction between mosses and microorganisms and the weathering processes and mechanisms in these microhabitats and analyze why the weathering will be intensified in moss and lichen habitats. Finally, we provide a reference to establish a practical and effective method to protect rock cultural heritages from microbial destruction.

   functional trait variation; global patterns; wing morphology
AB Aim Our understanding of the biological strategies employed by species to cope with challenges posed by aridity is still limited. Despite being sensitive to water loss, bats successfully inhabit a wide range of arid lands. We here investigated how functional traits of bat assemblages vary along the global aridity gradient to identify traits that favour their persistence in arid environments.
   Location Global.
   Time period Contemporary.
   Major taxa studied Bats.
   Methods We mapped the assemblage-level averages of four key bat traits describing wing morphology, echolocation and body size, based on a grid of 100-km resolution and a pool of 915 bat species, and modelled them against aridity values. To support our results, we conducted analyses also at the species level to control for phylogenetic autocorrelation.
   Results At the assemblage level, we detected a rise in values of aspect ratio, wing loading and forearm length, and a decrease in echolocation frequency with increasing aridity. These patterns were consistent with trends detected at the species level for all traits.
   Main conclusions Our findings show that trait variation in bats is associated with the aridity gradient and suggest that greater mobility and larger body size are advantageous features in arid environments. Greater mobility favours bats' ability to track patchy and temporary resources, while the reduced surface-to-volume ratio associated with a larger body size is likely to reduce water stress by limiting cutaneous evaporation. These findings highlight the importance of extending attention from species-specific adaptations to broad scale and multispecies variation in traits when investigating the ability of species to withstand arid conditions.

AB The tropical waters of the Northern Arabian Gulf have a long history of maritime resource richness. High levels of biodiversity result from the complex matrix of coastal habitats, coral reefs and sea grass beds that characterise the region. Insight into the ongoing health of such habitats and the broader Kuwait maritime environment can be gauged by the status of indicator species found within these habitats. Here we review information on the occurrence, distribution and threats to key marine habitats and associated indicator species to provide an updated assessment of the state of the Kuwait's marine biodiversity. Critical evaluation of historic data highlights knowledge gaps needed inform the focus of future monitoring and conservation efforts. This assessment is designed to evaluate performance against environmental policy commitments, while providing a solid foundation for the design of comprehensive marine ecosystem management strategies.

AB Evolutionary reduction of adult body size (miniaturization) has profound consequences for organismal biology and is an important subject of evolutionary research. Based on two individuals we describe a new, extremely miniaturized chameleon, which may be the world's smallest reptile species. The male holotype of Brookesia nana sp. nov. has a snout-vent length of 13.5 mm (total length 21.6 mm) and has large, apparently fully developed hemipenes, making it apparently the smallest mature male amniote ever recorded. The female paratype measures 19.2 mm snout-vent length (total length 28.9 mm) and a micro-CT scan revealed developing eggs in the body cavity, likewise indicating sexual maturity. The new chameleon is only known from a degraded montane rainforest in northern Madagascar and might be threatened by extinction. Molecular phylogenetic analyses place it as sister to B. karchei, the largest species in the clade of miniaturized Brookesia species, for which we resurrect Evoluticauda Angel, 1942 as subgenus name. The genetic divergence of B. nana sp. nov. is rather strong (9.914.9% to all other Evoluticauda species in the 16S rRNA gene). A comparative study of genital length in Malagasy chameleons revealed a tendency for the smallest chameleons to have the relatively largest hemipenes, which might be a consequence of a reversed sexual size dimorphism with males substantially smaller than females in the smallest species. The miniaturized males may need larger hemipenes to enable a better mechanical fit with female genitals during copulation. Comprehensive studies of female genitalia are needed to test this hypothesis and to better understand the evolution of genitalia in reptiles.

AB Despite there are several contributions on the relationship between various aspects of consumer behavior and environmental awareness, further research is required to analyze consumer behavior in the domain of cigarette butts littering. The aim of this study is to examine the role of feared self and environmental awareness constructs as significant antecedents of consumer behavior, as well as the impact of congruity between feared self and environmental awareness. This study utilizes structural equation modeling (SEM). Specifically, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is used to test the construct measures of the structural model and path model analysis to test the hypotheses of the structural model. The hypothesized model was tested using primary data. The main findings are consistent with the hypothesized model and highlight a positive influence of feared self on cigarette butts littering behavior, whereas congruity of feared self and environmental awareness do not have an impact on cigarette butts littering behavior. These results may draw the attention of practitioners, academicians, and policy-makers for environmentally responsible guidance as well as consumer awareness programs for sustainable development.

ID RATIONAL CHOICE
AB We axiomatize a model of satisficing which features random thresholds and the possibility of choice abstention. Given a menu, the decision maker first randomly draws a threshold. Next, using a list order, she searches the menu for alternatives which are at least as good as the threshold. She chooses the first such alternative she finds, and if no such alternative exists, she abstains. Since the threshold is random, so is the resulting behavior. We characterize this model using two simple axioms. In general the revelation of the model's primitives is incomplete. We characterize a specialization of the model for which the underlying preference and list ordering are uniquely identified by choice frequencies. We also show that our model is a special Random Utility Model. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nitrogen fixation (NF) of phototrophic communities was studied in a number of soda lakes with a wide range of salinity (25-400 g/l) located in Kulunda Steppe (Altai, Russia) during several summer seasons (2011-2016). The phototrophic communities were represented by the algal-bacterial Ctenocladus communities or cyanobacterial biofilms dominated by heterocystous and non-heterocystous cyanobacteria and purple sulfur bacteria Ectothiorhodospira sp. (up to 210 g/l) and endoevaporitic Euhalothece communities dominated by the extremely salt-tolerant unicellular cyanobacterium Euhalothece sp. and Ectothiorhodospira sp. (above 350 g/l). Salinity was the major factor influencing the composition and NF potential of the phototrophic communities. The communities dominated by vegetative heterocystous cyanobacteria exhibited light-independent NF at total salinity up to 60 g/l. The communities dominated by non-heterocystous cyanobacteria exhibited light-dependent NF in a range of 55-100 g/l, but it was significantly suppressed at 100 g/l. At 160-200 g/l the dark heterotrophic NF was a prevailing process if communities didn't contain Euhalothece sp. At salt-saturating ranges above 350 g/l, light-dependent NF associated with the Euhalothece communities was detected. A statistically significant positive correlation between the NF and diurnal light intensity was found in all samples of communities dominated by non-heterocystous cyanobacteria in contrast to communities dominated by heterocystous cyanobacteria with insignificant correlation coefficients.

AB Most of the sand dunes close to the Mediterranean coast of Egypt have been destroyed due to human pressures. The remaining dunes are under extreme threat due to unplanned development. This study aims to explore the floristic patterns and detect which drivers threaten their conservation status. Eighty-five random plots of 100 m(2) each along 12 transects perpendicular to the seashore in the northwestern coastal dunes were sampled. Classification of plots using plant cover percentage was carried out through agglomerative hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate analysis. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and variance partitioning (VP) were used to define the drivers that influence the floristic patterns. Therophytes and chamaephytes represent 30% of each of the 113 vascular plant species recorded in the present study. Four clusters of plant species corresponding to four dune-types were identified: Ammophila arenaria - Ononis vaginalis in foredunes, Echinops spinosissimus- Launaea fragilis in embryonic dunes, Echinops spinosissimus- Allium erdelii in transitional and Echinops spinosissimus- Thymelaea hirsuta in stabilized dunes. Stabilized dunes showed the highest diversity (species richness H-dune = 1.37, evenness E-dune = 0.88) and rarity indices (R = 0.52) as well as a steeper rarefaction curve. CCA disclosed that organic matter and CaCO3 content, distance from the coastline, overcutting, trampling, and urbanization were correlated with the floristic patterns. VP showed that the examined variables justified for 53% of the variance in the floristic composition. Our results can be considered by managers to fulfill an appropriate conservation plan to preserve and manage the coastal dunes in arid regions.

AB Industrial bulk material transfer and handling processes often cause large amounts of dust emission and seriously threatens workers' health. Proper design of dust removal system requires an understanding of the volume flow rate of entrained air during the falling process of the particle plume. Based on previous researches, this paper deduces the formula of the volume flow rate of entrained air through theoretical analysis. This theoretical formula involves the initial velocity of the particles and the void fraction of particle plume core zone. By comparing with former experimental and numerical calculation results, it is found that the theoretical formula can better predict the volume flow rate of entrained air. The numerical calculation is used to analyze the influence of the initial velocity of the particles and the angle of the particle source on the volume flow rate of entrained air. It was found that when the initial velocity of the particles increased from 0.1 m/s to 10 m/s, the volume flow rate of entrained air is hardly affected during the falling process. The angle between the particle source and the horizontal direction has a greater influence on the total volume flow rate of entrained air. With the angle of particle source between 30 degrees and 45 degrees, the total volume flow rate of entrained air is the largest for different drop height.

AB Mathematical models of fertilization have been developed for many taxa, for both external and internal fertilizers. They estimate the proportion or number of fertilized gametes based on gamete concentrations and parameters relating to the biology of the model organism, as well as serve multiple purposes: a predictive purpose, with applications in, for example, artificial insemination; they clarify causal components of fertilization success such as concentration, size, collision rates and swimming speed of gametes, and polyspermy block times; and they function as components of models in evolutionary ecology, which often require understanding of fitness consequences of resource allocation between gametes and other traits. We pay particular attention to this last category, which has received less attention than other uses. Many evolutionary models assume the simplest relationship between fertilization success and gamete numbers: all eggs are fertilized. In nature, however, it is not uncommon for eggs to be sperm limited, and fertilization success must decrease as sperm density approaches zero. Fertilization functions become important in the range between these two extremes. We focus on models in evolutionary ecology, but aim for a resource that is useful regardless of topic or taxon by reviewing models developed for different purposes in a common mathematical framework.

AB While many mating preferences have a genetic basis, the question remains as to whether and how learning/experience can modify individual mate choice decisions. We used wild-caught (predator-experienced) and F-1 laboratory-reared (predator-naive) invasive Western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis from China to test whether mating preferences (assessed in a first mate choice test) would change under immediate predation threat. The same individuals were tested in a second mate choice test during which 1 of 3 types of animated predators was presented: 1) a co-occurring predator, 2) a co-evolved but not currently co-occurring predator, and 3) a non-piscivorous species as control. We compared preference scores derived from both mate choice tests to separate innate from experiential effects of predation. We also asked whether predator-induced changes in mating preferences would differ between sexes or depend on the choosing individual's personality type and/or body size. Wild-caught fish altered their mate choice decisions most when exposed to the co-occurring predator whereas laboratory-reared individuals responded most to the co-evolved predator, suggesting that both innate mechanisms and learning effects are involved. This behavior likely reduces individuals' risk of falling victim to predation by temporarily moving away from high-quality (i.e., conspicuous) mating partners. Accordingly, effects were stronger in bolder than shyer, large- compared with small-bodied, and female compared with male focal individuals, likely because those phenotypes face an increased predation risk overall. Our study adds to the growing body of literature appreciating the complexity of the mate choice process, where an array of intrinsic and extrinsic factors interacts during decision-making.

AB Mougeotia (Zygnematales, Charophyta) first appeared in the plankton of Lake Kinneret in 1998. While initially rare, from 2004 onwards it was present in the plankton continuously, forming massive blooms in spring (2005, 2006, 2012) or in winter (2010), occasionally appearing in different morphological and life cycle forms. Mougeotia maintained its population under a wide range of water temperatures, nutrient concentrations, solar radiation, pH levels and stratification patterns, making it a highly versatile alga. In multiple regression, year and month as the only predictors explained 36% of the pattern of Mougeotia biomass. However, Mougeotia biomass could not be explained by any of the environmental parameters considered. Modeling the temporal dynamics of Mougeotia biomass using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA(1,0,0)) explained 56% of variability indicating that intraspecific factors (e.g., competition for nutrients or self-shading) may determine the dynamics of Mougeotia biomass. To explain the lack of relationships with the environmental parameters, we hypothesize that (1) Mougeotia possesses exceptional physiological plasticity and/or (2) Lake Kinneret may host two or more genetically distinct cryptic species of Mougeotia with different environmental niches. Both explanations may hinder any inference on Mougeotia-environment relationships and require confirmation by experimental work.

AB We quantified the predation of Acanthocyclops americanus from the shallow Mediterranean lake Albufera, using gut contents from field collections and laboratory feeding tests. For functional response studies, we used Brachionus plicatilis (at 6 concentrations, 400-4000 ind. 40ml(-1)) and Diaphanosoma mongolianum (at 2-20 ind. 40ml(-1)). Copepod feeding rates were also estimated using different proportions of rotifer prey and lake seston (0-67.5% of seston+ 40 individuals of B. plicatilis). Prey selection studies were conducted using five zooplankton species: Brachionus angularis, Brachionus plicatilis, Keratella tropica, Daphnia magna and Diaphanosoma mongolianum. Gut contents of field-collected adult Acanthocyclops contained filamentous algae and cyanobacteria and 16 zooplankton species (Keratella cochlearis, unspined and spined forms, K. tropica, Brachionus plicatilis, Brachionus calyciflorus, Brachionus angularis, Brachionus variabilis, Asplanchna girodi, Polyarthra vulgaris, Synchaeta pectinata, Lepadella rhomboides, unidentified bdelloids, Alona rectangula, Chydorus sphaericus, Bosmina longirostris, D. magna, Ceriodaphnia dubia and copepod nauplii). When fed B. plicatilis or D. mongolianum, female A. americanus had higher prey consumption rates than males. Increased proportion of lake seston caused reduced consumption of brachionid prey. Our data suggest that A. americanus is omnivorous in nature.

AB Although initially applied to endotherms, Bergmann's Rule (body size correlated with latitude) has also been demonstrated for a number of ectothermic taxa, including turtles. We examined body size and growth in the Pond Slider (Tracheinys scripta) at the northern edge of its range in Indiana. We then compiled body size data from across the range of the species to test for latitudinal trends. Adult females in Indiana were larger than males, and their growth rates began diverging by at least their fourth year. Mean and maximum body size were positively correlated with latitude in female Red-eared Sliders (T. s. elegans), but not in males or in Yellow-bellied Sliders (T. s. scripta), for which the available data were limited. More data are needed to understand geographic patterns in growth, age and size at maturity, and adult male size in this otherwise well-studied species.

AB Theory suggests that ecological systems exhibit a pronounced slow down in their dynamics, known as 'critical slowing down' (CSD), before they undergo regime shifts or critical transitions. As a result of CSD, ecosystems exhibit characteristic temporal and spatial changes which can be used as early warning signals of imminent regime shifts. For temporal data, statistical methods to detect these generic indicators of ecosystem resilience are well developed. However, for spatial data, despite a well developed theoretical framework, statistical methods such as data pre-processing and null models to detect EWS are relatively poorly developed. In this manuscript, we investigate the case of a common type of ecological spatial dataset which consists of binary values at each location (e.g. occupied/unoccupied, tree/grass or coralline/bleached). We employ a cellular-automaton based spatially-explicit model which generates data that mimics remotely sensed or field collected high-resolution spatial data with a binary classification of the state variables at each location. We demonstrate that trends in two spatial metrics, spatial variance and spatial skewness, of such binary spatial data lead to false, failed or misleading signals of transitions. We find that, two other indicators, spatial autocorrelation at lag-1 and spectral density ratio, accurately reflect CSD even with binary spatial data. To overcome the problems associated with detection of EWS using spatial variance and skewness, we investigate a data pre-processing method called `coarse-graining' which is inspired from the physics literature on phase transitions. Coarse-graining reduces the spatial resolution of data by averaging state variables over small scales. Yet, it enables detection of CSD-based spatial indicators of impending critical transitions. In summary, our study provides a theoretical basis, and rigorous evaluation, of coarse-graining as a pre-processing step to analyse spatial datasets with discrete state classifications.

TI Are post-dispersed seeds of Eucalyptus globulus predated in the

AB Plantations of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. have been expanding rapidly worldwide. The species is considered invasive in several regions. While in the native range, post-dispersal seed predation is known to severely limit eucalypt recruitment, there is no experimental evidence of seed predation in the introduced range. We hypothesised that E. globulus seeds largely escape predation in Portugal, which may explain its prolific recruitment in some locations. We tested this hypothesis in central Portugal by exposing E. globulus seeds to the local fauna. For comparison purposes, we also used seeds from locally common species: Acacia dealbata Link (alien, larger, elaiosome-bearing seeds) and Cistus salviifolius L. (native, similarly sized seeds). We installed 30 feeding stations across three study sites, each one dominated by one study species. Each feeding station featured four feeders with different animal-access treatments: invertebrates; vertebrates; full access; no access (control). We placed five seeds of each plant species every day in each feeder and registered the number of seeds missing, eaten and elaiosome detached over 9 summer days.
   Eucalyptus globulus seeds were highly attractive to fauna in the three sites. Nearly half of E. globulus seeds were predated or removed, thus contradicting our hypothesis. Surprisingly, E. globulus and A. dealbata seeds were used by animals in similar proportions and C. salviifolius seeds were the least preferred. Vertebrates were the predominant seed predators and preferred the alien seeds. Invertebrates used all seed species in similar proportions. We found spatial variation regarding the predominant type of seed predators and the levels of seed predation according to the following patterns: predominance of vertebrates; predominance of invertebrates; negligible seed predator activity. Locations with negligible seed predation were abundant and scattered across the study area. Such spatial variation may help to explain the heterogeneous recruitment patterns of E. globulus seedlings found in previous studies.

AB Sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) live along the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf and are aggregated over a broad range of spatial scales (m(2)-10(5) km(2)). However, little is known about the spatial distribution of local scallop neighborhoods, the scale at which spawning, intra-specific competition, and predator-prey interactions occur. We surveyed 30,995 km2 of Georges Bank and the Great South Channel annually from 2003 to 2010 counting the number of scallops in 54,016 locally replicated 3.24-m(2) quadrats with underwater video. There were about 4 billion scallops occupying 11,200 km2 of the study area in concentrations from 1 to 41 scallops per scallop. Scallop spatial distribution switched from dispersed to aggregated at a concentration of 3-4 scallops in every year. High concentrations (>3) occurred in 11% but were only persistent in 4% (449 km(2)) of scallop habitat. There were 13 persistent high-concentration aggregations (7-217 km(2)), and all but two occurred on gravel-dominated sediments left by prehistoric glacial retreat. Model-derived benthic boundary shear stresses in the persistent aggregations averaged two times higher than in scallop habitat, but the seabed was about two times more stable because it had significantly less sand and more granule-pebble and cobble sediment. The area occupied by scallops each year varied little (9%) despite a 49% increase in total scallop abundance between 2005 and 2007, suggesting Georges Bank scallops have a proportional density population structure. Most scallops occurred alone or at low concentrations (<= 2) where fertilization success is probably poor. The persistent high-concentration aggregations we identified may be critical for successful reproduction and sustainable harvest. Observing organisms at scales corresponding to their individual interactions reveals important processes shaping their landscape-scale spatiotemporal distributions. These processes are obscured by the methods typically employed to estimate abundances of commercial fishery species. The spatiotemporal structure of sea scallop distribution has important implications for the design of abundance surveys and the assumptions underlying stock assessment methods. These should be investigated. Finally, this work suggests that natural disturbance (sediment stability) may play a substantial role in shaping spatiotemporal distributions and dynamics of benthic marine populations.

AB Knowledge about vegetation patterns along disturbance gradients is essential for conservation and management of coastal habitats in arid regions. This study focuses on the floristic diversity and the factors controlling the vegetation structure in the Gulf of Gabes (Tunisia). For this purpose, the floristic diversity of 120 releves belonging to three coastal sites with different disturbance levels (40 releves per site) was analyzed in relation with 10 environmental and anthropogenic factors. Therophytes constitute 54% of the 237 plants species belonging to 44 families identified in the present study. The species richness and floristic diversity indices exhibited a similar trend and peaked in the slightly disturbed site (H=3.38; S=176). The similarity between sites was relatively low and reached its maximum between the little and the highly disturbed sites. Two-way indicator species analysis and detrended correspondence analysis applied on the floristic data resulted in groups mainly determined by disturbance level by explicitly segregating the three sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the spatial pattern of species composition was mainly influenced by anthropogenic variables. Partial CCA revealed that the effect of anthropogenic variables on floristic composition was thrice higher than the effect of environmental variables (57.5% vs. 18.4%, respectively). Overall, this study provides a broad understanding of the floristic diversity and vascular plant richness in the Gulf of Gabes. The obtained results reflected a disturbance-diversity pattern and thus revealed the obvious importance of maintaining the intermediate disturbance for biodiversity conservation and monitoring.

AB The process of desertification in the semi-arid climatic zone is considered by many as a catastrophic regime shift, since the positive feedback of vegetation density on growth rates yields a system that admits alternative steady states. Some support to this idea comes from the analysis of static patterns, where peaks of the vegetation density histogram were associated with these alternative states. Here we present a large-scale empirical study of vegetation dynamics, aimed at identifying and quantifying directly the effects of positive feedback. To do that, we have analyzed vegetation density across 2.5 x 10(6) km(2) of the African Sahel region, with spatial resolution of 30 x 30 meters, using three consecutive snapshots. The results are mixed. The local vegetation density (measured at a single pixel) moves towards the average of the corresponding rainfall line, indicating a purely negative feedback. On the other hand, the chance of spatial clusters (of many "green" pixels) to expand in the next census is growing with their size, suggesting some positive feedback. We show that these apparently contradicting results emerge naturally in a model with positive feedback and strong demographic stochasticity, a model that allows for a catastrophic shift only in a certain range of parameters. Static patterns, like the double peak in the histogram of vegetation density, are shown to vary between censuses, with no apparent correlation with the actual dynamical features. Our work emphasizes the importance of dynamic response patterns as indicators of the state of the system, while the usefulness of static modality features appears to be quite limited.

AB Under gradual change of a driver, complex systems may switch between contrasting stable states. For many ecosystems it is unknown how rapidly such a critical transition unfolds. Here we explore the rate of change during the degradation of a semiarid ecosystem with a model coupling the vegetation and geomorphological system. Two stable statesvegetated and bareare identified, and it is shown that the change between these states is a critical transition. Surprisingly, the critical transition between the vegetated and bare state can unfold either rapidly over a few years or gradually over decennia up to millennia, depending on parameter values. An important condition for the phenomenon is the linkage between slow and fast ecosystems components. Our results show that, next to climate change and disturbance rates, the geological and geomorphological setting of a semiarid ecosystem is crucial in predicting its fate.

AB Premise of research. The Apodanthaceae, the only parasitic lineage within the order Cucurbitales, comprises one species of Apodanthes and 12 species of Pilostyles, parasitizing Salicaceae, and legume stems, respectively. All species are achlorophyllous and holoparasitic, with a mycelium-like endophyte. Although flowers, fruits, and seeds are the only organs available for morphological and taxonomic studies, floral development has not been recorded, and morphoanatomical observations in the family are scarce. Given the position of the Apodanthaceae as the earliest-diverging group within the Cucurbitales, their floral characters allow a reevaluation of the apomorphies for the order, as well as those features specific to the Apodanthaceae, likely linked to their holoparasitic lifestyle.
   Methodology. We used LM and SEM protocols to record all developmental stages from early floral initiation through fruit and seed ripening of Pilostyles boyacensis, a species inhabiting dry Andean forests.
   Pivotal results. Floral development occurs completely inside the host. Perianth organs are formed in a spiral. Staminate flowers develop a central column with a basal nectary disk before synandrium formation. A ring of vesicular hairs forms above the synandrium. Carpellate flowers lack vesicular hairs. The funicle is schizogenous, and the chalazal exotesta forms an elaiosome likely related to ant dispersal; these traits are here proposed as apomorphic in Apodanthaceae. Carpellate flowers are more frequent than staminate flowers (74% vs. 20%). Additionally, chimeric, half-staminate, and half-carpellate flowers occur in 6% of the total of dissected flowers (n = 276).
   Conclusions. The Apodanthaceae shares with the remaining Cucurbitales polysymmetric flowers; free perianth organs with stomata; simultaneous microsporogenesis; anatropous, bitegmic ovules; chalazal functional megaspore; Polygonum-type embryo sac; exotestal seed coat; and nuclear endosperm. Chimeric half-staminate and half-carpellate flowers indicate a more labile sex determination in Apodanthaceae, whose flowers are often described as unisexual. Athecal stamens lacking fibrous endothecium, carpels distally fused, tenuinucellate ovules, berries with persistent perianth, schizogenous funicle, and seeds with elaiosome are apomorphic to Apodanthaceae. The latter two traits are described in detail for the first time in the family.

AB We studied cladoceran species richness, community composition, habitat preference and density in three spatial habitats over 1 year at Thale-Noi, a large shallow tropical lake in southern Thailand. Monthly sampling conducted with activity traps deployed overnight in littoral (Hydrilla and Ceratophyllum beds), open water (Hydrilla beds) and marginal zone (Utricularia beds), revealed that the macrophyte beds support similar cladoceran diversities regardless of the habitat. Total species richness in all studied habitats ranged between 30 and 34 species, supporting up to 22 species in a trapping area of 0.09 m(2) at peak times, the majority belonging to the Chydoridae. In total, 40 species were recorded over the year, half of which were chydorids. Mixed cladoceran densities reached maxima of 160 333 ind.m(-2) for a single habitat at a given moment. The dominant species included Chydoridae (Anthalona, Kurzia, Dunhevedia and Ephemeroporus), Daphniidae (Ceriodaphnia), Macrothricidae (Macrothrix) and Ctenopoda (Latonopsis). Monthly variation in species richness was most obvious in the littoral zone, whereas monthly variation in densities occurred at all sites. Community composition and habitat preference were mainly structured by depth and pH, resulting in different assemblages per habitat, but with uniform communities in the littoral (Hydrilla and Ceratophyllum) beds in a single area. This study presents the first ecological survey of Cladocera using activity traps in a shallow tropical lake.

AB Trochulus striolatus is a land snail showing great morphometric variation in its shell, which is the basis for recognition of its subspecies. However, this variability can result from an influence of environment. To verify the possible effect of bioclimatic and spatial variables on the shell size and shape, we studied many samples collected from four biotic zones (lowland, submontane, montane and subalpine). Many of its shell features appeared significantly negatively correlated with a precipitation parameter and altitude, whereas positively correlated with temperature parameters. The shells were smaller at higher altitudes and in colder environment with greater precipitation. The reduced growth period can be an adaptive response to the shorter growing season in mountainous regions compared to lowland areas, where the longer season permits a longer growth resulting in larger mean adult body size. This conforms to the converse Bergmann's cline. The synergetic interactions between seasonality, temperature and moisture best explain the size variation in T striolatus resulting from the influence of local environmental and/or climate factors. Therefore, there is no sufficient justification for subspecies recognition and the subspecific epithets for T striolatus should be discarded.

AB To explore the differences in the swimming ability and environmental adaptive abilities between male and female Gambusia affinis, we assessed the differences in burst swimming speeds (U-burst), critical swimming speeds (U-crit) and their related fin areas, and consumption of energy substances after starvation at 0 (control group), 15, 30, 45, and 60 days, respectively. The results showed that the pectoral and caudal fin areas did not differ significantly between male and female G. affinis. However, the dry mass, condition factors, and absolute contents of glycogen, lipids, and proteins were significantly elevated in females in the control group (P<0.05), whereas U-burst and U-crit were significantly low ( P<0.05). After starvation of 60 days, the rate of consumption of lipids was significantly low in the females (P<0.05). Although U-burst and U-crit decreased linearly with increased duration of starvation, the coefficient of linear equation between Ucrit and starvation time was significantly lower in females than males (P<0.05). These findings indicated that low body mass and condition factors reduce the relative bear load and moving resistance that causes high swimming performance in male G. affinis. High contents of energy substances and low rate of consumption of lipids result in stable U-crit in females during hunger.

AB Mothers have a crucial influence on offspring development. Variations of maternal behaviour can be due to numerous parameters, for instance costs are related to the size of a brood/litter, which in turn can influence the level of mothers' investment in each offspring. Here we investigated the influence of brood size on the behaviour of Japanese quail mothers and chicks during the mothering period and on offspring development. We compared two types of broods: small broods of three chicks (N = 9) and large broods of six chicks (N= 9). Behavioural tests assessed chicks' social and emotional traits. Mothers of large broods emitted more maternal vocalisations at the beginning of the mothering period, but at the end they assumed more non-covering postures and trampled chicks more than mothers of small broods. Chicks in large broods huddled up more whereas chicks in small broods rested alone more frequently. Moreover, the social motivation of chicks in large broods was higher than that of chicks in small broods, although their emotional reactivity levels were similar. Our results evidence the importance of brood size for maintaining family cohesion and the influence of brood size on chicks' interactions with their siblings. We evaluated the influence of mothers and siblings on chicks' behavioural development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deserts rodents coexistence has been mainly attributed to resource partitioning at different scales, from macro to microhabitat. We explore the structure of a rodent community in a North African desert under the hypothesis of resource partition. We present the first data of habitat selection by several Gerbilline rodent species in North Africa (Tunisia). Animals were trapped during one season in four locations of the Tunisian desert (Bou-Hedma National Park). Macrohabitat selection was assessed by RDA and variance partitioning. The effect of macrohabitat variables on species richness was assessed by Poisson GLZ and multimodel averaging. Microhabitat selection was evaluated by GLMM and multimodel averaging. Our results support the configuration of two desert rodents assemblages in this region: one characterized by species requiring disaggregated soil, probably for burrowing necessities (Gerbillus tarabuli, Meriones crassus, Gerbillus campestris); and the other one characterized by species maximizing shrub cover, presumably related to food availability and predation risk (Meriones shawii and Gerbillus amoenus). Gerbillus gerbillus seems to have a specially distinctive microhabitat selection pattern. Our results at the micro habitat scale highlight the role that floristic composition can play to segregate between rodent species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID BUMBLE BEES; PREFERENCES; COLONIES; HIVE; BEHAVIOR
AB Animals may adjust their behavior according to their perception of risk. Here we show that free-flying honey bee (Apis cerana) foragers mitigate the risk of starvation in the field when foraging on a food source that offers variable rewards by carrying more 'fuel' food on their outward journey. We trained foragers to a feeder located 1.2 km from each of four colonies. On average foragers carried 12.7% greater volume of fuel, equivalent to 30.2% more glucose when foraging on a variable source (a random sequence of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 M sucrose solution, average sucrose content 1.5 M) than when forging on a consistent source (constant 1.5 M sucrose solution). Our findings complement an earlier study that showed that foragers decrease their fuel load as they become more familiar with a foraging place. We suggest that honey bee foragers are risk sensitive, and carry more fuel to minimize the risk of starvation in the field when a foraging trip is perceived as being risky, either because the forager is unfamiliar with the foraging site, or because the forage available at a familiar site offers variable rewards.

   MOSQUITOFISH; FRESH-WATER; GRAVID LIZARDS; SPRINT SPEED; PREDATOR;

AB The cost of reproduction hypothesis suggests that current reproduction has inherent tradeoffs with future reproduction. These tradeoffs can be both in the form of energy allocated to current offspring as opposed to somatic maintenance and future reproduction (allocation costs), or as an increase in mortality as a result of morphological or physiological changes related to reproduction (viability costs). Individuals may be able to decrease viability costs by altering behavior. Female western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis experience a reduction in swimming ability as a consequence of pregnancy. We test for a viability cost of reproduction, and for behavioral compensation in pregnant female G. affinis by measuring survival of females in early and later stages of pregnancy when exposed to predation. Late-stage pregnant females experience a 70% greater probability of mortality compared to early-stage pregnant females. The presence of a refuge roughly doubled the odds of survival of both early and late-stage pregnant females. However, there was no interaction between refuge availability and stage of pregnancy. These data do not provide evidence for behavioral compensation by female G. affinis for elevated viability costs incurred during later stages of pregnancy. Behavioral compensation may be constrained by other aspects of the cost of reproduction.

TI Spatial forcing of pattern-forming systems that lack inversion symmetry
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E

ID FORCED OSCILLATORY SYSTEMS; NONEQUILIBRIUM SYSTEMS; BANDED VEGETATION;
   COMMENSURATE; INSTABILITY
AB The entrainment of periodic patterns to spatially periodic parametric forcing is studied. Using a weak nonlinear analysis of a simple pattern formation modelwe study the resonant responses of one-dimensional systems that lack inversion symmetry. Focusing on the first three n : 1 resonances, in which the system adjusts its wavenumber to one nth of the forcing wavenumber, we delineate commonalities and differences among the resonances. Surprisingly, we find that all resonances show multiplicity of stable phase states, including the 1 : 1 resonance. The phase states in the 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 resonances, however, differ from those in the 1 : 1 resonance in remaining symmetric even when the inversion symmetry is broken. This is because of the existence of a discrete translation symmetry in the forced system. As a consequence, the 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 resonances show stationary phase fronts and patterns, whereas phase fronts within the 1 : 1 resonance are propagating and phase patterns are transients. In addition, we find substantial differences between the 2 : 1 resonance and the other two resonances. While the pattern forming instability in the 2 : 1 resonance is supercritical, in the 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 resonances it is subcritical, and while the inversion asymmetry extends the ranges of resonant solutions in the 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 resonances, it has no effect on the 2 : 1 resonance range. We conclude by discussing a few open questions.

AB Ecosystem modelling studies that consider mesozooplankton feeding regulation have primarily focused on the impact of prey nutritional status and temperature separately, despite experimental evidence for strong links between these two factors. Here, we propose a method based on optimal feeding behaviour of individual mesozooplankton that can be used to derive acclimative food ingestion, assimilation, and respiration under different temperature and food conditions. In the model, animals first evaluate the nutritional value of prey organisms based on their temperature-specific demand for energy and structural biochemical substances. They then regulate their feeding behaviour as well as metabolic physiology in order to satisfy their specific biochemical requirements for maintenance and growth. The approach is applicable to all heterotrophic plankton. In the example presented here the model has been configured to simulate egg production by the calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa. The model realistically reproduces the observed rates for egg production, as well as carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) gross growth efficiencies of egg production by Acartia in response to changes in both algal C:N-ratio and temperature. Results suggest that enhanced temperature accelerates respiratory consumption of the N assimilated by mesozooplankton, and thus decreases the rates for reproduction at higher temperatures. They also show that the optimum temperature for maximum egg production increases with algal C:N-ratio. These findings support and extend conclusions previously obtained for mesozooplankton and indicate that ocean warming could alter the role of Acartia spp. in planktonic food webs.

AB Ecological restoration of degraded ecosystems is now a global priority for addressing, and reconciling, environmental and sustainable development goals. Biocultural, bioregional, and landscape perspectives are vital for this purpose. Those working in restoration ecology, landscape ecology and conservation biology can help design, steer and implement such programs, but their work will only be effective if it is coordinated with ecological economics, law, and ethics. Many other disciplines and professions may be required as well, depending on the specific context. All scientists and professionals on a team must also be able to communicate and collaborate with non-scientists as well, including community leaders, NGOs, policymakers, landowners, and others. This is called transdisciplinarity. Here we discuss results obtained and outstanding challenges in this regard, in four landscape and bioregional scale restoration programs in South Africa, India, the USA, and Brazil. We also call for the establishment of an international network of long-term sites where research and development, capacity-building, workshops, outreach and in situ demonstration of ecological restoration, and the restoration of natural capital and ecosystem services, can all take place.

AB Facing the changes in the agricultural sector as well as new growing demands from society in relation to the European countryside, new questions emerge as to the management of the agricultural landscapes. The multiple combination of production with the support of multiple functions is a challenge for present day management. Tools are needed that make it possible to assess how a certain landscape can support in particular cultural and amenity functions, those that directly depend on the public preferences. The objective of this paper is to describe the proposed Landscape Amenity Model (LAM), a landscape amenities evaluation tool developed within the framework of the Integrated Project SEAMLESS. The LAM is based on the calculation of the Index of Function Suitability (IFS) for a given landscape, based on the distance between that landscape and the preferred landscape, as expressed by different users. The paper goes further in applying IFS namely by examining two different approaches for deriving land cover pattern preferences by users, either gathered from questionnaire surveys or expert panels in two case-studies, one in Portugal and another in France, respectively.

AB Ecosystem dynamics may exhibit alternative stable states induced by positive feedbacks between the state of the system and environmental drivers. Bistable systems are prone to abrupt shifts from one state to another in response to even small and gradual changes in external drivers. These transitions are often catastrophic and difficult to predict by analyzing the mean state of the system. Indicators of the imminent occurrence of phase transitions can serve as important tools to warn ecosystem managers about an imminent transition before the bifurcation point is actually reached. Thus, leading indicators of phase transitions can be used either to prepare for or to prevent the occurrence of a shift to the other state. In recent years, theories of leading indicators of ecosystem shift have been developed and applied to a variety of ecological models and geophysical time series. It is unclear, however, how some of these indicators would perform in the case of systems with a delay. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the investigation of precursors of state shift in the presence of drivers acting with a delay. We discuss how the effectiveness of leading indicators of state shift based on rising variance may be affected by the presence of delays. We apply this framework to an ecological model of desertification in arid grasslands.

AB Although reintroduction has been a widely implemented conservation tool, in many cases it is unclear whether the released animals can successfully establish a viable and self-sustaining population. We constructed a population model for reintroduced Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) and conducted a population viability analysis to evaluate the probability of persistence. We based our study on a reintroduced orangutan population at Bukit Tigapuluh, Jambi, Central Sumatra, Indonesia. We used various scenarios to assess the effects of adaptation time, number of released individuals, duration of release period, variation in infant survival, and carrying capacity on population extinction probability over time. We found that behavioral adaptation of individuals to living in the wild within < 6 yrs after release enhanced population persistence, and that initial losses may be compensated by additional releases. Our analyses indicated that a lack of information about released orangutans prevented accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of reintroduction procedures. Consequently, we recommend that reintroduction projects improve data quality on the fates of released individuals in order to provide a reliable basis for a population viability analysis. The use of population viability analyses would allow proactive management and a better evaluation of reintroduction progress.

AB Previous studies aimed at detecting costs of sexually selected traits have yielded mixed results partly because of variable methods. We present a novel approach: a repeated-measures design to examine individual variation in locomotor performance of male Xiphophorus hellerii as the sexually selected sword develops ontogenetically and to determine whether the growth of a sexually selected trait alters consistency of performance. Individual differences in sprint speed, critical swimming speed (stamina), and relative sword length were statistically repeatable over 9 wk. However, using the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes, the best-fit predictive models for swimming performance did not include sword length or relative sword length. Furthermore, in less supported models and within-week comparisons, there was no statistically significant effect of sword length on performance. These results suggest little effect of the sword on locomotor abilities, which is inconsistent with results from some previous experimental manipulations, possibly because compensatory traits develop ontogenetically in parallel with the sword. However, our results are consistent with correlational studies of natural variation that suggest no locomotor cost of the sword. These results do not necessarily imply a complete lack of a cost to the sword but rather lack of a functional cost for swimming performance.

AB We explore a class of hybrid (piecewise deterministic) systems characterized by a large number of individuals inhabiting an environment whose state is described by a set of continuous variables. We use analytical and numerical methods from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to study the influence that intrinsic noise has on the qualitative behavior of the system. We discuss the application of these concepts to the case of semiarid ecosystems. Using a system-size expansion we calculate the power spectrum of the fluctuations in the system. This predicts the existence of noise-induced oscillations.

AB Mortality and/or dispersal immediately after release can cause translocated populations to fail over both the short and long term, particularly at mainland sanctuaries. However, post-release mortality and dispersal can be limited by releasing individuals with an increased probability of survival and site attachment. We monitored a South Island saddleback (tieke; Philesturnus carunculatus carunculatus) population, translocated to a mainland sanctuary, for one year after release to understand the combined influence of post-release mortality and dispersal on initial establishment. We related settlement propensity to three individual characteristics (sex, age class, and previous pairing history) that are known to play a role in the success of reintroductions of other species. Observations of 38 individually marked birds within the sanctuary declined sharply immediately after release, similar to a pattern of post-release mortality observed after a saddleback translocation onto an offshore island. Thereafter, observations declined more gradually until after the start of the first breeding season (5 months after release), likely due to dispersal out of the sanctuary. By the middle of the first breeding season, significantly more subadults than adults survived and remained at the release site, which we attribute to differences in territorial status prior to translocation. Although only 18% of the released birds survived and settled inside the sanctuary at one year after release, our results suggest that, for saddlebacks, releasing a greater proportion of subadults than adults could have a positive effect on reintroduction outcomes at mainland sites where dispersal is of concern.

AB In this study we examined temporal and geographical variations in a sample of 124 skulls of the weasel Mustela nivalis and 146 skulls of the stoat M erminea, collected in Sweden between 1959-1992 and 1913-1990, respectively.
   We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to combine the effects of latitude, longitude, year of collection, mean ambient temperature and Net Primary Productivity (NPP). The first principal component (PCI) contained latitude, ambient temperature and NPP and was significantly and positively related to male (but not female) skull size of both stoats and weasels. None of the other factors or their interactions were significantly related to skull size.
   We conclude that ambient temperature, either directly through energy savings, or indirectly through improved food availability (increased NPP), had a significant effect on determining body size of male stoats and weasels in Sweden. Our results support the hypothesis that male and female of these species are affected by different selection pressures and thus react differently to changing environmental conditions.

DT Article
ID HATCHING ASYNCHRONY; BROOD SIZE; INCUBATION; SUCCESS; MANIPULATION;
   DEMANDS
AB The breeding system of the Greater Rhea Rhea americana is almost unique among birds as it combines harem polygyny and sequential polyandry, with communal egg-laying and uniparental male care. In this species, large communal clutches (more than 30 eggs) are rare and have a lower hatching success than smaller clutches. Here we analyse the proximate causes of hatching failures and the costs of large communal clutches (and therefore the costs of extensive polygyny) for males and females. We evaluated if length of the nesting period, egg viability, egg losses during incubation and male parental activity at the nest were affected by clutch size. We also evaluated if chicks hatched from large clutches have a lower survival during the first 2 months after hatching. Large clutches had longer nesting period and lower hatching success, mainly as a result of bacterial contamination of the eggs and increased hatching asynchrony. In addition, large clutches tended to lose more eggs as a result of accidental breakage or predation. Male activity at the nest and chick survival were not related to clutch size. Low hatching success, nest predation risk and energetic costs associated with large clutches penalize females that join large harems and males that accept additional eggs into the nest.

AB By use of in situ bottle incubations, we determined three variables for the characterization of plankton community primary productivity in Lake Kinneret, Israel: (1) (H2O)-O-18-based primary productivity ((OP)-O-18), measured by 3402 (180160) evolution; (2) radiocarbon-uptake-based primary productivity ((CP)-C-14); and (3) net O-2 production (NOP), calculated from the rate of O-2: Ar change. Six experiments were conducted in the fall, a period that is characterized by thermocline deepening, erosion of the hypolimnion, and eventual introduction of high concentration of reduced substances into the epilimnion. An additional experiment was conducted in spring. In comparison to net O-2 evolution, the tracer-based methods severely underestimated primary productivity in the fall. This is indicated by unusually high NOP: (OP)-O-18 and NOP: (CP)-C-14 ratios (1-2.2 and 2-4, respectively). The latter is considerably different than the typical values of aquatic environments (similar to 1.4). In contrast to these ratios, the (OP)-O-18: (CP)-C-14 appears normal (1.6-2.9) and not significantly different from previous results in the lake. Ammonium was the major nitrogen source in the fall experiments, and there is no reason to assume that the cellular composition of phytoplankton was exceptional. It is therefore unlikely that the high NOP: (CP)-C-14 ratio represents genuine ratios of oxygen and carbon metabolism. We suggest that an explanation accounting for the high values of both NOP: (OP)-O-18 and NOP: (CP)-C-14 can be slow diffusion of the tracers in and out of phytoplankton cells.

AB With the aid of Ecopath with Ecosim mass-balance model and perturbation by fishing, the existence of alternative attractors in marine ecosystems was explored. The ecosystem was investigated in the form of bottom-up, mixed and top-down control, respectively Furthermore, fishery species were changed from wasp-waist to top predators. Thus, the effect of the trophic level to the existence of the alternative attractors was showed. The results proved that there were indeed alternative attractors in the studied ecosystems, and alternative attractors might be easier to appear from the systems with top-down control. As the fishing trophic level changed, the occurrence frequency of the alternative attractors changed slightly, but the models with alternative attractors changed significantly.

AB The study of land bridge based on continental drift(1)) and long-distance dispersal are gaining increasing attention in biogeography. We review several major dispersal theories including the Malpigiacea route, patterns of chameleon dispersal and the floating island model. The Malpigiaceae route indicates that the Malpigiaceae family originated in northern South America and that members of several clades migrated into North America and subsequently moved via north Atlantic land connections into the Old World starting in the Eocene. This route may also explain many other pantropic disjunction patterns, including some Chinese plants disjunctions, involving South America. Not all biogeographical distribution patterns can be explained by vicariance theory, so more research, including chameleon distribution, has recently focused on long-distance dispersal. The latest analyses suggest that chameleons have dispersed over long-distances from Madagascar on several occasions. The floating island model would explain flora and fauna similarities between South America and Africa. Studying long-distance dispersal mechanisms is important for understanding distribution patterns and even the spread of pandemics. More research on the specific implications of long-distance dispersal for biogeography is necessary.

AB This article develops the cognitive-emotional forager (CEF) model, a novel application of a neural network to dynamical processes in foraging behavior. The CEF is based on a neural network known as the gated dipole, introduced by Grossberg, which is capable of representing short-term affective reactions in a manner similar to Solomon and Corbit's (1974) opponent process theory. The model incorporates a trade-off between approach toward food and avoidance of predation tinder varying levels of motivation induced by hunger. The results of simulations in a simple patch selection paradigm, using a lifetime fitness criterion for comparison, indicate that the CEF model is capable of nearly optimal foraging and outperforms a run-of-luck rule-of-thumb model. Models such as the one presented here can illuminate the underlying cognitive and motivational components of animal decision making.

AB An important aspect of and regions is the spatial heterogeneity resulting from differences among plant communities. There are process differences among different vegetation patches increasing variability in the functioning of the ecosystem. The purpose of this study was to estimate granivory, by studying variation of seed removal rates among patches at the local scale and variation according to seed type. We carried out experiments during four seasons in three plant communities in the Monte Desert, Argentina: 'peladal', mesquite forest and creosotebush. Seed trays were offered to ants, birds and rodents. Two types of commercial seeds (sunflower and millet) were used. We found that seed removal rate was significantly different among plant communities, among taxa (birds, ants and murid rodents), and among seasons, and that removal rate was higher for sunflower. Seed removal rates by murid rodents were higher than by birds or ants, and occasionally as high as those found in other deserts. The heterogeneity of seed removal patterns at the local level was as strong as that found between continents. Further studies may show similar local heterogeneity in other deserts of the world.

AB An active transponder system adapted for animal behaviour studies is described, and the potential of the system to facilitate patch scale monitoring of grazing cows is explored. A preliminary experiment examined the effect of presence and colour of loop aerial wires, on the activity of grazing cattle. Results from brown and white aerials pegged on the surface of the ground were compared with those from aerials buried at a depth of 5 cm. There was no effect of colour or burial of aerial on total number of contacts, or in time duration of cows within patches (P > 0.001). Further experiments were conducted to examine potential sources of variation in the reading range of aerials. Reading range declined with reduction in aerial size and as the height of the transponder above ground level increased. Detection distance from a square aerial varied according to the transponder direction of approach, whereas direction of approach around the circumference of a circular aerial had little affect on detection distance. Reading range was greatest when orientation of the transponder tag to an aerial was vertical compared to horizontal. Implications of the results for studies of grazing activity are discussed and it is concluded that the field based active transponder system used in this experiment offers potential when recording patch level investigative behaviour of grazing animals. However, the effect of variability in reading range of aerials and potential variability in transponder height need to be considered when interpreting results from a field based active transponder system.

AB Long-term observations on coral units and their coral fishes, as well as observations on the growth of colonies of marked corals in the Gulf of Aqaba ( Red Sea), have revealed the relationship between coral dimension and complexity and the ecomorphology and sociobiology of the inhabiting fishes. In this study, coral fishes are identified as species that, following the planktonic interval, settle and remain in a selected coral or its immediate vicinity. Parallel with growth of the refuge, the number of fishes in such a coral-fish association (=ecological cell) increases to a certain asymptote, forming a stable symbiotic entity of fish species, specific in composition and biomass. The initial cell begins with 4-5-year-old branching corals that harbors 3-4 cryptic species of gobies (Paragobiodon and Gobiodon species). This is followed by several stages of coral growth and increase in fish species and biomass, especially of pomacentrids, anthiases, pseudochromids and blennies. The water column or functional space from which the fishes harvest plankton, their main food source, starts at around a 0.2 m(3) column in the young colonies, and ends with a water column of around 500 m(3) in the mature ecological cells of large coral knolls. At the mature stage, large cells harbor up to 100 diurnal and nocturnal species of fish, permanently using this refuge and forming an integrated collective. The territorial limits of the piscivorous groupers (Cephalopholis species) generally establish the dimensions of these ecological cells. Preliminary data on standard energy metabolism of the fishes for mature ecological cells reveal that similar to800 kg food is required each year to maintain this biomass. The biological composition and stability of fish populations of such ecological cells will depend on the biological and physical stability of the host coral population.

Females (N = 114) and males (N = 116) were treated separately. The first principle component (size) accounted for 68.4% of the variation in males, with a significant decrease in PC1 score with increased latitude (P < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.243). In females, the first principle component accounted for 71.9% of the variation, with a significant decrease in PC1 score with increased latitude (P < 0.0001, R-2 = 0.306). There was no significant variation in PC1 with longitude (P = 0.388).

AB This study deals with preference of different seed particles of a novel type of foods by ants of the species Messor arenarius (Fabricius). Given choices between different wheat seed particles at the same distances from the nest, the first time wheat was offered to M. arenarius they reacted as follows: They preferred halves of wheat seeds cut longitudinally most significantly over whole-wheat seeds. Three-quartered of wheat seeds were preferred significantly over one-quartered wheat seeds. There was no preference in the choice between whole-wheat seeds and halves of wheat seeds cut transversely. From the second day and up to the fourth day when these choices were offered, the ants showed no preference in choice between whole-wheat seeds and halves of wheat seeds cut longitudinally. The preferences in the other choices were about the same as the first time that wheat was offered to the ants. The average returning time of ants to the nest with a whole-wheat seed did not differ significantly from that with a half seed cut longitudinally. From these findings, it seems that the first time wheat is offered to the ants, both the odor and the relative length of the the food item are preference criteria used by the ants in their food choice.

ID SMALL-EARED SHREW; BODY SIZE; SORICIDAE; ISRAEL
AB A recent review of small-eared shrews, genus Cryptotis (Mammalia: Insectivora: Soricidae), in the collection of the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, revealed a previously unidentified specimen of Cryptotis merriami Choate from the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve. This specimen is only the second record of C. merriami from Costa Rice, it represents the southernmost record for the species, and it documents the first case of syntopy between C. merriami and Cryptotis nigrescens (Allen). The co-occurence of C. merriami and C. nigrescens provides conclusive support for the hypothesis they are distinct species within the C. nigrescens-group (sensu Woodman and Timm, 1993). The soricid community at Monteverde is comprised of three species in three evenly-spaced size classes: the numerically-dominant C. nigrescens, C. merriami, and an undescribed, endemic species the size of typical C. merriami. Morphometrical analysis indicated that C. merriami exhibits no apparent geographic trends in size throughout most of its range, yet the Monteverde specimen is significantly larger than all other C. merriami. Its large size at Monteverde apparently represents character displacement in response to the presence of a more abundant sister species, C, nigrescens; the presence of a second, unrelated shrew the size of more typical C. merriami; or interactions with both.

AB The seasonal changes in the dynamics and life histories of the Cladocera in Lake Mangakaware, North Island, New Zealand, were studied over 19 months by sampling at weekly or 2-weekly intervals. Lake Mangakaware is a 13.3 ha polymictic lake with high nutrient status, low Secchi disc transparencies, and an unstable thermal regime. The four planktonic cladoceran species (Bosmina longirostris, B. meridionalis, Ceriodaphnia pulchella, and C. dubia) exhibited disjunct population maxima. Only B. longirostris was perennially present. All species exhibited low fecundities and low lipid content, indicating that food resources were limited and that competitive interactions and resistance to starvation were probably important in determining species success. Increases in body size in cooler seasons were unrelated to clutch size, giving further support for the view that available food was limited. These results are consistent with previous experimental findings that subtle differences in life history can determine seasonal success and the outcome of competition between similar species.

TI Persistence of tropical forage grasses in shaded environments
SO JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID HERBIVORY; NITROGEN
AB The sowing of improved tropical forages in tree plantations can increase animal productivity considerably, but planted grasses often fail to persist under grazing, resulting in unstable pastures. An experiment was conducted in Brisbane, Australia during the summer of 1989/90 to investigate whether the failure of tropical grasses to persist in shade when regularly defoliated is related to their growth habit. Two shade-tolerant grasses of contrasting growth habit (prostrate Paspalum wettsteinii v. erect Paspalum malacophyllum) were grown in simulated swards at light levels of 100, 50 and 20% of full sunlight and defoliated every 2 or 4 weeks. Shading and frequent cutting reduced total dry matter yield equally in the two grasses. Shading also reduced tiller density. Paspalum wettsteinii persisted poorly under frequent (2-weekly) defoliation in shade. Plant survival rate of this grass was 66% in the 2-weekly defoliation-20% light transmission treatment, compared with 94% in P. malacophyllum. The poor survival of P. wettsteinii was related to its high allocation of total yield to roots, low tiller density and low total nonstructural carbohydrate yield in residual biomass after defoliation. The inability of P. wettsteinii to adjust in shade to frequent defoliation led to a continual decline in photosynthetic area and light interception, resulting in the depletion of energy reserves, increased susceptibility to Rhizoctonia fungal infection and ultimately to death. It was concluded that growth habit per se cannot be used as a simple indicator for selecting tropical grasses for shaded environments. Instead, morphophysiological adaptation to defoliation in shade was critical for plant persistence.

AB The scope of this study was to analyse the levels of various xenobiotics in animals, wild and domestic, of the Acre Valley in the north of Israel, the most polluted and dense urbanised part of the country. The focus was placed upon the bioaccumulation of heavy metals, such as Pb, Hg, Cu, Zn, Al, Fe, as well as other elements and PCBs. Analysis was also performed on levels of cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase in birds and man influenced by insecticides in the same region. For this study we used X-ray scanning electron microscopic (S.E.M.) electron probe, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, gas chromatography for PCBs and biochemical methods specific for enzymes. We studied four species of littoral molluscs, four species of birds and five species of mammals including dogs and cats. The results showed very high levels of metals and PCBs and enzyme deviations in birds and man around the sprayed cotton fields, as compared to man from the close to towns. All the collected data will serve as an Environmental Health Profile for immediate and future consideration.

AB The Red List of Threatened Species, published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), is a crucial tool for conservation decision-making. However, despite substantial effort, numerous species remain unassessed or have insufficient data available to be assigned a Red List extinction risk category. Moreover, the Red Listing process is subject to various sources of uncertainty and bias. The development of robust automated assessment methods could serve as an efficient and highly useful tool to accelerate the assessment process and offer provisional assessments. Here, we aimed to (1) present a machine learning-based automated extinction risk assessment method that can be used on less known species; (2) offer provisional assessments for all reptiles-the only major tetrapod group without a comprehensive Red List assessment; and (3) evaluate potential effects of human decision biases on the outcome of assessments. We use the method presented here to assess 4,369 reptile species that are currently unassessed or classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN. The models used in our predictions were 90% accurate in classifying species as threatened/nonthreatened, and 84% accurate in predicting specific extinction risk categories. Unassessed and Data Deficient reptiles were considerably more likely to be threatened than assessed species, adding to mounting evidence that these species warrant more conservation attention. The overall proportion of threatened species greatly increased when we included our provisional assessments. Assessor identities strongly affected prediction outcomes, suggesting that assessor effects need to be carefully considered in extinction risk assessments. Regions and taxa we identified as likely to be more threatened should be given increased attention in new assessments and conservation planning. Lastly, the method we present here can be easily implemented to help bridge the assessment gap for other less known taxa.

AB Aim The island species-area relationship (ISAR) quantifies how the number of species increases as the area of an island or island-like habitat gets larger and is one of the most general patterns in ecology. However, studies that measure the ISAR often confound variation in sampling methodology and analyses, precluding appropriate syntheses of its underlying mechanisms. Most ISAR studies use only presence-absence data at the whole-island scale, whereas we planned to use a framework that applies individual-based rarefaction to synthesize whether and how the ISAR differs from the null expectation of the passive sampling hypothesis. Location Five hundred and five islands from 34 different archipelagos across the world, including oceanic islands, lake islands and forest islands. Major taxa studied Local assemblages of plants, invertebrates, herpetofauna, birds and mammals. Methods We collated local-scale species abundance data from multiple archipelagos (median of 12 islands per study) and used a rarefaction-based approach to synthesize the relationship between island size and (1) sample effort-controlled rarefied species richness, or (2) an effective number of species derived from the probability of interspecific encounter (an index of community evenness). Results When we applied rarefaction to control for sampling effort, the numbers of species and their relative abundances across all studies differed from the passive sampling hypothesis. Our measure of evenness also increased with island size, suggesting that the disproportionate effects we observed influenced both rarer and more common species. We found few associations between the slope of this effect and island type or taxon, but we did find that island archipelagos with greater elevational heterogeneity also deviated more from the null expectation than those with less heterogeneity. Main conclusions Using a synthetic approach across island archipelagos, we reject the null expectation that passive sampling causes the ISAR and instead suggest that ecological mechanisms leading to disproportionate (non-random) effects on larger relative to smaller islands are predominant.

AB Motivation The understanding of physiological adaptations, of evolutionary radiations and of ecological responses to global change urges for global, comprehensive databases of the functional traits of extant organisms. The ability to maintain an adequate water balance is a critical functional property influencing the resilience of animal species to climate variation. In terrestrial or semi-terrestrial organisms, total water loss includes a significant contribution from evaporative water loss (EWL). The analysis of geographic and phylogenetic variation in EWL rates must however account for differences in methods and potential confounding factors, which influence standard measures of whole-organism water loss. We compiled the global and standardized SquamEWL database of total, respiratory and cutaneous EWL for 325 species and subspecies of squamate reptiles (793 samples and 2,536 estimates) from across the globe. An extensive set of companion data and annotations associated with the EWL measurements of potential value for future investigation, including metabolic rate data, is provided. We present preliminary descriptive statistics for the compiled data, discuss gaps and biases, and identify promising avenues to update, expand and explore this database. Main types of variables contained Standard water loss rates, geographic data, metabolic rates. Spatial location Global. Time period Data were obtained from extant species and were collected between 1945 and 2020. Major taxa Reptilia, Squamata including lizards, snakes and amphisbaenians. Level of measurements Individual samples of animals from the same species, locality, age class and sex category. Software format csv.

AB Parasitic worms (i.e., helminths) commonly infect multiple hosts in succession. With every transmission step, they risk not infecting the next host and thus dying before reproducing. Given this risk, what are the benefits of complex life cycles? Using a dataset for 973 species of trophically transmitted acanthocephalans, cestodes, and nematodes, we tested whether hosts at the start of a life cycle increase transmission and whether hosts at the end of a life cycle enable growth to larger, more fecund sizes. Helminths with longer life cycles, that is, more successive hosts, infected conspicuously smaller first hosts, slightly larger final hosts, and exploited trophic links with lower predator-prey mass ratios. Smaller first hosts likely facilitate transmission because of their higher abundance and because parasite propagules were the size of their normal food. Bigger definitive hosts likely increase fecundity because parasites grew larger in big hosts, particularly endotherms. Helminths with long life cycles attained larger adult sizes through later maturation, not faster growth. Our results indicate that complex helminth life cycles are ubiquitous because growth and reproduction are highest in large, endothermic hosts that are typically only accessible via small intermediate hosts, that is, the best hosts for growth and transmission are not the same.

AB Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses using two mitochondrial (16S and cyt b) and two nuclear (CMOS and RAG1) genes and 103 specimens recovered the first phylogenies of all 23 extant species of Goniurosaurus. The analyses strongly supported the recognition of four monophyletic species groups with identical inter-specific relationships within the kuroiwae, lichtenfelderi, and yingdeensis groups but discordant topologies at some nodes within the luii group. Both analyses recovered a polyphyletic G. luii with respect to G. kadoorieorum, and owing to the lack of diagnostic characters in the latter, it is considered a junior synonym of G. luii. A stochastic character mapping analysis of karst versus non-karst habitat preference suggested that karstic landscapes may have played a major role in the evolution and diversification of Goniurosaurus. A karst habitat preference is marginally supported as the most probable ancestral condition for Goniurosaurus as well as for the kuroiwae, luii, and yingdeensis groups. However, a nonkarst habitat preference is marginally supported as the most probable ancestral condition for the lichtenfelderi group. Multivariate and univariate ecomorphological analyses of the karst-adapted G. catbaensis, G. huuliensis, and G. luii of the luii group and the granite-stream-adapted G. lichtenfelderi of the lichtenfelderi group demonstrated that their markedly statistically different body shapes may be an adaptive response that contributes to habitat partitioning in areas of northern Vietnam where they are nearly sympatric.

AB Amniotic eggs are multifunctional structures that enabled early tetrapods to colonize the land millions of years ago, and are now the reproductive mode of over 70% of all terrestrial amniotes. Eggshell morphology is at the core of animal survival, mediating the interactions between embryos and their environment, and has evolved into a massive diversity of forms and functions in modern reptiles. These functions are critical to embryonic survival and may serve as models for new antimicrobial and/or breathable membranes. However, we still lack critical data on the basic structural and functional properties of eggs, particularly of reptiles. Here, we first characterized egg shape, shell thickness, porosity, and mineralization of eggs from 91 reptile species using optical images, scanning electron microscopy, and micro computed tomography, and collected data on nesting ecology from the literature. We then used comparative analyses to test hypotheses on the selective pressures driving their evolution. We hypothesized that eggshell morphology has evolved to protect shells from physical damage and desiccation, and, in support, found a positive relationship between thickness and precipitation, and a negative relationship between porosity and temperature. Although mineralization varied extensively, it was not correlated with nesting ecology variables. Ancestral state reconstructions show thinning and increased porosity over evolutionary time in squamates, but the opposite in turtles and crocodilians. Egg shape, size, porosity and calcification were correlated, suggesting potential structural or developmental tradeoffs. This study provides new data and insights into the morphology and evolution of reptile eggs, and raises numerous questions for additional research.

AB Aim Bergmann's rule is an ecogeographical rule that describes a negative relationship between body size and temperature. Here, we used a multivariate measure of skull size (centroid size) as a proxy for body size to test the influence of temperature, precipitation, elevation, human influence and competition on size in Dicotyles tajacu and Tayassu pecari.
   Location American tropics and sub-tropics.
   Taxon Tayassuidae.
   Methods Using geometric morphometric methods, we measured 426 adult skulls of both peccary species from 174 different localities south of the equator and 83 in the north. We explored the effects of temperature, precipitation, altitude and human influence, controlling for spatial autocorrelation, using ordinary least squares models and the Akaike information criterion. Size differences where the species occur allopatrically or sympatrically, where competition could be a factor, were investigated using ANCOVA models.
   Results We found that peccaries were larger in the tropics. Temperature and precipitation explained the size variation of both peccaries in the southern hemisphere, whereas human influence is a predictor of size only for T. pecari. Size variation of northern D. tajacu is mainly explained by elevation and temperature. Tayassu pecari is consistently larger than D. tajacu in both hemispheres. Peccaries did not exhibit significant shifts in either rate of change in size or size-latitude relationships between allopatric and sympatric areas.
   Main conclusions Geographical variation in size of these peccaries does not support Bergmann's rule. In the tropics, precipitation and human influence appear to exert strong selective pressures on body size of peccaries, whose resource utilization patterns are shaped by group living. Size differences of the two species across the continents may contribute to their stable coexistence via interference rather than exploitative competition.

AB Granite and/or gneiss inselbergs are excellent examples of geomorphologically stable island habitats, considered as old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs). However, unlike oceanic islands, their underlying drivers of diversity patterns remain to be investigated. Here, we studied 24 inselbergs in south-eastern Brazil, aiming to understand the role of landscape variables and environmental conditions in the assembly of the characteristic extremophilic mat vegetation communities. We found that beta diversity was largely explained by climatic variables, whereas species richness did not vary among inselbergs. Classic determinants of the diversity of island communities do not generally seem to apply to these plant assemblages. Overall, these communities change along a coast-to-inland gradient that captures increased seasonality with a replacement of more hydrophilic taxa by more drought-tolerant taxa. Changes in species composition in space involved strong species replacement, with several widespread genera locally represented on distinct inselbergs by different narrowly distributed species. Despite the deterministic sorting of taxa based on climatic conditions, a substantial fraction of the beta diversity remained unexplained. This underlines the importance of historical processes, which are easier to notice in stable OCBIL regions, such as range expansion, local extinction, dispersal constraints and allopatric speciation.

AB Y Spontaneous hybridization in ex situ conservation facilities could potentially contaminate endangered plant species destined for the reintroduction into the wild. Despite the general recognition of the importance of such danger, studies exploring the consequences of hybridization including subsequent performance of the hybrids in comparison to the original species are rare. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential consequences of hybridization between the endangered endemic serpentinophyte species, Minuartia smejkalii, and its congener allopatric species, M. caespitosa. We performed controlled inter-specific crosses and compared seed production, germination, growth, seed morphology and dispersal ability between M. smejkalii and the hybrids. Our results showed that M. smejkalii and M. caespitosa can hybridize and produce viable seeds. Number of seeds per capsule produced by M. smejkalii and the hybrids did not differ but germination rates were higher in the hybrids. In addition, hybrids produced a higher number of flowers than M. smejkalii in open sites and serpentine soils, indicating that the hybrids perform better in the extreme serpentine conditions than the original serpentine species. Our simulation results showed a higher dispersal potential in hybrids compared to M. smejkalii despite their higher terminal velocity. Our results provide evidence that hybrid individuals from ex situ collections might outcompete the endemic M. smejkalii in the wild, if they are introduced by mistake. Therefore, for conservation and reintroduction purposes, ex situ hybridization events should be considered as a potential threat and treated carefully. We recommend establishing an adequate management of potentially crossable species and cautiously selecting individuals to be used for restoration.

AB Geckos are a hyper-diverse, ancient, and globally distributed group. They have diverged early from other squamates and thus can be expected to differ from them along multiple ecological, life history, and biogeographic axes. I review a wide range of gecko traits, comparing them to those of other lizard taxa, to identify the unique, and unifying, attributes of geckos among lizards, based on comprehensive databases of lizard distributions and biological attributes. Few traits completely separate geckos from other lizard taxa, yet they differ to a large degree along many axes: they are more restricted to low latitudes and altitudes, are especially diverse on islands, but relatively scarce in America. They are small lizards, that lay small, fixed clutch sizes, for which they compensate only partially by laying frequently. Because they mature at relatively similar ages and have similar lifespans to other lizards, geckos produce fewer offspring over a year, and over their lifetimes, perhaps implying that they enjoy higher survival rates. While being the only large lizard Glade of predominantly nocturnal lizards a large proportion of species is active by day. Gecko body temperatures and preferred temperatures are lower than those of other lizards -even when they are compared to lizards with similar activity times. Worryingly, most geckos have small ranges that often reside completely outside of protected areas - much more frequently than in other reptile and vertebrate taxa.

AB Plant facilitation has a pivotal role in regulating species coexistence, particularly under arid environments. The present study aimed to evaluate the facilitative effect ofCalligonum polygonoidesL. on its understory plants in coastal habitat. FortyCalligonumshrubs were investigated and the environmental data (soil temperature, moisture, pH, salinity, carbon and nitrogen content, and light intensity), vegetation composition, and diversity of associated species were recorded under- and outside canopies. Eight of the most frequent understory species were selected for evaluating their response to the facilitative effect ofC. polygonoides. Bioactive ingredients ofCalligonumroots were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and mycorrhizal biodiversity in their rhizosphere soil was also assessed. The effect ofCalligonumon understory plants ranged between facilitation and inhibition in an age-dependent manner. Old shrubs facilitated 18 and inhibited 18 associated species, while young shrubs facilitated 13 and inhibited 9 species.Calligonumameliorated solar radiation and high-temperature stresses for the under canopy plants. Moreover, soil moisture was increased by 509.52% and 85.71%, while salinity was reduced by 47.62% and 23.81% under old and young shrubs, respectively. Soil contents of C and N were increased under canopy. This change in the microenvironment led to photosynthetic pigments induction in the majority of understory species. However, anthocyanin, proline contents, and antioxidant enzyme activities were reduced in plants under canopy. Thirteen mycorrhizal fungal species were identified in the rhizospheric soil ofCalligonumwith the predominance ofFunneliformis mosseae. Thirty-one compounds were identified inCalligonumroot extract in which pyrogallol and palmitic acid, which have antimicrobial and allelopathic activities, were the major components. The obtained results demonstrated that facilitation provided byCalligonumis mediated with multiple mechanisms and included a set of interrelated scenarios that took place in a species-specific manner.

AB Conservation translocations - the intentional movement of individuals from one area to another for conservation purposes - provide a potential response to climate change, but can be costly and risky. To help improve translocation outcomes and assess their feasibility as a climate adaptation tool, we analyzed past conservation translocations (176 bird species at 680 sites globally) as a proxy for future efforts. To determine predictors of annual survival of released birds, we used generalized linear mixed models. Species with larger bodies and relative brain size had higher survival. Survival was also higher in protected areas, with subsequent releases at a site, for more recent years, and where the initial cause of decline was removed (n = 435 releases). Of particular relevance to climate-motivated translocations, longer distance translocations decreased survival; there was no evidence that greater climate differences between source and release sites (n = 117 releases), or releases beyond the indigenous range ("managed relocation", n = 435 releases), reduced survival. We also assessed how reproduction varied with release rates (birds/year) and species' generation lengths. Species with long generation lengths released at high rates had similar reproductive success to species with short generation lengths released at low rates. These findings can improve conservation translocation decisions by informing expected outcomes for target species, and identifying site features and management practices that maximize the likelihood of success. We also provide an empirical assessment of potential challenges of using conservation translocations in response to climate change, including evidence that longer distance translocations may be less feasible than shorter distance translocations.

AB A lack of understanding exists regarding how freshwater species will respond to increases in temperature associated with ongoing changes in climate. Non-urban to urban thermal gradients generated by urban heat islands can serve as models to characterize the effects of relatively consistent increases in temperature on freshwater ecosystems over several decades. This study investigates the apparent responses of two freshwater fish species, Campostoma anomalum (Central Stoneroller) and Lepomis macrochirus (Bluegill), to directional changes in temperature over the past century across the non-urban to urban gradient in the Saint Louis, Missouri region in the central United States. Differences in air temperature across this gradient have increased by approximately 3 degrees C since 1920. Critical thermal maximum (CTMax) assays were conducted on individuals from fish populations across this gradient from either streams (C. anomalum) or ponds (L. macrochirus) to assess whether thermal tolerance is associated with water temperature among sites. According to expectations based on the effect of an urban heat island, maximum water temperature at stream sites was positively correlated with percent urban landcover around the sites. Moreover, CTMax among populations of C. anomalum was positively correlated with maximum water temperature at each site, suggesting that this species has likely responded to increases in temperature over the past several decades. There was no relationship between percent urban landcover and maximum water temperature in the pond systems. There was also no relationship between CTMax and maximum water temperature among L. macrochirus populations. The pond systems and populations of L. macrochirus are highly managed, which may limit local physical and biological responses to increases in air temperature. Results suggest that freshwater habitats in urban environments and the species inhabiting these areas are responding differently to recent increases in air temperature, highlighting the complexity of the physical and biological components of these systems.

AB Aim Ecological theory is not often applied to human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP), which estimates reduction of natural net primary production (NPP) due to harvest and land use. Here we use predator-prey theory to evaluate HANPP as "predation". Macroecology and adaptive life history strategies also help evaluate relationships among global terrestrial HANPP, NPP, and plant biomass (B).
   Location Lands worldwide.
   Time period 2000.
   Major taxa studied Terrestrial plants.
   Methods HANPP and potential NPP allometric scaling were estimated for terrestrial ecoregions (N = 819, for 86% of global land surface area) in the year 2000. HANPP and NPP scaling were compared and projected to current and year 2050 conditions. NPP scaling for potential versus actual conditions were also compared, as were biomass turnover rates (T; per year).
   Results Global HANPP scales predictably with B; consistent with predator-prey theory, HANPP scaling is not clearly satiated at greater B. NPP scaling supports adaptive life history strategies theory. HANPP scaling is c. 16% of NPP scaling; a conservative estimate compared to a grid-based 22%. HANPP scaling could become 25-35% of potential NPP scaling by 2050 due to population growth, or be constrained to 20-26% of potential NPP scaling if resource use efficiency improves. However, B is more sensitive than NPP to human effects, and human population size and HANPP now dominate as predictors of T.
   Main conclusions Three ecological theories converged here to broadly support prior empirical estimates and enable novel insights. B and T are more sensitive to global human impacts than is NPP and should be priorities for carbon budgets and conservation. Human population growth and resource use efficiency strongly affect terrestrial plant HANPP, B and T, and thus global carbon budget. Both human "top-down" effects (evaluated here) and "bottom-up" drivers (e.g., climate, nutrients, CO2) need to be incorporated into global carbon models.

AB Aotearoa-New Zealand (NZ) is internationally renowned for picturesque landscapes and agricultural products. Agricultural intensification has been economically beneficial to NZ but has implications for its clean green image. Contaminated waterways, high carbon emissions, and extensive soil erosion demonstrate the downside of high stocking rates and land clearing. Transformative farming systems are required to address the challenge of balancing production with the environment. Whilst navigating through the process of change, farmers need to be supported to make informed decisions at the farm and landscape scale. Landscape ecology (LE) is ideally positioned to inform the development of future farming landscapes and provide a scientific context to the criteria against which land-related information can be evaluated. However, to do this effectively, LE needs to demonstrate that it can link theory with practice. Using NZ as a case example, this paper discusses the key roles for LE in future farming systems. It looks at the way LE can help quantify the state of the landscape, provide support towards the co-creation of alternative futures, and assist with the inclusion of land-related information into design and planning to ensure mitigation and adaption responses assist in the transformation of farming systems for sustainable outcomes.

AB Plant-soil feedback is recognized as a causal mechanism for the emergence of vegetation patterns of the same species especially when water is not a limiting resource (e.g. humid environments) (Carteni et al. in J Theor Biol 313:153-161,2012. 10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.08.008; Marasco et al. in Bull Math Biol 76(11):2866-2883, 2014. 10.1007/s11538-014-0036-6). Nevertheless, in the field, plants rarely grow in monoculture but compete with other plant species. In these cases, plant-soil feedback was shown to play a key role in plant-species coexistence (Mazzoleni et al. in Ecol Model 221(23):2784-2792,2010. 10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2010.08.007). Using a mathematical model consisting of four PDEs, we investigate mechanisms of inter- and intra-specific plant-soil feedback on the coexistence of two competing plant species. In particular, the model takes into account both negative and positive feedback influencing the growth of the same and the other plant species. Both the coexistence of the plant species and the dominance of a particular plant species is examined with respect to all model parameters together with the emergence of spatio-temporal vegetation patterns.

AB In order to understand how organisms cope with ongoing changes in environmental variability, it is necessary to consider multiple adaptations to environmental uncertainty on different time scales. Conservative bet-hedging (CBH) represents a long-term genotype-level strategy maximizing lineage geometric mean fitness in stochastic environments by decreasing individual fitness variance, despite also lowering arithmetic mean fitness. Meanwhile, variance-prone (aka risk-prone) strategies produce greater variance in short-term payoffs, because this increases expected arithmetic mean fitness if the relationship between payoffs and fitness is accelerating. Using evolutionary simulation models, we investigate whether selection for such variance-prone strategies is counteracted by selection for bet-hedging that works to adaptively reduce fitness variance. In our model, variance proneness evolves in fine-grained environments (lower correlations among individuals in energetic state and/or payoffs), and with larger numbers of independent decision events over which resources accumulate prior to selection. Conversely, multiplicative fitness accumulation, caused by coarser environmental grain and fewer decision events selection, favours CBH via greater variance aversion. We discuss examples of variance-sensitive strategies in optimal foraging, migration, life histories and cooperative breeding using this bet-hedging perspective. By linking disparate fields of research studying adaptations to variable environments, we should be better able to understand effects of human-induced rapid environmental change.

AB The Grazing Ecosystem is a special case of predator-prey systems, which has attracted widespread attention since a long time ago. Because of the ubiquity of noise, there is a growing need to research the influences of noise on the Grazing Ecosystem. This paper is devoted to investigating the transition behaviors of the high vegetation biomass in the Grazing Ecosystem subjected to Gaussian noise and Levy noise, respectively. Firstly, the original system is translated into the Ito stochastic differential equation, which is utilized to derive the analytical expression of the escape probability through the Dirichlet boundary value problems. Then the transitions between the two vegetation potential wells are explored by calculating the size of the stochastic basin of attraction based on the escape probability. The comparison between the analytical results and the ones through Monte Carlo simulations shows that the proposed method works very well. It turns out that the Gaussian white noise intensity, Levy noise stability parameter and herbivore density have different impact mechanisms on the basin stability of high density vegetation in the stochastic Grazing Ecosystem.

AB Carrying capacity is a fundamental concept in rangeland science and management; however, it is difficult to define, not least because it can be viewed from varied perspectives. With a view to facilitating debate, six perspectives (or definitions) of carrying capacity were formulated, representing: resource productivity; animal production; the system; animal welfare; the environment; and profit. To explore their implications semi quantitatively, Noy-Meir's simple, two-function model of a grazing system was used to simulate the annual herbage production cycle, during which a specified animal population density would be present year-round, except during an early-season grazing deferment of specified duration. The model was extended to calculate a metric for each definition of carrying capacity and then implemented for various combinations of the two key grazing-management-determined parameters: animal density and deferment duration. The metrics were mapped as a series of response surfaces. In general, grazing deferment at the start of the growth season can compensate for an increase in animal density. In other words, carrying capacity is, for most definitions, a contour line on a response surface; it divides the total space into "acceptable" and "unacceptable" regions of grazing-management practice. The contour lines that characterize the various carrying-capacity definitions can then be superimposed to examine the degree of overlap between "acceptable" regions. Two common rules-of-thumb for determining carrying capacity are examined by using this approach. The term "carrying capacity" is vague because it can address various concerns, but some of the most important concerns can be defined in reasonably precise terms and translated into quantitative metrics, based on the fundamental states and rates of a grazing system. Such an approach could facilitate dialogue among those concerned with the continuous refinement of carrying-capacity recommendations.

AB Integrodifference equations (IDEs) are used in ecology to model the growth and spatial spread of populations. With IDEs, dispersal is specified with a probability density function, called the dispersal kernel, and the shape of the kernel influences how rapidly invasions progress. In this paper, we apply tail additivity, a property of regularly varying probability densities, to model invasions with fat-tailed (power-law decay) dispersal in one dimension. We show that fat-tailed invasions progress geometrically fast, with the rate of spread depending on the degree of fatness of the tails. Our analyses apply to populations with no Allee effect as well as weak Allee effects, and we conduct simulations to show that fat-tailed invasions with weak Allee effects produce accelerating invasions. We analyze point-release and front-release invasions, corresponding to newly-established and well-established populations, and we find that front-release invasions gain a permanent speed-up over point-release invasions, invading at a faster geometric rate that persists for all time. Since accelerating invasions are qualitatively different than constant-speed invasions, we also discuss how measures of invasion must be modified and reconsidered when invasions accelerate.

AB This article analyzes the process of forest cover depletion over the last 40 years at three landscapes distributed along the Amazon floodplain. To this end, we created multi-temporal forest cover maps based on time series of Landsat images, and then analyzed the forest cover dynamics through landscape metrics. Based on landscape analyzes and bibliographic information, we assessed the degree of forest depletion of each landscape and made inferences regarding the main drives of forest changes and their impacts on ecosystem integrity. Results show the existence of an east-to-west gradient of forest depletion that varies in time and space along the floodplain of the SolimOes/Amazonas River, and provides evidence that it is a response to the history of human occupation and public policies. The most degraded landscapes are located on the eastern region, where forest depletion degree indicates substantial damage to biodiversity and ecosystem services. The study increases the scarce knowledge about the dynamics of the floodplain forest over the last decades, allows a deeper understanding of the human influence on the floodplain ecosystem, and supports further studies on the impacts of forest loss and fragmentation on biodiversity, ecosystem services and human well-being in the Amazon floodplain.

TI Localized Radial Roll Patterns in Higher Space Dimensions
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Swift-Hohenberg equation; singular perturbation; localized pattern;
   snaking bifurcation
AB Localized roll patterns are structures that exhibit a spatially periodic profile in their center. When following such patterns in a system parameter in one space dimension, the length of the spatial interval over which these patterns resemble a periodic profile stays either bounded, in which case branches form closed bounded curves ("isolas"), or the length increases to infinity so that branches are unbounded in function space ("snaking"). In two space dimensions, numerical computations show that branches of localized rolls exhibit a more complicated structure in which both isolas and snaking occur. In this paper, we analyze the structure of branches of localized radial roll solutions in dimension 1+epsilon, with 0 < epsilon << 1, through a perturbation analysis. Our analysis sheds light on some of the features visible in the planar case.

AB The effects of ecosystem degradation are pervasive worldwide and increasingly concerning under the present context of global changes in climate and land use. Theoretical studies and empirical evidence increasingly suggest that drylands are particularly prone to develop nonlinear functional changes in response to climate variations and human disturbance. Precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) represents the ratio of vegetation production to precipitation and provides a tool for evaluating human and climate impacts on landscape functionality. Holm oak (Quercus ilex) woodlands are one of the most conspicuous dry forest ecosystems in the western Mediterranean basin and present a variety of degraded states, due to their long history of human use. We studied the response of Iberian holm oak woodlands to human disturbance along an aridity gradient (that is, semi-arid, dry-transition and sub-humid conditions) using PUE estimations from enhanced vegetation index (EVI) observations of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Our results indicated that PUE decreased linearly with disturbance intensity in sub-humid holm oak woodlands, but showed accelerated, nonlinear reductions with increased disturbance intensity in semi-arid and dry-transition holm oak sites. The impact of disturbance on PUE was larger for dry years than for wet years, and these differences increased with aridity from sub-humid to dry-transition and semi-arid holm oak woodlands. Therefore, aridity may also interact with ecosystem degradation in holm oak woodlands by reducing the landscape ability to buffer large changes in vegetation production caused by climate variability.

   on Posidonia oceanica leaves

ID MARINE CYANOBACTERIA; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; HOT-SPRINGS; DIVERSITY
AB Cyanobacteria contribute to the ecology of various marine environments, also for their symbioses, since some of them are common hosts of sponges and ascidians. They are also emerging as an important source of novel bioactive secondary metabolites in pharmacological (as anticancer drugs) and biotechnological applications. In the present work we isolated a cyanobacteria in a free-living state from leaves of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica leaves. This newly collected strain was then cultivated under two laboratory conditions, and then characterized by combining morphological observation and molecular studies based on 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis. The strain showed 99% pairwise sequence identity with Halomicronema metazoicum ITAC101, never isolated before as a free-living organisms, but firstly described as an endosymbiont of the Mediterranean marine spongae Petrosia ficiformis, under the form of a filamentous strain. Further studies will investigate the actual role of this cyanobacterium in the leaf stratum of P. oceanica leaves, given its demonstrated ability to influence the vitality and the life cycle of other organisms. In fact, its newly demonstrated free-living stage, described in this study, indicate that Phormidium-like cyanobacteria could play important roles in the ecology of benthic and planktonic communities.

AB Animal behaviors can often be challenging to model and predict, though optimality theory has improved our ability to do so. While many qualitative predictions of behavior exist, accurate quantitative models, tested by empirical data, are often lacking. This is likely due to variation in biases across individuals and variation in the way new information is gathered and used. We propose a modeling framework based on a novel interpretation of Bayes's theorem to integrate optimization of energetic constraints with both prior biases and specific sources of new information gathered by individuals. We present methods for inferring distributions of prior biases within populations rather than assuming known priors, as is common in Bayesian approaches to modeling behavior, and for evaluating the goodness of fit of overall model descriptions. We apply this framework to predict optimal escape during predator-prey encounters, based on prior biases and variation in what information prey use. Using this approach, we collected and analyzed data characterizing white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) escape behavior in response to human approaches. We found that distance to predator alone was not sufficient to predict deer flight response and show that the inclusion of additional information is necessary. We also compared differences in the inferred distributions of prior biases across different populations and discuss the possible role of human activity in influencing these distributions.

AB A new ichnogenus and ichnospecies, Spirolites radwanskii, is a spiral boring recognized in large limestone clasts deposited in a Miocene cliff-foot ramp. It is characterized by a semi-circular or inverted Omega-shaped cross section, gradually increasing width, gradual entrenching in the rock from the narrower side, consistent coiling direction, steep margin from the wider side, two-order annuli, and occasional truncation of the narrower side by the wider part. It is interpreted as a boring of vermetid gastropods, similar to the recent Dendropoma. Spirolites co-occurs with the bivalve borings Gastrochaenolites, mostly G. torpedo, sponge borings Entobia, and the spionid polychaete boring Caulostrepsis, which are typical of the Entobia ichnofacies. Spirolites was produced in very shallow, clean and warm sea waters.

AB ObjectivesTo infer the ecogeographic conditions that underlie the evolutionary diversification of macaques, we investigated the within- and between-species relationships of craniodental dimensions, geography, and environment in extant macaque species. We studied evolutionary processes by contrasting macroevolutionary patterns, phylogeny, and within-species associations.
   Materials and MethodsSixty-three linear measurements of the permanent dentition and skull along with data about climate, ecology (environment), and spatial geography were collected for 711 specimens of 12 macaque species and analyzed by a multivariate approach. Phylogenetic two-block partial least squares was used to identify patterns of covariance between craniodental and environmental variation. Phylogenetic reduced rank regression was employed to analyze spatial clines in morphological variation.
   ResultsBetween-species associations consisted of two distinct multivariate patterns. The first represents overall craniodental size and is negatively associated with temperature and habitat, but positively with latitude. The second pattern shows an antero-posterior tooth size contrast related to diet, rainfall, and habitat productivity. After controlling for phylogeny, however, the latter dimension was diminished. Within-species analyses neither revealed significant association between morphology, environment, and geography, nor evidence of isolation by distance.
   DiscussionWe found evidence for environmental adaptation in macaque body and craniodental size, primarily driven by selection for thermoregulation. This pattern cannot be explained by the within-species pattern, indicating an evolved genetic basis for the between-species relationship. The dietary signal in relative tooth size, by contrast, can largely be explained by phylogeny. This cautions against adaptive interpretations of phenotype-environment associations when phylogeny is not explicitly modelled.

AB Published and unpublished long-term studies are assembled to examine trends in coral cover and the dependence of change in coral cover on the initial coral cover in KAne'ohe Bay over the last 44 yr. Each study showed there had been periods of increase in coral cover in the bay and showed that the rate of change in cover has been inversely dependent on the initial cover at a site. When coral cover is high on upper reef slopes, the fragile structure of reefs in this sheltered bay often collapses, resulting in a decrease in coral cover. The rate of change in coral cover was also inversely dependent on cover in one of the two studies that included analysis of reef-flat corals; the cause of decrease in cover in this habitat is thought to be attributable to particularly low sea levels in Hawai'i in the late 1990s and 2009-2010. The inverse relationship between initial coral cover and change in cover, and the intersections of the regression lines of these variables with the x-axis at intermediate values of coral cover, is indicative of resilience in this ecosystem over the last 44 yr. In the 1970s, the invasive macroscopic green alga Dictyosphaeria cavernosa covered a high percentage of coral habitat and commonly displaced corals from the reef slope and outer reef flats; the change was cited as an example of a phase shift on a reef. This alga has virtually disappeared from the bay, thus increasing the space available to corals; its disappearance is coincident with the increase in coral cover. Other species of macroalgae, including alien species, have not replaced D. cavernosa as major space competitors. The increase in coral cover and virtual disappearance of D. cavernosa constitute an example of a phase-shift reversal.

AB We modify an existing water quality index of Lake Kinneret to better match the objective of sustaining the ecosystem over time. The Kinneret Sustainability Index (KSI) provides a quantitative indication of how similar the current ecosystem is in relation to a reference state that managers are striving to achieve and sustain once accomplished. As Lake Kinneret is the only freshwater lake in Israel, it is vital to sustain the lake ecosystem over time. The KSI provides lake managers with a means for assessing the state of the lake. The KSI is based on nine ecosystem variables and provides information on each variable and the combined index. We present examples of application of the KSI to lake management and conduct a sensitivity analysis of the underlying assumptions demonstrating its robustness to the assumptions. While the index presented here is specific to Lake Kinneret, it is a general approach that can be readily applied to lakes worldwide and can assist, for example, in achievement of the required good status for European lakes.

AB This research aims to test a scalable and transferable Geographic Information System (GIS)-based evaluation methodology for the identification, quantification and assessment of multi-functional landscape features. The evaluation of multi-functional features is one of the key tasks required when it comes to identifying the values that people attribute to landscapes, according to the principles of the European Landscape Convention. Mapping the static distribution of Landscape Services (LS) through data-derived estimates and performing spatial composite indicators are fundamental steps in understanding the current state of the Social-Ecological System (SES) of threatened or resilient landscapes. The methodological process is structured in four phases: intelligence (i), design (ii), choice (iii) and outcome (iv), according to the framework of the Multi-Criteria Spatial Decision Support System (MC-SDSS). This process has been implemented in the case study of the National Park of Cilento, Vallo di Diano and Alburni (Italy). The weighting of the spatial indicators, which simulates the model of LS-functioning for the study area, derives from an entropy-based method. Such a method, by which the weights are estimated without decisional agents, concerns a key-concept of information entropy theory, whereby the amount of information for each criterion determines its relative importance within a defined set of spatial criteria. The output of the model concerns mapping composite indicators of the LS; this involves the macro-categories of Regulating, Provisioning, and Cultural Services.

AB The taxonomy of the genus Melozone has recently been analyzed from genus to subspecies level, leading to a significant revision of our understanding of this group of birds. Previous studies quantified differences in phenotypic traits, behavior, and genotypes, to provide a better understanding of the underappreciated diversity within Melozone and the relationship between species within this genus. Yet the relationship between the subspecies of White-eared Ground-sparrows, Melozone leucotis, has not received thorough taxonomic scrutiny. In this study, we evaluate the taxonomic status of the three recognized subspecies of M. leucotis using multiple morphometric characteristics, plumage color features, and vocalizations. We measured plumage patterns and reflectance from museum specimens, morphometric features from museum specimens and live birds, and vocal characteristics from sound recordings. We observed substantial variation between subspecies in plumage, morphometry, and voice, especially between northern and southern birds. The phenotypic and vocal differences exhibited by M. l. occipitalis (from Chiapas, Mexico; Guatemala; and El Salvador) suggest that its taxonomic relationship with the M. l. leucotis and M. l. nigrior complex (from Costa Rica and Nicaragua, respectively) needs to be reevaluated, because these two groups are highly diagnosable from one another. Additionally, M. l. occipitalis is geographically isolated from the other two subspecies, reducing the probability of contact by natural causes in the near future. Based on the clear differences in voice, plumage, and morphometric features reported here, we propose that M. l. occipitalis be recognized as a distinct species, M. occipitalis (Salvin's Ground-sparrow), diagnosed on the basis of its longer tail, longer bill, duller plumage, and songs with a lower frequency of maximum amplitude.

AB The non-random selection of fruits by frugivores can affect plant demography by changing the probability of seedling recruitment. We investigated whether the New Zealand pigeon (Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae) exhibits size-based preference of fruit in two indigenous tree species, Vitex lucens and Prumnopitys ferruginea, that have large fleshy diaspores containing single seeds. We also assessed if there was an advantage for seeds that were actively dispersed since birds may select fruits that have viable seeds (although the cue for such selection remains unclear) and whether a combined scarification-deinhibition advantage was conferred on germination due to seed passage through the gut. Using seed length as a proxy for fruit size, we compared the length of passively dispersed fruits in traps with the estimated fruit length of actively dispersed seeds in six trees of each species across three areas in one fruiting season. For both species, actively dispersed seeds were significantly longer than seeds from passively dispersed fruit, suggesting frugivore preference for larger fruit. Seeds from passively dispersed P. ferruginea fruit had significantly higher viability than actively dispersed seeds and there was no measurable scarification-deinhibition effect. For V. lucens, there was no significant difference in viability between actively and passively dispersed seeds and there was a total lack of seed germination in our trial. Our results show a significant preference by H. novaeseelandiae for larger fruit in both tree species, which was possibly associated with annual fruit production since P. ferruginea trees that had more fruit produced larger fruit on average. That H. novaeseelandiae selected longer fruit in our study is consistent with the prediction that birds will prefer larger fruit when beak gape limitation is absent. However, active dispersal of larger seeds may not always be advantageous since passively dispersed intact fruit germinated equally well and may even have had a viability advantage.

AB A new species of Campylopterus sabrewing is described from eastern Brazilian tropical dry forests occurring below 900 m asl. Its holotype (MZUSP 99024) is an adult female from Sitio Duboca (16 degrees 43'19 '' S, 43 degrees 58'20 '' W, elevation 840 m), municipality of Montes Claros, state of Minas Gerais. A taxonomic revision based on more than 1,000 museum specimens revealed that the new taxon, together with C. largipennis, C. diamantinensis and C. obscurus (with C. aequatorialis considered as a subjective junior synonym) should be ranked as species. We provide a key to permit easy identification of the four species. The new species is very similar to the parapatric C. diamantinensis of high altitude "campos rupestres" above 1,000 m asl, differing from it by its smaller size and longer light tail tips, as well as by sternum measurements. Given the several threats faced by the habitat to which the new species is endemic, we propose to consider it as Vulnerable under the IUCN criteria.

AB One of the main recommendations of reintroduction biology for prospective projects is that they should be planned with local species knowledge and with species-specific quantitative modelling, for example, from population viability analysis (PVA). Here, we apply this approach to the planned reintroduction of the critically endangered Floreana mockingbird Mimus trifasciatus in the Galapagos Archipelago. After its extinction on Floreana Island, the Floreana mockingbird today only persists on two small islets, Champion and Gardner. In the context of a wider island restoration project, there are plans to reintroduce M.trifasciatus back to Floreana to establish a population as large and genetically diverse as possible, while minimizing the impact on the two source populations. To aid the planning of this reintroduction effort, we compared six potential reintroduction strategies that differ in three aspects: (1) use of captive breeding, (2) state-(in)dependent sourcing of birds, (3) time span for translocations. We assessed the strategies' performance using a multi-site count-based PVA and simulations of coancestry as a measure of genetic diversity. In general, PVA and coancestry results were comparable in terms of the strategies' performance. Strategies with captive breeding resulted in larger population sizes and higher genetic diversity on Floreana after 20 years. However, the advantages of captive breeding disappeared when the population growth rate in captivity or on Floreana was very low. The reintroductions did not negatively impact the source populations' viability, provided no more than 2 and 16 birds were taken annually from the two source islets. The approach employed here shows how a count-based PVA in combination with simulations of genetic diversity can help reintroduction planning.

AB Environmental variation between habitats may impose divergent selection pressures resulting in phenotypic divergence that can lead to reproductive isolation, especially if these same traits are favoured by sexual selection. Anuran body size is an important trait in male mating success and can affect the spectral traits of calls that female frogs use in mate choice. Environmental differences in water availability and temperature influence anuran body size and may result in reproductive incompatibility between populations. We investigated the importance of environmental differences between the Amazon and the Cerrado in driving phenotypic variation in the lesser tree frog (Dendropsophus minutus). In the present study, we tested the relationship between body size and environmental variables (precipitation and temperature). The results obtained show that body size increases in a more seasonal climate. Precipitation seasonality is the most important variable in explaining body size variation. If environmental variables can be used as a proxy for phenotypic variation, our results suggest that environmental differences between habitats may be an important driver of intraspecific divergence. Thus, this divergence across the Amazon and the Cerrado suggests the early stages of the ecological speciation continuum. (C) 2016 The Linnean

AB Landscape structure can affect connectivity among populations. In a patchy landscape, specialist species that are limited to particular elements are expected to show low gene diversity, low connectivity and high differentiation among patches. Conversely, for generalist species, genetic variability and gene flow among sites are expected to be high, and differentiation is expected to be low. Here we tested this hypothesis for two rodent species: Gerbillus gerbillus, the psammophile specialist species abundant in sandy habitats, and Gerbillus nanus, the parapatric habitat generalist species, found in the more stable sands in Israel and West Africa. We found that among the psammophile specialist G. gerbillus populations, differentiation was low and connectivity was high. In contrast, the parapatric generalist species G. nanus demonstrates markedly high genetic differentiation between localities within short distances in Israel. Furthermore, our results support a division between the African and the Israeli G. nanus populations, suggesting two distinct species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sedimentation resulting from the direct and indirect effects of coastal development is an increasing threat to Caribbean coral reefs. This study investigated taxonomic diversity, percent cover and successional patterns of recruited organisms over a period of 30 months to understand the community-wide consequences of increased coastal development and sediment supply along the northern coast of Jamaica. Terra cotta tiles were secured to the reef and the communities inhabiting both the cryptic and exposed sides of the tiles were monitored. The location with the highest sediment supply had the lowest Shannon diversity (H'; 1.37-1.41) and percent cover of organisms inhabiting the cryptic tile sides after 30 months (bare space was between 37 and 40%). The cryptic communities at each of the locations were similar in composition of organisms after 30 months; however, the cryptic community trajectories (analyzed using the second-stage nMDS ordination) varied and two distinct clusters were found, with the most impacted location differing from the other locations in the deep depth strata. The exposed communities at all locations were primarily composed of macroalgae, turf and encrusting algae; the location with the highest sediment supply had higher diversity of algae and lower amounts of turf than the other locations. This study provides evidence that differences in sediment supply between these locations may play a subtle role in structuring communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Wide-ranging species typically differ morphologically across their ranges. Bergmann's rule suggests that taxa in colder environments are bigger than related taxa in warmer locations. We examined 767 painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) in ten populations near their northwestern range edge in south-central British Columbia, Canada, in conjunction with previous data, to test the hypotheses of (1) a Bergmann's latitudinal cline, and (2) that males and females show similar latitudinal variation in size. We also explicitly test the impact of high local variation on range-wide inference. Female and male turtles showed similar latitudinal clines in body size; the degree of sexual dimorphism did not change across the range. Importantly, local variation in sexual dimorphism across ponds was nearly as high as the previously observed continental variation. Indeed, we found both the lowest and the highest degrees of sexual size dimorphism that have ever been reported for this species. Further, differing criteria in the literature for identifying mature females compound the difficulty of interpreting latitudinal clines in size or dimorphism. Our results highlight the need for much more systematic local and regional sampling as inputs for latitudinal or other comparative analyses such as Rensch's rule because insufficient sampling of high local variation may mask important ecological and evolutionary patterns.

AB Decline and collapse of populations of harvested marine broadcast spawners has led to broad concern over reproductive Allee effects for these species, acting through spatial challenges to finding a mate. We used an individual-based simulation model to investigate the potential for movement and mate seeking behavior to mitigate spatial challenges. We incorporated asynchrony in spawning spread over a reproductive season rather than the frequently assumed and generally unrealistic scenario of complete synchrony and instantaneous spawning. Movement rules were based on telemetry data for pink abalone (Haliotis corrugata), a severely depleted and formerly harvested species, and we used the model to estimate fertilization success for realistic densities and aggregation states in the Point Loma kelp forest (San Diego, CA, USA). Model rules for abalone movement incorporated conspecific attraction and attraction to a home scar, and produced home range areas of realistic size. Initial aggregation state did not affect home range areas as movement overcame distances separating aggregated from random distributions. Movement was capable of compensating for the fertilization drawbacks to asynchronous spawning. However, fertilization success rates based on movement and spawning asynchrony were comparable to success rates assuming no movement and complete synchrony and declined similarly with decreasing population density. When combined with reproductive asynchrony, movement may not mitigate density decline. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of any reintroduction program is to create a viable population that is self-sustaining in the long term. Thus, in the short term, it is important to evaluate the acclimation of reintroduced individuals in order to assess the potential success of the project. In this study, we radio-tracked 30 European pond turtles (Emys orbicularis) reintroduced in the Estagnol Nature Reserve (southern France) in 2008 and 2009. We analyzed each individual's dispersal over the site, its home range, and its pattern of displacement for 2 yrs after its release. About 80% of the released animals were still detected on the site 8 mo after the release operation. Home-range size was highly variable among individuals but was typical of what is known for the species. Home ranges were, however, larger in the first year after release than in the following year, probably because individuals explored the site immediately after release. The released individuals exhibited a typical displacement pattern over the first year, with a larger displacement during spring and summer that was earlier for males (April-May) than for females (June-September). All of these results strongly indicate the success of the acclimation phase of the reintroduction operation. To evaluate the success of reintroduction programs of long-lived species, we recommend, in addition to a long-term demographic study, a fine-scale study of space-use modalities, which allows the assessment of the acclimation phase of the individuals at the new site in the short term. In this way, a rapid reevaluation of the project can be made if failure at this stage is identified, allowing appropriate management actions to be taken at the site.

AB Reintroduction can be enhanced by data from long-term post-release monitoring, which allows for modeling opportunities such as population viability analysis (PVA). PVA-relevant data were gathered via long-term monitoring of reintroduced red-billed curassows at the Guapiacu Ecological Reserve (REGUA), located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, over 25 months. In the present article, we (1) assess the robustness of the reintroduction plan, (2) evaluate the viability of the current reintroduced population, and (3) examine mitigation options to increase the viability of this population. VORTEX indicates that the initial plan, fully implemented, was likely to establish a viable population at REGUA. The current population is unviable; the best mitigation strategies are to eliminate hunting altogether, or at least reduce it by half, and to supplement ten immature pairs in 2015. A positive long-term outcome at REGUA is still possible; we encourage the Brazilian government and private stakeholders to consider population supplementation, both to achieve success at REGUA and to improve the evidence base for future reintroductions.

AB Food and water resources are limiting factors for animals in desert ecosystems. Fleshy fruits are a rare water source in deserts and when available they tend to attract a wide variety of organisms. Here we show that two congeneric rodent species, Acomys cahirinus and A. russatus, employ different fruit eating strategies that result in either dispersal or predation of the small seeds of the desert plant Ochradenus baccatus. The nocturnal A. cahirinus leaves intact seeds when consuming O. baccatus fruits and thus, acts mainly as a seed disperser; whereas the diurnal A. russatus consumes the whole fruit and digests the seeds and thus, acts mainly as a seed predator. Acomys russatus is subjected to the toxic products of the glucosinolates-myrosinase system found in O. baccatus fruits. Acomys cahirinus avoids the toxic compounds by consuming the pulp only, which contains glucosinolates but not the seeds that contain the enzyme that activates them. We suggest that the behavioral responses exhibited by A. russatus are the result of physiological adaptations to whole fruit consumption that are absent in A. cahirinus. Our results shed new light on the ecological divergence of the two congeneric species.

AB We tested the validity of Bergmann's rule and Rosenzweig's hypothesis through an analysis of the geographical variation of the skull size of Otaria flavescens along the entire distribution range of the species (except Brazil). We quantified the sizes of 606 adult South American sea lion skulls measured in seven localities of Peru, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, and the Falkland/Malvinas Islands. Geographical and environmental variables included latitude, longitude, and monthly minimum, maximum, and mean air and ocean temperatures. We also included information on fish landings as a proxy for productivity. Males showed a positive relationship between condylobasal length (CBL) and latitude, and between CBL and the six temperature variables. By contrast, females showed a negative relationship between CBL and the same variables. Finally, female skull size showed a significant and positive correlation with fish landings, while males did not show any relationship with this variable. The body size of males conformed to Bergmann's rule, with larger individuals found in southern localities of South America. Females followed the converse of Bergmann's rule at the intraspecific level, but showed a positive relationship with the proxy for productivity, thus supporting Rosenzweig's hypothesis. Differences in the factors that drive body size in females and males may be explained by their different life-history strategies. Our analyses demonstrate that latitude and temperature are not the only factors that explain spatial variation in body size: others such as food availability are also important for explaining the ecogeographical patterns found in O. flavescens.

AB Evolutionary theory predicts trade-offs between fecundity and mobility, but there is substantial lack of empirical evidence if and how basic mobility relates to fitness costs. In a field experiment, we investigated fecundity costs of mobility in a non-migratory, wing-monomorphic grasshopper, Stenobothrus lineatus, and at the same time tested for possible effects of reproductive state (egg-load) on the mobility. For 10 days, body weight and activity radius of 60 females were recorded daily and oviposition events were inferred from abrupt weight losses. We found a strong and significant relationship between the individual mobility and the time between egg pods laid (interpod period). Individual egg-laying was reduced by a rate of 0.36 eggs per day with each meter increase in mean daily activity radius. The trade-off was not biased by the size of the females, that is, constitution did not positively influence both offspring number and mobility. Egg-load had no significant influence on the individual distances travelled. We could demonstrate that mobility - as induced and selected for by foraging, thermoregulation, predator escape, shelter seeking, and reproduction - can be directly paid off by fecundity. This direct consequence of mobility on individual fitness was detected for the first time in a walking insect.

AB Traditionally in toxicological studies time is not studied as quantifiable variable but as a fixed endpoint. The Reduced Life Expectancy (RLE) model which relates exposure time and exposure concentration with lethal toxic effects was tested previously using fish data. In this current paper the effects of exposure time on aquatic toxicity with zooplanktons and various toxicants were evaluated using the RLE model based on ambient exposure concentration. The model was evaluated by plotting In LT50 against LC50 using toxicity data with zooplanktons from the literature for metal, metalloid and organic compounds. Most of the experimental data sets can be satisfactorily correlated by use of the RLE model, but deviations occurred for some data sets. Those data sets were satisfactorily fitted by a two stage RLE model. This model was based on two phases: one in the peripheral system and other in the central system. Both the single and two stage RLE model support the hypothesis that toxicity is time dependent and decreases in a systematic way with increasing exposure time. A calculated normal life expectancy (NLT) can be obtained from the single stage model and is in accord with reported NLT but those obtained from the two stage RLE model are in excellent agreement.

AB The process of facilitation, where a species increases the survival, growth, and fitness of another species, is becoming increasingly recognized as a critical factor in shaping the structure of plant communities. This process is particularly important in stressful environments. Yet few studies have attempted to incorporate positive interactions into community ecological theories such as the neutral theory of biodiversity. Here, we use an equalizing trade-off model as a foundation to study the potential impact of facilitation on species richness and community temporal turnover.
   Based on a spatially explicit birth-death trade-off model, we assume that the occurrence of facilitation is dependent on the presence of interspecific neighbours. We further propose that the realized birth rate for a given individual subject to facilitation is proportional to the number of interspecific neighbours within its neighbourhood. Thus, in our model, the individuals of rare species will benefit more from the existence of heterospecific individuals than common species.
   As the facilitative coefficient increased, the species richness for simulated communities at the dynamically stochastic equilibrium was also increasing. Simulations also demonstrated that facilitation could increase the replacement of species through time: communities with facilitation become more dissimilar (i.e. have smaller Bray-Curtis similarity values) than communities without or with a lower degree of facilitation after the same time interval. Facilitation from interspecific neighbours on rare species increased their population sizes and consequently made them less prone to extinction, thus enhancing species richness. Meanwhile, in a saturated community, with the increase of species richness, mean population size of entire communities decreased, making species more prone to extinction on average, and thus increased the community temporal turnover.
   Our results suggest that future experimental work on the effect of facilitation on community-level properties should focus not just on species richness but also on other descriptors of community dynamics such as the temporal species turnover.

Using a multi-step approach, 128 cases of PIL were identified and classified. Geographically, the territorial concentrations of PILs under research are located in the North-Bohemian Industrial Crescent (from the town of Cheb in the West to town Nachod in the East), in the Central Bohemian Industrial Belt (from Pilsen region to Prague capital region), in Ostrava region (North-east of Czechia, and in the Southern Moravia). Advantages and weaknesses of the applied procedure and reliability of results were also discussed.

AB This study describes patterns of geographic variation in morphometric characters of the African green toad Bufo boulengeri, from Tunisia (11 populations). Body size differences of 89 specimens were analysed with univariate statistics, and body proportions with multivariate methods. Among-groups differences in morphometric characters included both size and shape. Southern populations were found to have larger body size than northern ones, and there was an association between climatic factors and morphological characters. The observed clinal variation in both body size and weight may result from phenotypic plasticity correlated with local environmental factors.

AB The aim of this paper is to discover a model equation for predicting the concentration of the algal species Peridinium gatunense (Dinoflagellate) in Lake Kinneret. This is a rather difficult task, due to the sudden ecosystem changes that occurred in the mid-1990s. Namely, the stable ecosystem (with regular Peridinium blooms until 1993) underwent changes and has transformed into an unstable system, with cyanobacterial blooms now occurring regularly. This shift in the algal succession is expected to influence attempts to model the lake ecosystem. Namely, the model structure before and after the change is likely to be different. Our modelling experiments were directed to discover a single model equation that can simulate dinoflagellate dynamics in both periods. We apply an automated modelling tool (Lagramge), which integrates the knowledge- and the data-driven modelling approach. In addition we include an expert visual estimation of the models discovered by Lagramge to assist in the selection of the optimal model. The dataset used included time-series measurements of typical data from the periods 1988 to 1992 and 1997 to 1999. Using the data and expert knowledge coded in a modelling knowledge library. Lagramge successfully discovered several suitable mathematical models for Peridinium. After the expert's visual estimation and validation of the models, we propose one optimal model capable of long-term predictions. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study investigated whether the predictions of an optimal risk-sensitive foraging model (the energy-budget rule) would extend to humans' choices between high- and low-variance monetary response options. In Experiment 1, participants were presented with repeated choices between two options that had the same mean values but different variances across positive- and negative-budget conditions. In Experiment 2, a within-subject comparison was conducted to investigate choice under positive- and negative-budget conditions when the options were either (a) a fixed option and a high-variance option, or (b) a low-variance option and a high-variance option. Session-wide choices were analyzed in relation to the predictions of the energy-budget rule and sequential choices were analyzed with dynamic optimization modeling. When both options were variable choice was generally consistent with predictions of the energy-budget rule and was more risk prone under negative-budget than positive-budget conditions. Sequential choices were sensitive to local budget conditions, but choices were less consistent with optimality when both options were variable, possibly because of the greater similarity in expected earnings for optimal and nonoptimal choices in these conditions. Overall, the results provide further evidence that the energy-budget rule may have broad applicability and that it can extend to human risky choice between multiple variable response options.

AB We make a theoretical study of nitrogen cycling in a model of a grazing system with five compartments. The rates of uptake of nutrient by plants and herbivores are allowed nonlinear forms which involve no a priori assumptions about whether the system is subject to top-down or bottom-up control. We derive a method of piecewise linear approximation which allows analytical study of the system. We then use this method to investigate the properties of the equilibrium states of the system, and in particular whether the system favours donor- or recipient-control, the grazing optimization problem, and the potential benefits of herbivory to plant growth. We are able to generalise our results to all uptake functions of the same qualitative class as those considered, and to show that in general the system will tend to a stable equilibrium state of donor-controlled herbivory. In this model, the presence of the 'right' class of herbivore is not only beneficial to plant growth in certain circumstances, but can be essential to their survival, allowing plants to co-exist with herbivores under conditions in which they would be unable to survive alone.

AB The present study analyzed the spatio-temporal pattern of spawning aggregations of the Atlantic sardine Sardina pilchardus using a large set of reproductive data derived from 5 daily egg production method (DEPM) surveys conducted off Portugal and the Gulf of Cadiz. Similar to previous results for the Mediterranean sardine, sardines in the Atlantic were shown to form ephemeral spawning aggregations in which actively spawning females separated spatially from the remaining population, taking with them a large proportion of males. These aggregations were shown to take place at depth; specifically, bathymetric positioning of reproductively active individuals changed during the spawning cycle in such a way that imminent spawners were located at greater depths compared to recent spawners or non-spawning females. This pattern of bathymetric segregation of sardine spawning stages is in agreement with previously published evidence that sardines spawn at depth, either from indirect acoustic sampling data or from the occurrence of early embryonic stages at greater depths. A number of physiological mechanisms that may explain changes in the bathymetric positioning of actively spawning individuals are also suggested.

AB Niche theory predicts that ecologically identical species cannot stably coexist in local communities. My aim was to investigate morphological diversity as a possible factor enabling the coexistence of a species-rich Microtus (Rodentia: Arvicolinae) fauna in a hotspot of North American mammalian diversity, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE).
   The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, North America.
   Using in-hand morphological measurements of size and shape, I compared the morphologies of three North American vole species (Microtus spp.), in sympatry in the GYE and in allopatry across their ranges, in order to examine: (1) whether morphologies are fixed or plastic and (2) the degree of morphological character displacement or convergence in sympatric species.
   Support was found for plasticity of morphology for all three vole species: M. longicaudus, M. montanus and M. pennsylvanicus. However, Microtus individuals of all species from the GYE area of sympatry were more similar to each other than to allopatric individuals of the same species.
   Competition among these congeners is not manifested in morphological overdispersion. The response of these congeneric species to the same local ecological conditions is convergent. The relative strength of environmental conditions appears to be stronger than the strength of competitive interactions among the study species.

AB Nitrogen-fixing filamentous Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a tropical cyanobacterium that in recent years has invaded temperate inland waters all over the world (PADISAK 1997). Its less wide-spread relative.. Cylindrospermopsis cuspis KOMAREK & KLING (1991), first described from Lake Victoria, was then reported to occur in small volcanic lakes in the Los Tuxtlas region, Mexico (KOMAREK & KOMARKOVA-LEG-NEROVA 2002), and in Lake Okeechobee, Florida (PHLIPS et al. 1997). Akinetes were not observed by Komarek and Kling and were never described for this species.
   In 1998, C. cuspis invaded Lake Kinneret, Israel, 4 years after the invasion and major bloom of Aphanizomenon ovali-sporum, the first-ever reported bloom of N(2)-fixing cyanobacteria (POLLINGHER et al. 1998) in this mesoeutrophic, subtropical, warm monomictic lake (SERRUYA 1978). Since its 1998 appearance, C. cuspis has been found in the water column nearly every summer, initially at low concentrations, but since 2003 it has formed major summer blooms, exceeding by far the abundance of A. ovalisporum (Fig. 1). Until 2000, the rare C. cuspis trichomes had no heterocytes and were recorded as Raphidiopsis mediterranea. The first heterocyte-bearing filaments were observed in 2001, when filament abundance first exceeded 500/mL, and they were identified by J. Komarek as C cuspis. We report here oil the spatial and temporal dynamics of C cuspis in Lake Kinneret, examine these dynamics in relation to environmental parameters, and assess features that may have enabled it to out-compete A. ovalisporum.

AB Evaporitic environments are found in a variety of depositional settings as early as the Archean. Depositional conditions, microbial communities and mineralogical compositions vary significantly as no two settings are identical. The common thread linking all of the settings is that evaporation exceeds precipitation, resulting in elevated concentrations of cations and anions that are higher than in oceanic systems. The Dead Sea and Storrs Lake are terrestrial examples of two diverse-modern evaporitic settings, as the former is below sea level and the latter is a coastal lake on an island in the Caribbean. Each system varies in water chemistry; the Dead Sea-dissolved ions originate from surface weathered materials, springs, and aquifers while the dissolved ion concentration in Storrs Lake is primarily derived from sea water. Consequently, some of the ions, e.g., Sr, Ba are found at significantly lower concentrations in Storrs Lake than in the Dead Sea. The origin of the dissolved ions are ultimately responsible for the pH of each system, the alkaline versus mildly the acidic. Each system exhibits unique biogeochemical properties as the extreme environments select certain microorganisms. Storrs Lake possesses significant biofilms and stromatolitic deposits; the alkalinity varies, depending on rainfall and storm, activity. The microbial Community in Storrs Lake is much more diverse and active than those observed in the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea waters are mildly acidic, lack stromatolites, and possess a lower density of microbial populations. The general absence of microbial and biofilm fossilization is due to the depletion of HCO3 and its slightly acidic pH.

AB Many factors important to reproduction are difficult to quantify for wild mammals, yet an understanding of them is often critical to species' recovery programs, particularly those involving captive breeding and reintroduction. We examined management variables employed by the Vancouver Island man-not captive breeding program during 1998-2005 to determine how such variables influenced production of young and litter sizes. We then tested the ability of factors that were identified as important to predict production of young in the breeding program in 2006. For previously paired animals, production of young was significantly greater when they had been paired with the same mate for >= 1 year before the breeding season. When these females had been with a mate for < 1 year, production of young was more than 2 times greater among 2-4 year olds compared to older age classes. Among previously paired females, 5-7 year olds and those that had produced young previously tended to produce young more often than other categories. Litter size was positively influenced by visual contact between a female and other pairs. For previously paired females, age, the amount of time paired with their mate, and previous production of young accurately predicted 75% of production of young in 2006. We propose that results from out study be combined with genetic considerations to plan future pairings in the breeding program and to assist in the selection of individuals for reintroduction to the wild. Methods reported herein may be applicable to recovery programs for other imperiled mammals.

AB We investigated the validity and distribution of the subspecies Acris crepitans blanchardi. Currently Acris crepitans contains three subspecies: the northern cricket frog ( A. c. crepitans), Blanchards cricket frog ( A. c. blanchardi) and the coastal cricket frog ( A. c. paludicola). We examined the diagnostic characters of 1441 specimens from the center of the range ( Arkansas, Missouri, and Mississippi), 161 specimens from the extreme northwest portion of this species range ( South Dakota and Nebraska), and 85 from the extreme southeast portion of the species range ( Florida and Georgia). Discriminate analysis was applied to the tabulated data and no significant differences between portions of the range could be discerned. No concrete evidence was found to support designation of specimens from South Dakota and Nebraska or from Smallens Cave ( origin of the type specimen) as A. c. blanchardi. This information places the subspecies A. c. blanchardi in a status of doubtful validity suggesting that no delineation between A. c. blanchardi and A. c. crepitans should be made at this time.

ID DISPERSAL STRATEGIES; ENVIRONMENTS; ADAPTATIONS; HABITAT
AB A field experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that competitive interactions affect demographic responses of desert dune annuals to gradients in sand stability. The experiment was based on a three-way factorial design with two types of neighbor treatments (complete neighbor removal vs. control), two types of habitats (stable vs. unstable sands) and two species which characterize sandy areas of the western Negev Desert (Neurada procumbens and Bromus fasciculatus). Each of the eight treatment/habitat/species combinations was characterized by three demographic variables: seedling survival to reproduction, fruit number per reproductive plant and fruit number per seedling. All of these variables exhibited significant interactions between the effects of neighbor removal and habitat type, indicating that neighbor conditions were important in determining the observed patterns of demographic variation. Moreover, while plants of Neurada procumbens growing without neighbors suffered more mortality on unstable sands, conspecific plants growing at natural density conditions suffered more mortality on stable sands. In the case of Bromus fasciculatus, individuals growing in the absence of competitive effects produced more fruits on stable sands, but conspecific plants growing at natural density conditions exhibited higher fruit production on unstable sands. These findings indicate that competitive effects not only modify, but may even reverse demographic responses of desert dune annuals to gradients in sand stability. Based on these results and evidence from two other studies it is suggested that seed dispersal from abiotically favorable into less favorable habitats may increase fitness of desert annuals by reducing the average effect of competition.

AB Ecophysiological strategies were examined for some species colonizing the different habitat types of north Egypt, namely, saline flat covered by sand sheets, a transitional area between the saline flat and rocky ridge, rocky ridge covered by gravely sand deposits and a non-saline depression. These habitats are characterized by marked soil variations which affect species tolerance. Water content, relative water content, pH, dry matter percentage, chlorophyll content, proline and carbohydrates varied in the species characteristic of each habitat type. Such information has made it possible to identify the most suitable habitat for each species within the range of habitats where they occur. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

ID LIZARD; ISLAND; COLOR; O-18
AB Within-island microgeographic variation in body size of the Gran Canarian skink, Chalcides sexlineatus, is described. Clear latitudinal patterns of variation were found for both males and females. Using Mantel tests we rejected within-island altitude-related ecological variation as the cause of the geographic variation, but found a significant relationship between body size and the pattern of lush - arid variation. Larger body size was found in populations from the lusher northern areas, and small body size in populations from the arid south. Studies with doubly labelled water showed higher energy expenditure per animal in a studied northern population than in a southern population, due to larger body size in the former. Mean mass-specific energy expenditure was found to be low in this species compared with other lizards, and did not differ significantly between populations (north, 150.1 J . g-0.80 . d-1; south, 124.7 J . g-0.80 . d-1). Mean mass-specific water fluxes were similar for lizards at both study sites (14.79 and 14.20 mL H2O . kg-0.91 . d-1, respectively). Previous explanations invoking differences in water stress as the cause of variation in body size among populations of arid-zone lizards do not appear to be applicable to C sexlineatus.

AB An experiment established the effects of frequency and height of defoliation on the production of an irrigated Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum)-annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) sward. Five intervals of defoliation (from 4 to 12 weeks) were superimposed on 2 heights of defoliation (to ground level and to 4 cm above ground level) in a split-plot design.
   Total harvested yields ranged from 7.52 to 11.94 t DM/ha and varied according to defoliation management. Except for the very short defoliation intervals, defoliating to the higher level was less productive than defoliating to ground level. There were wide seasonal variations in the effect of treatment. In general, quality of the harvested herbage was relatively constant for much of the year, but in spring the effects of frequency and height of defoliation were evident. At this time, all chemical characteristics indicated that herbage quality declined with maturity of the sward. Optimum defoliation management will depend on both the quantity and quality of herbage produced. This will depend on animal requirements.

AB Mangroves are among the world's most productive ecosystems and a part of the "blue carbon" sink. They act as a connection between the terrestrial and marine ecosystems, providing habitat to countless organisms. Among these, microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, archaea, fungi, phytoplankton, and protozoa) play a crucial role in this ecosystem. Microbial cycling of major nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) helps maintain the high productivity of this ecosystem. However, mangrove ecosystems are being disturbed by the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere. Both the anthropogenic and natural factors contribute to the upsurge of greenhouse gas concentration, resulting in global warming. Changing climate due to global warming and the increasing rate of human interferences such as pollution and deforestation are significant concerns for the mangrove ecosystem. Mangroves are susceptible to such environmental perturbations. Global warming, human interventions, and its consequences are destroying the ecosystem, and the dreadful impacts are experienced worldwide. Therefore, the conservation of mangrove ecosystems is necessary for protecting them from the changing environment-a step toward preserving the globe for better living. This review highlights the importance of mangroves and their microbial components on a global scale and the degree of vulnerability of the ecosystems toward anthropic and climate change factors. The future scenario of the mangrove ecosystem and the resilience of plants and microbes have also been discussed.

AB Aim A decline in body size has been proposed as a universal response to global warming, but this is often questioned. We describe and characterize recent morphological changes in the avifauna of Israel as a whole and test several hypotheses regarding their cause. Location Israel. Time period 1950-2020. Major taxa studied Aves. Methods We analysed the morphology of 7,981 museum specimens. For each of the 106 species, we calculated the rate of change in mass, head and body length, wing length and approximate relative surface area, both over time and as a function of temperature anomaly (the difference between temperatures in a given year and the interannual average). We used phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models (PGLMMs) to determine trends and their relationship to the ecology of species. Results Over the last 70 years there have been consistent changes through time in mass, length and surface area-to-volume ratio. Mass decreased by 18.3%, length increased by 5.1%, and surface area-to-volume ratio increased by 28.9%. The increase in the ratio of surface area to volume through time corresponds to a 12.2% increase per degree Celsius of warming. In contrast, changes in wing length were few and inconsistent. Most species changed in either mass or length, but seldom in both. The effect of rising temperature on morphology was roughly an order of magnitude stronger than the effect of a comparable geographical difference in habitat temperature. Changes were modulated by migratory habits but not explained by human commensalism or diet. Main conclusions A decrease in mass and increase in length are widespread, both leading to higher relative surface area. Results conform with predicted responses to global warming, but not with any of our other tested hypotheses. If warming is the driver of these changes, the diverging responses observed between different species might represent different solutions to solve a common problem.

AB Reintroductions aim to re-establish a viable population within the indigenous range of living organisms, especially of threatened species. The population of the Asian Crested Ibis Nipponia nippon, a well-known 'Endangered' bird species, has increased over 100 times since wild populations were rediscovered in 1981, and several reintroduction projects were subsequently carried out in its former range. An experimental release of the Asian Crested Ibis was conducted in Qianhu National Wetland Park located in the southern part of the Loess Plateau, China. It is vitally important to monitor released birds (at least their survival and breeding), to inform subsequent releases in other suitable sites. During extensive post-release monitoring, data on capture-recapture and reproductive status were obtained using banding, radiotelemetry, and field observations. Using the Cormack-Jolly-Seber (C-J-S) model, the average annual survival rates were estimated to be 0.569 (95% CI: 0.353-0.762) for released individuals and 0.643 (95% CI: 0.038-0.987) for all individuals. From 2014 to 2018, a total of 14 breeding pairs produced 28 eggs and 10 fledglings with successful reproduction of the second generation. The mean clutch size was 2.07 +/- 0.25 (n = 29), and the breeding success was 34.5%. Predation and poor habitat quality have been shown to be the main factors affecting the reintroduced population at establishment stage. Some management suggestions at the metapopulation and ecosystem levels, including further release, predator control and habitat improvement, have been proposed.

AB Aim Climatic variation has long been regarded as a primary source of morphological variation. However, there is mixed support for the adherence of reptiles to ecogeographical hypotheses, such as Bergmann's rule (body size decreases with temperature) and Allen's rule (limb length increases with temperature). We quantified body and limb morphology among the diverse Australian gecko fauna (4 families, 30 genera, 226 of the 231 described species) to investigate environmental correlates of morphological variation in this radiation.
   Location Australia.
   Major taxa studied Geckos (Squamata: Gekkota; the families Gekkonidae, Carphodactylidae, Diplodactylidae and Pygopodidae).
   Methods We measured 20 external features of ethanol-preserved museum specimens. We investigated whether principal component axes of morphology were correlated with three key environmental variables, and the microhabitat occupied by each species.
   Results Morphology varied greatly among Australian gecko families and genera, although there was a strong phylogenetic signal in morphology. After accounting for phylogeny, morphology was correlated with a species' microhabitat use. Saxicolous species and species with variable microhabitat requirements (i.e., generalists) had larger body dimensions than terrestrial species. Saxicolous species also had longer proportional forelimbs and hindlimbs than terrestrial species.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight the importance of phylogeny and microhabitat use in shaping the morphology of Australian geckos. We find little evidence that Australian geckos adhere to Bergmann's rule or Allen's rule, suggesting that these ecogeographical hypotheses provide limited insight into the adaptive potential of lizard species to altered environmental conditions.

AB Building on the Bonn Challenge, the UN Decade advances global restoration on an unprecedented scale. Research increasingly points to the need for greater social inclusion in restoration projects, yet the approaches that favor such inclusion remain opaque in practice. In this paper, we identify three restoration approaches that figure in the international agenda and analyze these through the lens of social inclusion. We argue that: (1) restoration aimed at bringing ecosystems back to a previous state, or "return" restoration, favors natural science at the landscape scale over social inclusion at the community scale; (2) restoration seeking to recreate functional ecosystems in locations away from where the degradation has occurred, or "reorganization" restoration, fails to adequately address historical inequities and perpetuates legacies of exploitation; and (3) "resilience" oriented restoration is promising but remains theoretical, and risks instrumentalizing marginalized communities and their lands as experimental sites for restoration. Though both "return" and "reorganize" restoration face substantial criticism, these approaches continue to play a central role in the major paradigms and practices that enliven the global restoration agenda. To improve prospects for social inclusion in the global restoration movement, we advance that the movement must evolve beyond productivity-based inclusion schemes and address the role that international initiatives play in perpetuating systems of exploitation. Finally, we argue that "resilience" restoration offers the most promising pathway towards meaningful social inclusion when it can empower community members to participate in restoration as agents of change and co-experimenters.

AB Exquisitely preserved fossils of a new reef-building vermetid species from shallow-marine lower Miocene (Burdigalian) deposits of the Chilcatay Formation and upper Miocene (Tortonian) sediments of the Pisco Formation of Peru are here reported and described in detail for the first time. These finds are assigned to the living genus Thylacodes and recognized as representatives of a new species, Thylacodes devriesi sp. nov. This new taxon is known by long, almost straight tube-like shells that display peculiar ornamentations in form of striated lamellae and are arranged in an organ-pipe fashion. This discovery represents an important addition to the knowledge of the systematics and distribution of Thylacodes in South America in the geological past. Paleoenvironmental and taphonomic inferences drawn by the fossil remains of this reef-forming species are herein discussed for both the Chilcatay and Pisco Formations in the broader framework of the South American fossil record of Vermetidae.

AB Amniote vertebrates share a suite of extra-embryonic membranes that distinguish them from anamniotes. Other than that, however, their reproductive characteristics could not be more different. They differ in basic ectothermic vs endothermic physiology, in that two clades evolved powered flight, and one clade evolved a protective shell. In terms of reproductive strategies, some produce eggs and others give birth to live young, at various degrees of development. Crucially, endotherms provide lengthy parental care, including thermal and food provisioning-whereas ectotherms seldom do. These differences could be expected to manifest themselves in major differences between clades in quantitative reproductive traits. We review the reproductive characteristics, and the distributions of brood sizes, breeding frequencies, offspring sizes and their derivatives (yearly fecundity and biomass production rates) of the four major amniote clades (mammals, birds, turtles and squamates), and several major subclades (birds: Palaeognathae, Galloanserae, Neoaves; mammals: Metatheria and Eutheria). While there are differences between these clades in some of these traits, they generally show similar ranges, distribution shapes and central tendencies across birds, placental mammals and squamates. Marsupials and turtles, however, differ in having smaller offspring, a strategy which subsequently influences other traits.

AB Reintroduction to, or reinforcement of, threatened wild populations are commonly used conservation strategies. Reintroductions of the Southern Ground-hornbill Bucorvus leadbeateri have been tested as a potential conservation tool for this vulnerable species since 1995. Forty-two individuals have been reintroduced under varying management strategies. We analysed the outcomes of these attempts to assess which factors contributed most to success or failure. The species exhibits complex social learning and hierarchy, and is long-lived, with delayed sexual maturity. Immediate survival was significantly affected by the season in which the release was done and by the quality of the released birds. The best-quality release birds were reared with wild behavioural characteristics and were well-socialised to captive conspecifics prior to being placed into managed groups ('bush schools'), where social learning was led by an experienced, wild alpha male. Once reintroduced birds had survived their first year after release, continued wild experience and wild mentorship significantly affected their survival. Since sample sizes limited the rigour of some statistical analyses, other factors were considered that may also determine success. These quasi-experimental reintroductions revealed novel threats to the species, such as the importance of a nest to group cohesion, that harvested second-hatched chicks provide viable release birds, which essentially doubles wild productivity, and that reintroductions generate valuable civil society awareness of the plight of the species.

AB The island species-area relationship (ISAR) is a positive association between the number of species and the area of an isolated, island-like habitat. ISARs are ubiquitous across domains of life, yet the processes generating ISARs remain poorly understood, particularly for microbes. Larger and more productive islands are hypothesized to have more species because they support larger populations of each species and thus reduce the probability of stochastic extinctions in small population sizes. Here, we disentangled the effects of "island" size and productivity on the ISAR of Antarctic cryoconite holes. We compared the species richness of bacteria and microbial eukaryotes on two glaciers that differ in their productivity across varying hole sizes. We found that cryoconite holes on the more productive Canada Glacier gained more species with increasing hole area than holes on the less productive Taylor Glacier. Within each glacier, neither productivity nor community evenness explained additional variation in the ISAR. Our results are, therefore, consistent with productivity shaping microbial ISARs at broad scales. More comparisons of microbial ISARs across environments with limited confounding factors, such as cryoconite holes, and experimental manipulations within these systems will further contribute to our understanding of the processes shaping microbial biogeography.

AB The stochastic vegetation model with the pulse control is established, and the related dynamic mechanisms are explored. The stationary responses of the system can be detected by the stationary probability density function and the mean vegetation biomass. And the transient properties of the system are investigated by the mean first exit time of the attraction basin and the time series of the attractor. Due to the special discontinuity of the pulse control, these indexes are analyzed through numerical simulations alone. Specially, for the uncontrolled case, the analytical expressions of the stationary probability density and mean first exit time can be derived, and relative errors of the two proposed methods can be ignored as a whole. It turns out that the strong environmental disturbance such as the random climate change can influence the vegetation ecosystem balance, which can be effectively controlled by the pulse control.

AB We explored the effects of heterogeneity of sward height on the functioning of grazing systems through a spatially implicit mechanistic model of grazing and sward growth. The model uses a population dynamic approach where a sward is spatially structured by height, which changes as a function of defoliation, trampling, and growth. The grazing component incorporates mechanisms of bite formation, intake, and digestion rates, but excludes sward quality effects. Sward height selection is determined by maximization of the instantaneous intake rate of forage dry mass. For any given average sward height, intake rate increased with increasing spatial heterogeneity. Spatio-temporal distribution of animal density over paddocks did not markedly affect animal performance but it modified the balance of vegetation heterogeneity within and between paddocks. Herbage allowance was a weak predictor of animal performance because the same value can result from multiples combinations of herbage mass per unit area, number of animals, animal liveweight, and paddock area, which are the proximate determinants of intake rate. Our results differ from models that assume homogeneity and provide strong evidence of how heterogeneity influences the dynamic of grazing systems. Thus, we argue that grazing management and research need to incorporate the concept of heterogeneity into the design of future grazing systems.

AB Localized planar patterns in spatially extended bistable systems are known to exist along intricate bifurcation diagrams, which are commonly referred to as snaking curves. Their analysis is challenging as techniques such as spatial dynamics that have been used to explain snaking in one space dimension no longer work in the planar case. Here, we consider bistable systems posed on square lattices and provide an analytical explanation of snaking near the anti-continuum limit using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction. We also establish stability results for localized patterns, discuss bifurcations to asymmetric states, and provide further numerical evidence that the shape of snaking curves changes drastically as the coefficient that reflects the strength of the spatial coupling crosses a finite threshold.

AB Competition has long been recognized as a central force in shaping evolution, particularly through character displacement. Yet research on character displacement is biased, as it has focused almost exclusively on pairs of interacting species while ignoring multispecies interactions. Communities are seldom so simple that only pairs of species interact, and it is not clear whether inferences from pairwise interactions are sufficient to explain patterns of phenotypes in nature. Here, we test for character displacement in a natural system of freshwater fishes in western Mexico that contains up to four congeneric species of the genus Poeciliopsis. We analyzed body shape differences between populations with different numbers of competitors while accounting for confounding environmental variables. Surprisingly, we found evidence for convergent character displacement in populations of P. prolifica, P. viriosa, and P. latidens. We also found that the convergence in body shape was not consistently in the same direction, meaning that when three or more competitors co-occurred, we did not find more extreme body shapes compared with when there were only two competitors. Instead, when three or more competitors co-occurred, body shape was intermediate between the shape found with a pair of species and the shape found with no competitor present. This intermediate shape suggests that evolution in multispecies communities likely occurs in response to several competitors rather than to simple pairwise interactions. Overall, our results suggest that competition among multiple species is more complex than simple pairwise competitive interactions.

AB We study theoretically the emergence of localized states of vegetation close to the onset of desertification. These states are formed through the locking of vegetation fronts, connecting a uniform vegetation state with a bare soil state, which occurs nearby the Maxwell point of the system. To study these structures we consider a universal model of vegetation dynamics in drylands, which has been obtained as the normal form for different vegetation models. Close to the Maxwell point localized gaps and spots of vegetation exist and undergo collapsed snaking. The presence of gaps strongly suggest that the ecosystem may undergo a recovering process. In contrast, the presence of spots may indicate that the ecosystem is close to desertification.

AB Climatic effects on the growth of apex marine predators - such as sharks - are poorly understood; moreover, shifts in shark growth are primarily attributed to fishing pressure. This paucity of information impedes management and conservation planning for these taxa. Using vertebral increment patterning as a proxy of somatic growth, this study reconstructed mean growth of the philopatric and demersal Heterodontus portusjacksoni population from Gulf St Vincent (South Australia). A biochronology of shark growth spanning a 15 year period (1996-2010) was developed using mixed effects models. The biochronology showed considerable year-to-year deviations in growth that were significantly and negatively correlated with mean sea surface temperatures during the species' breeding season (July to November). These findings are consistent with mesocosm experiments and support the influence of changing climates on shark growth; particularly in an inshore, demersal, and highly philopatric shark species. It is likely that the effects of environmental variation occur in a species-specific manner, governed by life history strategies and ecological requirements. In this manner, life history traits might aid in estimating species vulnerability to climate change.

AB Revegetation is the most common procedure in the restoration of disturbed areas; this practice usually aims at reconstructing plant communities that can last without further management. A low-cost strategy to assist these efforts is the application of ecological knowledge in the design of the restoration. Promoting ecological processes that enhance the functioning of the restored community could result in higher restoration success. Among these processes, plant-plant interactions, e.g., facilitation and competition, can play an important role, both facilitating and impeding the development of a self-sustaining plant community. Although these processes have been well-studied in nature, we rarely have sufficient knowledge about the whole plant community. To develop that knowledge, we leverage on a restoration experiment that took place after a mine toxic spill, where similar to 15,000 woody plants from 13 species were planted and geolocated. Species were planted in three mixtures mimicking natural communities found along soil moisture gradients (xerophyte, intermediate, and hydrophyte). Plantings also varied in density. Approximately 2,600 plants were monitored for damage status, survival, and growth, for 4 yr. We analyzed growth performance of six targeted species as a function of their damage status, planted mixture, and density. Growth was also assessed on the basis of neighboring plants, accounting for the species identity and distance to the focal plant. Results show that survival among planted species was relatively high and was mostly unaffected by mixture or density of the plantings. Only very damaged plants in one species experienced a decrease in survival with increasing density. Neighborhood effects on growth show positive, neutral, and negative interactions among the tested species; these also varied depending on the type of growth performance considered (height, crown area, diameter). The species-specific results ranged from positive to negative, varying between pair of species and growth performance metric. Results gathered from our neighborhood analyses on plant growth provide valuable information for the design of planting schemes that could enhance the performance of the target species. The methods developed can be applied to other systems and species. Given the potential impacts that facilitation and competition may have during revegetation, these interactions could be considered in restoration operations.

AB One of the most important ecological processes is the formation of interspecific relationships in relation to spatial patterns among alpine cushion plants in extreme environmental habitats. However, such relationships remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the spatial patterns of alpine cushion plants along an altitudinal gradient of environmental severity and the interspecific relationship between two cushion species (Thylacospermum caespitosum and Androsace tangulashanensis) on the eastern Kunlun Mountain of China. Our results showed that the two species were highly aggregated within a distance of 2.5-5 m at the mid (S2) altitude, whereas they were randomly distributed at the low (S1) and high (S3) altitudes. A positive spatial interaction between the two species was observed over shorter distances at the mid (S2) altitude, and the spatial patterns were related to the size of individuals of the two species. Moreover, the impact of A. tangulashanensis on T. caespitosum (RIIT. caespitosum) was negative in all the study plots, and a positive impact of T. caespitosum on A. tangulashanensis (RIIA. tangulashanensis) was only observed at the mid (S2) altitude. Together, these results demonstrated that the spatial patterns of these two cushions varied with environmental severity, since the outcome of the interactions were different, to some extent, at the three altitudes. Plant size is the main factor affecting the spatial correlation and interspecific relationship between two cushions. Therefore, its potential influence should be considered when discussing interspecific relationships among cushions and their community construction at small scales in alpine ecosystems.

AB Desmonostoc salinum CCM-UFV059 (Desmonostoc) is a novel cyanobacterial strain of the order Nostocales isolated from a saline-alkaline lake. The acclimation towards salt and desiccation stress of Desmonostoc was compared to the related and well-characterized model strain Nostoc sp. PCC7120 (Nostoc). Salt-stressed cells of Desmonostoc maintained low cellular Na+ concentrations and accumulated high amounts of compatible solutes, mainly sucrose and to a lower extent trehalose. These features permitted Desmonostoc to grow and maintain photosynthesis at 2-fold higher salinities than Nostoc. Moreover, Desmonostoc also induced sucrose over-accumulation under desiccation, which allowed this strain to recover from this stress in contrast to Nostoc. Additional mechanisms such as the presence of highly unsaturated lipids in the membrane and an efficient ion transport system could also explain, at least partially, how Desmonostoc is able to acclimate to high salinities and to resist longer desiccation periods. Collectively, our results provide first insights into the physiological and metabolic adaptations explaining the remarkable high salt and desiccation tolerance, which qualify Desmonostoc as an attractive model for further analysis of stress acclimation among heterocystous N-2-fixing cyanobacteria.

AB Oaks (Quercus spp.) are currently declining worldwide due to a multitude of threats. Woodland management is often heavily focused on thinning and burning nontarget species to reduce competition and promote oak dominance in the overstory. These techniques have typically been developed in temperate regions, such as eastern U.S. forests, but whether they are the most effective strategy for promoting oak regeneration in semiarid woodlands has not been sufficiently examined. We conducted our study on the eastern Edwards Plateau in central Texas, where several oak species are codominant with Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) over karst limestone terrane. These juniper-oak woodlands provide habitat for many endemic species and play an essential role in the maintenance of key aquifers. A history of canopy clearing and a severe drought in 2011 generated patches of living and dead juniper-oak canopy interspersed with canopy gaps in our study area. In November 2013, we planted 200 shin oak (Quercus sinuata var. breviloba) acorns in each of three habitat treatments, replicated six times: (1) live canopy, (2) dead canopy, and (3) open invasive grassland. We monitored emergence and survival each year, harvesting five seedlings from each replicate in October 2017 to assess shoot height, rooting depth, biomass, ectomycorrhizal colonization, and foliar nutrients. Canopy trees, living or dead, significantly enhanced seedling emergence and survival. Survival was positively associated with increasing Ashe juniper and oak basal area, shrub cover, and soil organic matter, and negatively associated with increasing canopy gap size (complete mortality in gaps >220 m(2)). Seedling biomass increased significantly in dead and open treatments along with foliar nutrients N, P, and S (dead treatments) or S and Fe (open treatments), whereas ectomycorrhizal colonization and foliar nutrients Ca, Mg, and Mn increased under living canopy. Our findings suggest that oak regeneration in these juniper-oak woodlands closely resembles that of Mediterranean regions, where canopy facilitates seedling survival. Both living and dead trees and shrubs enhanced oak regeneration, with seedling survival depending on proximity to larger trees, living roots, shrubs, and juniper-oak canopy. Planting acorns under canopy is an inexpensive, sustainable, and effective restoration practice in drought-prone ecosystems.

AB Overgrazing has extensively degraded Chinese grasslands. A reduction in stocking rate of 30-50% below the district averages is required to increase the profitability of livestock production and protect vital ecosystem services such as mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG). Grazing experiments located in the desert steppe, typical steppe and alpine meadow verified the influence of stocking rate and grazing management on livestock production, grassland composition and associated ecosystem services. The desert steppe experiment found lower stocking rates of ~150 SE (where SE is sheep equivalent, which is a 50 kg animal) grazing days ha(-1) (1 SE ha(-1) over 150 days) enhanced botanical composition, maintained profitable lamb growth rates and reduced GHG emissions intensity. The typical steppe experiment found moderate grazing pressure of ~400 SE grazing days ha(-1) (4 SE ha(-1) over 100 days) maintained higher lamb growth rates, an average herbage mass >0.5 t DM ha(-1) that maintained the content of Leymus chinensis above 70% and Artemisia frigida below 10% of the grassland and had the highest level of net carbon sequestration. In the alpine meadow experiment the district average stocking rate of ~16 SE ha(-1) (1440 SE grazing days ha(-1) over 90 days) was not too high, but extending grazing into the non-growing season had no benefit. The findings of these experiments highlight that many of the benefits to ecosystem services can be achieved with reduced stocking rates which also generate profitable levels of livestock production. In both the desert and typical steppe experiments, the results were optimal when the stocking rates were adjusted to maintain average herbage mass over summer above ~0.5 t DM ha(-1), whereas herbage mass was higher with the local, conservative stocking rates in the alpine meadow.

AB A time-continuous, spatially discrete motile predator-immobile prey model has been developed to describe the interactions between harpacticoid copepods and benthic microalgae in the intertidal zone. Harpacticoids perform periodic and nondirectional migrations; the local intensity of these migrations is trophic-dependent, related to the ratio of real to maximum food consumption rates. The zero-dimensional (non-spatial) analog of the model has three nontrivial equilibrium states, two of which are stable: one corresponds to overgrazing (permanently low abundance of prey controlled by hungry predator); the second is "welfare" (well-fed predator and resource-limited prey). Simulations show that in the spatially distributed model with close-to-real parameter values, two regimes can be realized: either total overgrazing or a persistent heterogeneous dynamic regime with short-lived patches of both populations, similar to that observed in nature. The predator's ability to migrate narrows the "welfare" domain in parametric space, but increases the trophic efficiency of the system: in this domain, both average prey abundance and average consumption rate for the predator are higher than without migrations. The migrating gain is larger in an environment that is spatially heterogeneous for prey. Assumption of local awareness of the predator (preferred migrations toward a high abundance of prey) has no significant effect on the state of the system.

AB Extensive partial mortality of intertidal corals was observed at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, associated with extended and recurrent daytime low water levels from September to November 2018. Branching Acropora corals on shallow leeward reef platforms were emersed during the middle of day during the Austral spring due to diurnal tidal influences, seasonal mean sea-level minima associated with the southward flowing Leeuwin Current and interannual variability related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Pre-emersion total live coral cover was estimated to be similar to 35%, dominated by Acropora (similar to 24%). Post-emersion, live Acropora cover decreased to 11.1% (+/- 1.5 SE) and total cover to 21.7% (+/- 0.8 SE). Mortality of non-acroporid corals which were lower in the water column was not observed. Partial coral mortality associated with seasonal low tides and interannual variability in mean sea level is a universal process and under-reported driver of temporal variability in coral cover on intertidal reef platforms.

AB Mammals and birds provide food for their young after birth, but such provisioning is almost absent in other vertebrates. A recent theory suggested that, in addition to thermoregulation, the large discrepancy in size between adult and young ectothermic vertebrates precludes them from providing for their young, whereas the relatively large offspring of endotherms are easier to provision. I show here that reptile neonates and hatchlings are as large as those of mammals and birds. Differences in size between adults and young thus cannot explain the lack of parental provisioning in reptiles. I suggest that the large size at birth is the ancestral condition in amniotes as a whole and that provisioning has thus evolved after endothermy.

   stochastic differential equation
ID REGIME SHIFTS; THRESHOLDS; ECOSYSTEMS
AB As a dynamical system approaches its critical threshold, the probability density distribution of the system will change significantly. Therefore, it is possible to present an early warning signal based on the changing skewness before reaching the critical threshold. Based on a zero-dimensional climate model and several typical fold models, this paper systematically studies the influence of noise and missing data on the performance of the skewness coefficient as an early warning signal of an abrupt climate change. The results in three types of fold models show that the skewness coefficient has anti-noise ability to some extent, but strong noise will significantly reduce the magnitude of the skewness coefficient and the time for early warning will also be shortened. In some cases, strong noise even will lead to the result that the skewness does not work in warning an impending abrupt change. However, the influence of strong noise on skewness is insignificant in the zero-dimensional climate model. Therefore, the influence of strong noise needs to be considered in the practical application of the skewness coefficient as an early warning signal of an abrupt change. In addition, the results of all the models also indicate that different degrees of the missing data have no statistically significant effect on the warning performance of the skewness coefficient, even when the length of the missing data is up to 20% of the total sample size used in the present paper.

AB Faced with an environment of accelerated change, the long-term dynamics of biotic communities can be approached to build a consistent and causal picture of the communities' life. We have undertaken a 25-year monthly-sampling study on the phytoplankton of a meso-oligotrophic lake, paying attention to controlling factors of overall biomass (TB) and taxonomical group biomass (TGBs). Long-term series included decreased trends of TB and TGBs, and multi-scale periodicity. A decadal TB periodicity emerged related to nitrogen concentration and Cryptophytes. Annual periodicities were mainly related to air and water temperature controlling the abundance of Chlorophytes or Dinoflagellates. Intra-annual cycles could arise from autogenic processes. The analysis by periods revealed relevant dynamics (for example, Diatom periodicities), hidden in the analysis of the complete series. These results allow us to establish that: i) two organizational levels of phytoplankton change differently in time scales from months to decades; ii) controlling factors (climate, water physics and chemistry) act at different time scales and on different TGBs, and iii) different combinations of the "taxonomical group-control factor-trend and periodicity" set throughout the studied time explain total biomass dynamics. A holistic approach (multiple complementary analyses) is necessary to disentangle the different actors and relationships that explain non-stationary long-term phytoplankton dynamics.

AB The economic defensibility model explains human territoriality by considering the costs and benefits of defending resources that vary in density and predictability. We conducted a comparative study of 30 pastoral societies in Africa to explain the variation in tenure systems using the economic defensibility model. In particular, we examined under what environmental conditions we find open property regimes versus common property regimes. In addition, we considered how pastoralists' relationships with the outside world shaped property regimes by considering the role of circumscription and encapsulation. Our results show no support for the economic defensibility model across African pastoral societies: open and common property regimes are found under similar environmental conditions. Instead, we find that pastoral societies that are circumscribed are more likely to have common property regimes. We suggest that open property regimes are the default regime in pastoral societies and that common property regimes are a response to circumscription by other groups.

AB Proceratophrys minuta is known from two localities in the state of Bahia, northeastern Brazil. Information on the tadpoles and natural history of adults and larvae is available in the literature, but its advertisement call remains undescribed. Herein, we describe the advertisement call of P. minuta on the basis of four males recorded at the type locality in the municipality of Miguel Calmon, state of Bahia, Brazil. The advertisement call consists of one note with 30-52 pulses and duration of 0.4-0.72 s. The pulses usually present shorter attack than decay, with amplitude varying throughout the call. The dominant frequency over the course of the call is 1.98-2.07 kHz. The advertisement call of P. minuta is compared with available call descriptions of 25 species of Proceratophrys. It is promptly diagnosed from the calls of almost all congeners by presenting the highest dominant frequency, except for P. avelinoi, from which P. minuta can be distinguished on the basis of qualitative parameters (pulse amplitude modulation) and pulse duration. All Proceratophrys species share the following structural features of the advertisement call: notes composed of regularly repeated pulses with amplitude modulation throughout the calls and low dominant frequencies varying from 0.2-2.3 kHz. The advertisement call differs among species of Proceratophrys in the general shape of the call envelope due to distinct patterns of amplitude modulation, being either gradually modulated or abruptly modulated. We tested and obtained negative correlation between species dominant frequencies and body size in Proceratophrys, drawing attention to the importance of body size in the evolution of vocalization. Furthermore, we observed high acoustic similarities among phylogenetically distant species, indicating that quantitative parameters of the call are not likely to predict phylogenetic relatedness. Nevertheless, qualitative characters might recover the phylogenetic relationship among Proceratophrys species, and, further, they might elucidate how the the advertisement call encodes crucial information for mate recognition and discrimination.

AB Widespread species often show extensive phenotypic variation due to the contrasting abiotic and biotic factors that shape selective pressures in different environments. In this context, the gradual and predictable patterns of variation in climatic and environmental conditions found in mountain areas offer a great opportunity to explore intraspecific phenotypic variation. For instance, temperature is negatively correlated with altitude and virtually all aspects of the behavior and physiology of ectotherms are sensitive to body temperature. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that morphology, dorsal and ventral coloration and the chemical profile of femoral secretions show interpopulational and seasonal variation in the lacertid lizard (Podarcis liolepis). We compared lizards from three populations inhabiting lowland and highland habitats in the French Pyrenees that were closely related genetically. We found that highland lizards were larger, stockier, had longer heads and more femoral pores and had a darker dorsal coloration than lowland ones. In addition, we detected inter-populational differences in both the abundance and the richness of chemical compounds in the glandular secretions, and we also found seasonal variation in the overall chemical composition. Dorsal and ventral coloration differed seasonally and between populations. Ventral and dorsal brightness were higher in lowland than in highland lizards in the reproductive season whereas the reversed trend was found in the non-reproductive season but only for dorsal brightness. In addition, all lizards had browner dorsal coloration in the non-reproductive season, and lowland lizards were greener in the reproductive season. By integrating information from both visual and chemical systems, our works offers a comprehensive view of how these lizards communicate in a multimodal context.

AB Context. Large forest-dwelling mammals are highly sensitive to habitat structure. Thus, understanding the responses of reintroduced banteng (Bos javanicus d'Alton 1823) to their habitat is important for ensuring the sustainability of a reintroduction program.
   Aims. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the habitat preferences of banteng after reintroduction into the Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand on the basis of fieldwork conducted between January 2015 and November 2017.
   Methods. Seven banteng individuals bred at the Khao Nampu Nature and Wildlife Education Center were systematically reintroduced into the Salakphra Wildlife Sanctuary in 2015 (four individuals) and 2016 (three individuals). The banteng individuals were tracked via radio-collars and camera-traps. The maximum-entropy method (MaxEnt) and multiple logistic regressions (MLR) were used to identify habitat preferences. Kernel-density estimates (KDE) and a minimum convex polygon (MCP) were used to estimate the area of the habitat used.
   Key results. In total, 407 radio-signal locations showed that the MaxEnt habitat-preference models classified the banteng as associated with distance from villages and salt licks (regularised training gain of >1.0). Multiple logistic regressions form 32 camera-trap locations classified the banteng as associated with low elevations far from villages, guard stations and roads in a flat area (no aspect). The two methods for estimating habitat use provided similar results and showed that the reintroduced banteng used a wider range of habitat in the dry than in the wet season.
   Conclusions. The results from the present study suggest that the reintroduced banteng individuals prefer low elevations and flat areas without human activity.

   PATENTABILITY OF PHAGE THERAPEUTICS AND THE NECESSITY OF ALTERNATIVE
   INCENTIVES
SO DUKE LAW JOURNAL

DT Article
ID BACTERIOPHAGE; THERAPY
AB Bacteriophages, or "phages," are a category of highly adept and adaptable viruses that can infect and kill bacteria. With concerns over the burgeoning antibiotic-resistance crisis looming in recent years, scientists and policymakers have expressed a growing interest in developing novel treatments for bacterial infections that utilize bacteriophages. Because of the great expense associated with bringing a new drug to market, patents are usually considered the gold standard for incentivizing research and development in the pharmaceutical field. Absent such strong protection for a developer's front end investment, pharmaceutical development remains financially risky and unattractive. Unfortunately, recent Supreme Court jurisprudence analyzing patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. 101 has cast doubt on whether phage therapeutics would be eligible for strong patent protection. In order for the promise of phage therapeutics to become a reality, alternative protections or incentives are likely necessary. Such a framework would likely include trade secrecy, regulatory exclusivities, research support, alternative payment models, or some combination thereof.

AB Bees tend to avoid or to show indifference to uncertain ("risky") relative to certain ("safe") food rewards, whether in nectar volume or in nectar concentration. The unattractiveness of uncertain food rewards is also sometimes independent of the energy budget of bees. This pattern of responses seems to differ from that observed in mammals and birds, which may exhibit a strong preference for the uncertainty over the certainty of food delivery on a given trial in dual-choice tasks. Upon analysis of the conditions that determine preference and aversion for uncertain food rewards in "higher" vertebrates, I attempt to demonstrate that bees react to uncertainty in a similar way. It is argued that, because of their social organization and of the type of resources they seek, bees are essentially exposed to situations in which "higher" vertebrates find reward uncertainty unattractive as well. The nature of their representation of food distribution is discussed, and it is suggested that scout bees may differ from recruits with respect to uncertainty processing.

AB The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that, although facilitation and competition occur together, facilitative interactions will be more prevalent with increasing abiotic stress. In water-limited ecosystems, support for the SGH has been controversial. Because of the relevance of ecotones to local and regional diversity and the susceptibility to disturbance of the species inhabiting them, these systems represent interesting opportunities to test the SGH. Our aim was to determine whether the spatial pattern of species distribution along an arid ecotone is consistent with the SGH. Vegetation surveys were performed along topographical gradients found between several palaeochannels and bars where two communities dominated by Chuquiraga avellanedae and Larrea divaricata coexist. Daily precipitation and soil water potential at three depths were measured at a palaeochannel and a bar. Univariate and bivariate distribution patterns were investigated by second-order spatial analysis based on Ripley's K function in order to evaluate the possible existence of positive or negative interactions among plants. Soil water potential was higher at palaeochannels, indicating that a gradient of water stress exists between the palaeochannels and the bars. Whereas palaeochannels showed regularity among C.avellanedae individuals, bars showed aggregation among L.divaricata individuals and among both species. These results suggest a change in dominant interactions along the gradient from facilitative at the more xeric bars to more competitive at the relatively wetter palaeochannels in accordance with the stress-gradient hypothesis.

AB For sustainable forest management, understanding the ecological factors that determine vegetation composition are important. Here, the relation between the vegetation composition and environmental factors (elevation, aspect, slope, CaCO3, K, P, C, N, C/N, bulk density, soil porosity, saturation moisture content, EC, pH, sand, silt and clay) was investigated in the Khonj forests, Fars Province, Iran. Characteristic land units, each 200 m(2), were chosen for sampling to analyze species composition, soil characteristics and topographic factors. The floristic data were classified using a two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Means were then compared using an ANOVA and Duncan multiple range test to detect any variations between groups. Also, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index and Bartlett test were used to measure sampling adequacy. The four vegetation groups identified comprised the species Achillea wilhelmsii, Tanacetum parthenium, Convolvulus spinosus, Capparis spinosa. A detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) ordination diagram clearly illustrated the relationship between vegetation and environmental factors. According to the results, group 1 with A. wilhelmsii as the indicator species has a positive relation with slope and elevation. T. parthenium was the indicator species of group 2, that appears in areas with high silt and low bulk density and sand. The results showed that group 3 with Convolvulus spinosus as the indicator species was distributed in soils with high bulk density, low silt and pH as well. Group 4 with C. spinosa as the indicator species occurs in sandy soils and low slopes. Using DCCA, we determined the relationship between species and environmental factors more accurately. Results of this study can be used to restore vegetation or maintain species composition in ecological sensitive areas.

AB Eryngium viviparum is a very rare species with a fragmented distribution between the NW of the Iberian peninsula and Brittany. In France, the species is only maintained in one locality, thanks to management efforts. The plant is currently included in a National Action Plan that encompasses reintroductions into restored and ecologically favorable historic locations.
   In 2015, an experimental reintroduction study had been implemented in order to define the optimal establishment method in relation to site ecological factors. The period of implantation, the demographic stage of introduced individuals and local conditions, including microtopography, were tested. Population dynamic was evaluated during the two first years, through the observation of survival rates and the establishment of a new generation.
   The introduced seeds showed very low germination rates for both sites whereas contrasted results were obtained with adult transplantations. Survival rates appeared to be influenced by the microtopography but not by the season of transplantation. The establishment of a new generation has been observed, leading to the increase of the population size on both sites. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the reestablishment of Eryngium viviparum' populations in restored sites may encourage the reintroduction of the species on a larger scale.

AB Background and Aims Dioecious plants are of particular concern in view of global environmental changes because reproductive females are more sensitive to abiotic stresses, thus compromising population viability. Positive interactions with other plants may counteract the direct effects of any abiotic environmental stress, allowing them to thrive and maintain a viable population in suboptimal habitats, although this process has not been tested for dioecious species. Furthermore, almost no data are available on the outcome of such species interactions and their link with local spatial patterns and sex ratios.
   Methods We set up a field experiment with Poa ligularis, a dioecious native grass from the arid grasslands of South America. We studied the interaction of male and female plants with cushion shrubs of contrasting ecological strategies. We experimentally limited direct shrub-grass competition for soil moisture and transplanted plants to evaluate the amelioration of abiotic stress by shrub canopies (i.e. sun and wind) on grasses. We also studied the distribution of naturally established female and male plants to infer process-pattern relationships.
   Key Results Positive canopy effects as well as negative below-ground effects were more intense for females than for males. Deep-rooted Mulinum spinosum shrubs strongly facilitated survival, growth and reproduction of P ligularis females. Naturally established female plants tended to distribute more closely to Mulimun than co-occurring males. Female growth suffered intensive negative root competition from the shallow-rooted Senecio filaginoides shrub.
   Conclusions Interactions with other plants may reduce or enhance the effect of abiotic stresses on the seemingly maladapted sex to arid environments. We found that these biased interactions are evident in the current organization of sexes in the field, confirming our experimental findings. Therefore, indirect effects of climate change on population sex ratios may be expected if benefactor species abundances are differentially affected.

AB Monitoring and assessing marine biodiversity relies upon adequate and accurate knowledge of population and distribution patterns of ecologically important species. Cetaceans are recognised both as functionally important and as flagship species and have been the target of monitoring and conservation programs. The habitat specialist Indian Ocean humpback dolphin (Sousa plumbea) is the second most common cetacean in the Persian Gulf. Mousa Bay in the northwestern Persian Gulf is an important, but highly industrialised habitat for this species. We developed a systematic and comprehensive distance sampling survey carried out from 2014 to 2016 to estimate abundance and population density of humpback dolphin in this bay. To evaluate distribution pattern of the species, eight environmental variables were measured and employed in a zero-inflated generalised additive model (ZINB GAM). With an estimated abundance of 92 animals (64-131, 95% CI) and density of 0.123 animal/km(2) (0.086-0.176, 95% CI), our results revealed Mousa Bay as one of the largest population of humpback dolphin in northern latitudes of its global range. Based on ZINB GAM findings, distance to coastlines, depth, EC, and chlorophyll a concentration significantly influence the distribution of the species. Our results highlighted that physiographic parameters and resource availability are the most important motivators of the species distribution in shallow nearshore waters. Biotic (e.g. water quality) factors due to strongly being affected by the variability of time and space ranked after physiographic variables. The high tendency of humpback dolphins to enter in highly developed foreshore of Mousa Bay raise the need for conservation-oriented studies to inform conservation planning. This study provides a basis for monitoring humpback dolphin and assessing ecosystem health of northern Persian Gulf.

AB Translocations have become an increasingly valuable tool for conservation in recent years, but assessing the successfulness of translocations and identifying factors that contribute to their success continue to challenge biologists. As a unique class of translocation, population reinforcements have received relatively little attention despite representing a substantial portion of translocation programs. Here, we conducted population viability analyses to quantify the effects of 216 reinforcement scenarios on the long-term viability of four populations of Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) in Wisconsin, USA, and used multiple linear regression to identify factors that had the greatest relative influence on population viability. We considered reinforcements from outside of the study area in addition to translocations among Wisconsin populations. We observed the largest decreases in site-specific extinction probability and the largest increases in the number of sites persisting for 50years when more vulnerable populations were targeted for reinforcement. Conversely, reinforcing the most stable sites caused the greatest reduction in regional extinction probability. We found that the number of translocated hens was a comparatively poor predictor of changes in long-term population viability, whereas the earlier onset of reinforcement was consistently associated with the greatest increases in viability. Our results highlight the value of evaluating alternative reinforcement strategies a priori and considering the effects of reinforcement on metrics of long-term population persistence.

AB Assisted colonisations are increasingly being used to recover endangered or functionally extinct species. High quality habitat at release sites is known to improve the success of assisted colonisations, but defining high quality habitat can be challenging when species no longer inhabit their historical range. A partial solution to this problem is to quantify habitat use at release sites, and use results to inform assisted colonisation in the future. In this study, we quantified habitat use by the eastern barred bandicoot Perameles gunnii, functionally extinct on the Australian mainland, immediately after translocation to an island ecosystem. The release site, Churchill Island in Westernport, Victoria, Australia, has a mix of open woodlands and open pasture, providing a range of habitat conditions considered appropriate for nesting and foraging. A total of 16 bandicoots were radio-tracked for 30 d immediately post-release. Early survivorship was high (94 %), with males found to have larger home ranges and move greater distances from their first nest than females. Males and females initially used structurally complex habitats for nesting and foraging; as they became more established, males moved further from their release point and both sexes increased their use of open habitats during nightly activity. Female home ranges had limited overlap, suggesting intra-sexual territoriality. Males exhibited larger overlapping home ranges. Our results assist in quantifying habitat use of bandicoots immediately post-release and will be used to inform future assisted colonisations of the species to larger islands, in the presence of feral cats.

AB Abrasion platforms with vermetids shape unique seascapes and biotic assemblages that characterize several of the warm Mediterranean coasts. The composition, structural and seasonal dynamics of the platforms' phytobenthos were examined at two Southeast Iberian locations through non-destructive sampling. The patterns observed were linked with environmental variables and grazers' coverage, and we assessed their possible influence. Structural descriptors alpha-diversity and beta-diversity were applied, pointing that depth and season-related variables were the major influencing drivers. Higher alpha-diversity and beta-diversity values during winter and spring coincided with the production optimum of the community. A greater average water depth influences the abundance of both midlittoral and infralittoral taxa. The strong resemblance between the phytobenthos of these vermetid platforms and that on similar platforms in the Eastern and Central Mediterranean Sea suggests that these are affected by the same structuring mechanisms.

AB In this study, we isolated and characterized rock-weathering bacteria from the surfaces of less and more altered tuffs, along with the adjacent soils, with respect to their rock weathering pattern, stress resistance, community structure, and the changes in these rocks and soils. Using a moderate-nutrition medium, we obtained 150 isolates from the rocks and soils. The rock-weathering patterns of the isolates were characterized using batch cultures that measure the quantity of Si, Al, and Fe released from tuff under aerobic conditions. Based on the potential of the bacterial influence on the element releases, the isolates could be grouped into highly, moderately, and least effective element solubilizers, respectively. Significantly more highly effective Al and Fe solubilizers were observed in the altered rocks, while the soils had more highly effective Si solubilizers. Furthermore, more isolates from the altered rocks significantly acidified the culture medium in the rock weathering process. Dynamic changes in the element release showed the distinct element releasing patterns of three selected isolates. More isolates from the altered rocks could grow at 4 degrees C or at 55 degrees C or at pH 4. Some isolates from the altered rocks could grow at pH 10 and with 10-15% (w/v) NaCl. The altered rocks and the soils existed in diverse and different highly weathering-specific culturable rock-weathering community structures. The changes in the culturable weathering communities between the altered rocks and the soils were attributable not only to major bacterial groups but also to a change in the minor population structure.

AB Plankton and herbivore in aquatic ecosystems are often deeply disturbed by human exploitations in impulsive patterns. In this paper, for a herbivore-plankton interaction model with cannibalism, firstly, the complex dynamic behaviors including the number, the existence and stability of internal equilibriums, the limit and homoclinic cycles, Hopf, saddle node, Pitchfork and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations are investigated roughly. Furthermore, multiple state feedback controls are implemented so that three order-one periodic solutions (OOPSs) and heteroclinic bifurcation driven by disparate dynamics are induced, respectively. By the method of Bendixson theorem and successor function, the existences of OOPSs are proved. Finally, for the corresponding small parameter-perturbed system, B-convergent of OOPS and homoclinic bifurcation are investigated by the variational equation and the rotated vector, respectively.

AB In the period of August 2013 to September 2015, we collected and measured the body weight of 246 red fox (Vulpes vulpes) carcasses collected during hunts. A portion of these red foxes (n = 153) was originally from habitats they shared with the golden jackal (Canis aureus), while the other portion (n = 93) had almost no contact with this species. We analyzed the body weight of red foxes fromboth areas according to age (adult-cub) as well as gender. We have found that the younger animals that live sympatrically with the golden jackal weigh less than those from the golden jackal-free territory regardless of gender. In the case of adult red foxes, the habitat-related differences between body weight were found to be insignificant. These results suggest that the high level of nutritional niche overlap between sympatric red fox and golden jackal could affect the body weight of juvenile red foxes.

AB Dynamic environmental modelling of spatio-temporal systems often requires the representation of both fields and agents. Fields are continuous with values in the whole spatio-temporal domain of a model, while agents are bounded in space and often mobile. It is currently difficult for environmental modellers with limited software engineering background to construct such field-agent models, as modelling frameworks mostly do not support the integration of fields and agents. To overcome this issue, we describe a data model combining fields and agents in a single concept. This data model represents fields, agents and relations by grouping items sharing properties into a phenomenon. The concepts domain, property set and value handle spatio-temporal attribute representations. The data model is implemented in a software prototype that shows how data on fields and agents is stored and manipulated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study tries to unveil the contribution of climatic shift in shaping the extreme body size diversity in terrestrial isopods (Oniscidea). Trying to explain size variation at an interspecific level, we test five hypotheses: (1) Bergmann's Rule and the temperature-size rule postulate large size in cold areas; (2) The metabolic cold adaptation theory postulates small animal sizes in cold environments; (3) The primary productivity hypothesis predicts size increase in resource-rich areas; (4) The aridity resistance hypothesis predicts large size in arid regions; and (5). The acidosis hypothesis predicts smaller size with decreasing soil pH. Globally, Bergmann's rule and the aridity hypothesis are weakly supported. Among families and genera, results are variable and idiosyncratic. Conglobating species sizes provide weak support for the acidosis hypothesis. Overall, size is strongly affected by familial affiliation. Isopod size evolution seems to be mainly affected by phylogenetically constrained life-history traits.

AB The Egyptian weasel (Mustela subpalmata) is a small mustelid with a distribution restricted to the lower Nile Valley and the Nile Delta. Traditionally considered a subspecies of the least weasel (M. nivalis), it is currently recognized as a separate species based on morphology. Here we present the first genetic assessment of the taxonomic status of the Egyptian weasel by comparing mitochondrial DNA (Cytochrome b gene and control region) sequences to those of least weasels from the western Palearctic, with a focus on the Mediterranean region. Our results provide no evidence to support the view that the Egyptian weasel is genetically distinct from the least weasel, as we found that, for both Cytochrome b and control region, haplotypes were shared between the two taxa. Specifically, the Cytochrome b and control region haplotypes detected in the Egyptian weasel were also present in M. nivalis from Turkey and Malta, two populations genetically analysed here for the first time. Our results suggest that the Egyptian weasel is distinct from the least weasel populations currently living in the Maghreb, which were inferred to be the result of an earlier colonization of North Africa, but the genetic data alone do not allow us to determine whether the Egyptian weasel is native or introduced. Nevertheless, the observed genetic patterns, together with the weasel fossil record in Israel and the unique commensal lifestyle of the Egyptian weasel, are consistent with the hypothesis that the Egyptian population is a relict of past range expansion from the Levant into Egypt. We suggest that the large size and characteristic sexual dimorphism of the Egyptian weasel are likely to represent ecotypic variation, but genomic studies are required to clarify the extent of its functional genetic divergence.

AB In many plant species, larger flowers offer larger or higher quality rewards to visitors, and flower visitors preferentially visit these larger, more rewarding flowers. Limited evidence suggests that plants in which flower size provides more reliable information about reward value have higher reproductive success than plants in which flower size offers less reliable information. We tested whether bumblebees could learn to respond to flower size when it was an informative reward cue while simultaneously learning not to respond to it when it was not informative. We also tested whether bees would develop a preference for a flower type that provided reward cues over one that did not. Bees were allowed to forage on an artificial array containing 2 flower types, each with a unique color and scent. In the informative flower type, large flowers contained sucrose rewards, whereas small flowers contained quinine solution ( a deterrent). In the uninformative flower type, both flower sizes were equally likely to contain sucrose or quinine. Bees learned to prefer large flowers in the informative flower type and to be indifferent to flower size in the uninformative type. However, contrary to expectations, bees did not develop a preference for the informative type. These results suggest that although bees may benefit from floral cues that give information about rewards, plants offering these cues may not receive more flower visits than plants that do not.

AB The generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation with a quadratic-cubic nonlinearity is used to study the persistence and decay of localized patterns in the presence of time-periodic parametric forcing. A novel resonance phenomenon between the forcing period and the time required to nucleate one wavelength of the pattern outside the pinning region is identified. The resonance generates distinct regions in parameter space characterized by the net number of wavelengths gained or lost in one forcing cycle. These regions are well described by an asymptotic theory based on the wavelength nucleation/annihilation time near the boundaries of the pinning region. The resulting theory leads to predictions that are qualitatively correct and, in some cases, provide quantitative agreement with numerical simulations.

AB Using museum collections and recently collected specimens we studied geographical and temporal (from 1906 to 2013) changes in skull size of two sibling species of rodents, Otomys auratus and O. angoniensis, in northern South Africa occupying distinct temperate grassland (O. auratus) and subtropical savanna (O. angoniensis) biomes. We hypothesised that cranial size should vary in space and time within species according to Bergmann's Rule, which predicts an inverse relationship between body size and temperature. We used the greatest length of the skull (GLS) as a robust indicator of body size. Cranial size of both O. auratus and O. angoniensis decreased significantly over the past 100 years, as expected given historical evidence of warming across northern South Africa since the 1950s. In terms of geographical patterns, GLS was inversely correlated with both latitude and longitude in O. auratus but these trends were correlated with annual rainfall rather than mean annual temperature. Conversely, cranial size of O. angoniensis was weakly positively correlated with longitude but with no climatic variables. Our results demonstrate rapid morphological changes in two herbivorous South African rodents over the past 100 years. Whilst the general decline in size with time in relation to increased temperature is consistent with Bergmann's Rule, multiple drivers may underlie geographical trends in the two species.

AB Exposure to cement dust has been associated with deleterious health effects in humans. This study investigated whether residing near a cement factory increases the risk of irritations to the mucous membranes of the eyes and respiratory system. A cross sectional study was conducted in Freedom Compound, a community bordering a cement factory in Chilanga, Zambia and a control community, Bauleni, located 18 km from the cement plant. A modified American Thoracic Society questionnaire was administered to 225 and 198 respondents aged 15-59 years from Freedom and Bauleni, respectively, to capture symptoms of the irritations. Respondents from Freedom Compound, were more likely to experience the irritations; adjusted ORs 2.50 (95% CI: 1.65, 3.79), 4.36 (95% CI (2.96, 6.55)) and 1.94 (95% CI (1.19, 3.18)) for eye, nose and sinus membrane irritations respectively. Cohort panel studies to determine associations of cement emissions to mucous membrane irritations and respiratory symptoms, coupled with field characterization of the exposure are needed to assess whether the excess prevalence of symptoms of mucous membrane irritations observed in Freedom compound are due to emissions from the cement factory.

AB Spatiotemporal patterns, indicating the spatiotemporal variability of individual abundance, are a pronounced scenario in ecological interactions. Most of the existing models for spatiotemporal patterns treat species as homogeneous groups of individuals with average characteristics by ignoring intraspecific physiological variations at the individual level. Here we explore the impacts of size variation within species resulting from individual ontogeny, on the emergence of spatiotemporal patterns in a fully size-structured population model. We found that size dependency of animal's diffusivity greatly promotes the formation of spatiotemporal patterns, by creating regular spatiotemporal patterns out of temporal chaos. We also found that size-dependent diffusion can substitute large-amplitude base harmonics with spatiotemporal patterns with lower amplitude oscillations but with enriched harmonics. Finally, we found that the single-generation cycle is more likely to drive spatiotemporal patterns compared to predator-prey cycles, meaning that the mechanism of Hopf bifurcation might be more common than hitherto appreciated since the former cycle is more widespread than the latter in case of interacting populations. Due to the ubiquity of individual ontogeny in natural ecosystems we conclude that diffusion variability within populations is a significant driving force for the emergence of spatiotemporal patterns. Our results offer a perspective on self-organized phenomena, and pave a way to understand such phenomena in systems organized as complex ecological networks.

AB Extracellular material can play a key role in benthic ecosystems, but most of our current knowledge about extracellular material comes from marine intertidal systems. Data from lakes are lacking. We worked in Lake Opeongo, a 5800-ha dystrophic lake on the Canadian Precambrian Shield, and investigated changes in extracellular material as a function of light intensity, sediment characteristics, and disturbance regime and algal biomass, community composition, and primary production, all factors important in marine intertidal studies. We used permutation-based path analysis to test alternative models. We found a negative effect of in situ primary production on loosely bound, colloidal extracellular material, indicating that extracellular material may be released under stressful conditions. The effect of algal community composition on colloidal extracellular material also was significant. Total extracellular material was affected only by time of year, indicating that tightly bound, capsular extracellular material is more refractory than colloidal extracellular material. We found no significant effects of environmental factors (light, nutrients, or wind-driven disturbance) on either colloidal or total extracellular material, despite their importance in marine intertidal systems.

AB Ecosystem dynamics provides an interesting arena for the application of a plethora concepts and techniques from statistical mechanics. Here I review three examples corresponding each one to an important problem in ecology. First, I start with an analytical derivation of clumpy patterns for species relative abundances (SRA) empirically observed in several ecological communities involving a high number n of species, a phenomenon which have puzzled ecologists for decades. An interesting point is that this derivation uses results obtained from a statistical mechanics model for ferromagnets. Second, going beyond the mean field approximation, I study the spatial version of a popular ecological model involving just one species representing vegetation. The goal is to address the phenomena of catastrophic shifts-gradual cumulative variations in some control parameter that suddenly lead to an abrupt change in the system-illustrating it by means of the process of desertification of arid lands. The focus is on the aggregation processes and the effects of diffusion that combined lead to the formation of non trivial spatial vegetation patterns. It is shown that different quantities-like the variance, the two-point correlation function and the patchiness-may serve as early warnings for the desertification of arid lands. Remarkably, in the onset of a desertification transition the distribution of vegetation patches exhibits scale invariance typical of many physical systems in the vicinity a phase transition. I comment on similarities of and differences between these catastrophic shifts and paradigmatic thermodynamic phase transitions like the liquid-vapor change of state for a fluid. Third, I analyze the case of many species interacting in space. I choose tropical forests, which are mega-diverse ecosystems that exhibit remarkable dynamics. Therefore these ecosystems represent a research paradigm both for studies of complex systems dynamics as well as to unveil the mechanisms responsible for the assembly of species-rich communities. The more classical equilibrium approaches are compared versus non-equilibrium ones and in particular I discuss a recently introduced cellular automaton model in which species compete both locally in physical space and along a niche axis.

AB The Late Quaternary, presumed bathyal foraminiferal fauna in ODP Hole 1006A (Santaren Channel, west of the Bahama Platform) does not show marked glacial-interglacial contrasts. Instead, a major regime shift occurred during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 8-9 from one steady community structure to another.
   ODP Hole 1006A was drilled through the Santaren Drift, a contourite containing an admixture of foraminifera of a) reefal and inner-neritic (0-20 m) and b) deeper-water aspect. The deeper-water assemblage, which includes species with habitats that encompass outer-neritic (100-200 m) abyssal depths, is for statistical purposes here treated as being in situ. Of the benthonic foraminifera collected from 66 Late Quaternary (MIS 1-17) samples in this study, 60.9% comprise the presumed bathyal assemblage. Percentages of presumed bathyal specimens/sample are unrelated to most marine isotope stages, but are low in MIS 8-9. Sedimentology indicates that the fluctuations were not caused by turbidites and debris flows delivering shallow-water foraminifera from the Bahama Platform and Cay Sal Bank to the site, but possibly from a source off northern Cuba or Hispaniola. Some species abundance counts (e.g., Cassidulina laevigata, Lenticulina rotulata) may have been augmented by downslope transport. Others (e.g., Globocassidulina subglobosa, Sigmoilopsis schlumbergeri) are predominantly in situ.
   Only three species each (Globocassidulina subglobosa, Planulina ariminensis, Cibicidoides pachyderma) formed >5% of the total recovery of the presumed bathyal foraminiferal assemblage, but Cibicidoides spp. collectively formed 18.9%, while Uvigerina spp., Brizalina spp., and Bulimina spp. collectively formed 12.8%, indicating a low flux of organic carbon. The mean information function was higher in the subsection below MIS 9 (H = 3.56) than above MIS 8 (H = 3.40), but the mean percentages of Uvigerina spp., Brizalina spp., and Bulimina spp. did not differ, which suggests that there was little change in the organic flux. Instead, the regime shift may have been related to a change in the flux of shallow-water foraminifera, which was greater after MIS 8 than before MIS 9, or to long-term circulation changes. The subsections across the regime shift were separated by a Type-1 beta boundary, but a complementarity of 76.5 indicates that the interval MIS 8-9 did not act as a barrier to species continuance.

AB Surface water is one of the constraining resources for herbivore populations in semi-arid regions. Artificial waterpoints are constructed by wildlife managers to supplement natural water supplies, to support herbivore populations. The aim of this paper is to analyse how a landowner may realize his ecological and economic goals by manipulating waterpoints for the management of an elephant population, a water-dependent species in the presence of water-independent species. We develop a theoretical bio-economic framework to analyse the optimization of wildlife management objectives (in this case revenue generation from both consumptive and non-consumptive use and biodiversity conservation), using waterpoint construction as a control variable. The model provides a bio-economic framework for analysing optimization problems where a control has direct effects on one herbivore species but indirect effects on the other. A landowner may be interested only in maximization of profits either from elephant offtake and/or tourism revenue, ignoring the negative effects that could be brought about by elephants to biodiversity. If the landowner does not take the indirect effects of waterpoints into consideration, then the game reserve management, as the authority entrusted with the sustainable management of the game reserve, might use economic instruments such as subsidies or taxes to the landowners to enforce sound waterpoint management.

AB The aim is to review landscape ecology and the contribution it can make to sustainable rangeland management, using Australia as an example. An examination is made of how much traditional ecology, as a discipline, influences landscape ecology in Australia. Also evaluated is whether, under this influence, landscape ecology is emerging as effectively as it could be as a trans-disciplinary science that can contribute significantly to rangeland sustainability. Surveys of landscape ecologists in Australia make it possible to classify Australian landscape ecology as being unidirectional interdisciplinary' in approach, with ecology being the coordinating discipline. The important contribution that research under this classification provides in terms of understanding structure, process, and change in rangelands is recognised and acknowledged. However, the question is raised as to whether following an ecological construct is constraining the application of landscape ecology more widely to address the complex environmental problems facing Australia's (and the world's) rangelands that also require consideration of the social and geographical aspects of landscapes. Recent shifts in the landscape ecological paradigm towards a science for sustainability that links science and practice, with particular focus on landscape design, social and cultural aspects of landscapes, and the value associated with landscape services, make landscape ecology increasingly more useful as a goal-oriented' approach for addressing rangeland sustainability. This paper suggests that those involved in rangeland management need to consider landscape ecology within its wider context. In doing so, it is argued that they should explore the possibilities it has to offer in dealing with development and management of rangelands, including interrelationships between people and landscapes, and to ensure ecosystem goods and services valued by people are preserved.

AB Natural and semi-natural landscapes usually serve varied land uses, including grazing, forestry, recreation, and nature or biodiversity protection. In most cases areas with differing land uses are managed by different agencies, with differing perspectives, goals, and operating methodologies. In his teaching, Imanuel Noy-Meir emphasized the ecological basis of the management of principal land-use practices (forests, rangelands, nature reserves) in Mediterranean Israel, and advocated ecological thinking to achieve better management and to minimize inter-agency conflicts. We propose a broader framework for integrated management of multiple uses by adoption of a landscape perspective that cuts across administrative lines. The reasoning for taking such an approach is based on the newly developing understanding of the impact of dynamic processes that occur spontaneously on a large scale in Mediterranean Israel. Landscape-scale interactions-oak woodland succession and pine colonization-may interfere or even conflict with some management goals set by the agencies involved. Attempts to mitigate these interactions may be very costly or ineffective. We propose coordinated management, planning, and implementation, based on common ecological criteria. We base this paper on observations and on perceptions gained from analyzing landscape dynamics of the predominant ecosystems in Mediterranean Israel: dense oak woodland and planted pine forests. The small size of Israel and the consequently small size of different land-use units, as well as their close proximity to each other, call for coordination of the organizational perspectives that relate at present independently to the various units. The new perspective should be broader, regional, landscape-oriented, and should take into consideration ecological processes that integrate neighboring units. As a first step, all agencies involved should accept the pine-oak interaction and dynamics as part of the local succession and should adapt their management schemes accordingly.

AB Lake Kinneret (LK) is a monomictic lake that has undergone significant biological and chemical changes over the last three decades of the twentieth century. The transition between the 1970s and the 1980s attracted a lot of scientific attention as it was marked by significant changes in the ecology of the lake. In the early 1980s, phytoplankton biomass increased, apparently in response to an increase in the external soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) load. This period was marked by a rise in hypolimnetic levels of ammonium (NH4) and SRP as well as surface water dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH. Cconcomitantly, in surface waters in winter levels of NH4 increased and NO3 decreased. In this study interrelationships amongst these observations were examined with a mass balance modelling approach, including simulation of individual nutrient sources and sinks, focusing on nitrogen fluxes in winter. The step-like rise in phytoplankton biomass in 1981 may have been triggered by the increase in winter external loads of SRP, as P is likely to be the growth-limiting nutrient during this season. The additional P load led to a sequence of changes including greater summer phytoplankton biomass, followed by enhanced sedimentation of organic matter. Furthermore, higher organic matter mineralization fluxes within the hypolimnion resulted in elevated levels of NH4 and SRP in this layer through the 1980s, with a feedback to productivity in the trophogenic zone following seasonal destratification in early winter. In an apparent transition period (late 1970s to early 1980s), an increase in the modelled rate of nitrate (NO3) production occurred via nitrification together with increased uptake of the additional nitrate by phytoplankton. These results are consistent with increased phytoplankton abundance and elevated levels of surface water NH4 and DO during this period. Through this period the increase in phytoplankton uptake of NO3 predominated over the increase in nitrification, and NO3 concentrations in the 1980s were reduced compared with the previous decade, with increased partitioning of N in biomass and NH4.

AB Forest seed banks mostly studied in managed forests proved to be small, species poor and not reflecting above-ground species composition. Yet studies conducted in undisturbed communities indicate a different seed bank characteristic. Therefore we aimed at describing soil seed bank in an undisturbed forest in a remnant of European lowland temperate forests, the Bialowieza Forest. We compared similarity between the herb layer and seed bank, similarity of seed bank between different patches, and dominance structure of species in the herb layer and in the seed bank of two related oak-hornbeam communities. We report relatively high values of Sorensen species similarity index between herb layer and seed bank of both patches. This suggests higher species similarity of the herb layer and soil seed bank in natural, unmanaged forests represented by both plots than in fragmented communities influenced by man. Although there was a set of core seed bank species present at both plots, yielding high Sorensen species similarity index values, considerable differences between plots in seed bank size and dominance structure of species were found, indicating spatial variability of studied seed bank generated by edaphic conditions. Dominance structure of species in the herb layer was not reflected in the underlying seed bank. This stresses, that natural forest regeneration cannot rely only on the seed bank, although some forest species are capable of forming soil seed banks. While forest seed banks may not reflect vegetation composition of past successional stages, they may inform on history and land use of a specific plot.

AB The problem of when an action should be abandoned because it is not worth further effort occurs in many situations. In the spatial domain, the relevant information can be quantified. Two essential pieces of information are the precision with which the target location and the probability of the target being present are known. We offer a quantitative description of optimal solutions to cache retrieval, treating it as a 2D investment problem with search cost proportional to area. We estimated the value of knowing the precision of spatial information and the precision of information regarding probability: how precisely should you estimate the precision of your knowledge? We compared the expected gain from assessing the precision of spatial knowledge and probability with the expected gain from decisions based on aggregate knowledge of the distribution of precision and probability. We found that heuristics, represented here as default search limits based on aggregate knowledge, are useful only under limited conditions. (C) 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB International research and development efforts in Africa have brought ecological and social change, but analyzing the consequences of this change and developing policy to manage it for sustainable development has been difficult. This has been largely due to a lack of conceptual and analytical models to access the interacting dynamics of the different components of ecosocial systems. Here, we examine the ecological and social changes resulting from an ongoing suppression of trypanosomiasis disease in cattle in an agropastoral community in southwest Ethiopia to illustrate how such problems may be addressed. The analysis combines physiologically based demographic models of pasture, cattle, and pastoralists and a bioeconomic model that includes the demographic models as dynamic constraints in the economic objective function that maximizes the utility of individual consumption under different level of disease risk in cattle. Field data and model analysis show that suppression of trypanosomiasis leads to increased cattle and human populations and to increased agricultural development. However, in the absence of sound management, these changes will lead to a decline in pasture quality and increase the risk from tick-borne diseases in cattle and malaria in humans that would threaten system sustainability and resilience. The analysis of these conflicting outcomes of trypanosomiasis suppression is used to illustrate the need for and utility of conceptual bioeconomic models to serve as a basis for developing policy for sustainable agropastoral resource management in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB I introduced forest dynamics to a deterministic herbivore-vegetation model to examine the effects of vertically stratified forest structure on the dynamics of the herbivore-vegetation system, the resilience and stable states of vegetation, and the interactions between deer populations and vegetation. I constructed a model based on data from field studies performed in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Three phases of state were identified for a given deer density: (1) understory vegetation is maintained with a equilibrium proportion of canopy gaps in the absence of deer; (2) if the equilibrium proportion of canopy gaps is greater than that in the equilibrium state in the absence of deer, the understory vegetation can be maintained; and (3) the understory vegetation cannot be maintained. At the boundary between phases 2 and 3, the herbivore population level had discontinuous effects on vegetation. When the deer density was held below the threshold, forest vegetation had resilience to recover to the equilibrium stable state at the given deer density, although the equilibrium canopy gap ratio and vegetation biomass differed with deer density. However, the forest vegetation-herbivore system could not be maintained in a stable state without artificial deer population management if food limitation was the only mechanism to keep the deer population at low levels. The deer population must be kept below the boundary between phases 1 and 2 to maintain the forest regeneration processes. The level cannot be determined by observing the deer population; careful observation of forest regeneration processes is required.

AB We conducted aerial surveys of dugongs (Dugong dugon) using the line-transect method and snorkeling surveys of dugong feeding trails in 1998 and 1999 around Okinawa Island (26 degrees 30'N, 128 degrees 00'E) and the Sakishima Islands, southern Japan. A total of ten dugongs were sighted and feeding trails were confirmed in the sea grass beds off the east coast of Okinawa Island. In the Sakishima Islands, however, no dugongs were observed, and there was no evidence of feeding trails despite the existence of apparently suitable sea grass beds for feeding. The results of these surveys and other available information suggest that Okinawan dugongs represent a small, geographically isolated population. Our sightings of dugongs during the daytime, offshore of sea grass beds where feeding trails were recorded, suggest that Okinawan dugongs principally feed at night when human activities are limited. Survival of this remnant dugong population is threatened by habitat degradation and occasional entanglement mortality in fishing nets.

AB Cytogenetic data are increasingly being used in taxonomic analyses and can also be used to investigate phylogenetic patterns. Additionally, studies on genotoxicity using cytogenetic analyses have been demonstrated as an useful tool for biomonitoring. The endangered limpet Patella ferruginea was investigated under karyo and cytological analyses in order to explore the taxonomic status of the two different forms of the species, the phylogenetic relationships and to show up its suitability for future biomonitoring programs. The haploid complement was of n = 9 (5 metacentric, 1 meta-submetacentric, 1 submetacentric, 1 subtelocentric, 1 telocentric), and the ideograms of the two forms failed to establish taxonomic separation between them. P. ferruginea is close to P. rustica according to the karyotypes and recent molecular studies, Finally, several nuclear abnormalities have been detected in the species that could be useful for monitoring the cytotoxic effects on the endangered populations of the species.

AB Seedling survival of the dwarf shrub Sarcopoterium spinosum growing on hilly terra rossa soil was monitored between 2000 and 2004 on forty 1 x 1-m quadrats, each of which contained a single shrub. Of the 40 shrubs, 20 (designated P+) received a dressing of super-phosphate in 1988 and 20 (designated P-) did not. After seed dispersal in 1999, the shrubs were uprooted to prevent further addition of seeds. Seed dispersal was monitored up to 50 cm from the edge of the mother shrub. There were large year-to-year differences in emergence that were not clearly related to the rainfall distribution. On the P+ quadrats the peak biomass of herbaceous vegetation was consistently greater and the number of emergent seedlings was consistently smaller than on the P- quadrats, but seedling survival was not related to differences in herbaceous biomass. Our main conclusions are: S. spinosum germination is extremely erratic from year to year; only 0.5 of an average of 8-14 seedlings m(-2) that emerged, survived the first summer; these survivors had a good chance of becoming established plants; seedlings can become established in dense herbaceous vegetation; seedling dispersal was limited to 50 cm from the edge of the shrub; the current soil seed bank can maintain recruitment for at least 5 years without replenishment.

AB Consumer-resource systems may present complex dynamical behavior due to multiplicity of steady states, initial conditions and/or critical parameter values. Threshold policies are one of the strategies employed to exploit these systems. It is shown that proper combinations of the threshold densities and harvesting effort intensities based on virtual equilibrium can yield desirable results from the management point of view despite the possible dynamical complexities in single as well as in multi-species population models.

ID DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; FOOD; STABILITY; RAINFALL; CLIMATE
AB Time series analysis of herbivore data with weather included as covariate is commonly used as a mean to shed light on the state and ecology of the studied population. Conclusions about the herbivore population are drawn from statistical parameter values and presence/absence in the most parsimonious model. However, this procedure is only reliable if the statistical parameters have general interpretations regardless of system characteristics. Here we investigated the extent to which this is true by deriving six different vegetation-herbivore-systems and analyzing their respective statistical parameters. The analysis was done in both continuous and discrete time. It turned out that both density parameters (a(1) and a(2)) and rainfall coefficients change with biological interactions and amount of average rainfall, and they do so in different ways in different systems. This means that there is no valid general interpretation of them and, most important, the probability of detecting density dependence and effects of rainfall vary between systems. Hence, you can not make inference about the biological processes from statistical analysis without knowing the system that you study and what model best describes the interactions within it.

AB An analysis of the faecal pellets of two species of arid-zone mouse, the house mouse (Mus domesticus) and Lakeland Downs short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis), inhabiting Thevenard Island in Western Australia was conducted to ascertain their dietary requirements, and to use this information to predict their feeding rates in the field. Both species consumed seed, monocotyledon and dicotyledon plant material and invertebrate material, although the relative frequency-of-occurrence of these items varied throughout the year. Invertebrate material formed the highest proportion of dietary intake for both rodent species at all times, suggesting that this dietary strategy is advantageous for rodent species that inhabit environments where plant seeding is seasonal and rainfall dependent. The dry-matter intake (DMI) of free-ranging M. domesticus and L. lakedownensis was predicted and compared using information from two sources: their isotopic water fluxes and the water content of their diet, and their isotopic sodium fluxes and the sodium content of their diet with and without corrections for non-dietary (exogenous) sources of sodium. The DMI derived from the water turnover was high for both species, suggesting that the mice were drinking and that assumptions inherent in this calculation were violated. Feeding rates were also high if no correction was made for exogenous, non-dietary sodium. When corrections were made, however, M. domesticus was predicted to ingest 4.62 +/- 0.20 g dry matter day(-1) compared with 3.86 +/- 0.23 g dry matter day(-1) for L. lakedownensis. When DMI was scaled on the basis of allometric predictions for desert eutherians, only estimates of DMI for M. domesticus fell outside the predicted 95% confidence intervals. The results presented suggest that M. domesticus were obtaining some sodium from sources additional to their diet. Taken together, this methodology provides a useful application for measuring the feeding rate of free-ranging species given known dietary requirements in the field.

ID PHYLOGENETICALLY INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS; DNA HYBRIDIZATION; CLUTCH SIZE;
   EVOLUTION; ECOLOGY
AB Classical polyandry in birds is rare and is most Frequent in the shorebirds (Charadriiformes). Polyandrous shorebirds lag. smaller eggs for their body masses than non-polyandrous shorebirds, indicating that polyandrous female shorebirds may trade egg size off against number of eggs in order to maximize reproductive success. However, this trade-off may be confounded by phylogeny because most polyandrous species belong to a single Family, the Jacanidae. I re-analysed this adaptive hypothesis using phylogenetically-independent contrast analyses. These analyses showed that there was no statistically significant difference in egg size between polyandrous and monogamous short birds once the effects of phylogeny had been incorporated. This is one of the first studies to show that the results of independent contrasts analyses differ from those where phylogenetic effects have not been taken into account.

AB The community of spiders that burrow into the sand dunes of the northwestern Negev Desert was examined. Nine species were found, of which only two occurred on the unconsolidated, active dunes. The remainder occurred on the fixed bases of the dunes and the interdune depressions that were mostly covered by a biological crust. All spiders that dug their own burrows constructed vertical tunnels, which they excavated by carrying silk-sand bundles. Observations of Cerbalus psammodes (Heteropodidae) revealed it to be the Nagev counterpart of the dominant heteropodid spiders occurring in the Namib dunes. Parallel characteristics include its large size, the method of burrow stabilization (but not of excavation), nocturnal activity, 1-2 m home ranges, predation on tenebrionid beetles, sexual size dimorphism, and maternal care.

AB The abundance and spatial distributions of Millepora complanata and Millepora squarrosa were determined from contiguous, m(2) quadrats laid out along transects on three fringing reefs at Barbados, W.I. Spatial pattern of millepore colonies, determined by an analysis of variance at increasing, hierarchical block sizes, indicated clumped or contagious distributions. It is concluded that the patchy distribution of M. complanata is due to stolonal growth of colony bases and to breakage and reattachment of colony branches. The patchy distribution of M. squarrosa is more Likely due to settlement preferences and differential survival of recruits. The life-history strategies of M. complanata which lead to contagious distributions would be advantageous in competition for space on coral reefs.

TI GRAZING OF FORESTED GRASSLAND AND ITS CONSERVATION
SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
LA English
DT Article
ID STABILITY
AB A mathematical model for the depletion of grass biomass due to overgrazing by cattle migrating from plains to forested grassland is proposed and analysed. A model for conservation of the grass biomass is also suggested.
   It is shown that the grass biomass could vanish if overgrazing continued without any control. However, if appropriate effort is applied, the grass biomass can be maintained to its original level even under continued grazing.

SO CORAL REEFS
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGAL
AB Constructional lips and cup reef rims are little studied reef features typical of very turbulent conditions.  The relatively low diversity community of these structures consists of three components, an algal mat dominated by Herposiphonia secunda, an encrusting calcareous biota characterised by crutose coralline algae and the vermetid gastropod Dendropoma corrodens, which together are the main hermatypic components, and an endolithic component with very abundant boring sponges, polychaetes, crustaceans and sipunculids.  In northerly areas of Bermuda, the hydrozoan Millepora alcicornis is a prominent member of the community while to the south the urchin Echinometra lucunter is abundant.  On the south side of Bermuda the community traps sediment which is deposited in the void spaces.  The environment shows reduced grazing and this may account for the presence of several relict and rare species.

DE Ethics; ethical decision making; stakeholders; authorship; sexual

ID BUSINESS; MODEL
AB Ethical decision making has long been recognized as critical for industrial-organizational (I-O) psychologists in the variety of roles they fill in education, research, and practice. Decisions with ethical implications are not always readily apparent and often require consideration of competing concerns. The American Psychological Association (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct are the principles and standards to which all Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP) members are held accountable, and these principles serve to aid in decision making. To this end, the primary focus of this article is the presentation and application of an integrative ethical decision-making framework rooted in and inspired by empirical, philosophical, and practical considerations of professional ethics. The purpose of this framework is to provide a generalizable model that can be used to identify, evaluate, resolve, and engage in discourse about topics involving ethical issues. To demonstrate the efficacy of this general framework to contexts germane to I-O psychologists, we subsequently present and apply this framework to five scenarios, each involving an ethical situation relevant to academia, practice, or graduate education in I-O psychology. With this article, we hope to stimulate the refinement of this ethical decision-making model, illustrate its application in our profession, and, most importantly, advance conversations about ethical decision making in I-O psychology.

AB Current industrial bioethanol production by yeast through fermentation generates carbon dioxide. Carbon neutral bioethanol production by cyanobacteria uses biological fixation (photosynthesis) of carbon dioxide or other waste inorganic carbon sources, whilst being sustainable and renewable. The first ethanologenic cyanobacterial process was developed over two decades ago using Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, by incorporating the recombinant pdc and adh genes from Zymomonas mobilis. Further engineering has increased bioethanol titres 24-fold, yet current levels are far below what is required for industrial application. At the heart of the problem is that the rate of carbon fixation cannot be drastically accelerated and carbon partitioning towards bioethanol production impacts on cell fitness. Key progress has been achieved by increasing the precursor pyruvate levels intracellularly, upregulating synthetic genes and knocking out pathways competing for pyruvate. Studies have shown that cyanobacteria accumulate high proportions of carbon reserves that are mobilised under specific environmental stresses or through pathway engineering to increase ethanol production. When used in conjunction with specific genetic knockouts, they supply significantly more carbon for ethanol production. This review will discuss the progress in generating ethanologenic cyanobacteria through chassis engineering, and exploring the impact of environmental stresses on increasing carbon flux towards ethanol production.

AB The Regional Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment (ROPME) Sea Area (RSA) in the northern Indian Ocean, which comprises the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the northern Arabian Sea, already experiences naturally extreme environmental conditions and incorporates one of the world's warmest seas. There is growing evidence that climate change is already affecting the environmental conditions of the RSA, in areas including sea temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and sea level, which are set to continue changing over time. The cumulative impacts of these changes on coastal and marine ecosystems and dependent societies are less well documented, but are likely to be significant, especially in the context of other human stressors. This review represents the first regional synthesis of observed and predicted climate change impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems across the ROPME Sea Area and their implications for dependent societies. Climate-driven ecological changes include loss of coral reefs due to bleaching and the decline of fish populations, while socio-economic impacts include physical impacts from sea-level rise and cyclones, risk to commercial wild capture fisheries, disruption to desalination systems and loss of tourism. The compilation of this review is aimed to support the development of targeted adaptation actions and to direct future research within the RSA.

AB Invasive alien species (IAS) are a major threat to insular vertebrates, although the ecological characteristics that make insular communities vulnerable to IAS are poorly understood. After describing the ecological strategies of 6015 insular amphibians, birds, lizards, and mammals, we assessed the functional and ecological features of vertebrates exposed to IAS. We found that at least 50% of insular amphibian functional richness was hosted by IAS-threatened amphibians and up to 29% for birds. Moreover, all IAS-threatened groups except birds harbored a higher functional richness than species groups threatened by other threats. Disentangling the ecological strategies threatened by IAS, compared to those associated with other threats, we showed that birds, lizards, and mammals were more likely to be terrestrial foragers and amphibians to have larval development. By contrast, large-bodied species and habitat specialists were universally threatened. By considering the functional aspect of threatened insular diversity, our work improves our understanding of global IAS impacts. This new dimension proves essential for undertaking relevant and effective conservation actions.

AB Temporal shifts to drier climates impose environmental stresses on plant communities that may result in community reassembly and threatened ecosystem services, but also may trigger self-organization in spatial patterns of biota and resources, which act to relax these stresses. The complex relationships between these counteracting processes - community reassembly and spatial self-organization - have hardly been studied. Using a spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities and a trait-based approach, we study the response of such communities to increasing water-deficit stress. We first show that spatial patterning acts to reverse shifts from fast-growing species to stress-tolerant species, as well as to reverse functional-diversity loss. We then show that spatial self-organization buffers the impact of further stress on community structure. Finally, we identify multistability ranges of uniform and patterned community states and use them to propose forms of non-uniform ecosystem management that integrate the need for provisioning ecosystem services with the need to preserve community structure.

AB Hypersaline microbial mats are dense microbial ecosystems capable of performing complete element cycling and are considered analogs of early Earth and hypothetical extraterrestrial ecosystems. We studied the functionality and limits of key biogeochemical processes, such as photosynthesis, aerobic respiration, and sulfur cycling, in salt crust-covered microbial mats from a tidal flat at the coast of Oman. We measured light, oxygen, and sulfide microprofiles as well as sulfate reduction rates at salt saturation and in flood conditions and determined fine-scale stratification of pigments, biomass, and microbial taxa in the resident microbial community. The salt crust did not protect the mats against irradiation or evaporation. Although some oxygen production was measurable at salinities of <= 30% (wt/vol) in situ, at saturation-level salinity (40%), oxygenic photosynthesis was completely inhibited and only resumed 2 days after reducing the porewater salinity to 12%. Aerobic respiration and active sulfur cycling occurred at low rates under salt saturation and increased strongly upon salinity reduction. Apart from high relative abundances of Chloroflexi, photoheterotrophic Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Archaea, the mat contained a distinct layer harboring filamentous Cyanobacteria, which is unusual for such high salinities. Our results show that the diverse microbial community inhabiting this salt flat mat ultimately depends on periodic salt dilution to be selfsustaining and is rather adapted to merely survive salt saturation than to thrive under the salt crust.
   IMPORTANCE Due to their abilities to survive intense radiation and low water availability, hypersaline microbial mats are often suggested to be analogs of potential extraterrestrial life. However, even the limitations imposed on microbial processes by saturation-level salinity found on Earth have rarely been studied in situ. While abundance and diversity of microbial life in salt-saturated environments are well documented, most of our knowledge on process limitations stems from culture-based studies, few in situ studies, and theoretical calculations. In particular, oxygenic photosynthesis has barely been explored beyond 5 M NaCl (28% wt/vol). By applying a variety of biogeochemical and molecular methods, we show that despite abundance of photoautotrophic microorganisms, oxygenic photosynthesis is inhibited in salt-crust-covered microbial mats at saturation salinities, while rates of other energy generation processes are decreased several-fold. Hence, the complete element cycling required for self-sustaining microbial communities only occurs at lower salt concentrations.

AB Background Environmental conditions on Earth are repeated in non-random patterns that often coincide with species from different regions and time periods having consistent combinations of morphological, physiological and behavioral traits. Observation of repeated trait combinations among species confronting similar environmental conditions suggest that adaptive trait combinations are constrained by functional tradeoffs within or across niche dimensions. In an earlier study, we assembled a high-resolution database of functional traits for 134 lizard species to explore ecological diversification in relation to five fundamental niche dimensions. Here we expand and further examine multivariate relationships in that dataset to assess the relative influence of niche dimensions on the distribution of species in 6-dimensional niche space and how these may deviate from distributions generated from null models. We then analyzed a dataset with lower functional-trait resolution for 1023 lizard species that was compiled from our dataset and a published database, representing most of the extant families and environmental conditions occupied by lizards globally. Ordinations from multivariate analysis were compared with null models to assess how ecological and historical factors have resulted in the conservation, divergence or convergence of lizard niches. Results Lizard species clustered within a functional niche volume influenced mostly by functional traits associated with diet, activity, and habitat/substrate. Consistent patterns of trait combinations within and among niche dimensions yielded 24 functional groups that occupied a total niche space significantly smaller than plausible spaces projected by null models. Null model tests indicated that several functional groups are strongly constrained by phylogeny, such as nocturnality in the Gekkota and the secondarily acquired sit-and-wait foraging strategy in Iguania. Most of the widely distributed and species-rich families contained multiple functional groups thereby contributing to high incidence of niche convergence. Conclusions Comparison of empirical patterns with those generated by null models suggests that ecological filters promote limited sets of trait combinations, especially where similar conditions occur, reflecting both niche convergence and conservatism. Widespread patterns of niche convergence following ancestral niche diversification support the idea that lizard niches are defined by trait-function relationships and interactions with environment that are, to some degree, predictable and independent of phylogeny.

AB Ecosystem patterning can arise from environmental heterogeneity, biological feedbacks that produce multiple persistent ecological states, or their interaction. One source of feedbacks is density-dependent changes in behaviour that regulate species interactions. By fitting state-space models to large-scale (similar to 500 km) surveys on temperate rocky reefs, we find that behavioural feedbacks best explain why kelp and urchin barrens form either reef-wide patches or local mosaics. Best-supported models in California include feedbacks where starvation intensifies grazing across entire reefs create reef-scale, alternatively stable kelp- and urchin-dominated states (32% of reefs). Best-fitting models in New Zealand include the feedback of urchins avoiding dense kelp stands that can increase abrasion and predation risk, which drives a transition from shallower urchin-dominated to deeper kelp-dominated zones, with patchiness at 3-8 m depths with intermediate wave stress. Connecting locally studied processes with region-wide data, we highlight how behaviour can explain community patterning and why some systems exhibit community-wide alternative stable states.

AB Throughout the Negev Desert highlands, thousands of ancient petroglyphs sites are susceptible to deterioration processes that may result in the loss of this unique rock art. Therefore, the overarching goal of the current study was to characterize the composition, diversity and effects of microbial colonization of the rocks to find ways of protecting these unique treasures. The spatial organization of the microbial colonizers and their relationships with the lithic substrate were analysed using scanning electron microscopy. This approach revealed extensive epilithic and endolithic colonization and close microbial-mineral interactions. Shotgun sequencing analysis revealed various taxa from the archaea, bacteria and some eukaryotes. Metagenomic coding sequences (CDS) of these microbial lithobionts exhibited specific metabolic pathways involved in the rock elements' cycles and uptake processes. Thus, our results provide evidence for the potential participation of the microorganisms colonizing these rocks during different solubilization and mineralization processes. These damaging actions may contribute to the deterioration of this extraordinary rock art and thus threaten this valuable heritage. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing, in conjunction with the in situ scanning electron microscopy study, can thus be considered an effective strategy to understand the complexity of the weathering processes occurring at petroglyph sites and other cultural heritage assets.

AB Sea level rise (SLR), driven by anthropogenic climate change, can be a major threat to coastal ecosystems. Among the most biologically diverse but SLR-threatened coastal ecosystems are rocky shores, especially in regions with a small tidal range. Nonetheless, the impacts of SLR on rocky shore biodiversity, community structure and ecosystem functions have rarely been studied. Here, we use the biogenic intertidal ecosystem, Mediterranean vermetid reefs on the Israeli coast, as case study for testing the potential impact of SLR on reef communities, with surveys, 3D topographic mapping plus SLR simulations, and a manipulative community translocation experiment. We show that: (1) biodiversity is much lower on very shallow, permanently submerged, horizontal rocky surfaces compared to that on intertidal reef platforms, (2) the extensive intertidal platforms will permanently drown under even modest SLR scenarios, (3) the rich intertidal community will transform, when permanently submerged, either to a very different but still rich community when protected from grazing by highly abundant invasive fish (rabbitfish), or to a much poorer turf community when exposed to such fish grazing, and (4) the reef community net production will drastically drop under permanent submersion. Because the main ecosystem engineer of the vermetid reefs, Dendropoma anguliferum (Monterosato, 1878), is nearly extinct in the southeast Levant, it is unlikely that new reefs will be formed higher on the shore in the future, presumably resulting in extensive coastal ecological shifts. Considerable coastal community shifts are forecasted for many regions globally due to SLR, as many shorelines are predicted to suffer from "coastal squeeze". Hence, similar manipulative experiments are encouraged in other regions to test for generality vs. context dependency in SLR ecological impacts. We suggest that in cases where essential/unique intertidal habitats like vermetid reefs are expected to vanish by SLR, constructing carefully-planned, ecologically friendly, artificial alternatives should be considered .

AB China is a country with one of the most species-rich reptile faunas in the world. However, nearly a quarter of Chinese lizard species assessed by the China Biodiversity Red List are threatened. Nevertheless, to date, no study has explicitly examined the pattern and processes of extinction and threat in Chinese lizards. In this study, we conducted the first comparative phylogenetic analysis of extinction risk in Chinese lizards. We addressed the following 3 questions: (1) What is the pattern of extinction and threat in Chinese lizards? (2) Which species traits and extrinsic factors are related to their extinction risk? (3) How can we protect Chinese lizards based on our results? We collected data on 10 species traits (body size [BS], clutch size, geographic range size, activity time, reproductive mode, habitat specialization [HS], habitat use, leg development, maximum elevation, and elevation range) and 7 extrinsic factors (mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature, mean annual solar insolation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), human footprint, human population density, and human exploitation). After phylogenetic correction, these variables were used separately and in combination to assess their associations with extinction risk. We found that Chinese lizards with a small geographic range, large BS, high HS, and living in high MAP areas were vulnerable to extinction. Conservation priority should thus be given to species with the above extinction-prone traits so as to effectively protect Chinese lizards. Preventing future habitat destruction should also be a primary focus of management efforts because species with small range size and high HS are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss.

AB The evolution of key innovations-unique features that enable a lineage to interact with the environment in a novel way-may drive broad patterns of adaptive diversity. However, traditional tests of the key innovation hypothesis, those which attempt to identify the evolutionary effect of a purported key innovation by comparing patterns of diversity between lineages with and without the key trait, have been challenged on both conceptual and statistical grounds. Here, we explore alternative, untested hypotheses of the key innovation framework. In lizards, adhesive toepad structures increase grip strength on vertical and smooth surfaces such as tree trunks and leaves and have independently evolved multiple times. As such, toepads have been posited as a key innovation for the evolution of arboreality. Leveraging a habitat use data set applied to a global phylogeny of 2692 lizard species, we estimated multiple origins of toepads in three major clades and more than 100 origins of arboreality widely across the phylogeny. Our results suggest that toepads arise adaptively in arboreal lineages and are subsequently rarely lost while maintaining arboreal ecologies. Padless lineages transition away from arboreality at a higher rate than those with toepads, and high rates of invasion of arboreal niches by nonarboreal padbearing lineages provide further evidence that toepads may be a key to unlocking evolutionary access to the arboreal zone. Our results and analytical framework provide novel insights to understand and evaluate the ecological and evolutionary consequences of key innovations.

AB Calcium silicate slag (CSS) is a secondary solid waste produced by the technology of extracting Al2O3 from fly ash. CSS was used in the present study to replace part of the cement to prepare cementitious composites. The calcium hydroxide (CH) content of the cementitious composites containing CSS (including the CH content produced by cementitious composites hydration, consumed by pozzolanic reaction of CSS, and residual in cementitious composites) and the hydration degree of cement are analyzed by observing the phase, content, and microscopic of CH. Results show that different replacement rates of CSS can reduce the CH content by approximately 7.59%-53.93%, which is determined by the mineral composition of CSS and its pozzolanic properties. In addition, the incorporation of CSS increases the hydration degree of the cement in the cementitious composites. This research can provide a new way for the utilization of CSS.

AB Lizards that inhabit high-latitude alpine zones are exposed to extreme temperatures and long winters and most are diurnal heliotherms. Yet some poorly known nocturnal species exist in such locations, including several viviparous geckos from New Zealand. We studied the orange-spotted gecko (Mokopirirakau 'Roy's Peak'), a cryptic, nocturnal and viviparous lizard known only from the alpine zone (1150-1800 m a.s.l.) in the South Island (-44 degrees S). Our field study investigated (1) the influence of female reproductive condition and sex on daytime body temperatures, including relationships with microhabitat rock temperatures, (2) the influence of temperature and other weather conditions on gecko emergence by night and day, and (3) the thermal microclimates available year-round to orange-spotted geckos. Building a better understanding of these lizards aids in species conservation efforts, for example in developing monitoring programmes, and provides insights into the evolution of thermal mechanisms in cold environments. Reproductive females maintained higher daytime body temperatures than non-reproductive females and males, suggesting pregnancy-related thermophily. On summer days, all reproductive groups reached similar body temperatures to New Zealand geckos from lower elevations, suggesting similar thermal preferences. Using trail cameras, we obtained evidence of geckos openly basking during the day (previously undocumented for this species) when temperatures of exposed lizard models (=Texp) were 3.2-39.3 degrees C. We also observed emergence at night at low Texp (-0.8-14.6 degrees C), when some Tbs were probably 0-6 degrees C. Diurnal activity increased as Texp rose to peak at -30 degrees C before dropping again at higher temperatures, whereas nocturnal activity unexpectedly decreased with increasing Texp. Our study provides evidence of diurnal activity in a 'nocturnal' gecko that may be essential to squamate viviparity at high-latitude, high-elevation sites. It also suggests remarkable capacity for locomotor activity at extremely low Tb.

AB Geese can profoundly affect arctic ecosystems directly (e.g., by grazing vegetation) and indirectly (e.g. by changing nutrient cycling resulting from faces inputs and by reducing plant litter). In the Arctic, behavior and abundance of geese have changed due to climate and land-use change. While the short-term effects of increased goose populations on tundra ecosystems are known, there is a knowledge gap for long-term consequences of goose population changes on nutrient cycling and plant communities, especially in the High-Arctic. Here, we compared wetland sites where geese have been almost absent for at least 50 years (Pond Inlet), and nearby sites where geese are abundant or sites where they have been excluded experimentally by cages and where the ground has been experimentally fertilized for over 16 years (Bylot Island). Long-term goose disappearance increased inorganic nutrients in wetlands through increased plant litter decomposition and changed community composition, likely by altering competitive relationships between three dominant vascular plant species that are different in terms of nutrient acquisition and use. In experimentally fertilized sites, inorganic nutrients were similarly increased, but fertilization had contrast effects on plant community composition compared with herbivory, released plant species from the nutrient limitation and converted wetland habitats to a dryer state. Overall, our results suggest that the direct effects of goose herbivory on vegetation are more profound than their indirect effects through an alternation of nutrient cycling even in nutrient-limited wetlands of the Arctic. These findings emphasize the need to assess long-term direct impacts of herbivores on vegetation.

AB Mountainous regions represent an excellent model to test ecological hypotheses encompassing assemblage diversity and body traits of species. Among insects, there is no uniform body size pattern across temperature gradients, suggesting that processes controlling body size may differ among species. The aim of this study was to explore diversity and body size patterns of dung beetle species of the genus Onthophagus Latreille, 1802 across altitudinal gradients at two mountains in Mexico. Tropical mountain species were sampled from 2200 to 3400 m a.s.l. In both mountains, there was a decrease of richness and abundance of Onthophagus with increasing altitude. There were contrasting relationships between beetle body size and altitude, which varied depending on the data set analyzed. Furthermore, interspecific variations of body size were not related to the number of altitudinal bands recorded by each species. Species from high altitudes were also recorded at lower mountain altitudes, suggesting that diversity at the highest altitudes represents a subgroup of lowland diversity. This may indicate that the fauna inhabiting higher elevations could be the most eurytopic one. Here we present an example of an assemblage that partially contradicts Bergmann's rule, with contrasting effects of altitude on dung beetle body size.

AB In this study, we present the results of microscopic observations of pine needles Pinus sylvestris L. collected in the area of cement-lime pressure in the south-western part of the swietokrzyskie Mountains in the region of Biale Zaglebie. Images of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirm the presence of particles with a size of about 2 to 20 mu m on the surface of the needles. Analysis using X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) allowed, in turn, to identify lead, iron, aluminium, calcium, and silicon in particles deposited in the surface layer of assimilation organs and dispersed in the surface layer of vegetation tissue within cell structures. Chemical composition, size and shape of particles of foreign bodies on the needles' surface allow them to be identified as cement-lime dust coming from production plants located in the Biale Zaglebie. Negative influence on the condition and liveliness of Scots pine in the study area is manifested by images on which stomata is sealed, which limits the possibility of gas exchange.

AB A simplified model of clonal plant growth is formulated, motivated by observations of spatial structures in Posidonia oceanica meadows in the Mediterranean Sea. Two levels of approximation are considered for the scale-dependent feedback terms. Both take into account mortality and clonal, or vegetative, growth as well as competition and facilitation, but the first version is nonlocal in space while the second is local. Study of the two versions of the model in the one-dimensional case reveals that both cases exhibit qualitatively similar behavior (but quantitative differences) and describe the competition between three spatially extended states, the bare soil state, the populated state, and a pattern state, and the associated spatially localized structures. The latter are of two types, holes in the populated state and vegetation patches on bare ground, and are organized within distinct snaking bifurcations diagrams. Fronts between the three extended states are studied and a transition between pushed and pulled fronts identified. Numerical simulations in one spatial dimension are used to determine front speeds and confront the predictions from the marginal stability condition for pulled fronts. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Most species remain unknown to science and might go extinct before we recognize their existence. Although specimens belonging to many of these unknown taxa may already be housed in scientific collections, they can remain 'shelved' for years bearing the wrong name or without a formal name. We investigate factors underlying variation in time lag between collection and description dates for 2356 reptile species described worldwide between 1992 and 2017. We modelled the time to description using biological and sociological variables in a time-to-event analysis. Time lag between collection and description varied from zero to 155 years (median = 5). More than one-quarter of species involved specimens 'shelved' for 12 years or more. The time lag was shorter when the collector of the holotype - specimen serving as the name-bearer of the species - was an author of the description, while taxonomic revisions uncovered species with longer time lags. Unknown species collected by non-taxonomists and 'shelved' in scientific collections remained incorrectly identified for a much longer time. Taxonomic revisions are crucial to reverse this trend and improve benefits of the collecting performed by nontaxonomists. Our findings reveal the kinds of preserved reptile specimens that most likely represent unknown species in scientific collections.

AB The interpretation of patterns of biodiversity requires the disentanglement of geographical and environmental variables. Disjunct alpine communities are geographically isolated from one another but experience similar environmental impacts. Isolated homogenous habitats may promote speciation but constrain functional trait variation. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that dispersal limitation promotes taxonomic divergence, whereas habitat similarity in alpine mountains leads to functional convergence. We performed standardized field investigation to sample non-volant small mammals from 18 prominent alpine sites in the Three Parallel Rivers area. We estimated indices quantifying taxonomic and functional alpha- and beta-diversity, as well as beta-diversity components. We then assessed the respective importance of geographical and environmental predictors in explaining taxonomic and functional compositions. No evidence was found to show that species were more functionally similar than expected in local assemblages. However, the taxonomic turnover components were higher than functional ones (0.471 +/- 0.230 vs. 0.243 +/- 0.215), with nestedness components showing the opposite pattern (0.063 +/- 0.054 vs. 0.269 +/- 0.225). This indicated that differences in taxonomic compositions between sites occurred from replacement of functionally similar species. Geographical barriers were the key factor influencing both taxonomic total dissimilarity and turnover components, whereas functional betadiversity was primarily explained by climatic factors such as minimum temperature of the coldest month. Our findings provide empirical evidence that taxonomic and functional diversity patterns can be independently driven by different ecological processes. Our results point to the importance of clarifying different components of beta-diversity to understand the underlying mechanisms of community assembly. These results also shed light on the assembly rules and ecological processes of terrestrial mammal communities in extreme environments.

AB Whether or not biogeographic rules dealing with spatial patterns of animal body sizes are valid for ectotherms is controversial. As the ectotherms grow all their lives, we explored the role of age and annual growth rate in body size variation in Phrynocephalus przewalskii in northern China. Morphological data were collected from 11 populations across a broad geographic gradient. Correlations between age, sex, climatic factors, and body size were analyzed using generalized linear model (GLM) and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). GLM analysis indicated that the general body size of both sexes and the appendage size of females increased significantly with increasing temperature; however, the coefficient of determination was very small. GLMM analysis indicated that body size only correlated with age, whereas appendage size was affected by age, temperature, rainfall, and sunshine. Annual growth rates were positively correlated with temperature. We concluded that body size variation was mainly caused by age structure and plasticity of the growth rate in P. przewalskii and did not follow Bergmann's rule; however, females followed Allen's rule. Future studies to investigate the effect of energy restriction are needed to further understand the relationship between growth rate and body size. We also suggest that further studies on thermal advantage and sexual selection may be helpful to understand appendage size variation in P. przewalskii.

AB The endemic Mediterranean reef building vermetid gastropods Dendropoma petraeum complex (Dendropoma spp) and Vermetus triquetrus develop bio-constructions (rims) on rocky shorelines at about Mean Sea Level (MSL) and are therefore commonly used as relative sea-level (RSL) markers. In this study, we use elevations and age data of vermetid reefs to (1) re-assess the vertical uncertainties of these biological RSL indicators, and (2) evaluate the vertical growth rates along a Mediterranean east-west transect, in attempt to explain the differences found in both growth rates and uncertainties. In Israel, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) and laser measurements relative to the local datum show that the reef surfaces mainly occupy the upper intertidal zone with variations in elevation from +0.51 +/- 0.07 m to +0.13 +/- 0.05 m along the coast. However, in specific sites the vertical uncertainty exceeds the tidal range. In some places the local vermetid species D. anguliferum and V. triquetrus appear to alternate along the vertical rim profiles. This study documents a spatial variability of vertical growth rates, ranging from similar to 1 mm yr(-1) in Israel and Crete, to similar to 0.1-0.2 mm yr(-1) in NW Sicily and Spain. The order of magnitude of the difference in growth rates correlates with the east-west spatial thermal gradient of Sea-Surface Temperature (SST). Preferential skeleton deposition of D. petraeum and V. triquetrus measured by growth axis delta O-18 analysis shows that most calcification occurs at SST above the mean annual value. These findings indicate that vermetid reefs are a site-specific RSL indicator, displaying various vertical uncertainties and inner-structure complexities. Local data on the indicative range of vermetids are required when reconstructing relative sea-level changes using fossil vermetids.

AB Understanding how biological communities respond to climate change is a major challenge in ecology. The response of ectotherms to changes in temperature depends not only on their species-specific thermal tolerances but also on temperature-mediated interactions across different trophic levels. Warming is predicted to reinforce trophic cascades in linear aquatic food chains, but little is known about how warming might affect the lower trophic levels of food webs involving extensive fish omnivory, a common scenario in subtropical and tropical waterbodies. In this study, a mesocosm warming experiment was conducted involving a pelagic food chain (fish-zooplankton-phytoplankton) topped by the omnivorous bighead carp [Aristichthys nobilis(Richardson)]. We found that temperature elevation significantly enhanced the growth of fish and suppressed zooplankton, including both metazooplankton and ciliates, while abundances of phytoplankton, despite disruption of temporal dynamics, did not increase correspondingly-likely due to fish predation. Our results suggest that trophic cascades are less unlikely to be reinforced by warming in food chains involving significant omnivory. Moreover, we found that warming advanced the spring abundance peak of phytoplankton abundance and that of the parthenogenetic rotiferBrachionus quadridentatus; whereas, it had no effect on the only sexually reproducing copepod,Mesocyclops leuckarti, presumably due to its prolonged life history. Our study also confirmed that warming may lead to a phenological mismatch between some predators and their prey because of the distinct life histories among taxa, with potentially severe consequences for resource flow in the food chain, at least in the short term.

AB Vegetation patterns are a characteristic feature of semi-deserts occurring on all continents except Antarctica. In some semi-arid regions, the climate is characterised by seasonality, which yields a synchronisation of seed dispersal with the dry season or the beginning of the wet season. We reformulate the Klausmeier model, a reaction-advection-diffusion system that describes the plant-water dynamics in semi-arid environments, as an integrodifference model to account for the temporal separation of plant growth processes during the wet season and seed dispersal processes during the dry season. The model further accounts for nonlocal processes involved in the dispersal of seeds. Our analysis focusses on the onset of spatial patterns. The Klausmeier partial differential equations (PDE) model is linked to the integrodifference model in an appropriate limit, which yields a control parameter for the temporal separation of seed dispersal events. We find that the conditions for pattern onset in the integrodifference model are equivalent to those for the continuous PDE model and hence independent of the time between seed dispersal events. We thus conclude that in the context of seed dispersal, a PDE model provides a sufficiently accurate description, even if the environment is seasonal. This emphasises the validity of results that have previously been obtained for the PDE model. Further, we numerically investigate the effects of changes to seed dispersal behaviour on the onset of patterns. We find that long-range seed dispersal inhibits the formation of spatial patterns and that the seed dispersal kernel's decay at infinity is a significant regulator of patterning.

AB Mangrove forests occur throughout the coastlines of Arabia, one of the most environmentally extreme regions of their global distribution. The gray mangrove [Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh.] is the only widespread tree species in this region, providing a unique evergreen habitat that supports high mangrove-associated biodiversity and many ecosystem services of socio-economic importance. This study provides the first literature-based analysis of the status and historical development of mangrove science in Arabia. The goal was to identify trends and gaps in regional mangrove research, providing information essential to guiding future science and conservation programs. The analyses incorporated 400 publications from over six decades since the first article in 1955, each classified into 11 major research topics and including studies from each of the regional seas (Red Sea, Arabian Sea, Sea of Oman, and the Persian/Arabian Gulf). The results demonstrate that there has been exponential growth in research on regional mangroves in recent decades (particularly around human impacts and ecology). The study further reveals knowledge gaps in important research topics and geographical areas that could be exploited to provide insights into broader biogeographic issues. These results provide a comprehensive assessment of the growing body of knowledge on regional mangroves, and provide direction for future research that can guide conservation, management and scientific knowledge of these critical ecosystem engineers.

AB We examined evidence for larval spillover (increased recruitment outside the closures) of Atlantic sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) due to rotational closures in the Mid-Atlantic Bight using a 40-year fisheries survey time series and a larval transport model. Since the first closure of the Hudson Canyon South (HCS) area in 1998, mean recruitment in the two areas directly down-current from this closure, Elephant Trunk (ET) and Delmarva (DMV), increased significantly by factors of about 7 and 2, respectively. Stock-recruit plots indicate that low biomasses in HCS were associated with reduced mean recruitment in ET and DMV. Simulations indicate that larvae spawned in HCS often settle in the two downstream areas and that model-estimated settlement (based on gonad biomass in HCS and year-specific larval transport between the areas) is correlated with observed recruitment. This study gives strong evidence that the rotational closure of HCS has induced increased recruitment in down-current areas.

AB Oceanic conditions along the Atlantic Coast of North America are changing rapidly. Surface water temperatures in the Gulf of Maine have increased faster than 99% of the global oceans, and major infrastructure projects, including the largest windfarm in the world, are under development along this seaboard. In Canada and theUS, the Atlantic sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) supports lucrative fisheries, which were originally founded on an extensive scientific framework focusing on stock assessment. The sea scallop is an ideal sentinel species, as it is highly sensitive to changes in marine conditions. We used a drop camera system to estimate the number and size of scallops, as well as the distribution of their reproductive potential, over 70,000 km(2)of the continental shelf in 2016-2018, an area that nearly covers the entire range of this species. In total, we estimated that there were 34 billion individual scallops (95% confidence limits: 22-46 billion) within the species' range. In this paper, we examine the role of the sea scallop as a baseline sentinel species that can be used to measure the impacts of environmental change and anthropogenic developments.

AB Climate warming is facilitating the expansion of many cold-sensitive woody species in woodland-grassland ecotones worldwide. Recent research has demonstrated that this range expansion can be further enhanced by positive vegetation-microclimate feedbacks whereby woody canopies induce local nocturnal warming, which reduces freeze-induced damage and favors the establishment of woody plants. However, this local positive feedback can be counteracted by biotic drivers such as browsing and the associated consumption of shrub biomass. The joint effects of large-scale climate warming and local-scale microclimate feedbacks on woody vegetation dynamics in these ecotones remain poorly understood. Here, we used a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to investigate the effects of woody cover on microclimate and the consequent implications on ecological stability in North American coastal ecosystems. We found greater browsing pressure and significant warming (similar to 2 degrees C) beneath shrub canopies compared to adjacent grasslands, which reduces shrub seedlings' exposure to cold damage. Cold sensitivity is evidenced by the significant decline in xylem hydraulic conductivity in shrub seedlings when temperatures dropped below -2 degrees C. Despite the negative browsing-vegetation feedback, a small increase in minimum temperature can induce critical transitions from grass to woody plant dominance. Our framework also predicts the threshold temperature of -7 degrees C for mangrove-salt marsh ecotones on the Atlantic coast of Florida. Above this reference temperature a critical transition may occur from salt marsh to mangrove vegetation, in agreement with empirical studies. Thus, the interaction between ongoing global warming trends and microclimate feedbacks may significantly alter woody vegetation dynamics and ecological stability in coastal ecosystems where woody plant expansion is primarily constrained by extreme low temperature events.

AB Stable isotope compositions of oxygen (delta O-18) and carbon (delta C-1(3)) of the aragonite skeleton of the reef-building gastropod Dendropoma petreaum provide high-resolution records of the Mediterranean climate over the last millennium. In particular, the isotopic composition of vermetid cores collected from the west and east Mediterranean reveals that the different regions have had distinct thermal and primary production behaviors throughout the last millennium. The rate of warming in the recent Industrial Period is variable among the different regions of the Mediterranean Sea. The delta O-18-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies show that the Eastern Mediterranean surface temperature is increasing much more rapidly than in the Western Mediterranean. Additionally, the signals of the Little Ice Age and of the Medieval Climate Anomaly are more apparent in the western and in the central Mediterranean while they are almost absent in the eastern Mediterranean.
   We aim to reconcile the SST temporal and spatial pattern with the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the South Asian Monsoon (SAM) climate systems by analyzing coupled atmosphere-ocean models from the CMIP5/PMIP3 projects that simulate the global climate of the past 1000 years. We show that even though the NAO is more dominant in the western Mediterranean SST, its latitudinal movement, on a centennial time scale, is evident in the eastern Mediterranean SST signal. We also discuss the Atlantic water inflow role in the observed similarities of the surface productivity signals and the Suess effect that prevail the Industrial Period signal in all regions of the Mediterranean.

AB We describe the physiological and behavioral maturity of the red deep-sea crab, Chaceon quinquedens (Smith, 1879), using ovary and oocyte development and morphological features to estimate the size at 50% sexual maturity (SM50) for females in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. This economically important species inhabits the continental shelf and slope of the western Atlantic from Nova Scotia, Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Samples were collected by trawling in 2011-2013 and by traps in 2014-2016. We used histological analysis to describe the stages of ovarian development. Five stages of ovarian development were identified: 1, immature; 2, early maturing; 3, late maturing; 4, mature; and 5, redeveloping. A logistic model was used to estimate the SM50 using maximum likelihood methods. Physiological SM50 varied among geographic locations and was estimated at 61.2 mm CL and 70.8 mm CL for females collected near Hudson Canyon and Baltimore and Norfolk canyons, respectively. Behavioral SM50 decreased with latitude and was estimated at 53.9 mm CL, 62.5 mm CL and 65.5 mm CL for Hudson, Baltimore, and Norfolk canyons, respectively. Results implied asynchrony between physiological and behavioral sexual maturity, suggesting that mating occurs prior to completion of ovarian development. This study provides the first evidence of a latitudinal trend in sexual maturity for C. quinquedens. Further investigation is needed to understand the cause of the latitudinal trend as our study presented limitations. Results provide useful information for fisheries management about the reproductive biology of C. quinquedens.

AB Herbivory is a major energy transfer within ecosystems; an open question is under what circumstances it can stimulate aboveground seasonal primary production. Despite multiple field demonstrations, past theory considered herbivory as a continuous process and found stimulation of seasonal production to be unlikely. Here, we report a new theoretical model that explores the consequences of discrete herbivory events, or episodes, separated in time. We discovered that negative density (biomass) dependence of plant growth, such as might be expected from resource limitation of plant growth, favors stimulation of seasonal production by infrequent herbivory events under a wide range of herbivory intensities and maximum plant relative growth rates. Results converge to those of previous models under repeated, short-interval herbivory, which generally reduces seasonal production. Model parameters were estimated with new and previous data from the Serengeti ecosystem. Patterns of observed frequent and large magnitude stimulated production in these data agreed generally with those predicted by the episodic herbivory model. The model thus may provide a new framework for evaluating the sustainability and impact of herbivory.

AB Shadow competition, the interception of prey by sitand-wait predators closest to the source of prey arrival, is prevalent in clusters of sit-and-wait predators. Peripheral positions in the cluster receive more prey and should thus be more frequently occupied. Models predicting spatial positioning in groups, however, usually ignore variability among group members. Here, I used a simulation model to determine conditions under which small and large sit-and-wait predators, which differ in their attack range, should differ in their spatial positions in the cluster. Small predators occupied peripheral positions more frequently than large predators at the simulation beginning, while the opposite held true as time advanced. Because of the large and small attack range of large and small predators, respectively, small predators mistakenly relocated away from peripheral positions, while large predators did not relocate fast enough from inferior central positions. Any factor that moderated the frequent relocations of small predators or had the opposite effect on large predators assisted small or large predators, respectively, in reaching the more profitable peripheral positions. Furthermore, any factor elevating shadow competition led to longer occupation of the periphery by large predators. This model may explain why sit-and-wait predators are not homogenously distributed in space according to size.

AB Homeotherms and many poikilotherms display a positive relationship between body size and latitude, but this has rarely been investigated in microscopic animals. We analysed all published records of marine Tardigrada to address whether microscopic marine invertebrates have similar ecogeographical patterns to macroscopic animals. The data were analysed using spatially explicit generalized least squares models and linear models. We looked for latitudinal patterns in body size and species richness, testing for sampling bias and phylogenetic constraints. No latitudinal pattern was detected for species richness, and sampling bias was the strongest correlate of species richness. A humpshaped increase in median body size with latitude was found, and the effect remained significant for the Northern Hemisphere but not for the Southern. The most significant effect supporting the latitudinal gradient was on minimum body size, with smaller species disappearing at higher latitudes. Our results suggest that biogeographical signals were observed for body size, albeit difficult to detect in poorly studied groups because of swamping from biased sampling effort and from low sample size. We did not find a significant correlation with the latitudinal pattern of body size and ecologically relevant net primary productivity.

AB A large number of restoration projects aims to improve the ecological quality of streams and rivers by focusing on the stream structure. However, improved habitat heterogeneity often does not lead to natural recolonization by sensitive freshwater macroinvertebrate communities, particularly when the recolonization potential is low and source populations are absent. In preliminary studies we tested whether natural substrate exposures could be used to sample and transport benthic macroinvertebrates. In this pilot study we used these previously tested natural substrate exposures to sample freshwater invertebrates in a donor stream in order to actively (re-)colonize a recipient stream. In the course of three reintroduction campaigns, we were able to accumulate over 350,000 benthic invertebrates, including 25 indicator taxa of the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera and 30 taxa scoring positive in the German Fauna Index. In total, 45 taxa, which did not occur in the recipient stream before, were reintroduced. They were transported gently within natural substrate exposures and released on a stream bottom area of 500 m(2) in the recipient stream. We intended to study if an increase of benthos fauna in a recipient stream is possible, and if this increase will eventually improve the ecological status. So far, the natural substrate exposure-method demonstrated to be an adequate tool to accumulate and transport benthic macroinvertebrates and, in general, has the potential to increase the biodiversity of streams when used as assisted migration measure.

An environmental forensic investigation was carried out in the surroundings of a major cement manufacturing unit at a place called Coimbatore in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The investigation was carried out to identify the contribution of the cement manufacturing unit to the SPM concentration of the surrounding air environment. The sampling points' selection and sample collection were done following the principles outlined in the INTERPOL Manual for Pollution Crime Forensic Investigation. On-site monitoring of the air samples was carried out using Mini Laser Aerosol Spectrometer (GRIMM, Mini-LAS Model 11R). The instrument was capable of measuring particles ranging from 0.25 to 32 mu m and classifying them into 31 size channels. The test results at majority of the monitoring locations were well above the limits specified in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards of India. Microscopic studies of the dust samples were carried out for surface texture and particle shape. The spatial distribution of particles was analysed using geographic information system (GIS) for the visual identification of the extent of the pollution by keeping the cement factory as the focal point. The results from the GIS and microscopic analysis established the role of the cement factory in the particulate matter pollution of its surroundings, specifically in the areas North-West of the factory. The successfully adopted procedure can serve as a guideline for the environmental forensic investigation of similar pollution incidences.

AB The European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus) is a vulnerable species, whose populations are declining throughout its entire range in Central and South-Eastern Europe. To a great extent, its conservation depends on habitat restoration, maintenance and protection. In order to improve the conservation status of the species, reintroductions are increasingly applied. Therefore, researchers focus their attention on factors that facilitate these activities and contribute to their success. In addition to the well-known factors like grass height and exposition, others, related to the underground characteristics, are more difficult to evaluate. The presence of other digging species could help this evaluation. Here, we present two reintroduced ground squirrel colonies, where the vast majority of the burrows are located in the base of anthills, mainly of yellow meadow ant (Lasius flavus). This interspecies relationship offers numerous advantages for the ground squirrel and is mostly neutral for the ants. The benefits for the ground squirrel, including reduced energy demand for digging, as well as additional surveillance and hiding places available, could greatly enhance the post-reintroduction adaptation process.

AB Improved knowledge of dispersal parameters across multiple populations is essential for the effective management of species exposed to ongoing threats from habitat loss, fragmentation and climate change. Currently, management decisions are based on incomplete or insufficient knowledge of key dispersal parameters, especially long-distance dispersal, and its role in maintaining metapopulation connectivity, facilitating range shifts under climate change, or enabling the colonization of new habitats. Using a combination of microsatellite-based population genetic analyses, scaling relationships and parentage-based dispersal analysis we investigated levels and patterns of long-distance dispersal in the koala. Using home range size as a scalar predicted spatial variation in maximum dispersal distance amongst regional populations (range 13.4-43.4 km), while parentage-based dispersal analysis showed that long-distance dispersal (> 11.2 km) accounted for 16.7-18.5% of movements in a focal population. Common movement patterns were discerned, despite varying levels of imprecision and bias, that suggest an important role for long-distance dispersal in maintaining metapopulation connectivity. Our results suggest that implementation of a systematic approach to the estimation of dispersal across multiple populations would benefit koala conservation and management. This will require the use of both empirical and simulation studies to quantify and minimize sources of imprecision and bias that can occur including those related to incomplete sampling, the presence of fine-scale spatial genetic structure and areas of localized inbreeding. As limitations associated with partial sampling are likely to remain an inherent feature of large-scale dispersal studies, a large number of loci should be assayed.

AB Phosphate is a macronutrient and often the limiting growing factor of many ecosystems. The aim of this work was to assess the effect of various phosphate sources on the active bacterial microbiota of barley rhizosphere and endorhiza. Barley was grown on poor soil supplemented with either Ca(H2PO4)(2) (CaP), Gafsa rock phosphate (Gafsa), sodium hexaphytate (NaHex), or not amended (P0). RNA was extracted and cDNA synthesized via reverse transcription from both rhizosphere and endorhiza of barley roots; the obtained 16S rRNA cDNA was sequenced by Ion Torrent and analyzed with QIIME and co-occurrence network analysis. Phosphatase activity was measured in the rhizosphere. The phosphate source significantly affected alpha- and beta-diversities of the active microbiota, especially in the rhizosphere. CaP enriched the relative abundance of a broad range of taxa, while NaHex and Gafsa specifically enriched one dominant Massilia-related OTU. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that the most abundant OTUs were affected by phosphate source and, at the same time, were low connected to other OTUs (thus they were relatively "independent" from other bacteria); this indicates a successful adaptation to the specific abiotic conditions. In the rhizosphere, the phosphatase activities were correlated to several OTUs. Moreover, the phosphodiesterase/alk. phosphomonoesterase ratio was highly correlated to the dominance index of the microbiota and to the relative abundance of the dominant Massilia OTU. This study shows the differential response of the rhizosphere- and endorhiza bacterial microbiota of barley to various phosphate sources in soil, thus providing insights onto this largely unknown aspect of the soil microbiome ecology and plant-microbe interactions.

AB Over-exploitation of natural resources can have profound effects on both ecosystems and their resident human populations. Simple theoretical models of the dynamics of a population of human harvesters and the abundance of a natural resource being harvested have been studied previously, but relatively few models consider the effect of metapopulation structure (i.e., a population distributed across discrete patches). Here we analyze a socio-ecological metapopulation model based on an existing single-population model used to study persistence and collapse in human populations. Resources grow logistically on each patch. Each population harvests resources on its own patch to support population growth, but can also harvest resources from other patches when their own patch resources become scarce. We show that when populations are allowed to harvest resources from other patches, the peak population size is higher, but subsequent population collapse is significantly accelerated and across a broader parameter regime. As the number of patches in the metapopulation increases, collapse is more sudden, more severe, and occurs sooner. These effects persist under scenarios of asymmetry and inequality between patches. Our model makes simplifying assumptions in order to facilitate insight and understanding of model dynamics. However, the robustness of the model prediction suggests that more sophisticated models should be developed to ascertain the impact of metapopulation structure on socio-ecological sustainability.

AB We motivate and analyze a simple model for the formation of banded vegetation patterns. The model incorporates a minimal number of ingredients for vegetation growth in semiarid landscapes. It allows for comprehensive analysis and sheds new light onto phenomena such as the migration of vegetation bands and the interplay between their upper and lower edges. The key ingredient is the formulation as a closed reaction-diffusion system, thus introducing a conservation law that both allows for analysis and provides ready intuition and understanding through analogies with characteristic speeds of propagation and shock waves.

AB Halophilic archaea thrive in hypersaline conditions associated with desiccation, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and redox active compounds, and thus are naturally tolerant to a variety of stresses. Here, we identified mutations that promote enhanced tolerance of halophilic archaea to redox-active compounds using Haloferax volcanii as a model organism. The strains were isolated from a library of random transposon mutants for growth on high doses of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), an agent that forms hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and other redox acid compounds common to aqueous environments of high concentrations of chloride. The transposon insertion site in each of twenty isolated clones was mapped using the following: (i) inverse nested two-step PCR (INT-PCR) and (ii) semi-random two-step PCR (ST-PCR). Genes that were found to be disrupted in hypertolerant strains were associated with lysine deacetylation, proteasomes, transporters, polyamine biosynthesis, electron transfer, and other cellular processes. Further analysis revealed a Delta psmA1 (alpha 1) markerless deletion strain that produces only the alpha 2 and beta proteins of 20S proteasomes was hypertolerant to hypochlorite stress compared with wild type, which produces alpha 1, alpha 2, and beta proteins. The results of this study provide new insights into archaeal tolerance of redox active compounds such as hypochlorite.

AB Many species of marine mammals have evolved behavioural adaptations to minimize heat loss to the surrounding water. We tracked 21 dugongs (Dugong dugon Muller 1776) using acoustic and satellite/GPS transmitters in 2012, 2013 and 2014 in Moreton Bay, Queensland at the high latitude limit of the species' winter range in eastern Australia to examine if there was a relationship between movements and environmental temperature that might suggest behavioural thermoregulation. Oceanic waters immediately outside the bay where the dugong's seagrass food is unavailable exhibited temperatures from 5.5 degrees C warmer to 3 degrees C cooler than the Eastern Banks, the major dugong habitat in the bay. All tracked dugongs made at least one (and up to 66) return trip(s) from the Eastern Banks to the adjacent oceanic waters. The probability of making an outgoing trip was highest in 2014 and lowest in 2013 when the water temperature inside the bay was higher than the other two years. The odds of making an outgoing trip were lower when temperature differences (outside minus inside) were small or negative but increased by a factor of up to 2.12 for each 1 degrees C positive difference. Individual dugongs were most likely to travel out of the bay between midnight and noon on an outgoing tide or at slack high water and return to the bay on an incoming tide or slack low water between noon and midnight. The amount of time a dugong spent outside the bay on each trip was relatively short with an overall median of 5.9 h. The dugongs' individual activity spaces generally declined as winter progressed suggesting a change in the cost-effectiveness of moving outside the bay. Our analysis adds to the evidence that dugongs undertake behavioural thermoregulation at least at the high latitude limits of their range.

AB Pattern formation and selection are fundamental, omnipresent principles in nature-from small cells up to geological scales. In E. coli bacteria, for example, self-organized pole-to-pole oscillations of Min proteins-resembling a short standing wave-ensure correct positioning of the cell division site. The same biochemical reaction leads to traveling protein waves on extended membranes in in vitro experiments. Are these seemingly contradictory observations of system-spanning importance? We show that a transition of nonlinear traveling wave patterns to reflection-induced standing waves in short systems is a generic and robust phenomenon. It results from a competition between two basic phenomena in pattern formation theory. We confirm the generic findings for the cell-biological Min reaction and for a chemical reaction-diffusion system. These standing waves show bistability and adapt to varying system lengths similar as pole-to-pole oscillations in growing E. coli. Our generic results highlight key functions of universal principles for pattern formation in nature.

AB The objectives of this study were to examine whether sustained exercise training at four water velocities, i.e. nearly still water (control), 1 body length (BL) s(-1), 2 BL s(-1) and 4 BL s(-1), has effects on swimming performance and digestive metabolism in juvenile black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus). The results demonstrated that fish subjected to sustained training at 2 and 4 BL s(-1) showed significantly higher critical swimming speed (U-crit) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) over the control group. Fish subjected to sustained training at 1 and 2 BL s(-1) showed a significantly (30 and 54%) prolonged duration, 14 and 17% higher postprandial MO2 increment (i.e. MO2peak), and 62 and 92% more energy expended on specific dynamic action (SDA), respectively, after consuming a similar meal over fish kept in nearly still water. These results suggest that (1) sustained exercise training at a higher speed (2 or 4 BL s(-1)) had a positive influence on the aerobic swimming performance of juvenile M. piceus, which may be associated with improved aerobic metabolism; and (2) sustained exercise training at a lower speed (1 or 2 BL s(-1)) resulted in elevated postprandial metabolic responses in juvenile M. piceus.

AB The Dead Sea has been known for its therapeutic and cosmetic properties. The unique climatic conditions in the Dead Sea area make it a renowned site worldwide for the field of climatotherapy, which is a natural approach for the provision of medications for many human diseases including unusual exclusive salt composition of the water, a special natural mud, thermal mineral springs, solar irradiation, oxygen-rich and bromine-rich haze. This review focuses on the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the Dead Sea mud and salts, in addition to their contaminants, allowing this review to serve as a guide to interested researchers to their risks and the importance of treatment. Beneficial effects of Dead Sea mud and salts are discussed in terms of therapy and cosmetics. Additional benefits of both Dead Sea mud and salts are also discussed, such as antimicrobial action of the mud in relation to its therapeutic properties, and the potency of mud and salts to be a good medium for the growth of a halophilic unicellular algae, used for the commercial production of (3-carotene; Dunaliella.

AB Wide coastal sectors of north-eastern Sicily are shaped by high rates of tectonic Pleistocene uplift of the area and concurrent glacio-eustatic sea level changes leading to the formation of terraces, characterised by basal marine sediments topped by continental vertebrate-bearing sediments, and caves with evidence of marine submersion. A tidal notch and associated organogenic crusts, formed by the vermetid gastropod Dendropoma cristatum found in a cave near Taormina located at an elevation of 130 m a.s.l. just above the terrace produced during the Tyrrhenian (MIS 5.5), were examined. This represents the first record of extensive vermetid bioconstructions inside a cave and a particular morphology of D. cristatum shells, which include coiled initial parts and straight distal elongated parts, with numerous internal septa. These specimens were preserved in a restricted area, with extended portions aligned parallel to each other and facing downward from a sub-horizontal step along a wall. The location of the vermetid crusts and the particular ecological requirements of this species (presently forming bioconstructions in exposed rocky shores characterised by high light intensity and water energy) points to a cave which was semi-submerged and widely open to the water energy at the time of its colonisation. The particular Dendropoma shell morphology has been interpreted as an adaptation to reach penetrating water flow rich in food and oxygen, also seen in other organisms from cave habitats. Apparent ages of the Dendropoma shells and the continental calcite crust obtained with the U-Th dating method are not consistent with the stratigraphic position of the cave and are significantly younger than expected. As observed for other dating results on the same species (and other molluscs), this indicates an alteration of the system during diagenesis and suggests caution in the use of certain species as stratigraphic constraints.

AB A reaction-diffusion logistic population model with spatially nonhomogeneous harvesting is considered. It is shown that when the intrinsic growth rate is larger than the principal eigenvalue of the protection zone, then the population is always sustainable; while in the opposite case, there exists a maximum allowable catch to avoid the population extinction. The existence of steady state solutions is also studied for both cases. The existence of an optimal harvesting pattern is also shown, and theoretical results are complemented by some numerical simulations for one-dimensional domains.

AB The study of lithic microbial communities, inhabiting rock substrates has been gathering momentum due to a growing attention of their wide importance as model systems in ecological studies and for their community structure. It is generally accepted that the success of cultivation-based technique is primarily based on suitable culture medium for isolation. The media available for enumeration and recovery of endolithic bacteria are mainly specific to particular type of rock which may not be suitable to isolate endolithic bacterial community from diverse lithobiontic niches. In this study, a new unoptimized medium was formulated, designated LM10 (unoptimized) for enumeration and recovery of endolithic bacteria by addition and/or omission of media components to the basal medium R2G, which was selected after experimental evaluation of five different existing media. The endolithic bacterial count in LM10 medium (unoptimized) was significantly higher than the R2G medium (t = -12.57, p < 0.0001). The culture and nutritional parameters associated with unoptimized LM10 medium were optimized using statistical approach to maximize the recovery and enumeration of endolithic bacteria. The first phase of the study comprised of a Plackett-Burman (PB) design experiment conducted to screen thirteen medium components and two culture parameters as variables with effect on bacterial enumeration and recovery. Out of these, Yeast extract, Casein hydrolysate, Glucose, Starch and Sodium thiosulphate were found to be significantly affecting the bacterial count (p < 0.05) based on PB design. On keeping rest of the media components and culture conditions at fixed value as per the PB design analyses (p > 0.05 and coefficients), further optimization was carried out for significant factors using Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM). Optimized media components obtained by BBD were Yeast extract, Casein hydrolysate, Glucose and Starch in 0.05 g/l each and Sodium thiosulphate in 0.047 g/l concentrations. The composition of optimized LM10 medium formulated (per litre) is 0.05 g Yeast extract, 0.05 g Casein hydrolysate, 0.05 g Glucose, 0.05 g Starch, 0.01 g K2HPO4, 0.02 g Sodium pyruvate, 0.2 g MgSO4, 0.001 g FeSO4 center dot 7H(2)O, 0.285 g NH4Cl, 0.039 g CaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O, 0.047 g Na2S2O3 center dot 5H(2)O, 0.002 g NaHCO3 and 11 g Gellan gum (pH = 7.4). Validation of optimized LM10 medium using nine different rock samples from Meghalaya clearly indicated that optimized LM10 medium was better suited for higher recovery and enumeration of endolithic bacteria under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

AB AimTo investigate shell size variation among gastropod faunas of fossil and recent long-lived European lakes and discuss potential underlying processes.
   LocationTwenty-three long-lived lakes of the Miocene to Recent of Europe.
   MethodsBased on a dataset of 1412 species of both fossil and extant lacustrine gastropods, we assessed differences in shell size in terms of characteristics of the faunas (species richness, degree of endemism, differences in family composition) and the lakes (surface area, latitude and longitude of lake centroid, distance to closest neighbouring lake) using multiple and linear regression models. Because of a strong species-area relationship, we used resampling to determine whether any observed correlation is driven by that relationship.
   ResultsThe regression models indicated size range expansion rather than unidirectional increase or decrease as the dominant pattern of size evolution. The multiple regression models for size range and maximum and minimum size were statistically significant, while the model with mean size was not. Individual contributions and linear regressions indicated species richness and lake surface area as best predictors for size changes. Resampling analysis revealed no significant effects of species richness on the observed patterns. The correlations are comparable across families of different size classes, suggesting a general pattern.
   Main conclusionsAmong the chosen variables, species richness and lake surface area are the most robust predictors of shell size in long-lived lake gastropods. Although the most outstanding and attractive examples for size evolution in lacustrine gastropods come from lakes with extensive durations, shell size appears to be independent of the duration of the lake as well as longevity of a species. The analogue of long-lived lakes as evolutionary islands' does not hold for developments of shell size because different sets of parameters predict size changes.

AB Scalar Utility Theory (SUT) is a model used to predict animal and human choice behaviour in the context of reward amount, delay to reward, and variability in these quantities (risk preferences). This article reviews and extends SUT, deriving novel predictions. We show that, contrary to what has been implied in the literature, (1) SUT can predict both risk averse and risk prone behaviour for both reward amounts and delays to reward depending on experimental parameters, (2) SUT implies violations of several concepts of rational behaviour (e.g. it violates strong stochastic transitivity and its equivalents, and leads to probability matching) and (3) SUT can predict, but does not always predict, a linear relationship between risk sensitivity in choices and coefficient of variation in the decision-making experiment. SUT derives from Scalar Expectancy Theory which models uncertainty in behavioural timing using a normal distribution. We show that the above conclusions also hold for other distributions, such as the inverse Gaussian distribution derived from drift-diffusion models. A straightforward way to test the key assumptions of SUT is suggested and possible extensions, future prospects and mechanistic underpinnings are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The upper threshold of thermal resistance was first identified for twelve species of freshwater cyclops belonging to seven genera of the family Cyclopoidae using the method of critical thermal maximum (CTM). Cyclops were captured from one river, two lakes, eight ponds and one of the temporary reservoirs that are located in Central and North-Western Federal Districts of the Russian Federation in 2013-2015. The interspecies comparison of the CTM levels allowed dividing all the studied species into three groups - with low, medium and high values of this index. The analysis of own and literature data on temperature conditions for the development of the species in waterbodies showed that species with similar CTMs had the same requirements to the environment. Stenothermal winter cold-loving species (Cyclops insignis, C. kolensis, C. strenuus, Megacyclops gigas) were included to the group with low CTM values (30.3-33.3 degrees C). Eurybiontic cosmopolitan species (Macrocyclops albidus, Macrocyclops fuscus, Cyclops vicinus, Megacyclops viridis) were in the group with mean CTM values (34.9-36.6 degrees C). Summer eurythermic species (Eucyclops macrurus, Thermocyclops crassus, Mesocyclops leuckarti) were members of the group with high CTM values (37.2-39.6 degrees C). Extremely flexible, the eurytopic species Eucyclops serrulatus, which is active throughout the year within a wide temperature range, had the highest level of thermal resistance (40.0 degrees C), which confirms the hypothesis of southern tropical origin of the genus Eucyclops.

AB Drylands support pastoralist social-ecological systems around the world. Ecological function in these water-limited environments frequently depends on tightly coupled, nonlinear interactions between water, soil, vegetation, and herbivores. Numerous complexity-based approaches have modeled localized ecohydrological feedbacks to yield insights into dryland landscape organization and emergent dynamics. The relevance of these models to management and sustainability continues to increase as researchers incorporate ecological processes at multiple scales and social-ecological variables like herding practices. However, many processes vary in their importance depending on ecological context, so there is a continuing need to construct models tailored to different contexts. We developed a model for semiarid rangelands that experience highly variable rainfall, substantial Hortonian runoff during rain events, patchy vegetation structure, and grazing-influenced patch transitions. The model couples an existing, mechanistic cellular automata model of hillslope water balance with a dynamic vegetation model in which probabilistic transitions between bare, annual grass, perennial grass patches depend on soil moisture and grazing intensity. The model was parameterized based on a field site in Kenya, from which we had empirical hydrological measurements and several years of patch-to-hillslope scale measurements of vegetation structure. The model domain is a 100 x 100 grid of 2 x 2 m cells, it simulates seasonal cycles of growing seasons followed by dry seasons, and it computes daily soil moisture based on stochastic rainfall forcings. Patch type transitions can occur twice during each seasonal cycle: at the end of the growing season, with probabilities based on average growing-season soil moisture availability; and at the end of the dry season, with probabilities based on grazing intensity and antecedent growing-season soil moisture. By parameterizing grazing intensity as a per-patch impact, it can be interpreted as the degree of forage depletion at which a herder decides to leave the area. We conducted a series of simulation experiments, principally altering runoff channelization and grazing intensity. The model generated plausible vegetation dynamics across the range of grazing intensities simulated. Vegetation cover fluctuated seasonally,. but never collapsed completely, even at the highest grazing intensity. At low to intermediate grazing, we observed multi-decadal switches in fractional perennial cover, triggered by periods of below- or above-average rainfall. At low to intermediate grazing intensities, we noted emergent spatial patterning in the form of a step-like increase in vegetation density in the lower half of the domain. With a vegetation patch transitions governed by mechanistic water balance dynamics as well as grazing intensities that represent herder decision-making, the model holds great potential for further explorations of how land use, climate, and spatial heterogeneity affect the functioning of a dryland pastoralist social-ecological system.

AB A new class of pattern forming systems is identified and investigated: anisotropic systems that are spatially inhomogeneous along the direction perpendicular to the preferred one. By studying the generic amplitude equation of this new class and a model equation, we show that branched stripe patterns emerge, which for a given parameter set are stable within a band of different wave numbers and different numbers of branching points (defects). Moreover, the branched patterns and unbranched ones (defect-free stripes) coexist over a finite parameter range. We propose two systems where this generic scenario can be found experimentally, surface wrinkling on elastic substrates and electroconvection in nematic liquid crystals, and relate them to the findings from the amplitude equation.

AB Populations of the Indo-Pacific invasive bivalve Spondylus spinosus in the Eastern Mediterranean occur at high densities and occupy vast areas of the rocky habitats along the Israeli coast where they are cemented to hard substratum in an oyster-like fashion. We studied the reproductive features of this bivalve in part of the area where it has invaded and found it to be gonochoric, featuring a reproducing population with a sex ratio of 1:1, annual gonad development and an inferred spawning period coinciding with the seasonal rise in seawater temperature. It is suggested that these reproductive features support high fertilisation rates and fecundity, thus contributing to the maintenance of its populations in the new environment.

AB Closely related species are likely to experience resource competition in areas where their ranges overlap. Fossil evidence suggests that hominins in East Africa c. 2-1.5 million years ago may have lived synchronically and sympatrically, and that competition may have contributed to the different tooth sizes observed in Homo and Paranthropus. To assess the likelihood that these taxa overlapped, we applied a character displacement model to the postcanine tooth size of fossil hominins and validated this model in populations of living primates. Mandibular fourth premolar (P-4) crown size was measured from fossil taxa and from living primate species where dietary overlap is established. Dimensions of the P-4 crown were fitted to a character matrix and described as the response variables of a generalized linear model that took taxon and location as input variables. The model recovered significant divergence in samples of closely related, living primates. When applied to fossil hominins the same model detected strong indications of character displacement between early Homo and Paranthropus (P = 0.002) on the basis of their P-4 crown size. Our study is an example of how ecologically informed morphologies measured in appropriate extant referents can provide a comparative context for assessing community and ecological evolution in the fossil record.

AB We develop a framework that casts the point water-vegetation dynamics under stochastic rainfall forcing as a continuous-time random walk (CTRW), which yields an evolution equation for the joint probability density function (PDF) of soil-moisture and biomass. We find regime shifts in the steady-state PDF as a consequence of changes in the rainfall structure, which flips the relative strengths of the system attractors, even for the same mean precipitation. Through an effective potential, we quantify the impact of rainfall variability on ecosystem resilience and conclude that amplified rainfall regimes reduce the resilience of water-stressed ecosystems, even if the mean annual precipitation remains constant.

AB Lama guanicoe (Muller, 1776) is one of the most important South American large mammal species for both biologists, ecologists and archaeologists, and body size of modern and prehistoric populations of guanaco has been one of the most studied parameters. In this paper, we evaluate the latitudinal differences in body size of different modern populations of guanaco from Argentinean Patagonia based on osteometric data of their long bones. The osteological sample is made of 110 fully-fused individuals drawn from three different guanaco populations from continental and insular Patagonia covering the latitudinal interval from S40 degrees to S54.5 degrees. Quantitative data for the four long bones selected are analyzed with univariate and multivariate parametric statistical techniques. Apparently consistent with Bergmann's rule, results show that guanaco specimens from S53-54.5 degrees are bigger on average than those from S48-52 degrees which are, in turn, bigger than those from S40 degrees. We observe a high and significant covariation between different environmental variables (maximum .temperature, net primary production, and winter precipitation) and body size of the guanaco populations. Nevertheless, when the temporal factor is incorporated into the analysis of this geographical gradient of body size the scenario becomes more complex. We conclude that the current clinal pattern observed in Patagonia is the result of several microevolutionary and biogeographic processes related to an adjustment of body size to different environmental and ecological drivers and to the consequences of isolation in Tierra del Fuego that occurred around the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.

AB Raccoons (Procyon lotor (L., 1758)) are known for their dietary plasticity and ability to exploit new resources. We studied raccoons preying on introduced intertidal clams and hypothesized that raccoons maximized energetic profit by foraging selectively. Raccoons discarded Manila clams (Venerupis philippinarum (A. Adams and Reeve, 1850)) but selected large varnish clams (Nuttallia obscurata (Reeve, 1857)), although varnish and Manila clam densities did not differ significantly and small varnish clams were more abundant than large ones. We determined the energy content of different-sized varnish and Manila clams by subtracting the cost of cracking a clam from its soft-tissue energy. Varnish clams with less shell mass than Manila clams required less energy to open, but for their size Manila clams were more profitable. We suggest that raccoons, limited to preying on clams when the tide is low and at risk feeding on an open beach, select varnish clams because they need less handling, but maximize profit by selecting large clams. Our calculations indicate that a raccoon eating large varnish clams could obtain up to 8.4% of its daily basal metabolic needs in 10 min, making varnish clams a potentially valuable new prey resource.

AB Risk taking decisions related to the unpredictability of resource availability (risk-sensitive foraging theory) have typically been explained by behavioral ecology and psychology approaches. However, little attention has been given to the physiological condition of animals as a factor that can influence the direction of foraging preferences. We evaluated the role of steroid hormones testosterone (T) and corticosterone (CORT) on the foraging preferences expressed by white-eared hummingbirds Hylocharis leucotis in a risk-sensitivity experiment. We recorded choices made by male individuals to floral arrays with constant and variable rewards (sugar concentration), and associated these with steroid hormone levels quantified at the start of the experiments. We found that males with higher T levels behave as risk-prone foragers as they perform more visits to flower arrays with variable rewards. Interestingly, CORT levels were similar regardless whether individuals visited both types of array. According to our results, T seems to influence the foraging preferences of male hummingbirds. Individuals with higher levels of this hormone, made more rapid, frequent visits to flowers with variable rewards, and behave consistently as risk-prone foragers, compared to males with low T levels. These are exciting avenues for future work, particularly considering recent evidence that individuals may exhibit behavioral differences, denoting an apparent personality, which may be associated with phisiological condition influencing how they respond behaviorally to environmental variation.

AB Evidence for reproductive character displacement (RCD) has accumulated more slowly than for ecological character displacement, perhaps because sampling scales and environmental covariates can obscure the role of RCD in speciation. We examined an early example of RCD in an anuran species group, the vocalizations of the sympatric cricket frogs Acris crepitans and A. gryllus. With a relatively fine spatial scale, we compared mixed-species choruses (syntopy), nearby locations where A. gryllus is recently extirpated (historic sympatry), and surrounding areas without secondary contact (allopatry). In each of these areas, we evaluated variation in dominant frequency, click rate, and mass of males. In addition, we determined the acoustic preferences of syntopic females. Temperature influenced dominant frequency of vocalizations in A. crepitans, but not in A. gryllus. Body size varied more and had a stronger influence on dominant frequency in A. crepitans than in A. gryllus. Consequently, the decrease in mass of A. crepitans in syntopy resulted in convergence of body size and divergence of dominant frequencies of the two species. In contrast, dominant frequency of A. crepitans did not differ between historic sympatry and allopatry. Females of both species used fine temporal structure to discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific vocalizations and showed no preferences for dominant frequency. Chorus noise limited the ability of A. gryllus females to detect and discriminate vocalizations, so convergence in mass might have resulted from RCD in dominant frequency to reduce heterospecific acoustic interference. However, influences other than RCD might have caused syntopic convergence in body size.

AB Concepts of robustness are sometimes employed when decisions under uncertainty are made without probabilistic information. We present a theorem that establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for non-probabilistic robustness to be equivalent to the probability of satisfying the specified outcome requirements. When this holds, probability is enhanced (or maximised) by enhancing (or maximising) robustness. Two further theorems establish important special cases. These theorems have implications for success or survival under uncertainty. Applications to foraging and finance are discussed.

AB The intensification of livestock production has highlighted the importance of balancing production and the environmental impact in grazing systems. With the advent of more distributed computing power we have seen more complex models being developed, capable of simulating most aspects of a livestock production system. Where the modelling objective includes prediction of both productivity and environmental impacts, it is imperative to include appropriate consideration of the grazing animal in the simulation. This raises numerous challenges with respect to environmental impact modelling, including explicit treatment of nutrients in dung and urine, the prediction of grazing behaviour, dry matter intake and associated enteric methane loss. This paper discusses these challenges and opportunities when integrating animal models into grazing system models for evaluating productivity and environmental impact.

AB Structures and potentialities of cultural landscapes have been studied mostly under a historical perspective. This article questions if contemporary societies can develop cultural landscapes. Starting from an analysis of the structure of contemporary landscapes, it investigates methods of developing cultural landscapes with contemporary knowledge and background. The theoretical assumptions are based on an ecosystem approach and consider the social and functional values in relation to the infrastructure project. Linear infrastructures are the physical basis for material and immaterial links between societies. They structure local territories, but more often reflect upper level rationalities - thus physically cross areas without providing a local service. An interpretative model to support cultural landscape dynamics within linear infrastructure projects was developed and tested in three Italian transportation infrastructures. The model was based on the analysis of the structure and the generating processes of contemporary cultural landscapes and makes use of criteria and indicators.

AB The Filippov ratio-dependent prey-predator model with economic threshold is proposed and studied. In particular, the sliding mode domain, sliding mode dynamics, and the existence of four types of equilibria and tangent points are investigated firstly. Further, the stability of pseudoequilibrium is addressed by using theoretical and numerical methods, and also the local sliding bifurcations including regular/virtual equilibrium bifurcations and boundary node bifurcations are studied. Finally, some global sliding bifurcations are addressed numerically. The globally stable touching cycle indicates that the density of pest population can be successfully maintained below the economic threshold level by designing suitable threshold policy strategies.

AB The coexistence in one area of two species with similar ecological requirements can lead to their morphological convergence or divergence. Convergence may be the result of adaptation to new conditions (species share a niche), whereas divergence may be the effect of competition for a resource (species compete for a niche). Compatibility with Bergmann's rule is possible in species with a significant latitudinal range. We tested whether potential differences between two long-eared bat species are consistent with character displacement or Bergmann's rule by investigating variability in cranial morphology of Plecotus auritus and P.?austriacus, which commonly occur in Central and Eastern Europe. We used 111 complete specimens from the allopatric range of P.?auritus (nine localities) and sympatric P.?auritus and P.?austriacus (44 localities) from Poland and Ukraine. A traditional morphometric method was used to evaluate variation in cranial size between the species in their ranges. Discriminant function analysis of cranial dimensions showed larger differences between sympatric populations of P.?austriacus and P.?auritus than between allopatric P.?auritus and a sympatric population of P.?austriacus. A subsequent analysis showed that most cranial variables (excluding elements of the skull responsible for prey capture and elements partly associated with echolocation) from the sympatric population of P.?auritus are smaller than those homologues from allopatric populations. Larger individuals from the allopatric population originate from the northern part of the study area; however, we did not detect an association of cranial variability with latitude pattern. The variation in size of the cranium between individuals from allopatric and sympatric ranges of P.?auritus can be explained by different preferences in each range for prey that vary in hardness. P.?auritus consumed significantly more hard-bodied insects in allopatry than in sympatry. This example is one of few confirmed morphological cases of competitive character displacement.

AB The effect of local habitat conditions on organisms, including environmentally-induced morphological changes, constitutes an important aspect of macroecology and evolution. The degree of geographic intraspecific variation in body dimensions, corporeal ratios and scalation pattern among male and female Palestine vipers (Vipera palaestinae) in Israel were examined. Univariate and multivariate analyses using 20 variable features relating to metric and meristic characters were applied in order to determine the existence of geographic variability in this species. Univariate analysis revealed that the majority of morphological characters possess relatively minor interregional distinctions, with only a few traits demonstrating Significant differences. Discriminant analysis of mixed-gender samples using a combination of variables did not distinguish between geographic groups within each sex. The multifactor approach slightly differentiated between samples when sexes were compared separately, but with much overlap. The continuous sampling method revealed no statistically significant relationship between geographic and metric variables across the distribution range. A weak latitudinal cline was observed in snout-vent length, with both sexes being larger in the south. Noticeable temperature-correlated intraspecific variability was found in both body and tail scale counts but not in head scalation features. Generally, both males and females demonstrate the same phenotype-environment correlation. The spatial variations in external morphology suggest that temperature conditions during early ontogenesis may induce quantitative changes in the scalation pattern of V palaestinae.

AB There is a negative relationship between trunk segment number and latitude among geophilomorph centipedes in general. A similar relationship is known to exist within the most intensively-studied geophilomorph species, Strigamia maritima, and also within several other species from this group. Previously, it was considered that this relationship did not involve body length; instead, individuals of S. maritima with more segments were considered to be more finely subdivided (not longer) than those with fewer segments. This incorrect interpretation arose from the difficulty of reliably separating post-embryonic stages and thus of making a simple and direct comparison. In the present study, we build on recent work that facilitates such comparisons; and we show conclusively that individuals with more segments are longer. Our finding means that it is now possible to connect the work on S. maritima in particular, and on geophilomorph centipedes in general, with the debate about Bergmann's rule: the proposal that body size increases with increasing latitude. There is a clear converse-Bergmann pattern, as has been found in several other taxa. We propose an adaptive hypothesis that may explain why geophilomorphs show this pattern.

AB The correlation between liquid water and life may be our most reliable tool in the search for extraterrestrial life. To help develop this tool, we explore the complex relationship between liquid water, partial pressure, and solute freezing point depression on Earth and Mars and discuss the conditions under which liquid water is metastable on Mars. We establish the physical conditions for the existence of saline aqueous solutions in the pores of the martian near surface substratum. We find that thin films of near subsurface liquid water on Mars at similar to-20 degrees C could provide a viable niche for terrestrial psychrophilic halophiles. Since some martian salts can suppress the freezing point of aqueous solutions with minimal suppression of the water activity, some martian liquid water environments with a water activity above similar to 0.6 may also be able to support terrestrial life at temperatures as low as -30 degrees C, similar to 10 degrees C lower than the limit of terrestrial life.

AB The association of water level changes and the relative (%) contributions of crustacean zooplankton to particulate N (PNz) and particulate P (PPz) in Lake Kinneret, Israel were studied. The PNz and PPz were assessed for a period of 10 years (1999-2008) in relation to water level (WL) changes which occurred during that period. We estimated PNz and PPz, based on crustacean N and P content measured seasonally over 2 years, and a 10-year record of zooplankton densities. Mean cladoceran N and P contents were 8.7 and 1.2% of dry weight, respectively, while for copepods they were 9.5 and 1.5% of dry weight, respectively. Zooplankton density, and hence PNz and PPz, changed dramatically during the 10 years, concurrent with extreme variations in the lake's WL. The lowest mean values of PNz and PPz occurred during high WL years and the highest PNz and PPz were during low WL years. PNz and PPz were negatively correlated with the total PN and PP concentrations, respectively, in the lake. The reduction in zooplankton contribution to the particulate N and P during high WL is probably due to higher loading of particulate matter in wet years, causing an increase of PN and PP concentration in the lake, as well as lower densities of zooplankton, caused by higher fish predation pressure, both are a by-product of the large water influx during extreme wet winters.

AB We present a mechanistic formulation of the intake response of ruminants to vegetation biomass based solely on physiological and morphological parameters that scale allometrically with the animal's body mass. The model is applied to describe herbivore-vegetation interactions in dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes with low quality but abundant "tall grass" and high quality but sparsely available "short grass", under two conditions: "uncoupled" (such that the effect of food intake on vegetation biomass can be neglected), or "coupled" (such that the vegetation biomass is determined by herbivore feeding). The results show that under uncoupled conditions, the minimum acceptance (proportion of vegetation consumed by the herbivore) at which the herbivore can leave its current patch without reducing its intake rate is when it has depleted the current patch by the energetic cost required to travel to another patch. The maximum acceptance at which the herbivore should leave its patch is when it has depleted the current patch by the cumulative energetic cost of traveling, handling, cropping, and digesting. Under coupled conditions, the optimal acceptance equals half the relative growth rate of the vegetation. Analytical solutions are obtained for equilibrium values for utilization of the vegetation, and for the densities of vegetation and ruminants, expressed in physiological and morphological herbivore parameters.

AB The coefficient of variation (CV) has been advocated as a measure of risk sensitivity in meta-analyses of data for risky choices by animals and humans. We examine properties of the CV measure. We demonstrate that the CV has unsatisfactory normative properties because it is inconsistent with preference for more than for less of the reward medium. Whether or not the CV succeeds as a descriptive criterion depends on its consistency or inconsistency with data We report two experiments designed to test the distinctive properties of the CV. The experiments involve human subjects motivated by salient monetary payoffs. Data from the experiments do not support the CV as a descriptive criterion for decision under risk. We also use data from an experiment designed to test for the incidence of patterns of small-stakes risk aversion used in concavity calibration. These data also do not support the CV as a good descriptive criterion (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Peripheral populations of widespread species are often considered unworthy of conservation efforts; however, they may be adapted to the conditions found at the range edge and are therefore important to the future evolutionary potential of the species. Blanchard's Cricket Frog (Acris blanchardi Harper, 1947) is widespread and abundant throughout the central United States, but is declining at the northern edge of its range. To assess the distinctiveness and conservation value of the northern populations, we investigated the spatial genetic structure and phylogeography of this anuran using mitochondrial control region sequences. Analysis of 479 individuals identified 101 haplotypes, with relatively low nucleotide diversity. Two moderately divergent clades were found. One was restricted to the southwest, which was probably a refugium during the Pleistocene, whereas the other occurred primarily across the north and is likely the result of postglacial colonization. The genetic distinctiveness of northern populations indicates the potential for adaptive differences of individuals in this region relative to those in the south. We therefore conclude that conservation efforts are justified for the declining northern populations of Blanchard's Cricket Frog, and we use the spatial genetic structure described here to develop specific recommendations for this anuran.

AB Experiments testing for variance-sensitivity (also called risk-sensitivity) usually offer 2 options delivering identical expected payoffs, with one option providing a constant and the other one a variable reward or delay. Animals often show a preference for the constant option when variance is in amount (variance-aversion) and a preference for the variable option when variance is in delay (variance-proneness). Variance-sensitivity is a taxonomically widespread phenomenon. Variance-sensitive foraging preferences contradict predictions derived from evolutionarily motivated models that emphasize long-term energetic benefits. We discuss a new approach of explaining variance-sensitive preferences. We hypothesize that variance-sensitivity results from decision mechanisms that are adjusted to ensure close to optimal responses to the environment. This paper demonstrates that simple decision rules ensure long-term rate maximization and exhibit variance-sensitive behavior when tested in a classical risk-sensitivity situation. We also show that behavioral patterns observed in experiments like preferences for constant reward amounts and variable time delays are produced by the decision rules. The decision rules presented here are a first step toward a decision mechanism that is psychologically plausible, is advantageous in natural foraging situations, and explains irrational behavior-like variance-sensitivity.

   CONSTRAINTS
AB Costs of reproduction are any aspect of current reproduction that has the potential to reduce survivorship or reproductive output, and may include physiological costs or increased risks. Females of many species experience increased body mass, and increased girth, when gravid. Increased body mass reduces running speed and increases the cost of locomotion during pregnancy, but few studies have examined the cost of increased girth. If increased girth of gravid females reduces access to shelter from predators or the elements, increased girth could constitute a cost of reproduction. In the laboratory, we experimentally tested whether access to crevices was limited in viviparous, saxicolous female lizards (Eulamprus brachysoma), which use crevices for shelter, by measuring access to artificial crevices of known widths, and body height during and after pregnancy. Gravid E. brachysoma had significantly greater body height (11.2% on average), and as a result were forced to use significantly wider crevices (18.4% wider on average) than post-parturition. Females with larger clutch sizes had wider mid-bodies and required larger crevices. Control females, which were not gravid at either time of testing, showed no significant change in the size of crevice they could enter over time. If access to narrow crevices provides advantages such as protection from predators, or is important for thermoregulation, then gravid females may suffer a cost of reproduction because their access to narrower crevices is limited.

AB We study positive solutions to the steady state reaction diffusion equation with Dirichlet boundary condition of the form:
   -Delta u = au - bu(2) - c u(p)/1 + u(p) - K, x is an element of Omega
   u = 0, x is an element of partial derivative Omega.
   Here Delta u = div(del u) is the Laplacian of u, a, b, c, p, K are positive constants with p >= 2 and Omega is a smooth bounded region with partial derivative Omega an in C(2). This model describes the steady states of a logistic growth model with grazing and constant yield harvesting. It also describes the dynamics of the fish population with natural predation and constant yield harvesting. We study the existence of positive solutions to this model. We prove our results by the method of sub-super solutions.

AB The time between egg laying and chick fledging is of crucial importance for the survival of young birds. I analyzed breeding output at consecutive phases of growth of young Coots (Fulica atra) relative to the clutch size and laying date. Considering the specific breeding biology of the Coot, I tested whether chick survival reveals clutch size-dependent variability. Clutch size did not affect hatching success; it only affected brood size, and that merely temporarily. During the first 20 days after hatching, i.e. during the time of the highest chick mortality, birds with larger clutches lost chicks at a higher rate. As a result, the number of fledged chicks was independent of the initial number of chicks, and pairs with different clutch sizes had a similar number of fledglings. The laying date had no effect. This pattern of age-related chick survival points to the greater role of the type of chick growth (semi-precocial) and behavior in their survival.

AB This paper examines whether the relationships between a number of characteristic limnological variables (suspended particulate matter, turbidity, Secchi depth, light attenuation, and chlorophyll a) determined for temperate lakes are consistent with the relationships found in Mediterranean lakes such as Lake Kinneret. We found that the use of published relationships between lake variables may lead to erroneous results when applied indiscriminately to other lake types.
   We applied linear regression, nonlinear regression and genetic algorithm (GA) approaches in order to fit the relationships to Lake Kinneret data. We showed that linear equations, simple or multivariate that do not require transformation prior to calibration, can be calibrated by simple and quick methods such as linear regression. However, when linear transformation is required prior to calibration the GA calibration produced better results. In addition, we found that the nonlinear regression method yielded a weak prediction, while the GA led to more accurate results.
   A sensitivity analysis of the GA operators' values indicated that using a crossover probability of 80% produced the best prediction. Furthermore, since the GA sometimes converges to local optimum, it must operate for a number of runs. We found that in our case 20 GA runs provided the most robust results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Fugitive Dust Model (FDM) and Industrial Source Complex (ISC), widely used coarse particulate dispersion models, have been shown inaccurate due to the neglect of vertical variations in atmospheric wind speed and turbulent diffusivity (Vesovic et al., 2001), omission of the gravitational advection velocity, and an underestimation of the ground deposition velocity (Kim and Larson, 2001). A simple, transient two-dimensional convection-diffusion-sedimentation model is proposed to simulate the evolution in particle size distribution of an aerosol 'puff' containing coarse particulate in the atmospheric surface layer. Monin-Okhubov similarity theory, accompanied by empirical observations made by Businger et al. (1971), is adopted to characterize the surface layer wind speed and turbulent diffusivity profiles over a wide range of atmospheric conditions. A first order analysis of the crossing trajectories effect suggests simulation data presented here are not significantly affected by particle inertia. The model is validated against Suffield experimental data in which coarse particulate deposition was measured out to a distance of 800 m from the source (Walker, 1965). Good agreement is found for the decay in ground deposits with distance from the source for stable atmospheres. Deposition data was also simulated for unstable atmospheric stratification and the current model was determined to modestly underestimate the peak concentration with increasing accuracy further downwind of the release. The current model's effective deposition velocity was compared to that suggested by Kim et al. (2000) and shows improvement with respect to FDM. Lastly, the model was used to simulate the dispersion of nine lognormal aerosol puffs in the lowest 50 m of the atmospheric surface layer for four classes of atmospheric stability. The simulated mass median aerodynamic diameters (MMAD) at multiple downwind sampling locations were calculated and plotted with distance from the source. The first 50 m from the source was found to have a substantial impact on the evolution of MMAD for stable atmospheric conditions. Away from the source, it was observed that particle size distributions were truncated by removal of all particles larger than about 60 gm. A particle Peclet number was also defined to quantify the relative importance of turbulent dispersion and sedimentation on particle motion in the vertical direction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The marine filamentous nonheterocystous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Lyngbya aestuarii (F. K. Mert.) Liebman ex Gomont CCY 9616 was grown under diazotrophic and nondiazotrophic conditions and under an alternating 16:8 light:dark (L:D) regime. Nitrogenase activity appeared just before the onset of the dark period, reaching its maximum 1-2 h in the dark, subsequently decreasing to zero at the beginning of the following light period. Nitrogenase activity was only detected at low levels of O-2 (5%) and when the culture was grown in the absence of combined nitrogen. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis of one of the structural genes encoding nitrogenase, nifK, showed that the highest levels of transcription preceded the maximum activity of nitrogenase by 2-4 h. nifK transcription was not completely abolished during the remaining time of the 24 h cycle. Even in the presence of nitrate, when nitrogenase activity was undetectable, nifK was still transcribed. The H-2-uptake activity seemed to follow the nitrogenase, but the transcription of hupL (gene encoding the large subunit of uptake hydrogenase) preceded the nifK transcription. However, H-2-uptake and hupL transcription occurred throughout the 24 h cycle as well as under nondiazotrophic conditions, albeit at much lower levels. The hoxH transcript levels (a structural gene coding for the bidirectional hydrogenase) were similar under diazotrophic or nondiazotrophic conditions but slightly higher during the dark period. All three enzymes investigated are involved in H-2 metabolism. It is concluded that the uptake hydrogenase is mainly responsible for H-2 uptake. Nevertheless, uptake hydrogenase and nitrogenase do not seem to be coregulated.

AB New records of copepods are listed from artificial containers and shallow waterbodies in the Florida Keys. Mesocyclops ogunnus is reported from the United States for the first time. Metacyclops cf. gracilis is reported from the Florida Keys for the first time. New collection records are presented for 12 other species. Mesocyclops ogunnus is an Old World species, and this is the third record in the Neotropics; it may have the potential to compete with the North and Central American native Mesocyclops edax. The non-native copepod species found in central and southern Florida are generally associated with plants and soils. A review of literature on introduced copepods found in South Florida is presented.

AB The epiphytic algal biomass on pneumatophores of the grey mangrove Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh., was estimated for the first time from the Indus Delta region during the northeast monsoon season. Its average value was 8.38 +/- 0.27 mg DW cm(-2) of pneumatophores surface area and 132.84 +/- 7.79 gm DW m(-2) of mud surface comparable to some other areas in the world. The algae formed a thick felt-like covering on the entire length of the pneumatophores except for a small portion at the tip. Vaucheria karachiensis was the most prominent and dominant alga. The algae were more common in shaded areas and also during colder months.

AB The aim of the study was a search for typical structure patterns of phytoplankton assemblages, based on the long-term dynamics analysis. As a test case we used the interannual phytoplankton variability of Lake Kinneret (Israel). The dominant phytoplankton species (Peridinium gatunense) structure was presented as the frequency-weighted taxonomic size spectrum (TSS) which describes the size distribution of the operational taxonomic unit (OTUj) occurrence frequencies. Using 24 years monitoring data, the TSS annual patterns of P. gatunense were compared. Typical persistent TSS patterns were evident even during years of pronounced deviations from the typical patterns of phytoplankton biomass dynamics and species composition. By correlation analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and ANOVA the TSS variability was quantified and compared. While the TSS general shape was almost constant, its amplitude variations allowed us to distinguish between three levels of annual bloom intensity.

AB 1. In rangeland areas such as the eastern Eurasian steppes (Mongolia and China), foraging behaviour is influenced by plant or vegetation properties with high heterogeneity.
   2. Until recently foraging theory has not accounted for the foraging process or ingestive behaviour. Existing theories on foraging behaviour need to evolve and begin to coalesce, and combine with observations or manipulative experiments.
   3. Plant and patch properties such as diversity and height influence animal foraging behaviour (related to foraging process or diet selection) in heterogeneous steppes.
   4. Stocking rate is the most important management factor for grazing or vegetation management, and determining the optimal stocking rate in steppes depends upon variable annual forage production, vegetation regrowth and animal production targets.

DT Article
DE ecological restoration; degraded systems; ecosystem monitoring
ID SCALE; FOREST; HABITAT
AB Ecological restoration is widely employed from tens to millions of hectares in space, and from tens of days to thousands of years in time, which forces consideration of it thoroughly. We argue that three questions are the most important among the contents relevant of ecological restoration, including why, what and how to restore degraded systems. Why to restore determines whether or not the degraded ecological systems should be restored. What to restore is the goal of ecological restoration. The explicit goal of ecological restoration is necessary to guide ecological restoration workers in pursuit of excellence and prevent restoration from being swamped by purely technological activities. And how to restore means the methods and steps we should apply. To ensure the final success of ecological restoration, restored sites should be monitored and managed for long time to determine whether the selected methods are appropriate, and can be remedy better. Only to deal with these effectively, ecological restoration would be the hope for the future.

AB The analysis of the intrinsic properties and processes of ecosystems, which regulate the production stability of mixed grasslands, has been complicated by the environmental noise caused by stochastic weather fluctuations. A mathematical framework is presented to deduct the actual, the extrinsic and the intrinsic stability of grassland ecosystems, as defined in the companion paper, from their yield patterns and the environmental patterns during a long time-course. Intrinsically stable grassland ecosystems remain stable when subjected to structured environmental fluctuations, yet are destabilised by stochastic environmental fluctuations. Contrastingly, intrinsically oscillating grassland ecosystems are on average somewhat stabilised by stochastic environmental fluctuations in temperate climates. Structured environmental fluctuations may fully stabilise these systems in continental climates. However, in these climates these ecosystems are destabilised by stochastic environmental fluctuations. As in some cases the actual stability of yields may be higher in intrinsically oscillating systems than in intrinsically stable systems, the stability of yields observed in short-term experiments is a poor reflection of the intrinsic ecosystem properties. Subsequently, this mathematical framework is applied to a number of experimental ecosystems in the Park Grass Experiment (UK) and at the Ossekampen (The Netherlands), which were subjected to various fertiliser and lime applications, and to a regime of either cutting or grazing, respectively. In the Park Grass Experiment, the yields of all plots studied appeared to be extrinsically unstable, with only small differences between fertiliser treatments. However, plots receiving lime showed a higher extrinsic stability than unlined plots. The extrinsic stability of the plot receiving farmyard manure (FYM) was lower than that of the plot receiving an equivalent of mineral nitrogen. Also at the Ossekampen, only small differences arose between the extrinsic stability of plots receiving various fertiliser treatments. Instead, the grassland management of the plots had an overriding effect on these stability levels. Whereas the extrinsic stability of all cut plots was low, all grazed plots were nearly entirely stable. It is argued that the nitrogen dynamics in grassland ecosystems have only a small impact on their extrinsic stability levels, in spite of the predictions by simulation models. Instead, pH-related soil processes and the grassland management play an overriding role in the maintenance of the production stability of mixed grassland. It is conceivable that a large number of other processes, which regulate ecosystem stability, could be identified in other plots and experiments, using the same mathematical framework.

AB Populations of rodents isolated on islands are often different from mainland populations in their life history and behaviour. We studied two populations of G. gerbillus - from a small isolated sand patch in the central Negev (''island" population), and one from a large sand massif in the Arava valley (''mainland " population). We asked (a) whether there are any between-population differences in body size, demography, reproduction rate and behaviour; (b) do these differences (if any) conform to " island syndrome " and Q what features allow the " island " population to persist on a very small and isolated area. The period of deep density decrease and low reproductive activity was much shorter in the " mainland " than in the " island " population. Difference in gerbil density between areas was not related to the difference in food resources. Age structure of both populations was characterized by a very high proportion of adults. Animals on the " island " survived longer than those on the " mainland ". Mean area of home range of mates was significantly larger than that of females on the " mainland ", but not on the " island ". " Island " females had larger home ranges than " mainland " females. No sexual dimorphism in body mass was found in the " island " population. In contrast, mainland " males were heavier than cohabitating females. Gerbils from the mainland " were significantly heavier than their " island " conspecifics. Encounters of male G. gerbillus from the same population were characterized by a low level of cohesive behaviour and a significantly higher level of agonism. " Island " individuals manifested mainly direct aggressive behaviours, whereas the agonistic behaviour in the " mainland " individuals was mainly ritualized. We concluded, that the characteristics of the " island " population did not conform to those predicted based on the " island syndrome " concept.

AB Algal species composition and cover data were collected from sixteen stations along 150 km of the Mediterranean coast of Israel during 1973-1995. The samples produced 185 composite samples from three habitat types, platform, wall, and rocky sea floor, which were analyzed using numerical classification and ordination techniques (TWINSPAN and RDA) to determine whether habitat, season, site, or yearly patterns correlate with observed differences between the algal communities. We conclude that habitat is the most important factor determining algal community composition, followed by season and site. Community patterns fluctuate between years but show no trends. Some recommendations for future monitoring are given.

AB The occurrence of six littoral species of Ceriodaphnia (C. affinis, C. laticaudata, C. megops, C. reticulata, C rotunda and C. setosa) living at the same time and locality is described. Basic population characteristics were studied in all species coexisting in the field, except for C. setosa, which was too scarce. Abundances, proportions of gamogenetic individuals, mean body lengths and clutch sizes were compared among species. Dissolved oxygen, temperature, chlorophyll-a and total seston volume were measured and related to population changes. C laticaudata and C. rotunda were closely similar to each other in many features and showed significant differences to other species. C. reticulata and C. megops seem to be similar in some features, while C. affinis was ecologically different.

AB Factors affecting the tree/grass coexistence in savannas and consequences on the organic matter budgets were explored in this review. In savannas, water and nutrients are commonly; limiting resources. and consequently the tree and grasses are interacting. However, this interaction is only apparent since the tree/grass competitors are coexisting in savanna vegetations, which are characterized by a wide range of physionogmic types spanning herbaceous to woodland savannas. The tree/grass coexistence is evident in climatic and edaphic savannas, whereas in humidic and mesic savannas, the fire factor controls tree density and its competitor ability depending upon the accumulation of organic matter. In order to explain the tree/grass coexistence several hypotheses have been proposed. An exclusion solution due to competitor superiority of grasses has been proposed for dry savannas. As the water supply increases, the grasses coexist by a spatial partitioning of the soil water resources. This equilibrium solution occurs by niche separation. Without ruling out these possibilities, there exist savannas where trees and grasses are competing by limiting resources. The competitive abilities of trees and grasses differed in response to environmental features; thus coexistence is associated with niche difference. In disturbance-prone savanna the mechanisms of the tree/grass coexistence for the competing species is based on a reduction in tree-grass competition due to control of tree density. Under savanna protection, grasses are competitively excluded by trees as the life-span of individuals is affected by the competitive interactions between trees and trees as well as trees and grasses. The causal mechanisms allowing tree/grass coexistance in savannas were explored on the basis of the ecological hypothesis of system equilibrium or stability. The changes it? the proportion of the tree/grass components affect the organic matter budget of the system. As a result of protection of the savannas, vegetation is able to sequester significant quantities of carbon. The calculated sequestering pool of carbon in both the restored forest vegetation and soil would be 5.99 Pg C for a restoration time of 51 years.

ID MODEL; ATTACK
AB This paper deals with a mathematical model of a non-interactive type autotropherbivore system in which the removal rate of the autotroph (or the herbivore feeding rate) has been taken as a Holling type-III function. The result shows that the system possesses a single steady state which is either a global attractor or there exists a stable limit cycle around it. It is also shown that there may exist small amplitude Hopf-type oscillations depending on the parameter of the system. Finally, a computer analysed result shows the behaviour of the solutions for different values of the system parameters involving the carrying capacity of the autotroph and the half saturation coefficient of the uptake function.

AB Vegetation of 127 sites on different aspects of dune-interdunes in the Indian Thar Desert was classified using TWINSPAN. TWINSPAN groupings of sites separated better vegetated dunes of the northeast form the poorly vegetated dunes of the northwest and the southwest. Of the different ordinations using noncentred, centred and centred and standardized principal component analysis, reciprocal averaging and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), the site and species classes in DCA correlated well with ten edaphic and ten vegetational attributes of each site. Strong correlation of vegetation groupings with soil texture, moisture holding capacity and low correlation with pH and electrical conductivity revealed the possible importance of soil physical properties in affecting vegetation composition.
   The 11 species classes in TWINSPAN were regrouped into 18 species classes in DCA, which separated highly frequent species from those of less and least frequent species. Based on dominance-diversity attributes, Calligonum polygonoides-Lasiurus sindicus was brought out as bioedaphic climax stage. Correlation of ordination scores in different site groupings with vegetational attributes showed specific trends: From the zero of x, y and z axes to their maximum, the ordination scores of grasses and browse species declined while score of spinous species increased. The sites near the origin of the x, y and z axes were therefore least degraded and those at or near the maximum of x, y & z axes were most disturbed as was confirmed by the dominance diversity trends. Thus trends of compositional and functional attributes of vegetation of sites in different groupings helped in inferring a site's degradation status.

AB This paper describes a program which simulates growth of the aquatic plant, Potamogeton pectinatus L. (sago pondweed), and plant consumption by the herbivorous fish, Ctenopharyngodon idella Val (triploid grass carp), under environmental conditions characteristic of a northern California irrigation system. In the program, plant growth is driven by temperature and light intensity, and grass carp feeding and growth by water temperature. The program uses data on these variables collected from the Byrnes Canal using data loggers which recorded temperature and light at 0.5-h intervals on 115 days during the summer of 1989. Less extensive data sets from two other canals were used to construct realistic simulation scenarios for canals with warmer or cooler water temperatures. The program provided reasonable predictions of plant growth, plant consumption by the fish, and fish growth. Simulations showed that using triploid grass carp in northern California irrigation systems that typically have cool water temperatures (12 to 24-degrees-C) would require more fish (50 or 250 kg vegetated ha 1 depending on the management objectives) than previous simulations for lakes in the U.S. would suggest. Evaluation of two management strategies indicated that stocking grass carp at 50 kg vegetated ha-1 in the first year, and retrieving and releasing them in subsequent years would be economically competitive with current management practices.

AB We investigated the potential diet of Gerbillurus paeba exilis (Shortridge and Carter, 1938) from dune slacks in the eastern Cape using food preference tests on captive animals in summer and winter. Food categories investigated were: seeds, leaves and stems, and arthropods. The seeds of Arctotheca populifolia were the most preferred food. A seasonal change in diet was found: gerbils consumed mainly arthropods and seeds in summer, while in winter, few arthropods were eaten, the preferred diet consisting chiefly of seeds. Little green plant material was ingested. The seasonal change in food preferences may influence the timing of breeding.

AB Conservation efforts in global biodiversity hotspots often face a common predicament: an urgent need for conservation action hampered by a significant lack of knowledge about that biodiversity. In recent decades, the computerisation of primary biodiversity data worldwide has provided the scientific community with raw material to increase our understanding of the shared natural heritage. These datasets, however, suffer from a lot of geographical and taxonomic inaccuracies. Automated tools developed to enhance their reliability have shown that detailed expert examination remains the best way to achieve robust and exhaustive datasets. In New Caledonia, one of the most important biodiversity hotspots worldwide, the plant diversity inventory is still underway, and most taxa awaiting formal description are narrow endemics, hence by definition hard to discern in the datasets. In the meantime, anthropogenic pressures, such as nickel-ore mining, are threatening the unique ultramafic ecosystems at an increasing rate. The conservation challenge is therefore a race against time, as the rarest species must be identified and protected before they vanish. In this study, based on all available datasets and resources, we applied a workflow capable of highlighting the lesser known taxa. The main challenges addressed were to aggregate all data available worldwide, and tackle the geographical and taxonomic biases, avoiding the data loss resulting from automated filtering. Every doubtful specimen went through a careful taxonomic analysis by a local and international taxonomist panel. Geolocation of the whole dataset was achieved through dataset cross-checking, local botanists' field knowledge, and historical material examination. Field studies were also conducted to clarify the most unresolved taxa. With the help of this method and by analysing over 85,000 data, we were able to double the number of known narrow endemic taxa, elucidate 68 putative new species, and update our knowledge of the rarest species' distributions so as to promote conservation measures.

AB Karst caves are a natural oligotrophic subsurface biosphere widely distributed in southern China. Despite the progress in bacterial and fungal diversity, the knowledge about interactions between bacteria, fungi, and minerals is still limited in caves. Hence, for the first time, we investigated the interaction between bacteria and fungi living on weathered rocks in the Heshang Cave via high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS1 genes, and co-occurrence analysis. The mineral compositions of weathered rocks were analyzed by X-ray diffraction. Bacterial communities were dominated by Actinobacteria (33.68%), followed by Alphaproteobacteria (8.78%), and Planctomycetia (8.73%). In contrast, fungal communities were dominated by Sordariomycetes (21.08%) and Dothideomycetes (14.06%). Mineral substrata, particularly phosphorus-bearing minerals, significantly impacted bacterial (hydroxyapatite) and fungal (fluorapatite) communities as indicated by the redundancy analysis. In comparison with fungi, the development of bacterial communities was more controlled by the environmental selection indicated by the overwhelming contribution of deterministic processes. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that all nodes were positively linked, indicating ubiquitous cooperation within bacterial groups and fungal groups, as well as between bacteria and fungi under oligotrophic conditions in the subsurface biosphere. In total, 19 bacterial ASVs and 34 fungal OTUs were identified as keystone taxa, suggesting the fundamental role of fungi in maintaining the microbial ecosystem on weathered rocks. Ascomycota was most dominant in keystone taxa, accounting for 26.42%, followed by Actinobacteria in bacteria (24.53%). Collectively, our results confirmed the highly diverse bacterial and fungal communities on weathered rocks, and their close cooperation to sustain the subsurface ecosystem. Phosphorus-bearing minerals were of significance in shaping epipetreous bacterial and fungal communities.

AB Vegetation pattern provides useful signals for vegetation protection and can be identified as an early warning of desertification. In some arid or semi-arid regions, vegetation ab-sorbs water through nonlocal interaction of roots. In this study, we present a vegetation model with nonlocal interaction which is characterized by an integral term with a kernel function. Mathematical analysis provides the conditions for the generation of stationary pattern. Numerical simulations exhibit different spatial distributions of vegetation. Densi-ties of vegetation and water show an inverse relationship at same spatial locations due to water transport mechanism. The results reveal that the interaction intensity and the shape of the kernel function can cause the transition of vegetation pattern. Specifically, the veg-etation biomass increases as the interaction intensity decreases or as the nonlocal inter-action distance increases. We demonstrate that the nonlocal interactions between roots of vegetation is a key mechanism for the formation of vegetation pattern, which provides a theoretical basis for the preservation and restoration of vegetation.

AB The evolution of brain size is constrained by the trade-off between the energetic costs allocated towards its maintenance and the cognitive advantages that come with a larger brain, leading to a paradox. The cognitive benefits of larger brains (e.g., high behavioural flexibility) mitigate extrinsic mortality factors, which may indirectly select for slower ageing that prolongs lifespan ("cognitive buffer hypothesis"). However, substantial energetic costs imposed by the maintenance of neural tissue is expected to compromise the energetic budget of large-brained organisms, and their investment in somatic maintenance and repair, thus accelerating ageing that shortens lifespan (the "disposable soma theory"). The relationship between lifespan and brain size has mostly been investigated in birds and mammals. Thus, whether these trade-offs express across ectothermic vertebrates remains to be addressed on a large-scale. Our study presents the first large-scale analysis of the brain size-lifespan relationship in ectothermic tetrapods (amphibians and reptiles). Using a dataset spanning 265 species, we performed phylogenetic linear models to investigate the predicted trade-off between variation in brain size and longevity. Our findings revealed a negative relationship between brain size and lifespan across reptiles, whereas no association was observed across amphibians. Thus, the relationship between life history and brain evolution in ectotherms does not follow the general pattern found across other vertebrates. Among ectotherms, the high metabolic cost of producing neural tissue seems to transcend the cognitive benefits of evolving a larger brain. Consequently, our findings suggest that natural selection favours optimization of the energetic economy over the fitness-advantages that cognitive benefits may offer.

AB Aim Trait-based approaches are being used increasingly in island biogeography, providing key insights into the eco-evolutionary dynamics of insular systems. However, the determinants of persistence of plant species after they have arrived and established on an island remain largely unexplored. Here, we used three edaphic island systems (i.e., habitat patches distinguished from the landscape matrix by distinct soil conditions and specialized vegetation) to examine relationships between persistence strategies (those associated with clonality, bud bank, seed mass and life-form) and insularity. We hypothesized that insularity promotes and selects strategies to persist locally, such that species occurring on small and/or isolated edaphic islands show trait values indicative of enhanced persistence and lower functional diversity. Location Three European systems of edaphic islands in the Western Carpathians, Moravia and the Cantabrian Range. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods For each system, we used linear models to explore persistence-related plant trait patterns (mean trait values and functional diversity) in relationship to three insularity metrics (island size, isolation and target effect). We focused on patterns of edaphic island specialists because their presence is confined to the islands. Results We found that insularity metrics largely explained the variation of the mean value and diversity of persistence-related traits of edaphic island plant specialists. Specifically, insularity was positively related to traits supporting local persistence (e.g., more extensive lateral spread) and to a reduced variability in persistence traits. More insular systems showed stronger and more numerous trait-insularity links. Main conclusions Insularity can affect plant species diversity, form and function in edaphic island systems, such as selecting for enhanced and less diverse persistence strategies. Plant species occurring in insular systems might therefore avoid or delay local extinction by promoting adaptive strategies to persist in situ.

AB Microbes in subsurface oil reservoirs play important roles in elemental cycles and biogeochemical processes. However, the community assembly pattern of indigenous microbiome and their succession under long-term human activity remain poorly understood. Here we studied the microbial community assembly in underground sandstone cores from 190 to 2050 m in northeast China and their response to long-term oil recovery (10-50 years). Indigenous microbiome in subsurface petroleum reservoirs were dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria, which exhibited a higher contribution of homogenizing dispersal assembly and different taxonomy distinct ecological modules when compared with perturbed samples. Specifically, the long-term oil recovery reduced the bacterial taxonomic- and functional-diversity, and increased the community co-occurrence associations in subsurface oil reservoirs. Moreover, distinguished from the perturbed samples, both variation partition analysis and structural equation model revealed that the contents of quartz, NO3- and Cl- significantly structured the alpha- and f3-diversity in indigenous subsurface bacterial communities. These findings first provide the holistic picture of microbiome in the deep oil reservoirs, which demonstrate the significant impact of human activity on microbiome in deep continental subsurface.

AB Impacts of the exceptionally high temperature and salinity on species composition, abundance, biomass and diversity of zooplankton communities were examined in the central Arabian (Persian) Gulf in late winter and summer of 2010 and 2011. Remarkably diverse zooplankton assemblages were characterized with small calanoids (Paracalanus aculeatus and Temora longicornis), cyclopoids (Oithona nana, Oithona plumifera, Corycaeus flaccus and Corycaeus lautus) and harpacticoids (Euterpina acutifrons) with relatively low abundance and biomass. Overall, the low biomass and abundance were not significantly associated with phytoplankton, whereas zooplankton faunal similarities were significantly correlated with water properties measured as environmental distances across sampling sites. Spatially, the lowest abundance, biomass and diversity occurred in extremely saline nearshore waters off the western Qatar peninsula, whereas the highest abundance, biomass and diversity consistently appeared at northeast offshore locations that periodically encounter nutrient and species-rich but low-salinity water entering the Arabian Gulf via the Strait of Hormuz. Numerically, the relative dominance of calanoids along with lower salinity and high chlorophyll-a concentration in the northeast Arabian Gulf implies that zooplankton populations are likely replenished by the seasonal (summer) transport of species from the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, which may explain partly the high variations of species richness and zooplankton abundance previously reported in the region. Given increasing evidence of climate-change induced responses of zooplankton, our findings suggest that in the semi-closed Arabian Gulf resident populations stressed by the harsh environment are likely to continue to be sustained only by invading water masses during the summer.

AB The Ojo de Liebre Lagoon is a Marine Protected Area that lies within a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is a critical habitat for important migratory species such as the grey whale and bird species. Unique hypersaline environments, such as the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon, are underexplored in terms of their bacterial and chemical diversity, representing a potential source for new bio-active compounds with pharmacological properties. Actinobacteria are one of the most diverse and prolific taxonomic bacterial groups in terms of marine bioactive compounds. This study aimed to identify the culturable actinobacterial community inhabiting the Lagoon, as well as to test their potential as new sources of anticancer compounds with pharmacological potential. A selective isolation approach focused on spore-forming bacteria from 40 sediment samples generated a culture collection of 64 strains. The 16S rRNA gene analyses identified three phyla in this study, the Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, where the phylum Actinobacteria dominated (57%) the microbial community profiles. Within the Actinobacteria, nine different genera were isolated including the Actinomadura, Micromonospora, Nocardiopsis, Plantactinospora and Streptomyces sp. We observed seasonal differences on actinobacteria recovery. For instance, Micromonospora strains were recovered during the four sampling seasons, while Arthrobacter and Pseudokineococcus were only isolated in February 2018, and Blastococcus, Rhodococcus and Streptomyces were uniquely isolated in June 2018. Ethyl acetate crude extracts derived from actinobacterial cultures were generated and screened for cytotoxic activity against six cancer cell lines. Strains showed promising low percentages of viability on lung (H1299), cervical (SiHa), colon (Caco-2) and liver (HepG2) cancer lines. Molecular networking results suggest many of the metabolites produced by these strains are unknown and they might harbour novel chemistry. Our results showed the Ojo de Liebre Lagoon is a novel source for isolating diverse marine actinobacteria which produce promising bioactive compounds for potential biotechnological use as anticancer agents.

   REINTRODUCTION
AB Translocations of kiwi (Apteryx spp.) are one of the most common and growing types of conservation translocations in New Zealand. However, their outcomes remain mostly unpublished, which does not allow for sharing of lessons learnt from past developments. We reviewed 102 kiwi translocations from the 19th century until 2018, and identified factors affecting their outcome. North Island brown kiwi (A. mantelli) was the most translocated species, but the highest impact of translocations on the improvement of conservation status was for the rarest taxa: little spotted kiwi (A. owenii), rowi (A. rowi), and Haast tokoeka (A. australis 'Haast'). Translocations are typically used for creating secure populations and, more recently, for ecosystem restoration objectives and meta-population management. We developed a set of criteria to evaluate the outcome of introductions and reintroductions based on demographic parameters alongside current recommendations on genetic make-up of translocated populations. These criteria allowed us to categorise historical and recent translocations that were carried out for a wide array of objectives. Currently, based on these criteria, only a few translocated populations can be considered successful in the medium-long term: 15+ years following the release of a genetically diverse population (40+ unrelated individuals). Most historical translocations failed or require further genetic and habitat management. However, a majority of kiwi translocations have occurred over the last two decades and, while several populations have successfully established, for most of them, it is too soon to assess their medium-long term outcome. An analysis of factors affecting translocation outcomes revealed that, despite ongoing predator control, populations at small, unfenced sites on the mainland suffer from dispersal and predation, which has negative demographic and genetic consequences. Releases to larger mainland sites and predator-free areas have increased survival times, which indicates higher chances for a positive translocation outcome. Moreover, translocated wild-caught and captive-sourced birds survived longer compared to birds from the Operation Nest Egg programme, particularly at sites that were not predator-free. We highlight the need for genetic considerations in the planning and adaptive management of proposed and existing translocated populations. Specifically, we suggest that differences in kiwi survival, based on the type of released birds and release site's area size and predator status, should be considered during translocation planning. Similarly, we encourage a standardised monitoring approach, increased reporting, and publishing the outcomes of translocations.

AB Aim Palaeoceanographic changes can act as drivers of diversification and speciation, even in highly mobile marine organisms. Shearwaters are a group of globally distributed and highly mobile pelagic seabirds. Despite a recent well-resolved phylogeny, shearwaters have controversial species limits, and show periods of both slow and rapid diversification. Here, we explore the role of palaeoceanographic changes on shearwaters' diversification and speciation. We investigate shearwater biogeography and the evolution of a key phenotypic trait, body size, and we assess the validity of their current taxonomy. Location Worldwide. Taxa Shearwaters (Order Procellariiformes, Family Procellariidae, Genera Ardenna, Calonectris and Puffinus). Methods We generated genomic (ddRAD) data to infer a time-calibrated species tree for the shearwaters. We estimated ancestral ranges and evaluated the roles of founder events, vicariance and surface ocean currents in driving diversification. We performed phylogenetic generalised least squares to identify potential predictors of variability in body size along the phylogeny. To assess the validity of the current taxonomy, we analysed genomic patterns of recent shared ancestry and differentiation among shearwater taxa. Results We identified a period of high dispersal and rapid speciation during the Late Pliocene-early Pleistocene. Species dispersal appears to be favoured by surface ocean currents, and founder events are supported as the main mode of speciation in these highly mobile pelagic seabirds. Body mass shows significant associations with life strategies and local conditions. The current taxonomy shows some incongruences with the patterns of genomic divergence. Main Conclusions A reduction of neritic areas during the Pliocene seems to have driven global extinctions of shearwater species, followed by a subsequent burst of speciation and dispersal probably promoted by Plio-Pleistocene climatic shifts. Our findings extend our understanding on the drivers of speciation and dispersal of highly mobile pelagic seabirds and shed new light on the important role of palaeoceanographic events.

AB Although litter prevention has environmental, social and economic benefits, cigarette butts are the most littered item on earth. While there has been vast research into the relationship between different factors affecting consumer behaviour, further research is needed to examine the antecedents of consumer sustainable behaviour. The aim of this study is to test the impact of feared self and landfill awareness on the sustainable behaviour of consumers using a structural equation modelling approach. Primary data of consumers are used to validate the hypothesised model. The findings highlight that feared self has a positive impact on the sustainable behaviour of consumers, while feared-self congruency and landfill awareness do not affect consumer sustainable behaviour. As for the implications, the results can support academics and strategic managers in the design process of sustainable consumer awareness programs to achieve environmental, social and economic benefits in the era of circular economy.

AB Explaining the stability of human populations provides knowledge for understanding the resilience of human societies to environmental change. Here, we use archaeological radiocarbon records to evaluate a hypothesis drawn from resilience thinking that may explain the stability of human populations: Faced with long-term increases in population density, greater variability in the production of food leads to less stable populations, while lower variability leads to more stable populations. However, increased population stability may come with the cost of larger collapses in response to rare, large-scale environmental perturbations. Our results partially support this hypothesis. Agricultural societies that relied on extensive landscape engineering to intensify production and tightly control variability in the production of food experienced the most stability. Contrary to the hypothesis, these societies also experienced the least severe population declines. We propose that the interrelationship between landscape engineering and increased political-economic complexity reduces the magnitude of population collapses in a region.

AB Despite the important role of marine mammals in marine ecosystems and the imperative for their conservation, there is still a great lack of information on the diversity, distribution, and density of these animals in the Saudi waters of the Arabian Gulf. To fill this gap, an integrative data-collection approach including fishermen's questionnaires, opportunistic sighting reports, and directed boat-based surveys, was undertaken between 2016 and 2020, leading to the first scientific report of marine mammal diversity, distribution, and density in the region. The results of the different approaches carried out during the study confirmed a high diversity of cetaceans on the west coast of the study area, with bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) and dugongs (Dugong dugon) as the most common species. While the two dolphin species were found to be widely distributed in both coastal and offshore waters, D. dugon appears to occur exclusively in coastal waters in the southern part of the study area, mainly in the Gulf of Salwah. The presence of both species of dolphins increased during the summer months and in the vicinity of the numerous oil and gas facilities in this region. The distribution of the observed dolphins was found mostly within a 10-20 km radius around each facility. Other cetacean species observed less frequently in the area include Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni), killer whale (Orcinus orca), common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) and finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides). Regarding the density of marine mammals in the region, boat-based surveys confirmed the results of fishermen's questionnaires and reports of opportunistic sightings, with bottlenose and humpback dolphins being the most abundant species. These results provide a baseline for policies oriented to the conservation of mammals in the Saudi waters of the Arabian Gulf.

AB Aim Identification of particular traits that predispose species to elevated extinction risk is an important component of proactive conservation. We capitalise on a recent strategic extinction risk assessment of all Australian squamate reptiles to identify intrinsic life history traits and extrinsic threats that correlate with extinction risk. We further assess whether extinction risk correlates differ between species impacted by different threatening processes (habitat loss vs. invasive species).
   Location Australia.
   Taxon Squamate reptiles.
   Methods We used the IUCN Red List data for Australian squamates, and publicly available datasets for 14 intrinsic and extrinsic traits. We used phylogenetically controlled Bayesian inference to test hypotheses regarding relationships between extinction risk and species traits, environment, and threat measures.
   Results We found that intrinsic characteristics (habitat specialisation, small range size and large body size), as well as extrinsic factors (high human footprint, accessibility from human population centres, cold temperatures and high rainfall), predispose a species to extinction. Similar predictors were important in threat-specific analyses, although relationships were generally more uncertain.
   Conclusions Our results largely accord with those of global and regional studies of extinction risk in reptiles and of terrestrial vertebrates more broadly. Our findings illustrate that there is no single pathway to extinction among Australian squamates.

TI Resource islands of Salix cupularis facilitating seedling emergence of

AB Salix cupularis is a common shrub for ecological restoration of the desertified alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. However, the effect of S. cupularis on spatial heterogeneity of soil resources (i.e., resource islands effect) has not been systematically evaluated, and the influence of shrub patches on the rehabilitation of understory herbs has also been unknown. In this study, we randomly selected S. cupularis individuals in the early restoration stage of desertified alpine meadow, where the three native forages (Elymus nutans, Elymus sibiricus and Festuca sinensis) were sown at different microsites around S. cupularis to explore the effects of S. cupularis on soil resources and emergence rates of the native forages. The results showed that S. cupularis significantly increased SWC (soil water content), C (carbon) and N (nitrogen) nutrients (p < 0.01) and enzyme activities (p 0.05) under canopy compared with the bare land, and the improvement performed better in the topsoil (0?5 cm) than in the subtop-soil (5?15 cm). Moreover, the soil properties were affected significantly by microsites around S. cupularis, resulting in regular changes of SWC, nutrients and enzyme activities in different microsites (Shrub center Middle of canopy radius > Bare land). In addition, there are significant regression relationships between emergence rates and enriching soil water, C and N nutrients, so the emergence rates of native forages under canopy may be improved significantly with the enriched soil resources, especially for E. nutans. As a result, S. cupularis is a suitable pioneer shrub for the vegetation restoration of desertified alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau, because it could not only shape the enrichment of soil resources under canopy, but also facilitate emergence of companion forages in the process of vegetation restoration.

AB In plants, long-distance dispersal is both attenuated and directed by specific movement vectors, including animals, wind, and/or water. Hence, movement vectors partly shape metapopulation genetic patterns that are, however, also influenced by other life-history traits such as clonal growth. We studied the relationship between area, isolation, plant-species richness, reproduction, and dispersal mechanisms with genetic diversity and divergence in 4 widespread wetland plant-species in a total of 20 island-like kettle-hole habitats surrounded by an intensive agricultural landscape. Our results showed that genetic parameters reflect the reproduction strategies with the highest genetic diversity being observed in the non-clonal, outcrossing Oenanthe aquatica compared to the clonal Lycopus europaeus, Typha latifolia, and Phragmites australis. Lycopus showed a positive relationship between genetic diversity and kettle-hole area, but a negative relationship with the number of neighboring kettle holes (less isolation). Genetic diversity increased with plant-species richness in the clonal species Phragmites and Lycopus; while it decreased in the non-clonal Oenanthe. Finally, genetic divergence and, therefore, connectivity differed between alternative dispersal strategies, where wind-dispersed Typha and Phragmites had a higher gene flow between the analyzed kettle holes compared with the insect-pollinated, hydrochorous Lycopus and Oenanthe. Our study provides information on genetic patterns related to reproduction and dispersal mechanisms of 4 common wetland species contributing to the understanding of the functioning of plant metacommunities occurring in kettle holes embedded in agricultural landscapes.

AB A low-cost restoration action in patchy drylands worldwide is the installation of obstructions (hereafter, resource sinks) to break runoff pathways and retain resources. Field-works have studied how the effectiveness of this action depends on the materials installed. However, the influence and effectiveness of the cover and spatial organization of resource sinks have not been widely investigated. In this work, we use a well-known dryland model to study how different initial cover and spatial organization of installed resource sinks affect the recovered ecosystem. In agreement with field-work studies, our results confirm that the installation of resource sinks can restore degraded drylands that would not recover naturally. More importantly, a very small cover of resource sinks was sufficient to trigger vegetation recovery, while a high cover would lead to complete failure. Higher plant densities were reached when distribution and cover were similar to that of spatial self-organized vegetation in the reference healthy system (i.e., regular spatial distribution in our study system). Given the effectiveness of low cover installations, suggested by our work, combined with the low-cost materials needed, resource sinks have the potential to be a key contributor to the large restoration efforts needed to achieve land-degradation neutrality, particularly in developing countries.

AB Reintroductions are an important recovery tool for endangered species but have had varying success. We used demographic data to evaluate the use of reintroductions for the recovery of the federally endangered Sierra Nevada Yellow-legged Frog (Rana sierrae) in stream populations in its northern range where the species is particularly at risk. We conducted a capture-mark-recapture study from 2016-2018 in four diverse streams. One of the streams contained a high abundance of frogs that allowed us to investigate demography in a relatively healthy population. In another of the streams, we tested a reintroduction using captive-reared frogs. We used robust design Huggins and Pradel models to estimate abundance, apparent overwinter survival, recruitment, longevity, and sex ratios. Annual abundance estimates were small, with <= 52 wild adult frogs at three streams and few tadpoles or subadults seen in any of the streams. The oldest frog in our streams was at least 13 yr. Estimates of apparent survival rates of wild adults ranged from 0.55 +/- 0.05 standard error (SE) to 0.90 +/- 0.05 SE, and estimates of annual recruitment ranged from 0.02 +/- 0.11 SE to 0.26 +/- 0.03 SE per site. High survival rates leading to long-lived adults may facilitate persistence of these stream populations, whereas low recruitment may limit population growth and recovery. The two largest populations were in intermittent streams, which may reflect their roles as a refuge from fishes. At least 52% of captive-reared frogs survived their first summer after release and at least 36% survived their first winter. Apparent overwinter survival of captive-reared frogs was lower than for wild frogs, ranging from 0.29 +/- 0.13 SE to 0.56 +/- 0.14 SE. Because of the apparent low survival of wild eggs, tadpoles, and subadults, releasing adults as was done in this study, rather than younger life stages, may be more successful. Our results offer promise for the use of reintroductions to augment depleted populations and su est that further research on factors affecting recruitment and survival of younger life stages is needed.

AB Priodontes maximus is the largest living armadillo and is at risk of extinction. The species ranges throughout South America and one of its last refuges in the entire Atlantic Forest is a reserve complex called Sooretama. We investigated the conservation status of the species and its role as an ecosystem engineer in Sooretama. We employed camera-traps, active searches and checked the data from previous studies in the area. In the past 14 years, there were 70 records of the species in 31 sites, including 43 camera-trap images, 25 excavations and two carcasses. However, our recent field work (2018-2019) recorded images of only three adult individuals (a female, a male and one of unidentified sex) and one excavation with evidence that poachers had killed its occupant. We observed through camera-traps that at least 37 vertebrate species used monitored excavations. The species-richness detected in sites with excavations was greater than in sites without excavations. The number of species using excavations of P. maximus in Sooretama was one of the greatest recorded among studies carried out in different biomes. The interior of excavations tended to be used mainly by ground foraging stratum species and by invertebrate and omnivore diets species. This study demonstrated the important role of P. maximus as an ecosystem engineer in the Atlantic Forest. However, unless the course of its imminent extinction can be reversed, P. maximus soon will not be able to play its important ecological role in the Sooretama region. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB The majority of lizard clades are ancestrally and predominantly diurnal. The only major taxon in which most species are nocturnal is the Gekkota (geckos and pygopodids). As ectothermic thermoregulators, lizard metabolic rates are highly temperature dependent, and diurnal lizards therefore demonstrate higher metabolic rates than nocturnal ones. Furthermore, exposure to solar radiation is thought to reduce ectothermic longevity by increasing both metabolic costs and the rate of accumulating harmful mutations through UV radiation (UVC specifically). In being nocturnal, ectothermic species may reduce their intrinsic mortality rates and thus live longer. To test this hypothesis, we collected literature data on the maximum longevities of 740 lizard species, of which 185 are geckos. We examined whether geckos live longer than other lizards, and whether activity time affects gecko longevity. While geckos live relatively long for lizards of their size, their activity time was found to be unrelated to longevity, contradicting our predictions. We suggest that diurnal species may have evolved higher resistance to UV radiation via thicker, more keratinized skin. Elevated metabolic rates do not automatically equate with faster aging. Mortality through extrinsic causes (e.g., predation) may impose much stronger selective pressures than intrinsic causes.

AB Many organisms are known to have wide distribution ranges, which cover large variability of ecological conditions. Therefore, natural history traits can differ throughout the distributional range, and, thus, studies on the natural history of traits from multiple areas of a single species are highly valuable. Ceratina cucurbitina is the most common small carpenter bee in Europe. We examined the social status of nests and maternal investment in four European locations: Czech Republic, Italy, Albania, and Crete. This species is solitary in all studied locations. We found evidence for nest reuse and founding of multiple nests per year; however, this behavior is relatively uncommon. The average number of brood cells provisioned was 8.75; however, this value was significantly lower in Crete than in other regions. Sex of offspring was related to brood cell position; the inner brood cells tended to be female-biased and outer brood cells male-biased. Despite that, we did not find evidence for the typical dwarf eldest daughter pattern of maternal investment in most studied regions. Generally, conditions for C. cucurbitina reproduction seem to be better in the center of the range (Italy, Albania) than on the margins (Czech Republic, Crete). A higher number of brood cell provisioned and/or larger size of offspring was found in central regions than in marginal regions.

AB Aim Little is known about the contributions of individual clades to the broader latitudinal diversity gradients of lizards and snakes in North America. Additionally, the environmental variables underpinning these patterns have not been extensively studied, nor have the relationships between squamate species richness and biome variety, a proxy for habitat heterogeneity. Here, we deconstruct the latitudinal diversity gradient of squamates and investigate lizard and snake species richness in relation to environmental gradients and biomes across continental North America.
   Location North America, excluding islands.
   Taxon Squamata (lizards and snakes).
   Methods We collated a suite of environmental variables (n = 10) and squamate species ranges (n = 1,152) in an equal-area grid system (100 x 100 km cells) spanning continental North America. We deconstructed the latitudinal diversity gradient of squamates and examined species richness patterns for all lizards, all snakes and several individual squamate clades. We used multiple linear regressions to determine which environmental factors are most important for each squamate clade. Finally, we documented species richness within biomes and tested for correlations between species richness and biome variety.
   Results Squamates exhibit a strong latitudinal diversity gradient across continental North America. Snakes are more widespread and have a stronger gradient than lizards. Our multiple linear regression results indicate strong associations between species richness and environmental variables for all individual squamate clades analysed; temperature variables are strongly positively correlated with species richness. Biome variety is more strongly correlated with lizard species richness than snake species richness. Squamates are most species-rich in tropical/subtropical forests, deserts and mangroves.
   Main conclusions Most snake clades in North America exhibit strong latitudinal diversity gradients, but only two lizard clades, Dactyloidae (anoles) and Gekkota (geckos), display strong gradients and thus drive the overall lizard pattern. Squamate clades differ in their responses to environmental gradients, as reflected by their species richness patterns, with warmer climates generally harboring more species. Lizards are more strongly associated with habitat heterogeneity than snakes are, consistent with results from previous studies. Squamates in more rapidly shifting biomes (e.g. deserts, mangroves) may face a greater risk of extinction from impending climate change.

AB The aim of the research was to analyse the relationship between psychological gender and risk perception style and the manifestation of pro-safe attitudes. The study involved 507 people in the age range 20-64 years, including 257 women and 250 men. Variables were measured using the following methods: Znajmiecka-Sikora's questionnaire of attitudes towards safety (PwB), Zaleskiewicz's questionnaire of the individual risk perception style (SIRI) and Lipinska-Grobelny and Gorczycka's scale of masculinity and femininity (SMiK). The obtained results prove that psychological gender significantly differentiates risk perception style and attitudes towards safety. The feminine dimension has been shown to strengthen safe attitudes and minimize risk-taking, while the masculine dimension weakens attitudes towards safety and strengthens risk propensity.

AB In semi-arid and arid environments, clonal plants occasionally appear in ring patterns. There is a general agreement that this pattern forms when ramets grow radially, leaving a dead centre where the parent plant once was. Nevertheless, there is still some controversy over the actual causes of this dieback and how water source-sink relations in and around the rings are involved in their formation. We studied Asphodelus ramosus rings in two sites with different soil textures (sand and loess) but comparable climate, in order to understand whether differences in soil hydraulic properties create different water source-sink relations and mechanisms that drive ring formation. We characterised soil hydraulic properties and dynamics, accompanied by measurements of soil texture and of belowground storage root biomass. We found that the nature of source-sink relations varies with soil texture and properties. In sandy soils, water supply to ring perimeters is mainly from their centres. In loessial soils, water supply to ring perimeters is mainly from the surrounding matrix. Consequently, rings are larger in sandy soils than in loessial soils. This suggests that rings in both sites are formed by different mechanisms: fine particle deposition in the centres of ring in the sandy soil but competition over water in rings in the loessial soil. Studying the formation of rings and other vegetation spatial patterns should consider local soil properties and the possibility that similar patterns may emerge through various processes.

AB The digit ratio, an indicator of brain laterality, is the ratio of the second and fourth digits on the left (L24) or right foot (R24). Much of the research on the digit ratio and brain laterality focuses on primates, rather than other species such as reptiles. We tested whether the digit ratio in the gecko Ptyodactylus guttatus was associated with behaviors attributed to brain laterality. We examined risk-taking behavior (time spent under cover), foot preference (which foot was the first to start moving) and the side from which geckos bypassed an obstacle, in relation to the digit ratio. Geckos with longer fourth digits on their left hind foot (higher digit ratio) spent more time under cover. Geckos starting to move with their left leg were much more likely to bypass obstacles from the right side, and vice versa. This is the first evidence of laterality being associated with the digit ratio in reptiles. Comparisons among vertebrates are needed in order to decipher the evolutionary origin of the commonalities and peculiarities of brain asymmetry and disentangle the patterns and drivers of our evolutionary tree.

AB With expanding human populations, the food sector has faced constant pressure to sustainably expand and meet global production demands. In aquaculture this frequently manifests in an animal welfare crisis, with fish increasingly farmed under high production, high stress conditions. These intense environments can result in fish stocks having a high susceptibility to infection, with parasites and associated disease one of the main factors limiting industry growth. Prediction of infection dynamics is key to preventative treatment and mitigation. Considering the climatic and technology driven changes facing aquaculture, an understanding of how parasites react across a spectrum of conditions is required. Here we assessed the impact of temperature, infection density and host species on the life history traits of Argulus foliaceus, a common palearctic fish louse, representative of a parasite group problematic in freshwater aquaculture and fisheries worldwide. Temperature significantly affected development, growth and survival; parasites hatched and developed faster at higher temperatures, but also experienced shorter lifespans when maintained off the host. At high temperatures, these parasites will likely experience a short generation time as their life history traits are completed more rapidly. A. foliaceus additionally grew faster on natural hosts and at lower infection densities. Ultimately such results contribute to prediction of population dynamics, aiding development of effective control to improve animal welfare and reduce industry loss.

AB Mimicry is common in interspecies interactions, yet conditions maintaining Batesian mimicry have been primarily tested in predator-prey interactions. In pollination mutualisms, floral mimetic signals thought to dupe animals into pollinating unrewarding flowers are widespread (greater than 32 plant families). Yet whether animals learn to both correctly identify floral models and reject floral mimics and whether these responses are frequency-dependent is not well understood. We tested how learning affected the effectiveness and frequency-dependence of imperfect Batesian mimicry among flowers using the generalist bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, visiting Begonia odorata, a plant species exhibiting intersexual floral mimicry. Unrewarding female flowers are mimics of pollen-rewarding male flowers (models), though mimicry to the human eye is imperfect. Flower-naive bees exhibited a perceptual bias for mimics over models, but rapidly learned to avoid mimics. Surprisingly, altering the frequency of models and mimics only marginally shaped responses by naive bees and by bees experienced with the distribution and frequency of models and mimics. Our results provide evidence both of exploitation by the plant of signal detection trade-offs in bees and of resistance by the bees, via learning, to this exploitation. Critically, we provide experimental evidence that imperfect Batesian mimicry can be adaptive and, in contrast with expectations of signal detection theory, functions largely independently of the model and mimic frequency.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Signal detection theory in recognition systems: from evolving models to experimental tests'.

AB 1. Although caves are generally perceived as isolated habitats, at the local scale, they are often interconnected via a network of fissures in the bedrock. Accordingly, caves in close proximity are expected to host the same, or very similar, animal communities.
   2. We explored the extent to which subterranean arthropod communities are homogenous at a local spatial scale of less than 1 km(2), along with which cave-specific environmental features result in a departure from the expected homogeneous pattern. We approached this question by studying richness and turnover in terrestrial invertebrate communities of 27 caves in a small karst massif in the Western Italian Alps.
   3. Specialised subterranean species were homogeneously distributed among caves and were not influenced by seasonality. The only factor driving their distribution was the distance from the cave entrance, with deeper caves yielding a greater diversity of species.
   4. Significant spatio-temporal turnover in species not specialised to subterranean life was observed. In summer, there was a significant homogenisation of the community and a more even distribution of species among sites; in winter, these species were missing or found exclusively at greater depths, where environmental conditions were more stable. Furthermore, caves at lower elevations yielded, on average, a greater diversity and abundance of these species.
   5. This study demonstrated that the theoretical expectation of no turnover in community composition in caves in close proximity is not always met. Turnover can be mostly attributed to seasonal patterns and sampling depth; thus, our findings have implications for planning sampling and monitoring activities in caves.

AB Modern extensions of the theory of island biogeography (TIB) posit that the slope of the species-area relationship (SAR) reflects the insularity of ecological communities and is strongly influenced by species' motility. We explore the relative insularity of crustacean, echinoderm and mollusk/Cirripedia assemblages in terms of both alpha diversity (species richness) and assemblage structure (relative biomass of species). These taxa/groups differ in adult motility and larval dispersal capacity. The habitats of interest were 10 offshore banks on the Scotian Shelf, Northwest Atlantic Ocean, a region dominated by the NE- to SW-flowing Nova Scotia Current (NSC). Banks in the NE tended to be larger, more heterogeneous, cooler, less saline, more retentive and more productive (higher chlorophyll a) than those in the SW. Only mollusks/Cirripedia, the least motile and dispersive group, had a significant SAR slope, supporting TIB. For crustaceans and echinoderms, temperature/salinity properties and habitat heterogeneity, respectively, were important predictors of alpha diversity. Inter-bank variation in crustacean assemblage structure was accounted for largely by bank location relative to the NSC; the leading variables accounting for echinoderm and mollusk/Cirripedia assemblage structure were retention time and mean annual chlorophyll concentration, respectively. Along the NE to SW axis of the NSC, there was a substantial loss of species (7 crustacean, 9 echinoderm and 13 mollusk/Cirripedia species) and decreases in the biomass of common cold-water species. A complex interplay of species motility/ dispersal capacity, local oceanography and habitat properties determine the extent to which (1) TIB applies to submarine macroinvertebrate assemblages and (2) upstream and downstream assemblages are interconnected.

AB Although adult cane toads (Rhinella marina) are generally active only at night, a recent study reported that individuals of this species switched to diurnal activity in response to encountering a novel habitat type (deeply shaded gorges) in the course of their Australian invasion. Our sampling over a broader geographic scale challenges the idea that this behaviour is novel; we documented diurnal behaviour both in the species' native range and in several sites within the invaded range, in multiple habitat types. Diurnal activity was most common in the tropics and in areas where toads attain high population densities and are in poor body condition, suggesting that the expansion of activity times may be induced by intraspecific competition for food.

AB Facultative bipedality is regarded as an enigmatic middle ground in the evolution of obligate bipedality and is associated with high mechanical demands in extant lepidosaurs. Traits linked with this phenomenon are largely associated with the caudal end of the animal: hindlimbs and tail. The articulation of the pelvis with both of these structures suggests a morphofunctional role in the use of a facultative locomotor mode. Using a three-dimensional geometric morphometric approach, we examine the pelvic osteology and associated functional implications for 34 species of extant lepidosaur. Anatomical trends associated with the use of a bipedal locomotor mode and substrate preferences are correlated and functionally interpreted based on musculoskeletal descriptions. Changes in pelvic osteology associated with a facultatively bipedal locomotor mode are similar to those observed in species preferring arboreal substrates, indicating shared functionality between these ecologies.

AB Context The 25th anniversary of the founding of the UK chapter of the International Association for Landscape Ecology (ialeUK) was marked in 2017. Objectives To assess trends in UK landscape ecology research over ialeUK's first 25 years, to compare these trends to changes elsewhere in the world, and to consider how ialeUK can continue to support landscape ecology research and practice. Methods A database of conference abstracts was compiled and examined in combination with a questionnaire that surveyed existing and former active members of ialeUK. Results Across 1992-2017 we observe noticeable trends including the declining roles of statutory bodies, the development of the ecosystem services concept, and a decrease in use of empirical methods. Analysis of questionnaire results highlighted four key areas: Developing new researchers; Facilitating conferences for networking, learning and discussion; Linking policy with practice; and Driving the continued growth of landscape ecology as a discipline. Challenges were also noted, especially regarding the adoption of a wider understanding of landscape ecological principles in management. Conclusions Increases in qualitative research, decreases in studies explicitly examining connectivity/fragmentation and an absence of landscape genetics studies in the UK are seemingly distinct from US landscape ecology and elsewhere around the world, based on published accounts. ialeUK has had success in increasing the role of landscape ecology in policy and practice, but needs to continue to aim for improved collaboration with other landscape-related professional bodies and contributions to wider sustainability agendas.

In this study, we propose an indicator of critical transitions in multivariate dynamical systems, based on the concept of the dynamical network marker (DNM). The DNM is originally defined based on the eigendecomposition of the Jacobian matrix of a nonlinear system and corresponds to large-magnitude components of the dominant eigenvector, which contributes primarily to transitions. Our DNM-based indicator is derived from the sample covariance matrix of state variables in a target system. Simulation results to predict transitions in complex network systems consisting of a harvesting model consistently show the superiority of our indicator as a precursor of transitions regardless of network structure characteristics, as compared to a conventional indicator.

AB Sicyos angulatus may become an extremely dangerous invasive plant depending on its ability to naturalize and outcompete other species. To further understand the adaptive strategies of structures that could enhance its competitiveness, field surveys and experimental studies were conducted in plant communities where invasion may occur. The results showed that multistage branches of tendrils ensured that the plants could climb higher to strive for better photosynthetic opportunities. The single fleshy fruit of the infructescence was carpeted with slender white spines on which dense barbs were arranged, which could defend fruits against herbivores and contributed to long-distance dispersal. There would be beaklike lignified thorn forming to continue spreading when most of the barbed spines fell off during the fruit season. Rootstock was found in this herbaceous vine, which could accumulate various storage substances during development and helped the plants spread in harsh conditions. Moreover, the discovery of ants as new pollinators enriched the pollination system of S. angulatus, which greatly enhanced pollination efficiency. Above all, we conclude that this species has diverse adaptive strategies and a strong invasive capacity. It is urgent to find some way to slow or even stop its invasion effectively.

AB Community composition of freshwater prokaryotes and protists varies through time. Few studies contemporarily investigate temporal variation of these freshwater communities for more than 1 year. We compared the temporal patterns of prokaryotes and protists in three distinct habitats for 4 years (2014-2017) in Lake Tovel, a cold-water lake. This lake showed a marked temperature increase in 2017 linked to altered precipitation patterns. We investigated whether microbial communities reflected this change across habitats and whether changes occurred at the same time and to the same extent. Furthermore, we tested the concept of hydrological year emphasizing the ecological effect of water renewal on communities for its explanatory power of community changes. Microbe diversity was assessed by Illumina sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene and 18S rRNA gene, and we applied co-inertia analysis and asymmetric eigenvector maps modelling to infer synchrony and temporal patterns of prokaryotes and protists. When considering community composition, microbes were invariable in synchrony across habitats and indicated a temporal gradient linked to decreasing precipitation; however, when looking at temporal patterns, the extent of synchrony was reduced. Small-scale patterns were similar across habitats and microbes and linked to seasonally varying environmental variables, while large-scale patterns were different and partially linked to an ecosystem change as indicated by increasing water transparency and temperature and decreasing dissolved oxygen. Our advanced statistical approach outlined the multifaceted aspect of synchrony when linked to community composition and temporal patterns.

TI Hopf bifurcation in a grazing system with two delays

DT Article
DE Pastoralism; Browsers; Grazers; Hopf bifurcation; Multistability
ID MODEL; COMPETITION; STABILITY
AB Life in the Sahelian zone is very difficult due to lack of resources on a permanent basis. This scarcity of resources leads the pastor, with their flock to organize themselves to better resist the difficult conditions. Pastoralism is of paramount importance for this region. There is an urgent need to understand this way of life in order to help pastors to better organize themselves. In this paper, we propose mathematical models that consist of three food trophic chains. We consider and formalize, in a given location, interactions between browsers, grazers and forage resources. We first analyze the resulting system without delays and in a second time take into account two positive and discrete time-delays. In our model, delays denote an average time required in order that food consumed by browsers and grazers are beneficial for them. Qualitative analysis of the delays-free model shows several equilibria as well as various situations of multistability. Considering delay as parameter, we investigate the effect of delay on the stability of equilibria. It is found that the delays can lead the system dynamic behavior to exhibit stability switches, and Hopf bifurcation occurs when the delay crosses some critical value. By applying the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem, the explicit formula which determines the stability and direction of the bifurcating periodic solutions is determined. Finally based on a nonstandard numerical scheme, we provide some numerical simulations in order to illustrate our qualitative results and support discussions.

AB Predators have both direct, consumptive effects on their prey and non-lethal effects on physiology and behavior, including reproductive decisions, with cascading effects on prey ecology and evolution. Here, we experimentally tested such non-lethal effects of exposure to increased predation risk on clutch size, egg mass, and the concentration of yolk steroid hormones in the yellow-legged gull Larus michahellis. We simulated increased predation risk by displaying stuffed predators (adult fox Vulpes vulpes, and adult buzzard Buteo buteo) to breeding adults before egg laying. The concentration of corticosterone, which has been shown to increase under exposure to maternal predation risk in other species, and of testosterone did not differ between eggs from mothers exposed to the predators and eggs from control mothers (i.e., eggs exposed to a novel object of similar size and position to the stuffed predators). The concentration of the two hormones negatively covaried. Clutch size did not vary according to experimental treatment, whereas egg mass was markedly larger in clutches from nests exposed to predators than in clutches from control nests. By increasing egg mass, mothers may reduce the risk of cooling of the eggs when incubation is impeded by predators, boost energy reserves, reduce post-natal detectability caused by food solicitation, and/or enhance development at hatching, thus increasing the chances of offspring survival. In general, our results are inconsistent with most of the few previous studies on similar non-lethal predator effects and suggest that such effects may vary among species according to ecological conditions, social behavior, and developmental mode.

AB Vermetid reefs and rocky shores are hot spots of biodiversity, often referred to as the subtropical equivalent of coral reefs. The development of the ecosystem depends on the activity of several reef builders, including red crustose coralline algae (CCA) such as Neogoniolithon brassica-florida. Despite its importance, little is known about Neogoniolithon sp. acclimation to rapid changes in light intensity and corresponding photosynthetic activity. To overcome the large spatial variability in the light field (due to location and the porous nature of the rocks) we grew Neogoniolithon sp. on glass slides and characterized its photosynthetic performance in response to various light intensities by following O-2 exchange and fluorescence parameters. This was also performed on rock-inhabiting thalli collected from the east Mediterranean basin. Generally, maximal photosynthetic rate was reached when Neogoniolithon sp. thalli grown under low illumination (such as in protected niches where the light intensity can be as low as 1% of surface illumination) were examined. When exposed to light intensities higher than those experienced during growth, Neogoniolithon sp. activates adaptive/protective mechanisms such as state transition and nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching and increases the dark respiration thereafter. We find that the Fv/Fm parameter (variable/maximal fluorescence) is not suitable to assess photosynthetic performance in Neogoniolithon sp. and propose using instead an alternative parameter recently developed. Our findings help to clarify why Neogoniolithon sp. is usually observed in shaded niches along the reef surfaces.

AB Taking inspiration from the archaeology of the Texas Coastal Plain (TCP), we develop an ecological theory of population distribution among mobile hunter-gatherers. This theory proposes that, due to the heterogeneity of resources in space and time, foragers create networks of habitats that they access through residential cycling and shared knowledge. The degree of cycling that individuals exhibit in creating networks of habitats, encoded through social relationships, depends on the relative scarcity of resources and fluctuations in those resources. Using a dynamic model of hunter-gatherer population distribution, we illustrate that increases in population density, coupled with shocks to a biophysical or social system, creates a selective environment that favors habitat partitioning and investments in social mechanisms that control the residential cycling of foragers on a landscape. Our work adds a layer of realism to Ideal Distribution Models by adding a time allocation decision process in a variable environment and illustrates a general variance reduction, safe-operating space tradeoff among mobile human foragers that drives social change.

AB Tipping points are sudden, and sometimes irreversible and catastrophic, changes in a system's dynamical regime. Complex networks are now widely used in the analysis of time series from a complex system. In this paper, we investigate the scope of network methods to indicate tipping points. In particular, we verify that the permutation entropy of transition networks constructed from time series observations of the logistic map can distinguish periodic and chaotic regimes and indicate bifurcations. The permutation entropy of transition networks, the mean edge between-ness of visibility graphs and the number of code words in compression networks, are each shown to indicate the onset of transition of a pitchfork bifurcation system. Our study shows that network methods are effective in detecting transitions. Network-based forecasts can be applied to models of real systems, as we illustrate by considering a lake eutrophication model.

TI Maximization of fertility transfers from rangeland to cropland: The
   contribution of control theory
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY

ID SUSTAINABILITY; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB In traditional mixed farming systems, soil fertility in cropland relies on the transfer of fertility from rangeland through the transfer of manure produced by livestock that grazes in rangeland. In this work, we introduce a simple meta-ecosystem model in which the mixed farming system is represented by a cropland sub-system connected to a rangeland sub-system by nutrient fluxes. The livestock plays the role of nutrient-pump from the rangeland sub-system to the cropland sub-system. We use this model to study how spatial organization and practices of livestock management such as the control of grazing pressure and night corralling can help optimize both nutrient transfers and crop production.
   We argue that addressing the optimization of crop production requires different methods, depending on whether the agricultural practice in focus is constant or variable over time. We first used classical optimization methods at equilibrium to address optimization when the grazing pressure was assumed to be constant over time. Second, we address optimization for a more realistic configuration of our model, where grazing pressure was assumed to vary over the course of a year. In this case, we used methods developed in the field of the control theory. Classical methods showed the existence of an optimal level of constant grazing pressure that maximizes the transfers from rangeland to cropland, leading to the maximization of crop production. Control methods showed that by varying the grazing pressure adequately an additional gain of production is possible, with higher crop production and lower nutrient transfer from rangeland to cropland. This additional gain arises from the fact that the requirement of nutrient by crops is variable along the year. Consequently, a constant adjustment of the grazing pressure allows a better match between nutrient transfer and nutrient requirement over time, leading to a substantial gain of crop biomass. Our results provide new insights for a "smarter" management of fertility transfers leading to higher crop production with less rangeland surface. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Do high soil temperatures on Namibian fairy circle discs explain the

SO PLOS ONE
LA English

AB Evenly-dispersed enigmatic bare discs known as 'fairy circles' occur within grasslands of the pro-Namib Desert. In spite of their conspicuous appearance, their nature and origin is still debated. The possible inhibitory effects of high surface and sub-surface soil temperatures on grass germination and seedling development on fairy circles have not yet been investigated. We measured maximum, mean daily (24 hour) and mean daytime (sunrise to sunset) temperatures of fairy circles and matrices in the NamibRand Nature Reserve (southwest Namibia). Optimum germination and growing temperatures, and thermal maxima of Stipagrostis ciliata, a grass commonly associated with fairy circle grasslands, were determined experimentally in growth trials. Seeds and seedlings were exposed to temperatures of 35 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 41 degrees C, 44 degrees C and 47 degrees C for 10 days. The optimum growth temperature range of S. ciliata seedlings was determined to be 35 C to 37 degrees C, with depressed growth above 47 degrees C. Seed germination was also depressed at 47 degrees C, and optimal germination occurred between 35 degrees C to 37 degrees C. Circle soils were consistently 2 degrees C cooler than matrix soils at both surface and 15 cm depths, and though the soil surface achieved daily temperatures of 45 degrees C and 47 degrees C for the circle and matrix respectively, mean daily temperatures at 15 cm depth were 36 degrees C and 38 degrees C respectively, coinciding with the optimum germination and growing temperature of S. ciliata. Circle soil temperature is thus unlikely to limit S. ciliata germination and seedling growth and contribute to the maintenance of a bare disc, as both thermal conditions and the presence of higher soil moisture on circles provide a more favourable growing environment than the matrix.

AB Crop models are important tools for assisting farmers and crop consultants to make decisions about fertilisation, irrigation and harvest management, because they allow users to understand productivity from the view of integrated sensitivities of basic plant physiological processes. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the CSM-CROPGRO-Perennial Forage model (PFM) to simulate regrowth of Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. ex A. Rich.) R.D. Webster cv. Marandu under varying irrigation and nitrogen levels. The second objective was to evaluate the water-balance module of the model under soil and climatic conditions in the Cerrado biome of central-eastern Brazil. The experimental data for model evaluation were obtained from a field experiment conducted during 2015, 2016 and 2017, and included herbage production, plant-part composition and plant nitrogen (N) concentration. The results suggest that the model can be used to simulate growth of Marandu palisade grass adequately under different managements of irrigation and N fertilisation. The findings indicate also that the agreement between simulations and field-observed soil moisture shows good performance of the water-balance module of CSM-CROPGRO-PFM. The most important parameterisation required by the model was the determination and calibration of inputs such as the stable soil carbon pool(SOM3) for N mineralisation, which affected the N response, and the soil water-holding characteristics, which affected the irrigation response. The default parameterisation ( species, ecotype, cultivar) of cv. Marandu inCSM-CROPGRO-PFM was sufficient for adequate performance of the model for this new environment and new crop management. However, minor modifications of species parameters were helpful to account for winter-kill of foliage.

AB Critical transitions whereby small changes in conditions can cause large and irreversible changes in ecosystem states are a cause of increasing concern in ecology. Here, we focus on the irreversibility of these transitions, formally known as hysteresis. We explore how simple correlations between parameters in Lotka-Volterra predator-prey equations result in a variety of complicated hysteretic patterns. These patterns include unattainable stable states that once lost may never be recovered. We suspect these patterns to be common in natural systems, where interactions between diverse assemblages are unavoidable. Thus, understanding underlying hysteretic structures may be necessary for rescuing lost ecosystem states and avoiding future losses.

AB There is growing concern about the impact of contemporaneous ocean acidification on marine ecosystems, but strong evidence for predicting the consequences is still scant. We have used the gastropod Trophon geversianus as a study model for exploring the importance of oceanographic variables (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a, oxygen, calcite and pH) on large-scale latitudinal variation in mean shell length and relative shell weight. Data were collected from a survey carried out in 34 sites along similar to 1600 km. Neither shell length nor relative shell weight showed any monotonic latitudinal trend, and the patterns of spatial variability were rather complex. After correcting for spatial autocorrelation, only pH showed a significant correlation with mean shell length and relative shell weight, but contrary to expectations, the association was negative in both cases. We hypothesize that this could mirror the negative effect of acidification on growth rate, which may cause larger asymptotic size. Latitudinal trends of body size variation are not easy to generalize using ecogeographic rules, and may be the result of a complex interaction of environmental drivers and life-history responses.

AB Natural products or their derivatives provide a reliable resource for new drugs. The multi-step chemical reaction to produce new drug is not only expensive but also release pollutants. The precursor-based combinatorial biosynthesis (PCB) is, however, a better option to produce novel natural products with potential pharmaceutical applications. The present work is an attempt to synthesize an antibacterial compound by transforming thiophene precursor using endolithic Streptomyces sp. AL51. The Streptomyces sp. AL51 was isolated from a granite rock sample collected from Mylliem, Meghalaya, India. The isolate was identified as Streptomyces sp. based on its cultural, morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics. The bioactive compound CAx1 was extracted from the fermentation broth. The compound was characterized by bioactivity-guided fractionation and identified by infrared, UV-visible, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry data and identified as 7-[1-(thiophene-5-yl)-1-formamido]-3-propylenyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid with molecular formula C15H14N2O4S2. The purified compound showed considerable in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria showing its broad spectrum property. The obtained results provide promising baseline information for the potential use of endolithic actinobacterium for semisynthetic drug discovery. This is the first report on PCB of broad range antibacterial compound by endolithic Streptomyces strain.

AB Reintroduction programs have been pivotal in augmenting populations of fishers (Pekania pennanti (Erxleben, 1777)) and re-establishing them to their former range in North America. The majority of reintroduction efforts in fishers have been considered demographically successful, but reintroductions can alter genetic population structure and success has rarely been evaluated in fishers from a genetic standpoint. We used microsatellite data (n = 169) to examine genetic population structure of fishers in the Great Lakes region and comment on the success of past reintroductions at two different spatial scales. We found significant genetic population structure among source and reintroduced populations within the Great Lakes region and large-scale genetic structure between fisher populations located in two geographically distant regions (Great Lakes and Northeast) in the eastern United States. Reintroductions associated with the Great Lakes produced results that were largely consistent with other studies of fisher reintroductions in the Northeast. However, our data are the first to support a measurable impact on genetic population structure in Pekania pennanti pennanti (Erxleben, 1777) from a reintroduction using geographically distant source and reintroduced populations. When feasible, we strongly recommend that reintroduction programs include an investigation of the underlying genetic structure to better define intended goals and supplement measures of demographic success.

AB The study of how animals respond to risk has had a strong influence on our understanding of animal behaviour. By risk, we refer to a situation where organisms must exploit a resource with an unstable quality. Animals may have different risk preferences: they may be risk seeking (e.g. prefer a gamble of 2 or 4 versus a safe bet of 3), risk averse or risk insensitive. Among invertebrates, bees are the most studied group in terms of risk preference. However, in eusocial insects such as bees and ants, the unit of selection is the colony. Thus, the risk preference of eusocial animals is best understood at the level of the group. More broadly, many group-living animals must make consensus decisions between options with varying risk. However, to our knowledge no study has yet set out to examine risk preference during collective decision making by groups. This study aimed to address this gap. Colonies of the ant Lasius niger were given access to two feeders, one offering a fixed 0.55 M sucrose solution and the other alternating every 3 min between 0.1 M and 1.0 M. Colonies almost always (26/28 trials) made a collective decision. While there was a small tendency for the variable feeder to be chosen if it initially offered 1 M sucrose, broadly speaking the fixed or variable feeders were equally likely to be chosen. Ant colonies thus showed risk neutrality during collective foraging decisions. Unexpectedly, and contrary to the classical understanding of pheromone-based collective decision making, the choice of feeder was only very weakly influenced by the initial quality of the variable feeder. We propose that risk preference during collective decision making by groups is a woefully understudied topic, and worthy of future work in both recruitment-based and nonrecruiting decision-making systems.

AB Body size is a key determinant of fitness in Daphnia. Bigger size means higher feeding efficiency and reproduction. However, filamentous cyanobacteria have a more detrimental effect on larger daphnids. Predicted global warming is expected to reduce size of Daphnia and facilitate frequent occurrence of cyanobacteria. Therefore, we asked two questions: (i) does elevated temperature cause reduced size of daphnids, and (ii) is temperature-dependent size reduction adaptive in an environment dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria? To address these issues, we obtained 8 clones of the Daphnia longispina complex from artificially heated lakes and 8 clones from control lakes, and exposed them to a favorable food Scenedesmus obliquus and a mixture of S. obliquus and the filamentous cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in life table experiments at 16, 20, and 24A degrees C. Individuals from heated lakes attained larger body size than those from control lakes. Moreover, exposure to the filamentous cyanobacterium led to reduced fecundity of Daphnia from the non-heated lakes and did not affect reproduction of Daphnia from the heated lakes. We conclude that Daphnia display some evolutionary adaptations to cope with filamentous cyanobacteria, linked to long-term exposition to elevated temperature. Our results violate broadly accepted assumptions that ectotherms are smaller in warmer environments.

AB Debris flow fans are non-equilibrium landforms resulting from the spatial variations of debris flows deposited on them. This geomorphic disturbance involving the asymmetric redistribution of water and sediment may create spatially heterogeneous patterns of soil-vegetation along landforms. In this research, founded on field-based observations, we characterized the spatial patterns of some soil (e.g., particle size distribution including fine and coarse covers, and infiltration capacity) and vegetation (e.g., plant distance, vegetation density, patch size, and average number of patches) properties within different debris flow fan positions (Upper, Middle, and Lower fan) located at the base of the Binaloud Mountain hillslope in northeastern Iran. Thereafter, using a mathematical model of dry land vegetation dynamics, we calculated response trends of the different positions to the same environmental harshness gradient. Field measurements of soil-vegetation properties and infiltration rates showed that the asymmetric redistribution of debris flow depositions can cause statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) in the spatial patterns of soil and eco-hydrological characteristics along different landform positions. The results showed that mean plant distance, mean vegetation density, and the average number of patches decreased as the coarse covers increased toward the Lower fan plots. Conversely, an increase in infiltration rate was observed. The simulation results on the aerial images taken from different positions, illustrated that positions with a heterogeneous distribution of vegetation patterns were not desertified to the same degree of aridity. Thus, the Middle and Lower positions could survive under harsher aridity conditions, due to the emergence of more varied spatial vegetation patterns than at the Upper fan position. The findings, based on a combined field and modeling approach, highlighted that debris flow as a geomorphic process with the asymmetric distribution of depositions on the gentle slope of an alluvial fan, can incur multiple resilience thresholds with different degrees of self-organization under stressful conditions over the spatial heterogeneities of soil-dependent vegetation structures.

AB The proportion of mimics and models is a key parameter in mimetic systems. In monoecious plants with self-mimicry pollination systems, the mimic-model ratio is determined by the floral sex ratio. While an equal sex ratio (1:1) could provide the perfect balance between pollen donors and stigma surfaces able to receive the pollen, an unequal ratio could increase pollination by production of a greater number of rewarding, model flowers. The aim of the present study is to test the differences in visitation frequency and reproductive rates of different mimic and model flower arrays in order to assess the efficacy of the mimetic system in a Begonia cucullata population. The frequencies of visitors to groups of flowers with three distinctive sex ratio arrays (male-biased, female-biased and equal ratio) were compared using a Bayesian approach. The reproductive outcomes were compared in order to detect advantages of particular sex ratios. Low visitation frequency was recorded in all arrays. Pollinators showed similar behaviour regardless of sex ratio; they tended to avoid female, rewardless flowers. Pollination quality was highest in the equal sex ratio array. The current study shows that sex ratio plays a critical role in the pollination of B. cucullata and that the efficacy of the self-mimicry system appears to be doubtful. Visitation frequency may be associated with visual or chemical cues that allow pollinators to recognize models and mimics, regardless of their frequency in the population.

AB Advertisement calls tend to differ among populations, based on morphological and environmental factors, or simply geographic distance, in many taxa. Invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) were introduced to Australia in 1935 and their distribution has expanded at increasing rates over time. Rapid evolution occurred in morphological and behavioural characters that accelerate dispersal, but the effects of rapid expansion on sexual signals have not been examined. We collected advertisement calls from four populations of different ages since invasion, and analysed the geographic differentiation of seven call parameters. Our comparisons indicate that the calls of R. marina differ among Australian populations. The signal variation was not simply clinal with respect to population age, climate, or morphological differentiation. We suggest that selection on signalling among populations has been idiosyncratic and may reflect local female preferences or adaptation to environmental factors that are not clinal such as energy availability.

AB Forests can affect environmental conditions in ways that enhance their survival. This effect may contribute to a positive feedback whereby deforestation could degrade environmental conditions and inhibit forest reestablishment. Sudden changes in forest functioning can be attributed to the existence of multiple stable states with one high and one low vegetation state. Multiple factors govern whether a transition between states will occur following deforestation. One such factor is strategic behavior and whether communities or stakeholders with an interest in the forest cooperate to maintain the forest in the fully vegetated state by reducing extraction levels or choose their own extraction rates without considering the collective effect of this behavior. We examine how the effect of a positive feedback and strategic behavior affect the optimal quantity of vegetation, V*. A clear hysteresis exists for logged forests exhibiting a positive feedback whereby an increase in extraction rates leads to a shift to the low vegetation state. An increase in the ecological value of the forest increases V* whereas the opposite is true for an increase in the value of timber. V* is also higher under cooperative conditions than noncooperative conditions. Notably, accounting for the effect of a positive feedback substantially increases V*. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Averages of external and cranial measurements were correlated with latitudes in Apodemus peninsulae, A. draco, and A. latronum in East Asia and Siberia. A total of 852 sexually mature specimens of 24-44 local populations were grouped into 5-11 regions by countries, provinces of China, running directions of big rivers in south-western China and Myanmar, or islands. In A. peninsulae, significant positive correlations were demonstrated in the lengths of condylobasal (CBL), anterior part of the skull, diastema, head and body (HBL), and hind foot (HFL) in all regions except for Siberia, Sakhalin, and Hokkaido, whereas a negative one was in HBL in Siberia, indicating two clines with the largest at around 50 degrees N in Heilongjiang, China. In A. draco, two significant negative correlations were shown in CBL, the lengths of anterior and posterior part of the skull, total molar, and tail by dividing into higher and lower localities than 29 degrees N except for Hebei. In A. latronum, significant positive correlations were exhibited in CBL and HFL in all regions. Adaptive meanings of the latitudinal clinal variations disclosed in A. peninsulae and A. draco were discussed on plant productivity, character displacement, and increasing of the anterior part of the skull.

AB Particle number concentrations and size distribution of atmospheric aerosol particles were measured in the range 6-560 nm by a fast mobility particle sizer in Toledo, Spain, and in the outskirts of nearby small villages within the area of influence of a cement factory, quarries and ceramic industries. Several measurement campaigns have been carried out in different days in Toledo (April, May and July) and one campaign in "Comarca de la Sagra" in July. In each campaign, measurement of 10-15 min has been achieved in several different points. In addition, a campaign of continuous measurements has been carried out in Toledo. The average number concentration in Toledo are consistent with other urban measurements, with lower values during the night-time ranging from 3x10(3) to 1x10(4) particles/cm(3) and higher average levels during daytime ranging from 5x10(3) to 4x10(4) particles/cm(3) depending on the measurement site and date. The measurement sites show similar background profiles of the particle size distributions with two clear particle modes centered in the sizes ranges 10-15 and 40-50 nm. Road traffic is postulated as the main source of submicron particles, giving lower level of particles during the summer time. Results from continuous measurements have been analyzed. On the other hand, the low total concentrations obtained in the "Comarca de la Sagra" campaign, ranging from 1.5x10(3) to 3.1x10(3) particles/cm(3) with an average value of 2.3x10(3) particles/cm(3), show a negligible influence of the different building materials industries on the total submicron particle concentration in the surrounding area and in Toledo.

AB The correlations between perennials and the herbaceous productivity in patches occupied by them were previously studied and several descriptive models were defined. Yet these studies focused on either single or several species without analyzing higher numbers and ranking their effects. Here we describe a handy analytical methodology which allows separating the effects of each perennial species on herbaceous productivity at its respective patches from those of the others in a given area, even in case of complex patches containing several species. The described methodology also allows analysts to correlate the effect of perennials to their patch sizes and the respective herbaceous biomass. Additional mathematical analysis presented here succeeded in differentiating between the perennial species stand-alone presence effect on the herbaceous productivity and that attributed to the canopy size. In addition, the effects of location along the slope and its rockiness outlines were studied. As a case study, we chose representative sloped shrubland with rockiness outlines, located in Yattir farm, Northern Negev, Israel. Based on the described analyses we found that the species with the highest positive effects on the herbaceous productivity were Echinops polyceras, Echium angustifolium, and Salvia lanigera. Contradictory effects were observed in case of Thymelea hirsute, Anchusa ramosus, and Noaea mucronata. Collectively, the presented methodology could be an important management tool for monitoring the herbaceous biomass amounts in a given shrubland.

AB Higher tiers of ecological risk assessment (ERA) consider population and community-level endpoints. At the population level, the phenomenon of density dependence is one of the most important ecological processes that influence population dynamics. In this study, we investigated how different mechanisms of density dependence would influence population-level ERA of the cyclopoid copepod Mesocyclops leuckarti under toxicant exposure. We used a combined approach of laboratory experiments and individual-based modelling. An individual-based model was developed for M. leuckarti to simulate population dynamics under triphenyltin exposure based on individual-level ecological and toxicological data from laboratory experiments. The study primarily aimed to-(1) determine which life-cycle processes, based on feeding strategies, are most significant in determining density dependence (2) explore how these mechanisms of density dependence affect extrapolation from individual-level effects to the population level under toxicant exposure. Model simulations showed that cannibalism of nauplii that were already stressed by TPT exposure contributed to synergistic effects of biotic and abiotic factors and led to a twofold stress being exerted on the nauplii, thereby resulting in a higher population vulnerability compared to the scenario without cannibalism. Our results suggest that in population-level risk assessment, it is easy to underestimate toxicity unless underlying ecological interactions including mechanisms of population-level density regulation are considered. This study is an example of how a combined approach of experiments and mechanistic modelling can lead to a thorough understanding of ecological processes in ecotoxicology and enable a more realistic ERA.

AB The effects of the foreseen change in precipitation and temperature on dynamic grazing systems that are managed under the hypothesis of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) are assessed. The standard Gordon Schaefer approach that relates the rate of above-ground vegetation production to biomass consumption by herbivores is adopted to simulate the grazing system. In order to account for future climate variability, the model is modified using principles from water balance hydrology, thus introducing vegetation growth limitations due to climatic aridity. The model is applied for an equilibrium established under the much criticized MSY hypothesis that assumes the optimum herbivore density for maximum biomass removal. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that as climate changes towards a warmer and drier future, the probability of a low ecological stability grazing system to collapse increases, especially in arid environments where water is a limited resource. Such sudden shifts that lead to undesirable stable states of arid ecosystems are investigated by the CASCADE EU project.

AB Global mean temperatures have increased by 0.3-0.6 degrees C since the late 19th century, affecting the physiology, distributions, phenology and adaptations of plants and animals. In the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, average annual temperatures increased by an average of 0.25 degrees C per decade from the 1970s to the 1990s, and by an average of 0.34 degrees C per decade thereafter. Using museum collections from the 1950s to the 2000s and published references, we tested the hypothesis that body size of the toad-headed lizard Phrynocephalus ylangalii in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau declined between 1954 and 2008 as a response to global warming. However; body size of males and females did not vary significantly between 1954 and 2008, probably due to the reciprocity between higher food availability and earlier age at sexual maturity. We suggest that human activity might result in declining population sizes in the future despite the lack of an apparent current response to changing climates.

AB Alternative stable states have long been thought to exist in natural communities, but direct evidence for their presence and for the environmental switches that cause them has been scarce. Using a combination of greenhouse and field experiments, we investigated the environmental drivers associated with two distinctive herbaceous communities in coastal ecosystems in New Zealand. In a mosaic unrelated to micro-topography, a community dominated largely by native turf species (notably Leptinella dioica, Samolus repens, and Selliera radicans) alternates with vegetation comprising exotic (i.e., nonnative) pasture species (notably Agrostis stolonifera, Holcus lanatus, Lolium perenne, and Trifolium repens). The species of these two communities differ in functional characters related to leaf longevity and growth rate, and occupy soils of differing nitrogen levels. Both spatial and environmental factors influenced the species composition locally. Reciprocal transplants of soil, with and without associated vegetation, showed that a native turf community developed when sward or soil from either community was bounded by turf, and a pasture community developed when sward or soil from either community was surrounded by pasture. In artificial mixed communities in the greenhouse, turf was able to invade the pasture community where the vegetation was clipped to simulate grazing, and also where Trifolium was removed and/or salt spray was applied. The pasture community invaded the turf where Trifolium was present or nitrogen was added. These results were supported by trends in experimentally manipulated field plots, where the amount of turf cover increased when nitrogen was kept low and when salt spray was applied, whereas pasture cover increased in the absence of salt spray. Thus, persistence of the native turf community is dependent on grazing, both directly and via its effect on keeping nitrogen levels low by excluding the exotic, nitrogen-fixing Trifolium, and by exposing the vegetation to salt spray. If any of these factors change, there could be a state change to pasture dominance that might be resistant to reversion to turf. Managing such coastal herbaceous communities therefore requires an understanding of the environmental and species characteristics that maintain alternative states.

AB The protecting requirements and functional connectivity of species in isolated habitat patches are crucial factors of eco-network planning. This study aimed to improve the method of eco-network planning for species conservation. Ecoprofiling was used to group the species by similar behavior types, namely, choice of ecosystem, area requirement, and short distance dispersal abilities. A least-cost model was used to simulate the optimal corridor location to maintain functional connectivity. A combination of ecoprofile and least-cost model was hired to develop an eco-network that promoted species conservation. A case study was also conducted in Beijing, China. In addition to the required ecosystem, habitat area is an important parameter for habitat extraction. Habitat area can remove noise habitat patches because of lacking area. Short-distance dispersal can be used to identify corridor requirements and avoid unnecessary building requirements. Species with various dispersal abilities exhibit significant differences in terms of corridor length and location requirement. Habitat isolation is the main threat for weakly mobile species, and habitat loss is the major risk of mobile species protection. Different species groups also exhibit distinct landscape pattern demands for an eco-network, and the eco-network planning based on specific species can not protect other species. We proposed that a combination of ecoprofile and least-cost model improved the efficiency of species conservation by eco-network planning.

AB Translocation of captive-reared animals is widely used as a tool for endangered species recovery. Frequently, translocated populations have relatively low initial productivity, requiring management intervention. A translocated population of whooping cranes Grus americana in central Wisconsin is such a case. We examined chick mortality for this population and used daily chick survival rates as our response variable to model several parameters including phenology, chick age, energetics and parent age and experience. We also developed and evaluated adoption techniques using sandhill cranes Grus canadensis to mitigate the effects of high chick mortality and increase the probability of fledging. Our results illustrate the challenges that translocated populations can face as they encounter novel breeding conditions. We found that whooping crane daily chick survival was relatively low and most mortality events occurred within the first 20 days. Our results indicated that variables related to age of the parents as well as the pair's previous chick rearing experience were useful for predicting daily chick survival. We found that sandhill crane foster parents readily accepted replacement chicks. We also demonstrated adopted chicks acceptance of foster parents and that the chicks' source (captive-born vs wild-born) did not affect success of the adoption. Chick adoption provides several management options that could be used to bypass the period when chicks experience the greatest mortality. Reducing chick mortality and developing techniques to increase the number of fledged chicks is paramount for whooping crane recovery as well as the recovery of other endangered bird species.

AB Patterns of geographical variation in morphology provide an empirical framework for testing the effects of ecological and historical factors on species differentiation. Environmental gradients play an important role in intraspecific differentiation through morphological adaptation in locations with distinct selective pressures. Vanzosaura rubricauda is a small microteiid lizard that is widespread in the great diagonal of dry biomes of South America, occurring in Cerrado, Caatinga, and Chaco open habitats with contrasting environmental conditions. Using multivariate morphometrics and spatial analysis, we show that V. rubricauda presents a structured pattern of geographic variation, with populations of the eastern Cerrado being distinct in morphometry. Geographical variation was observed in size and shape, with a general trend of contrast between trunk length and forelimb length among populations. Ecogeographical models that best explained geographic patterns of variation were aridity and precipitation.

AB Identifying differences in mortality rates in wild fish populations can provide insight into ecological and evolutionary variation within species, including differences between sexes. In this study, we examined natural mortality patterns among four populations of a viviparous freshwater fish (Poeciliopsis baenschi) from western Mexico that shows sexual size dimorphism. Our purpose was to test for differences in mortality rates among populations and to determine if these differences are sex- or size-dependent. We fit mark-recapture data to several competing models to test for differences in mortality rates among collection localities and between sexes, as well as to evaluate a potential relationship between size and mortality. The best-fitting model included an interaction between size and source population without a sex effect, indicating a strong relationship between size and mortality that differed among populations. In three populations, adult individuals of medium sizes experienced increased mortality rates compared to smaller or larger adults. In one of these three populations, this pattern was more pronounced with medium-sized individuals suffering strikingly higher mortality. In the remaining population, we found the opposite pattern: adult individuals of medium sizes experienced lower mortality rates compared to smaller or larger adults. In all cases, these effects were independent of sex. We consider explanations for this pattern based on ecological factors, such as differences in predation intensity, and discuss our results in the context of intraspecific phenotypic divergence. Our findings demonstrate the value of comparing mortality rates among populations within a fish species.

ID VIDEOGRAPHY; RETENTION; WETLANDS
AB Lake Kinneret is a major water source for the State of Israel, hence it is managed and preserved by the Israel Water Authority. Mapping the new vegetation growth along the exposed shores of Lake Kinneret during periods of retreating lake water levels is of great importance in the management of the lake and its water quality. When the lake level rises this vegetation is covered by water, decays, and releases nutrients into the lake, possibly enhancing algal blooms. In December, 2001, when the lake level was -214.72 m, a rapid and cost-effective vegetation mapping was done along the retreating shoreline using a GeoSky (TM) system that integrates oblique airborne video synchronized with Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) and an electronic compass, and displays them within a Geographic Information System (GIS). Six major vegetation classes with twelve subclasses were interpreted from the video along the newly exposed shoreline between -209 m (highest lake level) and -214.72 m, their borders mapped, and a total vegetation area of 73.6 km(2) was calculated. Dominant plant species, their features and structure were described. The coverage area of each vegetation class was mapped using the ArcView 3X (from ESRI) GIS tools within GeoSky (TM), finding Phragmites australis, Tamarix sp., and Cyperus spp. as representatives of the major vegetation classes. The biomass of each major class was then calculated from the coverage area according to dry matter concentration of 2.5, 1.5, 1, and 0.5 kg/m(2) of Phragmites, Tamarix, Cyperus, and other, respectively. Total phosphorus (P) and total nitrogen (N) were calculated utilizing concentrations of 0.2% of total P and 1.2% of total N in the dry biomass of vegetation. Maximum cumulative inventories were evaluated to 23,500 kg of phosphorus and 141,000 kg of nitrogen. It was then recommended to the Water Authority of Israel to leave the shoreline vegetation untouched instead of cleaning it with a mower.

AB The objective of this study was to estimate the contribution of a facility that processes steel production slag into raw material for cement production to local outdoor particle deposition in Camden, NJ. A dry deposition sampler that can house four 37-mm quartz fiber filters was developed and used for the collection of atmospheric particle deposits. Two rounds of particle collection (3-4 weeks each) were conducted in 8-11 locations 200-800 m downwind of the facility. Background samples were concurrently collected in a remote area located similar to 2 km upwind from the facility. In addition, duplicate surface wipe samples were collected side-by-side from each of the 13 locations within the same sampling area during the first deposition sampling period. One composite source material sample was also collected from a pile stored in the facility. Both the bulk of the source material and the <38 mu m fraction subsample were analyzed to obtain the elemental source profile. The particle deposition flux in the study area was higher (24-83 mg/m(2.)day) than at the background sites (13-17 mg/m(2).day). The concentration of Ca, a major element in the cement source production material, was found to exponentially decrease with increasing downwind distance from the facility (P < 0.05). The ratio of Ca/Al, an indicator of Ca enrichment due to anthropogenic sources in a given sample, showed a similar trend. These observations suggest a significant contribution of the facility to the local particle deposition. The contribution of the facility to outdoor deposited particle mass was further estimated by three independent models using the measurements obtained from this study. The estimated contributions to particle deposition in the study area were 1.8-7.4% from the regression analysis of the Ca concentration in particle deposition samples against the distance from the facility, 0-11% from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) source-receptor model, and 7.6-13% from the EPA Industrial Source Complex Short Term (ISCST3) dispersion model using the particle-size-adjusted permit-based emissions estimates.

AB Arid mangroves constitute a particular biotope, with very extreme variations in ecological conditions, mainly temperature and salinity, condition that demand specific adaptations to successfully inhabit this ecosystem. Cyanoprokaryotes have not been well studied in Mexican coasts and this is the first study that contributes to the knowledge of the biodiversity of this group in an arid mangrove in Zacatecas estuary, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Samples of Avicennia germinans pneumatophores from Zacatecas estuary were collected between May 2005 and May 2006. The identification of the most representative Chroococcales produced 10 morphotypes, described morphologically and digitally registered for the first time for Mexico. We report species of Aphanocapsa, Chroococcies, Hydrococcus, Chamaecalyx, Dermocarpella and Xenococcus. Some taxa have been recorded in brackish or even marine environments from other regions, evidencing the wide geographical distribution and ecological adaptability of these organisms, but some others are probably new to science. Some species have a specific seasonal and vertical distribution on the pneumatophore but other have a more ample distribution. Aphanocapsa littoralis and Chroococcus cf. obliteratus are new records for benthic biotopes of Pacific Mexico; Dermocarpella cf. stellata is a new record for the Gulf of California.

AB Temperature change may affect physiology, distribution, morphology and adaptation of animals. Using individuals captured in Nanchong and Laojunshan Nature Reserve of Sichuan province in western China, we tested head-body length variation in the mole-shrew (Anourosorex squamipes) in relation to annual temperature and elevation. Our results indicate that head-body length of both males and females decreases with decreasing ambient temperature along an altitudinal gradient. Likewise, there is significant monthly variation in head-body length, with individuals in warmer months being larger than that colder ones. The seasonal variation in head-body length suggests the higher predator risk and lower food availability in cold months.

AB We investigate the existence and persistence of a temporal and a spatial gradient in molar size of the house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, from France, Europe and northern Africa. Specimens include both modern samples extending from the beginning of last century to extant populations as well as archeological material. Several patterns in size variation were evidenced: i) there is a size gradient in molar teeth decreasing from North to South in modern mice, ii) a similar North-South gradient is present in archeological material indicating that it has existed at least since Gallo-Roman times, and iii) there is a decrease in size between the Gallo-Roman samples and modern ones. The geographical gradient was not gradual, but was characterized by a step cline on both sides of the 45(th) parallel, that is between the Mediterranean zone and the western European Continent. Within each of these compartments, no latitudinal variation from North to South was observed. The decrease in size of the house mouse since the Gallo-Roman period, or likely since the end of the Middle-Ages, could be due to landscape clearance and expansion of cereal-like cultivations. The commensal way of life, associated with an increase in population density, may have also had an effect. (C) 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier Gmbh.

AB This paper summarizes the status of and Opportunities for transboundary conservation areas (TBCAs) in the Arabian Peninsula. Although there has been limited development of TBCAs in the Peninsula, the concept is seen regionally as valuable to: encourage collaboration and cooperation between conservation partners; provide a shared vision; enable joint and effective ecosystem management in a larger system; encourage social, economic and ecological partnerships; facilitate the development of a sustainable sub-regional economic base; and increase international cooperation at multiple inter-government levels. Three potential sites have been identified, each focused around a charismatic species for the region: The conservation of dugongs in the marine environment from the Gulf of Bahrain to the United Arab Emirates (UAE); the conservation of Endangered Arabian Oryx Oryx leucoryx in the UAE-Saudi Arabia-Oman border area; and the conservation of Critically Endangered Arabian Leopard Panthera pardus nimr in the Yemen-Oman terrestrial borders. There has been a call for a champion, such as the Sharjah government, to drive the process at the inter-government level, with representatives of relevant conservation authorities facilitating activities at the local level.

ID MARGINAL VALUE THEOREM; LIONS
AB Based on data collected over 24 years in the Serengeti in Tanzania, Sinclair and Arcese (1995) indicated that the sensitivity of blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus to predation risk by lions Panthera leo may cause them to change habitats between open (low risk) and wooded (risky) habitats. They found that, in poor rainfall years, predators kill wildebeest that are in better condition than those that die of natural causes. In good rainfall years, predators kill wildebeest that are in worse condition than those that die of natural causes. Sinclair and Arcese (1995) proposed the "predation-sensitive food" hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that, as food becomes limiting, animals take greater risks to obtain more food, and some of these animals are killed. I propose a more parsimonious hypothesis based on the marginal value theorem that is consistent with the observations made by Sinclair and Arcese (1995). Wildebeest follow a single decision rule in good and poor rainfall years, viz, move when foraging elsewhere increases your rate of intake of nutritious food. Similarly, predators follow a single decision rule in good and poor rainfall years, viz, take the prey item that maximizes the intake of energy per unit effort expended. This parsimonious model does not require differences in predator sensitivity as required by Sinclair and Arcese's (1995) model. I indicate ways in which my model can be falsified.

AB We implicate ecological processes in assembly patterns of Egyptian desert rodents using spatial variation of distribution and composition of local assemblages. We also compare our assemblages to prior analyses of North American and Australian small mammal communities in terms of species richness and representation of trophic groups.
   We studied patterns of occurrence of 29 rodent species among 335 collecting events in 308 sites using museum specimen records resulting from a country-wide survey. The studied taxa vary greatly in their natural histories and ecology. Fully 69% of studied species (20) were localized in 30 or fewer sites (9% of all sites). Site incidence was closely correlated with the geographic range size of species, while local abundance of a species showed little relationship to its geographic range. The species richness of local assemblages ranged from a lone species at 73 sites to 11 species at 3 sites. A total of 214 different combinations were recorded of which 164(77%) were unique to a single site. G. gerbillus was both the most abundant and most ubiquitous species. Coexistence with other species was positively correlated with incidence and geographic range size. Body mass distribution was remarkably uniform for the fauna as a whole, and influenced the geographic distributions and abundance of individual species.
   Our sites have low species richness and substantial variability in species composition, which also characterize desert rodent communities elsewhere. Habitat requirements, exclusive distributions of sibling species, low primary productivity, and Egypt's location all influenced species assembly. The Egyptian and Australian deserts supported higher proportions of low richness assemblages compared to North America. As in North America, Egyptian sites were dominated by granivorous species.

AB Question: A number of studies have demonstrated that the interaction between nurse plants and their proteges changes from one of facilitation to interference as life history stage progresses. Here, I aimed to assess relative fitness of the protege plant ZiZiphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) under the subcanopy of Acacia erioloba (Leguminaceae), versus in the open, at various stages of the lifecycle.
   Location: Southern Kalahari, southern Africa.
   Methods: Germination was compared to assess the effects of shade, maternal origin (under A. erioloba or in the matrix) and soil. Seedlings were transplanted into the field under trees and in the open to ascertain establishment rates. Flower production, seed set and mistletoe infestation were compared between the two microhabitats.
   Results: Seeds from maternal Z. mucronata plants growing beneath A. erioloba had higher germination rates than those from maternal plants growing in the open. Germination was higher in full Sun and in matrix soil, although this result was found in experimental conditions mimicking good rainfall and may not hold Under dry or medium rainfall conditions. Z. mucronata demography suggested that the A. erioloba subcanopy is important for establishment, but seedlings transplanted into the matrix had higher survival rates than those under trees. Causes of seedling mortality were different: desiccation in the matrix, but invertebrate herbivory and trampling beneath trees. Mistletoe infestation was higher for adult plants growing in the open. Seed set was not significantly different between subcanopy and matrix environments, but once mistletoe infestation rates and parent plant size were accounted for, seed set was lower for adult plants growing in the open than those growing beneath trees.
   Conclusions: It appears that the nurse tree environment remains important for Z. mucronata throughout its lifecycle.

ID ALTERNATIVE STABLE STATES; INTRAGUILD PREDATION; PLANT-COMMUNITIES;
   PREY; EQUILIBRIA; DIVERGENCE; STABILITY
AB Previous studies of communities implicate many potential mechanisms that can create alternate stable states. These include density-dependent foraging behavior, size refuges reached by early colonists, environmental feedback following disturbance, and different initial densities of intraguild predators. Previous work shows that alternate states of varying stability can occur in food webs containing the intraguild predators Blepharisma americanum and Tetrahymena vorax. Differences in colonization history could create the alternate states, consisting of dominance by either Blepharisma or Tetrahymena, but it was unclear whether results depended on effects of initial density or only on changes in the resource base. We manipulated initial densities of both species to determine if density effects alone could create alternate stable states. Convergence of these communities over time indicated that differences in initial density did not create alternate stable states. By default, other factors influenced by colonization history, such as resource availability, may produce alternate states. Models of alternate stable-state phenomena should incorporate differences in resource availability in addition to direct competitive and predatory interactions to provide a more complete depiction of the causes of differences in community composition in otherwise similar habitats.

AB Trade-offs between locomotor performance and load-carrying in animals are well-established and often result from requisite life processes including reproduction and feeding. Osmoregulation, another necessary process, may involve storage of fluid in the urinary bladder of some species. The purpose of this study was to determine whether storage of urine in the urinary bladder reduces walking endurance in an actively foraging lizard. The results of our paired-design study indicate that the volume of fluid stored in the urinary bladder (36.5 +/- 1.6 ml) contributed a significant load (9.2% of body mass) to the lizards. This load resulted in a disproportionate 24.5 +/- 2.8% decrement in walking endurance. Specifically, Gila monsters walked at a fixed pace for a significantly shorter duration when the urinary bladder contained fluid (26 +/- 2.0 min) compared to when the bladder was empty (34.3 +/- 2.3 min). Since fluid stored in the bladder contributes to osmoregulation in this species, our results indicate the presence of a trade-off between osmoregulation and endurance in Gila monsters. Bearing other loads (e.g., a clutch or meal) influences the evolution of life-history traits and foraging strategy; thus the negative effect of fluid storage on endurance may also have evolutionary implications.

AB To examine the function of morphologically hermaphroditic, but functionally sterile, florets in female inflorescences of Petasites japonicus (Sieb. & Zucc.) Maxim., we conducted experiments in which all those florets were removed from female inflorescences. We hypothesize that those florets enhance female reproductive success by deceit, because they resemble the morphologically hermaphroditic, but functionally male florets, in male inflorescences. We found that the mean number of pollinator visits per inflorescence did not differ between the intact inflorescences and inflorescences in which such hermaphrodite florets had been removed. However, the mean duration of stay per visit to an inflorescence tended to be shorter in those with removed florets than in the intact inflorescences. The achene / female floret ratio was smaller in the inflorescences with removed florets than in the intact ones. We hence concluded that the hermaphrodite florets in female inflorescences enhance female reproductive success through prolonged duration of pollinator stay.

AB In a plant-herbivore system, a management strategy called threshold policy is proposed to control grazing intensity where the vegetation dynamics is described by a plant-water interaction model. It is shown that this policy can lead the vegetation density to a previously chosen level under an overgrazing regime. This result is obtained despite both the potential occurrence of vegetation collapse due to overgrazing and the possibility of complex dynamics sensitive to vegetation initial densities and parameter uncertainties.

AB We conducted a 2-year study in central Alberta to quantify and simulate the soil water status of boreal grasslands under three grazing systems using wapiti (Cervus elaphus Canadensis), viz. (1) ungrazed control (UNG), (2) high intensity [4.16 animal unit month per ha (AUM) ha(-1) ] short-duration grazing (SDG) and (3) moderate intensity (2.08 AUM ha(-1)) continuous grazing (CG). Soil water was measured from May 1997 to September 1998 to a depth of 15 cm. Total annual precipitation in 1997 and 1998 was 494 and 429 mm respectively. In both years grazing treatments reduced soil water. Soil water content under SDG was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than CG. Simulation of soil water on each grazing system was conducted using PASTURE, a simple compartmental system dynamics model. Evaluation of the model was conducted using statistical criteria that included calculation of average error, root mean square, coefficient of residual mass and modelling efficiency and comparing these statistics against optimal values. Although the model under-predicted soil water, simulations of soil water for grazing treatments in both years were closest to measured values with modelling efficiency (how well observed values are close to simulated values) up to 68 %.

AB This paper presents the foundations of the DESPAS model, a systems dynamic model of a theoretical commercial grazing system. Our goal is to emphasize the importance of systemic models, such as DESPAS, as tools for reaching a better understanding of the possible behaviours expected to be found in commercial grazing systems, for synthesizing existing knowledge about such systems and for guiding future research. An overall description of the model is also included. DESPAS serves to interact a commercial livestock herd with vegetal cover and soil in a complex framework that links physical end economic variables. This is an important link underlying desertification caused by overgrazing of pasturelands, which motivated the construction of our model.

AB 'Coarse fish' were introduced to New Zealand for angling and ornamental purposes, but their presence may have far-reaching consequences within our water bodies. Through their deleterious impacts on water quality and direct disturbance of submerged plants, large populations of these alien fish have the potential to cause substantial and undesirable changes to lake and river ecosystems. Moreover, the continued influence of coarse fish may prevent the recovery or restoration of such water bodies. In this paper, we review international findings on the incompatibility of coarse fish and submerged vegetation resources that raised an alarm for the New Zealand situation. We also present recent results from NIWA's research programme. Experiments on feeding preference confirm that herbivorous rudd (Scardinius erythropthalmus) present a particular risk to-native submerged plants and may facilitate invasion by less palatable alien weeds. Rudd consumption rates were found to be seasonal and we confirmed a grazing preference for native plants over weed species. Fish exclusion from areas of a shallow eutrophic lake (Hamilton Lake, or Lake Rotoroa) that supports an abundant coarse fishery, was found to substantially increase the early establishment and survival of submerged plants. The complexities of plant-fish relationships and, their outcome for vegetation development and persistence are considered using a simple, illustrative model. Some management issues are considered in the light of research results and NIWA's past experiences with aquatic plant pests. Finally, some future research priorities are suggested.

AB During 1993-1996, algal vegetation was studied in three stations in flat: two stations in the Hof Almog Nature Reserve and a third station at Taba, further south. In the Hof Almog stations, filamentous turf comprised more than half of the algal vegetation, macroalgae were scarce except for Lobophora variegata and crustose red algae, and total algal cover was low. In Taba, cover by macroalgae, e.g., Cystoseira myrica and Sargassum spp., and total algal cover was higher than in Hof Almog. Around the world, Cystoseira and Sargassum have disappeared or decreased in polluted areas. The almost total absence of these genera in the Hof Almog stations, in contrast to their ample occurrence at Taba, indicates pollution in Hof Almog but less in Taba. Numerous species found in earlier studies are absent in flat, while other species are recorded for the first time in the present study.

AB The extent of grazing by two macropodids, the agile wallaby (Macropus agilis) and the swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) on coastal foredunes on South Stradbroke Island in southeast Queensland was investigated to determine potential impacts on the principal sand colonizing species, sand spinifex grass (Spinifex sericeus). Grazing on spinifex grass on the foredunes of South Stradbroke island can be attributed principally to agile wallabies. Foraging activity by wallabies was higher in areas of high spinifex abundance, however, grazing intensity and impact on spinifex was only important on foredunes with low spinifex abundance. Spinifex consumption by wallabies was also related to a number of factors, especially composition and structure of vegetation in adjacent habitats. Spinifex consumption increased when the abundance of ground cover components (grasses, sedges, forbs) in adjacent habitats was low and structural complexity was high. Grazing on foredunes by wallabies significantly affects the species composition of the foredune community by excluding the establishment of a number of perennial foredune plant species. This may have implications for community succession in coastal ecosystems.

AB Predictions from three conceptual models of the dynamics of semi-arid vegetation (Clementsian succession, alternative stable states and annuation/pulse phenomena) are used to review the available evidence on changes in the vegetation of semi-arid lowland Central Otago, New Zealand. Evidence is presented from Central Otago that corresponds with Clementsian succession and with annuation/pulse phenomena, although there is so far no formal evidence of alternative stable states. A declining-productivity model, which combines aspects of the other models, is also shown to fit the process of vegetation change in vegetation dynamics in Central Otago are insufficient for the employment of management frameworks such as degradation gradient assessment and the state-and-transition model.

AB Simple models and an example from the published Literature suggest how consumer mobility can alter the relative importance to producers of consumption (predation and herbivory) and competition following a disturbance that opens habitat for colonization. Highly mobile consumer species often can colonize disturbed habitat at juvenile and adult life stages with high per capita consumption rates. In contrast, consumers with limited mobility, as well. as sessile or sedentary prey, can be restricted to colonization of disturbed habitat by reproductive propagules, and initially have low per capita consumption, and low biomass and per capita production, respectively. Following a disturbance, the relationship between potential consumption and production can differ in important ways from that prior to the disturbance if consumer and prey species differ markedly in mobility, but may be similar to that prior to the disturbance if consumers and prey are both limited to colonization by reproductive propagules. Functional responses of consumers, and growth rates of consumers relative to producers, can determine how strongly consumer mobility will influence post-disturbance interactions. In California (USA) kelp forests, sea urchins may be able to colonize disturbed patches as adults or can be restricted to colonization by larval settlement depending on habitat characteristics and how their foraging behavior affects sea urchin susceptibility to winter storms. On Naples Reef, near Santa Barbara, California, recovery of macroalgae including giant kelp was inhibited under grazing by adult urchins but was rapid when sea urchins colonized through larval settlement.

AB Conventional range rehabilitation methods use controlled grazing, followed by assessments of either species composition, cover or phytomass dynamics. We compared effects of controlled and free grazing on the dynamics of live (current year's and preceding years' crops), standing dead and litter fraction of the dwarf shrub Indigofera spinosa (Forsk.) Mathew between 1986 and 1990, on arid range of North-West Kenya. Except for standing dead fraction and litter mass, live phytomass fractions varied significantly between growth and dormancy months in the two treatments. Generally, phytomass fractions exhibited disappearance in grazed plots, while it was accumulated in control plots. The control, however, achieved greater phytomass turnover (50.1 +/- 15.8% Yr(-1)) than grazed plots (34.4 +/- 6.0% Yr(-1)). The results showed that browsing when combined with declining rainfall, increased depreciation of forage yield, while above-average rainfall enhanced greater phytomass production. Given the rapid recovery potential by the shrub, declining trends of live fractions in grazed plots were unlikely to be permanent but fluctuate between periods of favourable rainfall and drought. The relationship between total monthly rainfall, cumulative rainfall of the current and the preceding months and the current year's crop, respectively, was explained by correlation coefficient (r) of 0.23-0.30 in control plots and 0.43-0.65 in grazed plots (<0.05). Daily green dry matter productivity and rainfall use efficiency (RUE) of I. spinosa improved when rain storm events were closely sequenced and spread over growth months. On this arid range, dwarf shrub litter production showed constancy, while standing dead fraction increased by about 900% in control plots and declined by 40% in grazed. Accumulation of standing dead phytomass fraction in control plots portrayed a deteriorating forage condition. Given that I. spinosa is highly adapted to herbivory, deferral of over-browsed shrubs should be limited to no more than 1-2 growth seasons. The paper discusses management implications of the findings.

AB The phenology of Asphodelus aestivus Brot. is described by means of a phenological model which has been formulated to fit skewed phenological data. Based on the model parameters the timing of different phenophases of biomass accumulation were determined. The biomass oscillations of leaves, inflorescence stalks and tubers were found to be synchronized with the predictable seasonal climatic changes. In addition, the plant seems to respond to minor random climatic variations. The emergence of leaves and inflorescence stalks depends on stored material in the tubers while leaf and inflorescence stalk elongation as well as flowering depends on current production. The storage part of the tubers seems to be a regulating structure, which is responsible for the synchronization of A. aestivus productivity with the seasonality of the Mediterranean climate. A. aestivus is considered to be a Competitor Ruderal and Stress tolerant (C-R-S) strategist which may explain the wide distribution of this plant over the Mediterranean Basin.

TI A DIFFERENTIAL-DELAY MODEL OF PASTURE ACCUMULATION AND LOSS IN
   CONTROLLED GRAZING SYSTEMS
SO MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID STABILITY; GROWTH
AB A grazing population dynamics model is proposed where organisms in a grazed population have a fixed life span. The motivating context is that of ruminants grazing grass-dominant pasture. The model takes the form of a differential-delay equation in which the rate of loss of pasture due to senescence at some time depends on the rate at which leaves are reaching maturity at that time. Comparisons are made with data from a continuous grazing experiment due to Bircham and Hodgson (Grass and Forage Science, 38:323-331, 1985), leading to a prediction of 21.9 days for herbage life span. Predictions of herbage utilization are consistent with measured data. The model predicts lower senescence in swards in regrowth than in grazed swards at the same herbage mass. Solutions and equilibria are obtained for the linear form of the model with continuous grazing pressure. Solutions and bounds are obtained for the linear model with intermittent grazing pressure, and its usefulness in modeling grazed pastures is discussed. A delay model is a simple but powerful means of including the concept of fixed herbage life span in grazing modeling. Questions of herbage life span and percentage utilization are naturally contained in the mechanism of a differential-delay model. These are not so well handled by models that treat senescence of herbage empirically.

AB An experimental study was designed to investigate the demographic mechanisms by which annual plants inhabiting desert sand dunes respond to local gradients in the stability of the sand. The results indicated that individual plants emerging at different topographic positions along the dune experience different probabilities of survival and reproduction. The general trend observed was a decrease in seedling survival, plant biomass, fecundity, reproductive allocation, and fruit weight from the relatively stable, interdune corridor towards the unstable crest of the dune. However, all of these demographic responses were highly species-specific, indicating that coexisting annual species respond differentially to underlying patterns of spatial heterogeneity in the stability of the sand. These results suggest that local-scale spatial heterogeneity in sand stability may be important in promoting coexistence of desert sand dune annuals.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE

ID DAIRY-COWS
AB A field experiment investigated the effects of frequency and height of defoliation on the productivity of an irrigated Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum) sward. Combinations of 4 intervals of harvest (3, 6, 9, 12 weeks) and 2 heights of defoliation (to ground level or 5 cm above ground level) were used in a randomised block experiment, with 2 additional treatments of 4 and 18 weeks between harvests defoliated to ground level.
   Total herbage accumulation ranged from 8.46 to 13.90 t DM/ha and varied according to defoliation management. Except for the very short defoliation intervals, harvesting to 5 cm was less productive than harvesting to ground level. The effects of leaf area index, herbage yield, and infection with leaf fungal disease on growth rates were assessed. Leaf area had a positive effect, and fungal disease a negative effect, on herbage growth rates, while maximum growth rates in autumn-winter were achieved when herbage yield reached about 2.0 t DM/ha.
   Dead matter accumulation increased with the interval between harvests, and weeds invaded the plots at both the shortest and longest defoliation intervals. The quality of seed produced (seed weight) was not influenced by defoliation treatment (0.1112 g/100 seeds, on average). Defoliation interval was positively related to number of inflorescences and quantity of seed set, but height of defoliation did not significantly affect these variables.
   It was concluded that the optimum interval of harvest was 6-9 weeks. Height of defoliation had only minor effects, due to the small difference in residual dry matter between the treatments.

AB Understanding variation of traits within and among species through time and across space is central to many questions in biology. Many resources assemble species-level trait data, but the data and metadata underlying those trait measurements are often not reported. Here, we introduce FuTRES (Functional Trait Resource for Environmental Studies; pronounced few-tress), an online datastore and community resource for individual-level trait reporting that utilizes a semantic framework. FuTRES already stores millions of trait measurements for paleobiological, zooarchaeological, and modern specimens, with a current focus onmammals. We compare dynamically derived extant mammal species' body size measurements in FuTRES with summary values from other compilations, high-lighting potential issues with simply reporting a single mean estimate. We then show that individual-level data improve estimates of bodymass-including uncertainty-for zooarchaeological specimens. FuTRES facilitates trait data integration and discoverability, accelerating new research agendas, especially scaling from intra- to interspecific trait variability.

AB Groundwater degradation is a major issue on an increasingly hot and thirsty planet. The problem is critical in drylands, where recharge rates are low and groundwater is the only reliable resource in a context of water scarcity and stress. Aquifer depletion and contamination is a process of desertification. Land Degradation Neutrality is regarded as the main initiative to tackle land degradation and desertification. It is embedded in target 15.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals and focused on preventing these dynamics. Within this framework, we present an approach to assess risks of degradation and desertification in coastal basins with aquifers threatened by seawater intrusion. The approach utilizes an integrated system dynamics model representing the main relationships between the aquifer and an intensively irrigated area (greenhouses) driven by short- and medium-term profitability. The study area is located in a semi-arid region in Southern Spain, the Gualchos stream basin, which contains the Castell de Ferro aquifer. We found that the risk of salinization of the aquifer is 73%, while there is a 70% risk that the system would increases its demand for surface water in the future, and the chance of doubling the current demand is almost 50%. If the current system of reservoirs in the area were not able to satisfy such an increase in demand because of climate change, the basin would be at a serious risk of desertification.

AB Host-specialist parasites of endangered large vertebrates are in many cases more endangered than their hosts. In particular, low host population densities and reduced among-host transmission rates are expected to lead to inbreeding within parasite infrapopulations living on single host individuals. Furthermore, spatial population structures of directly-transmitted parasites should be concordant with those of their hosts. Using population genomic approaches, we investigated inbreeding and population structure in a host-specialist seal louse (Echinophthirius horridus) infesting the Saimaa ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis), which is endemic to Lake Saimaa in Finland, and is one of the most endangered pinnipeds in the world. We conducted genome resequencing of pairs of lice collected from 18 individual Saimaa ringed seals throughout the Lake Saimaa complex. Our analyses showed high genetic similarity and inbreeding between lice inhabiting the same individual seal host, indicating low among-host transmission rates. Across the lake, genetic differentiation among individual lice was correlated with their geographic distance, and assignment analyses revealed a marked break in the genetic variation of the lice in the middle of the lake, indicating substantial population structure. These findings indicate that movements of Saimaa ringed seals across the main breeding areas of the fragmented Lake Saimaa complex may in fact be more restricted than suggested by previous population-genetic analyses of the seals themselves.

AB Aim Many ectotherms are at risk from climate change as temperatures are increasingly exceeding their thermal limits. Many evaluations of the vulnerability of ectotherms to climate change have relied on statistical metrics derived from coarse-scale climatic data, which may result in misleading predictions. By applying an integrative approach, we investigated geographical correlates of the vulnerability of lizards to climate change. Location Globally. Taxon Lizards. Methods We combined data on lizard thermal physiology and ecology, with high-resolution climate data and biophysical modelling to assess lizards' vulnerability to climate change. We calculated warming tolerance (difference between their body temperatures and upper thermal limits) and number of hours of activity. We investigated associations between warming tolerance and activity time with latitude, altitude and biome types. We compared our approach with traditional methods to calculate warming tolerance (using solely macroclimatic data). Results We found no latitudinal trend in the warming tolerance of lizards calculated from body temperature, but there was a weak negative correlation with altitude. We found associations between hours of activity and latitude and altitude. Desert species showed narrower warming tolerance than tropical and temperate species. Desert species and temperate species had reduced hours of activity when compared to tropical species. When warming tolerance was calculated from macroclimatic data, however, it was positively correlated with latitude and altitude, and species from tropical forested biomes showed narrow warming tolerances. Main Conclusions Vulnerability metrics calculated from macroclimatic data can produce divergent outcomes to those observed from fine-scale climatic data. Our work indicates that the ability of desert and temperate lizard species to cope with heat stress by thermoregulating is more constrained than that of tropical species. Integrative assessments of ectotherms' vulnerability to climate change can highlight species and regions that should be prioritised for conservation management.

To examine whether small mammal and arthropod granivory is a mechanism of community change via association with extirpation events, we studied seed predation on six phylogenetically paired extirpated and extant species from Kalamazoo, Michigan, using a seed removal experiment in a restored prairie. We also examined differences in granivore preferences for seed traits (seed mass, water content, C:N content) and differences in seed traits between extirpated and extant taxa. Granivory was independent of extirpation status but was affected by seed traits. Small mammals consumed more seeds than arthropods and preferentially consumed large seeds, while arthropods consumed small seeds and those with higher C:N ratios (lower nitrogen content). Extirpated and extant taxa did not differ in seed traits, perhaps explaining why they did not differ in granivory. Granivory was phylogenetically conserved, suggesting that certain plant families are more susceptible to granivores than others. This study indicates that granivory varies across species and seed traits in a prairie restoration, but does not likely influence extirpation in this system. Understanding granivore preferences may help managers predict establishment success for rare or extirpated species with particular traits being introduced into prairie restorations.

AB This paper assesses the reflectance difference values between the respective spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) of Sentinel 2A/2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat 8/9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors for seagrass, algae, and mixed species discrimination and monitoring in a shallow marine environment southeast of Bahrain Island in the Arabian Gulf. To achieve these, a field survey was conducted to collect samples of seawater, underwater sediments, seagrass (Halodule uninervis and Halophila stipulacea), and algae (green and brown). In addition, an experimental mode was established in a goniometric laboratory to simulate the marine environment, and spectral measurements were performed using an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) spectroradiometer. Measured spectra and their transformation using the continuum-removed reflectance spectral (CRRS) approach were analyzed to assess spectral separability among separate or mixed species at varying coverage rates. Afterward, the spectra were resampled and convolved in the solar-reflective spectral bands of MSI and OLI sensors and converted into water vegetation indices (WVIs) to investigate the potential of red, green, and blue bands for seagrass and algae species discrimination. The results of spectral and CRRS analyses highlighted the importance of the blue, green, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths for seagrass and algae detection and likely discrimination based on hyperspectral measurements. However, when resampled and convolved in MSI and OLI bands, spectral information loses the specific and unique absorption features and becomes more generalized and less precise. There- fore, relying on the multispectral bandwidth of MSI and OLI sensors, it is difficult or even impossible to differentiate or to map seagrass and algae individually at the species level. Instead of the red band, the integration of the blue or the green band in WVI increases their power to discriminate submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), particularly the water adjusted vegetation index (WAVI), water enhanced vegetation index (WEVI), and water transformed difference vegetation index (WTDVI). These results corroborate the spectral and the CRRS analyses. However, despite the power of blue wavelength to penetrate deeper into the water, it also leads to a relative overestimation of dense SAV coverage due to more scattering in this part of the spectrum. Furthermore, statistical fits (p <0.05) between the reflectance in the respective VNIR bands of MSI and OLI revealed excellent linear relationships (R-2 of 0.999) with insignificant root mean square difference (RMSD) (<= 0.0015). Important agreement (0.63 <= R-2 <= 0.96) was also obtained between respective WVI regardless of the integrated spectral bands (i.e., red, green, and blue), yielding insignificant RMSD (<= 0.01). Accordingly, these results pointed out that MSI and OLI sensors are spectrally similar, and their data can be used jointly to monitor accurately the spatial distribution of SAV and its dynamic in time and space in shallow marine environments, provided that rigorous data pre-processing issues are addressed.

AB The Yellow Cardinal Gubernatrix cristata is an 'Endangered' passerine from southern South America. For the past three years a management plan for Yellow Cardinals has been implemented in Argentina, in which rescued individuals from the illegal cage bird trade were released back into suitable habitats within their population of origin. We studied the reproductive success of a mixed population of released and wild Yellow Cardinals in La Pampa province, Argentina, during the reproductive season of 2019. The population was highly parasitized by the brood parasitic Shiny Cowbird Molothrus bonariensis. The frequency of parasitism was 100% and the intensity of parasitism was 4.5 +/- 3.4 (mean +/- SD) eggs per parasitized nest (range 1-13). No Yellow Cardinal chicks were recruited in the monitored nests, mainly as a consequence of Shiny Cowbird parasitism. The unusually high rate of parasitism led to a poor outcome of the reintroduction programme and indicates the need to update the conservation actions that have been carried out for the Yellow Cardinal so far. Shiny Cowbird abundance varies within the distribution of Yellow Cardinals, related to habitat modification and farming activities. Thus, further research on habitat suitability and assessment of Shiny Cowbird abundance should be incorporated into future strategies for the conservation of the Yellow Cardinal.

AB Performance traits are tightly linked to the fitness of organisms. However, because studies of variation in performance traits generally focus on just one or several closely related species, we are unable to draw broader conclusions about how and why these traits vary across clades. One important performance trait related to many aspects of an animal's life history is bite-force. Here, we use a clade-wide phylogenetic comparative approach to investigate relationships between size, head dimensions and bite-force among lizards and tuatara (lepidosaurs), using the largest bite-force dataset collated to date for any taxonomic group. We test four predictions: that bite-force will be greater in larger species, and for a given body size, bite-force will be greatest in species with acrodont tooth attachment, herbivorous diets, and non-burrowing habits. We show that bite-force is strongly related to body and head size across lepidosaurs and, as predicted, larger species have the greatest bite-forces. Contrary to our other predictions, tooth attachment, diet and habit have little predictive power when accounting for size. Herbivores bite more forcefully simply because they are larger. Our results also highlight priorities for future sampling to further enhance our understanding of broader evolutionary patterns.

AB The subtropical ROPME Sea Area (RSA), comprising the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the northern Arabian Sea, is a heavily exploited sea region that experiences extreme environmental conditions, and for which climate change is expected to further impact marine ecosystems and coastal communities, sectors and industries. Climate change risk assessments provide a valuable tool to inform decision-making and adaptation planning through identifying and prioritising climate risks and/or opportunities. Using the first UK Climate Change Risk Assessment as an example, a marine climate change risk assessment was undertaken for the marine and coastal environment of the RSA for the first time. Through an extensive literature review and a workshop involving regional experts, marine and coastal climate change risks were identified, scored and prioritised. A total of 45 risks were identified, which spanned two key themes: 'Risks to Biodiversity' and `Risks to Economy and Society'. Of these, 13 were categorised as 'severe', including degradation of coral reefs and their associated ecological assemblages, shifts in the distribution of wild-capture fisheries resources, changes to phytoplankton primary productivity, impacts on coastal communities, threats to infrastructure and industries, and impacts on operations and safety in maritime transport. The diversity of risks identified and their transboundary nature highlight that climate change adaptation responses will require coordinated action and cooperation at multiple scales across the RSA. This risk assessment provides a crucial baseline for a largely overlooked geographic area, that can be used to underpin future decision-making and adaptation planning on climate change, and serve as a 'blueprint' for similar assessments for other regional shared seas.

AB Biological rules describe general morphological, structural and genetic patterns within and across species. Within these, ecogeographical rules correlate phenotypic variation of organisms with biogeography. The latter have been developed over the last 150 years, and recently have gained renewed attention due to climate change, as researchers try to predict how species will respond to different environmental conditions based on certain phenotypic features. However, there is no agreement whether such rules hold true in our rapidly changing world. Among the ecogeographical rules, six have focused on the contributions of the coloured integument and body size to the thermal balance of individuals. They are therefore particularly relevant for predicting how species' phenotypes will respond to future climatic scenarios. Here, we provide an overview and discuss these ecogeographical rules, particularly in light of thermoregulation, and probe the extent to which these rules apply, and the taxonomic levels at which they are relevant. The predictions of these rules often contradict each other, and indeed we argue that use of the word 'rule' itself hinders their careful investigation. Moreover, disrupted climate patterns and global warming alter the environmental conditions under which these rules were once formulated. Thus, these rules may be outdated in our current rapidly changing environment. We conclude by proposing a revised concept of ecogeographical rules, where the micro-environment should have a stronger influence on the phenotype of organisms than its geographical location, and we suggest precautions researchers should take when testing them.

AB Mobile marine species display complex and nonstationary habitat use patterns that require understanding to design effective management measures. In this study, the spatio-temporal habitat use dynamics of the vulnerable dugong (Dugong dugon) were modelled from 16 satellite-tagged individuals in the coral reef lagoonal ecosystems of New Caledonia, South Pacific. Dugong residence time was calculated along the interpolated tracks (9371 hourly positions) to estimate intensity of use in three contrasting ecoregions, previously identified through hierarchical clustering of lagoon topographic characteristics. Across ecoregions, differences were identified in dugong spatial intensity of use of shallow waters, deeper lagoon waters and the fore-reef shelf outside the barrier reef. Maps of dugong intensity of use were predicted from these ecological relationships and validated with spatial density estimates derived from aerial surveys conducted for population assessment. While high correlation was found between the two datasets, our study extended the spatial patterns of dugong distribution obtained from aerial surveys across the diel cycle, especially in shallow waters preferentially used by dugongs at night/dusk during high tide. This study has important implications for dugong conservation and illustrates the potential benefits of satellite tracking and dynamic habitat use modelling to inform spatial management of elusive and mobile marine mammals.

TI Global Size Pattern in a Group of Important Ecological Indicators
   (Diptera, Chironomidae) Is driven by Latitudinal Temperature Gradients
SO INSECTS

AB Simple Summary The size of animals is a result of the complex interactions between the evolution of a group, the environment in which the animal lives, and its physiology. It has been known for a long time that warm-blooded animals (such as birds or mammals) become larger in colder climates. This phenomenon is called "Bergmann's rule", and it is caused by the necessity of the animals to produce and preserve their heat in colder climates. This is easier for larger animals, as they have a lower ratio of body surface area to body volume. In cold-blooded animals, such as insects, similar patterns have been found in some cases, but their origin is less clear. In this paper, we show a strong negative relationship between size and temperature in a large group of aquatic insects (non-biting midges). We found that wings of non-biting midges are shorter by 32.4 mu m for every 1 degrees C of mean annual temperature increase. This finding is important for use of non-biting midges in monitoring aquatic ecosystem health and tracking global climate change. Size is one of the most outwardly obvious characteristics of animals, determined by multiple phylogenetic and environmental variables. Numerous hypotheses have been suggested to explain the relationship between the body size of animals and their geographic latitude. Bergmann's Rule, describing a positive relationship between the body size of endothermic animals and their geographic latitude, is especially well known. Whether or not insects exhibit a similar pattern has long been a subject for debate. We hypothesize that latitudinal size gradients are coupled to temperature variation affecting the metabolic rate of these merolimnic insects. We showcase a strong latitudinal size gradient in non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae), based on the examination of 4309 specimens of these midges from around the world. Although phylogenetic position was a key predictor of wing length, we also found that wing length decreases by 32.4 mu m per every 1 degrees C of mean annual temperature increase. This pattern was found across different taxa and could be detected in 20 of 24 genera studied. We discuss the reasons for this pattern origin and its palaeoecological implications.

AB Context Vegetation patterns in hummock grasslands of Australia's arid interior can be very complex. Additionally, the grasslands are interspersed with variable amounts of trees and shrubs. Objectives To better understand the spatial arrangement of this vegetation structure, and in particular the unvegetated bare-soil gaps, we analyzed the scale-dependent patterns of gaps, trees, and shrubs. Methods We focused on two size categories of grassland gaps, large gaps >= 4 m(2) known as fairy circles (FCs) and small gaps 1 to < 4 m(2), and on trees and shrubs. We mapped four 200 m x 200 m study plots located east of the town of Newman in Western Australia, using drone-based aerial images and LiDAR. The RGB images were converted into binary images and the gaps and woody plants were automatically segmented. The spatial patterns of the four vegetation components were analyzed, as well as the shape properties of the vegetation gaps. Results The most striking result was that small gaps appeared consistently at about 5 m distance away from the FCs, which are known as the most water-depleted locations in the grassland. The FCs were also rounder than the small gaps and this symmetry underlines their function as an extra source of water for the surrounding matrix vegetation. Trees and shrubs had spatial patterns that were unrelated to FCs, which likely results from their water uptake in deeper sub-soil layers. Conclusions The consistent distance of small gaps to FCs is further support that the Australian fairy circles are a self-organized vegetation pattern that results from ecohydrological feedbacks.

AB AimsAlthough Sinai is a global hotspot for desert vegetation, there is no well-documented overview of the Sinai vegetation. We aim to provide a phytosociological overview of Sinai desert vegetation based on an extensive database and formal classification. We further aim to describe the vegetation communities and provide information on their distribution.
   LocationSinai, Egypt.
   MethodsWe built a comprehensive database utilizing all available vegetation plot data of the study area from published literature and our field surveys. We determined the database clustering tendency (Hopkins' test analysis) and estimated its optimal number of clusters (Elbow method). We performed a cluster analysis (modified TWINSPAN) and improved the validity of the resulting groups by approximating natural clustering using the Silhouette algorithm. We visualized the results by calculating Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling and drawing distribution maps for the observed vegetation communities.
   ResultsWe distinguished nine classes representing Sinai desert vegetation: Salicornietea fruticosae, Retametea raetam, Haloxylonetea salicornici, Retamo-Tamaricetea fluviatilis, Acacietea tortilis, Artemisietea herbae-albae, Anabasietea articulatae, Chiliadenetea iphionoidis, and Stellarietea mediae. We distinguished 25 vegetation groups, of which seven are new findings, representing four main vegetation groups: salt desert, lowland desert, mountain desert, and ruderal desert. We observed a high diversity in life forms, chorotypes, and alpha-diversity of the vegetation among the main groups. Therophytes, chamaephytes, hemicryptophytes, and phanerophytes are the dominant life forms. Prevailing chorotypes are Saharo-Arabian, Mediterranean, Mediterranean-Irano-Turanian and Irano-Turanian-Saharo-Arabian. The salt desert and lowland desert vegetation are species-poor, whereas the mountain desert vegetation is relatively species-rich. The ruderal desert vegetation is the most species-rich.
   ConclusionWe present a common classification of Sinai desert vegetation based on cutting-edge methods and provide an updated description of the desert vegetation groups of Sinai. Our study forms an important basis for decision-making in nature conservation, global change issues, and further in-depth studies on Sinai vegetation.

AB This paper presents aspects of monitoring material dust emissions from stationary emission sources (monthly dust measurements performed on cement mill stacks-mill outlet and separator outlet). Additionally, the Portland cement mill technological process (its component parts), as well as the solutions regarding the reduction of the air emissions level, following the emission limit values (VLE), established in the integrated environmental authorization (AIM) from a cement factory in Romania, were analyzed. The paper focused on analyzing the data obtained in three different years for PM10 and dust concentrations (2018-2020). For each year, the measurements have been done in 3 months, each in a different season. The average values for each year for working conditions were: 30.22 mg/m(3) (2018), 27.38 mg/m(3) (2019), and 27.51 mg/m(3) (2020) for working conditions and for normal conditions: 34.22 mg/m(3) (2018), 30.49 mg/m(3) (2019), and 30.16 mg/m(3) (2020). For all 3 years, the values measured in spring were higher than the other two, both for work and normal conditions.

AB Citizen science data are becoming increasingly relevant in wildlife studies, especially when obtaining data requires costly logistics. In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, baseline information about cetaceans is scarce despite their regular presence. From 2012 to 2019, a citizen science campaign conducted in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) obtained information on 1,292 cetacean sightings. These were methodically validated by experts, resulting in 1,103 records where species was confidently assigned. From the 12 species reported, we analyzed the spatial patterns of occurrence and drivers of habitat preference for the three most reported species: Tursiops aduncus (Ta 53%), Sousa plumbea (Sp 45%), and Neophocaena phocaenoides (Np 2%). Ecological niche modelling, considering seven environmental variables (physicochemical: temperature, silicate, calcite, pH; physiographic: distance from coast, bathymetry; biological: chlorophyll) showed subtle niche partitioning among the three species. Our results suggest different diets and energy requirements for Np, with Ta and Sp, segregating mostly by different patterns of space use. Specifically, Sp prefers close proximity to shore, particularly areas with complex networks of inland canals. This information provides an estimate of habitat preferences, that can be used in formulating effective conservation measures. Sp shows the narrowest area of suitable habitat and is at particular risk from habitat degradation.

AB Novel assemblages of biotic, abiotic, and social components resulting from human-induced actions (e.g., climate change, land-use change, species movement) have been labeled as "Novel Ecosystems", or "Novel Urban Ecosystems" when emerging in urban contexts. This concept has been shifting perspectives among some scientists and making them question traditional values about human-nature interactions in a rapidly changing era dominated by anthropogenic actions (Anthropocene). Controversial dimensions surrounding the Novel Ecosystems and Novel Urban Ecosystems terms may be preventing the evolution and further research of these concepts. The environmental problems that our society will soon face support a search for innovative solutions and transdisciplinary efforts. For that reason, this discussion should not cease, rather should expand to other fields of knowledge that can contribute with pertinent insights and collaborations. This way, this short communication aims to reflect on the opportunities from Landscape Architecture to the discussion, research, and application of the novel ecosystems concepts in the real world, particularly in the urban landscape, and also reflect on the opportunities of this debate to the Landscape Architecture field. Ultimately, Landscape Architecture can contribute with innovative and creative perspectives, acceding valuable and advanced tools, facilitating dialogues between fields of knowledge, and bridging gaps between science, people, and nature.

AB Key message Plant-soil feedbacks in mangrove ecosystems are important for ecosystem resilience and can be investigated by establishing links between empirical and modelling studies. Plant-soil feedbacks are important as they provide valuable insights into ecosystem dynamics and ecosystems stability and resilience against multiple stressors and disturbances, including global climate change. In mangroves, plant-soil feedbacks are important for ecosystem resilience in the face of sea level rise, carbon sequestration, and to support successful ecosystem restoration. Despite the recognition of the importance of plant-soil feedbacks in mangroves, there is limited empirical data available. We reviewed empirical studies from mangrove ecosystems and evaluate numerical models addressing plant-soil feedbacks. The empirical evidence suggests that plant-soil feedbacks strongly influence ecological processes (e.g. seedling recruitment and soil elevation change) and forest structure in mangrove ecosystems. Numerical models, which successfully describe plant-soil feedbacks in mangrove and other ecosystems, can be used in future empirical studies to test mechanistic understanding and project outcomes of environmental change. Moreover, the combination of both, modelling and empirical approaches, can improve mechanistic understanding of plant-soil feedbacks and thereby ecosystem dynamics in mangrove ecosystems. This combination will help to support sustainable coastal management and conservation.

TI Vulnerability of a top marine predator in one of the world's most

SO MARINE BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BOTTLE-NOSED DOLPHINS; ABUNDANCE; SOUTHERN
AB Knowledge of the habitat use of wildlife in highly impacted areas is essential to identify areas of biological importance and to implement appropriate conservation measures. The Arabian Gulf represents one of the most extreme marine environments and is considered one of the regions in the world with the greatest anthropogenic impact. Information on the habitat use and abundance of marine top predator species is, however, lacking, despite being a prerequisite for effective planning of conservation measures. Here, we provide novel information for the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) in the Arabian Gulf (Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates). Data from 80 daily surveys conducted between June 2014 and November 2019 were used both to assess correlates of bottlenose dolphin habitat use and relative density and to calculate mark-recapture abundance estimates. This study confirms the strong adaptability and tolerance of this top marine predator to extreme environmental conditions within a highly heterogeneous and impacted marine habitat. The observed preferences for areas with less human pressure were likely a result of the interactions of environmental factors with prey availability and human disturbance. This study also provides the first abundance estimates for a bottlenose dolphin population in the Arabian Gulf. Our findings support the call for increased marine-protected areas and the creation of transboundary conservation areas in the region. Regional connectivity should be of value to marine predators whose wide distribution and vulnerability to human activities means that alteration of their habitats can result in population declines and eventual local or regional extinctions.

AB Context Amazonian white-sand ecosystems (campinas) are open vegetation patches which form a natural island-like system in a matrix of tropical rainforest. Due to a clear distinction from the surrounding matrix, the spatial characteristics of campina patches may affect the genetic diversity and composition of their specialized organisms, such as the small and endemic passerine Elaenia ruficeps. Objectives To estimate the relative contribution of the current extension, configuration and geographical context of campina patches to the patterns of genetic diversity and population structure of E. ruficeps. Methods We sampled individuals of E. ruficeps from three landscapes in central Amazonia with contrasting campina spatial distribution, from landscapes with large and connected patches to landscapes with small and isolated patches. We estimated population structure, genetic diversity, and contemporary and historical migration within and among the three landscapes and used landscape metrics as predictor variables. Furthermore, we estimated genetic isolation by distance and resistance within landscapes. Results We identified three genetically distinct populations with asymmetrical gene flow among landscapes and a decreasing migration rate with distance. Within each landscape, we found low differentiation without genetic isolation by distance nor by resistance. In contrast, we found differentiation and spatial correlation between landscapes. Conclusions Together with previous studies, the population dynamics of E. ruficeps suggests that both regional context and landscape structure shape the connectivity among populations of campina specialist birds. Also, the spatial distribution of Amazonian landscapes, together with their associated biota, has changed in response to climatic changes in the Late Pleistocene.

AB Regional long-term monitoring can enhance the detection of biodiversity declines associated with climate change, improving future projections by reducing reliance on space-for-time substitution and increasing scalability. Rodents are diverse and important consumers in drylands, regions defined by the scarcity of water that cover 45% of Earth's land surface and face increasingly drier and more variable climates. We analyzed abundance data for 22 rodent species across grassland, shrubland, ecotone, and woodland ecosystems in the southwestern USA. Two time series (1995-2006 and 2004-2013) coincided with phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which influences drought in southwestern North America. Regionally, rodent species diversity declined 20%-35%, with greater losses during the later time period. Abundance also declined regionally, but only during 2004-2013, with losses of 5% of animals captured. During the first time series (wetter climate), plant productivity outranked climate variables as the best regional predictor of rodent abundance for 70% of taxa, whereas during the second period (drier climate), climate best explained variation in abundance for 60% of taxa. Temporal dynamics in diversity and abundance differed spatially among ecosystems, with the largest declines in woodlands and shrublands of central New Mexico and Colorado. Which species were winners or losers under increasing drought and amplified interannual variability in drought depended on ecosystem type and the phase of the PDO. Fewer taxa were significant winners (18%) than losers (30%) under drought, but the identities of winners and losers differed among ecosystems for 70% of taxa. Our results suggest that the sensitivities of rodent species to climate contributed to regional declines in diversity and abundance during 1995-2013. Whether these changes portend future declines in drought-sensitive consumers in the southwestern USA will depend on the climate during the next major PDO cycle.

AB This work investigates the existence and bifurcation structure of multi-pulse steady-state solutions to bistable lattice dynamical systems. Such solutions are characterized by multiple compact disconnected regions where the solution resembles one of the bistable states and resembles another trivial bistable state outside of these compact sets. It is shown that the bifurcation curves of these multi-pulse solutions lie along closed and bounded curves (isolas), even when single-pulse solutions lie along unbounded curves. These results are applied to a discrete Nagumo differential equation and we show that the hypotheses of this work can be confirmed analytically near the anti-continuum limit. Results are demonstrated with a number of numerical investigations.

AB In attempting to predict the impact of major ecological or climatic change on livelihoods, insights can be gained by looking at communities who experience extreme seasonal or annual variation. Here, we compare the ecology, economy, and social network of a community of traditional fishers in the Brazilian Pantanal between the dry season and the flood season in which their wetland ecosystem is transformed. Using data derived from satellite imaging we show that during the flood season of 2019 the total amount of open water accessible to fishers more than doubled and led to drastic qualitative changes. We show that although fishers adapted to this extreme seasonality by changing where, how, and what they fish between seasons, the structure of the social network in our study community did not differ. We argue that strong networks are especially important in social-ecological systems with extreme seasonal changes. More generally, we suggest that case studies of seasonal adaptation such as ours can contribute to a broader understanding of how communities may be able to successfully adapt to novel social-ecological changes.

AB Background Skulls serve many functions and as a result, are subject to many different evolutionary pressures. In squamates, many fossorial species occupy a unique region of skull morphospace, showing convergence across families, due to modifications related to head-first burrowing. As different substrates have variable physical properties, particular skull shapes may offer selective advantages in certain substrates. Despite this, studies of variation within burrowers have been limited and are typically focused on a single origin of fossoriality. We focused on seven skink genera (Acontias, Typhlosaurus, Scelotes, Sepsina, Feylinia, Typhlacontias, and Mochlus; 39 sp.) from southern Africa, encompassing at least three independent evolutions of semi-fossoriality/fossoriality. We used microCT scans and geometric morphometrics to test how cranial and mandibular shape were influenced by phylogenetic history, size, and ecology. We also qualitatively described the skulls of four species to look at variation across phylogenetic and functional levels, and assess the degree of convergence. Results We found a strong effect of phylogenetic history on cranial and mandibular shape, with size and substrate playing secondary roles. There was a clear gradient in morphospace from less specialized to more specialized burrowers and burrowers in sand were significantly different from those in other substrates. We also created an anatomical atlas for four species with each element described in isolation. Every bone showed some variation in shape and relative scaling of features, with the skull roofing bones, septomaxilla, vomer, and palatine showing the most variation. We showed how broad-scale convergence in traits related to fossoriality can be the result of different anatomical changes. Conclusions Our study used geometric morphometrics and comparative anatomy to examine how skull morphology changes for a highly specialized and demanding lifestyle. Although there was broad convergence in both shape and qualitative traits, phylogenetic history played a large role and much of this convergence was produced by different anatomical changes, implying different developmental pathways or lineage-specific constraints. Even within a single family, adaptation for a specialized ecology does not follow a singular deterministic path.

AB Questions Habitat islands are often characterized by the presence of more or less sharp boundaries to adjacent matrix habitats. However, knowledge on boundaries of natural habitat islands is scarce, especially regarding patterns of beta diversity and its two underlying components: species turnover and nestedness. We therefore aim to quantify the effects of fine-scaled and sharp boundaries of quartz islands (quartz gravel-covered soils) on the different components of plant beta diversity and how they are linked to different soil environmental drivers. Location Knersvlakte, Western Cape, South Africa. Methods We sampled plant species richness in 56 fine-scale transects of 6 m x 1 m plots across eight different boundary types (four quartz island to matrix, four between habitats on quartz islands). Soil depth and chemistry (pH, electrical conductivity) were analyzed for each 1 m(2) plot. Differences in the two beta diversity components (turnover and nestedness) for each boundary type were tested by t tests. We used linear models to test relationships between species and environmental dissimilarity. Results All boundary types showed high beta diversity. Species turnover was the prevailing component for six boundary types, the nestedness component was only important for two boundary types. We found a significant linear increase of species dissimilarity with increasing dissimilarity in soil pH and distinct plant communities for the habitat types, but no significant increase for electrical conductivity or soil depth. Conclusions The spatial distinctiveness of the quartz islands leads to sharp boundaries, which result in high beta diversity, mainly through species turnover. This reflects the high levels of diversification and adaptation of the local plant communities. Nestedness occurred at two boundaries to the matrix, indicating that the latter does not necessarily represent an impermeable boundary for all species of the respective ecosystem. Studying diversity patterns across boundaries contributes to the question of applicability of island biogeography theory to habitat islands.

AB Eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) are among the most widely introduced freshwater species globally. To gain a better understanding of feeding patterns in non-native populations, and which local factors may influence them at the population level, we carried out gut content analysis on 163 specimens from nine invasive populations in Italy and Spain. Based on previous studies, we predicted that (a) mosquitofish are omnivores with a preference for detritus and cladocerans; (b) they display size- and population-specific differences in gut morphologies and diet, with larger fish feeding more intensively over a wider range of prey items; and (c) some of the variation would be associated with differences in local environmental and climatic factors. Our results confirmed our first prediction, because mosquitofish fed on a variety of diet items, among which detritus and Cladocera dominated. However, not a single diet item was shared among all populations. Congruent with our second prediction, we further identified size- and population-specific differences in the occurrence of some diet items and gut morphologies. However, observed patterns in dietary habits did not seem to be driven by the environmental and climatic variables we had quantified. The fairly variable diet likely aids invasion success and helps explain the ubiquity of invasive mosquitofish across Italy and Spain, as mosquitofish seem to be able to rely on whatever a local habitat provides. We further propose that size-specific differences likely capture the substantial sexual size dimorphism (males are smaller than females), while population-specific differences are likely the result of differences in local prey abundance. The lack of an influence of temperature on dietary habits suggests that mosquitofish feeding ecology may be less impacted by rising temperatures than other freshwater fish species. If true, then this suggests climate change-induced effects may further exacerbate the competitive superiority of mosquitofish over native species in the future.

AB A new assemblage of large insect trace fossils is recognized in paleosols of the middle Miocene pyroclastic deposits from extra-Andean north Patagonia. This assemblage includes Racemusichnus jacobacciensis igen. isp. nov., the largest trace fossil in paleosols attributed to solitary insects. R. jacobacciensis is represented by clusters of two to seven thickly walled cylinders horizontally orientated in the paleosol. The cluster arrangement, its orientation, the large size and wall of the cylinders suggest a dung beetle, probably a representative of the Geotrupidae as the possible trace maker. The new ichnoassemblage, also comprising large-sized specimens of Coprinisphaera ispp., Teisseirei barattinia and Feoichnus challa, belongs to the Rosellichnus assemblage-SAPIA of the Coprinisphaera Ichnofacies. Mollic paleosols along with the trace fossils, mammal remains and previous data for this unit suggest an open grassy habitat compatible with high productive grass savannas, under a temperate-warm and seasonal subhumid climate. This assemblage of large-sized trace fossils is attributed to highly productive ecosystems related to the rise of temperature occurred during the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum.

AB Variation in body size is thought as one of the main responses to climate change, yet studies exploring the existence of this pattern are limited by the scarcity of long temporal datasets. Bats are promising candidates for the occurrence of climate-driven changes in body size because their life cycle is highly sensitive to ambient temperature. Although a reduction in body size would adaptively imply more efficient heat dissipation under a climate change scenario, dehydration caused by heatwaves would in fact be limited by a larger body size, so either responses may be predicted. An increasing body size over time might also be the consequence of a longer growth season secured by a warmer climate. On such bases, we tested the hypothesis that body size varied in the bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum from Italian populations between 1869 and 2005 by examining forearm length (FAL) in 78 spatially independent specimens, and found that FAL increased over that period. We also ruled out that body size varied over space in relation to latitude (as predicted by Bergmann's rule) or insularity, besides confirming the occurrence of sexual dimorphism (females being larger than males). This study illustrates a rare example of an increasing body size trend in a mammal species measured over ca. a century and a half, potentially unveiling a response to environmental variation.

AB Simple Summary
   In our first experiment, we found that male and female guppies differ consistently in their swimming activity, both when alone and when together in heterosexual pairs, and that males, regardless of their own activity, show more sexual behaviours to more active females in these pairs. In the second experiment, we gave males the choice between a slow and a fast-moving virtual female and found that males prefer to associate with the fast-moving female. Both experiments together provide evidence that guppy males prefer faster moving females as mating partners over slower moving ones. Higher activity patterns may indicate health, fitness and receptivity and a mating preference for more active females can help males increase their own reproductive success.
   Mate choice that is based on behavioural traits is a common feature in the animal kingdom. Using the Trinidadian guppy, a species with mutual mate choice, we investigated whether males use female swimming activity-a behavioural trait known to differ consistently among individuals in many species-as a trait relevant for their mate choice. In the first experiment, we assessed male and female activity in an open field test alone (two repeated measures) and afterwards in heterosexual pairs (two repeated measures). In these pairs, we simultaneously assessed males' mating efforts by counting the number of sexual behaviours (courtship displays and copulations). Male and female guppies showed consistent individual differences in their swimming activity when tested both alone and in a pair, and these differences were maintained across both test situations. When controlling for male swimming behaviour and both male and female body size, males performed more courtship displays towards females with higher swimming activity. In a second experiment, we tested for a directional male preference for swimming activity by presenting males video animations of low- and high-active females in a dichotomous choice test. In congruence with experiment 1, we found males to spend significantly more time in association with the high-active female stimulus. Both experiments thus point towards a directional male preference for higher activity levels in females. We discuss the adaptive significance of this preference as activity patterns might indicate individual female quality, health or reproductive state while, mechanistically, females that are more active might be more detectable to males as well.

AB Effective restoration strategies are needed to address habitat degradation that accompanies worldwide environmental change. One method used to enhance restoration outcomes is the leveraging of beneficial relationships (facilitation) among plants. In the southwestern United States, native mesquite trees (Prosopis spp.) are commonly planted to stabilize soil, but the value of using mesquite canopies for enhancing restoration success is unknown. We explored this possibility in an attempt to understand how common species, that both are and are not typically used for restoration, might differentially respond to mesquite canopies. We used a Bayesian multivariate generalized mixed model structure to analyze a dataset describing natural vegetation density in the Santa Rita Experimental Range, Arizona, United States. We found that more dominant species were not more likely to be distributed under mesquite. We also found that, while all of the focal species were more likely to be under mesquite with increased mesquite cover, they varied in the strength of their responses and the degree of saturation. Finally, we found that the aggressive invasive grass Eragrostis lehmanniana was found at lower incidences with increasing mesquite canopy cover, compared to the total species average as well as several of the natives investigated in this study. This work highlights the importance of being conscious of canopy size and continuity when considering understory species for restoration. This work also suggests that mesquite canopies can be used to provide a "safe site" for restoration species because competitive pressure from invasives is slightly reduced.

AB Rensch's rule is an allometric rule on sexual size dimorphism. It states that in small-sized species, females are larger than males, whereas in larger species, males are relatively larger than females. Several studies have explored this pattern, and its inverse in lizard species. China has a unique and high diversity of species, with a variety of ecological systems which shape diversity of phenotypes. In this study, sexual size dimorphism and Rensch's rule were determined using a dataset of Chinese lizard species. The findings show that Chinese lizards generally exhibit female-biased sexual size dimorphism. In addition, clutch size was positively correlated with sexual size dimorphism. Agamidae species were the only taxa that followed Rensch's rule (slope of males against females was steeper than 1). Clutch size was correlated with sexual size dimorphism in groups that do not follow Rensch's rule. This finding implies that strong fecundity selection limits application of Rensch's rule in these groups.

AB Individuals and social groups balance foraging activities with other energetically demanding behaviours. In honey bee colonies, foraging and nest defence behaviours are performed by similar-aged bees, and so hives must adjust their workforce investment to fulfil both tasks. We investigate this balance in the context of honey robbing, a tactic in which foragers invade a victim hive, kill worker bees and steal honey stores. Robbing is highly beneficial because stored honey is a plentiful, concentrated food resource. However, robbing requires a large workforce to overwhelm the defences of the victim hive; it is unknown how robbing hives adjust other behaviours to accommodate this demand. We developed a method to provoke a hive to engage in simulated robbing and measured rapid changes in foraging activity and nest defence. Surprisingly, robbing hives increased both behaviours. Guards, the individuals responsible for nest defence, specifically increased defensiveness towards their own nestmates as they returned from a robbing trip. We found that increased foraging activity and changes in forager odour profiles from prolonged exposure to victim hive honeycomb were insufficient to explain robbing-induced changes in guard defensiveness. However, brain gene expression profiles of robbing foragers suggest these bees are unusually aggressive, and thus more likely to provoke aggression from nestmate guards. Increased forager aggression occurred even in the absence of direct competition with victim bees. Thus, although increased guard defensiveness may be costly in terms of increased nestmate mortality, because the ecological conditions that promote robbing simultaneously increase the likelihood a hive will become a robbing target, guards may use cues from returning nestmates to determine invasion risk and adjust their defensiveness accordingly. These results suggest that colonies use social information to dynamically optimize both foraging and defensiveness in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the costs of this high-risk tactic.

AB Central America is one of the most important biodiversity hot spots in the world, and Costa Rican microbial communities from thermal springs are the best characterized in the isthmus. Miravalles is an inactive quaternary stratovolcano, and the Rincon de la Vieja is a unique active volcano, in whose slopes diverse hydrothermal springs, such as Las Lilas, are located. These springs harbor extensive microbial mats, whose diversity has been studied. Based on their importance as primary producers, in this study we focused on cultured cyanobacterial diversity from two geothermal environments of northern Costa Rica. Several cultural, molecular and taxonomic techniques were employed to maximize the results of a polyphasic approach. Sample collection sites were physicochemically described, and strains were isolated and characterized by light and electron microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequences and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Fifty-six phylotypes were isolated and classified into 21 morphotypes and identified in 14 genera, some of them might be new species within these genera. Furthermore, according to phylogenetic analysis, there are three possible new genera in our collection. Miravalles and Las Lilas thermal springs are reservoirs of novel phylogeographic lineages of phototrophic microorganisms. This study is the first report of strains that belong to the genera Gloeocapsa, Stanieria, Microseira, Klisinema and Oculatella isolated from thermal springs and growing at temperatures above 50 degrees C. We also obtained isolates assigned to Synechococcus, Leptolyngbya spp., and Fischerella, which are considered typical strains in these environments.

TI Water constraints drive allometric patterns in the body shape of tree
   frogs
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The origin of morphological diversity is a critical question in evolutionary biology. Interactions between the environment and developmental processes have determining roles in morphological diversity, creating patterns through space and over time. Also, the shape of organisms tends to vary with increasing size as a result of those developmental processes, known as allometry. Several studies have demonstrated that the body sizes of anurans are associated with hydric conditions in their environments and that localities with high water stress tend to select for larger individuals. However, how environmental conditions alter those patterns of covariance between size and shape is still elusive. We used 3D geometric morphometric analyses, associated with phylogenetic comparative methods, to determine if the morphological variations and allometric patterns found in Arboranae (Anura) is linked to water conservation mechanisms. We found effects of the hydric stress on the shape of Arboranae species, favouring globular shapes. Also, the allometric patterns varied in intensity according to the water stress gradient, being particularly relevant for smaller frogs, and more intense in environments with higher water deficits. Our study provides empirical evidence that more spherical body shapes, especially among smaller species, reflect an important adaptation of anurans to water conservation in water-constrained environments.

AB Selection for effective locomotion can lead to specialized morphological structures. Adhesive toepads, which have arisen independently in different lizard clades, facilitate the use of vertical and inverted substrates. Their evolution is poorly understood because functionally intermediate morphological configurations between padless and pad-bearing forms are rare. To shed light on toepad evolution, we assessed the subdigital morphology of phylogenetically distinct lineages of the Bynoe's gecko species complex (Heteronotia binoei). Most populations of H. binoei are terrestrial, but two relatively distantly related saxicoline (rock-dwelling) lineages have enlarged terminal subdigital scales resembling toepads. We reconstructed the ancestral terminal subdigital scale size of nine lineages of H. binoei in eastern Australia, including these two saxicoline lineages. Additionally, we compared the subdigital microstructures of four lineages: the two saxicoline lineages and their respective terrestrial sister-lineages. Surprisingly, all four lineages had fully developed setae, but the setae of the two saxicoline lineages were significantly longer, branched more often and were more widely spaced than the terrestrial sister-lineages. We conclude that the saxicoline lineages represent examples of parallel evolution of enlarged adhesive structures in response to vertical substrate use, and their morphology represents a useful model as an intermediate state in toepad evolution.

AB The solar salterns in Tuticorin, India, are man-made, saline to hypersaline systems hosting some uniquely adapted populations of microorganisms and eukaryotic algae that have not been fully characterized. Two visually different microbial mats (termed 'white' and 'green') developing on the reservoir ponds (53 PSU) were isolated from the salterns. Firstly, archaeal and bacterial diversity in different vertical layers of the mats were analyzed. Culture-independent 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that both bacteria and archaea were rich in their diversity. The top layers had a higher representation of halophilic archaea Halobacteriaceae, phylum Chloroflexi, and classes Anaerolineae, Delta- and Gamma- Proteobacteria than the deeper sections, indicating that a salinity gradient exists within the mats. Limited presence of Cyanobacteria and detection of algae-associated bacteria, such as Phycisphaerae, Phaeodactylibacter and Oceanicaulis likely implied that eukaryotic algae and other phototrophs could be the primary producers within the mat ecosystem. Secondly, predictive metabolic pathway analysis using the 16S rRNA gene data revealed that in addition to the regulatory microbial functions, methane and nitrogen metabolisms were prevalent. Finally, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions determined from both mat samples showed that the delta C-13(org) and delta N-15(org) values increased slightly with depth, ranging from - 16.42 to - 14.73 parts per thousand, and 11.17 to 13.55 parts per thousand, respectively. The isotopic signature along the microbial mat profile followed a pattern that is distinctive to the community composition and net metabolic activities, and comparable to saline mats in other salterns. The results and discussions presented here by merging culture-independent studies, predictive metabolic analyses and isotopic characterization, provide a collective strategy to understand the compositional and functional characteristics of microbial mats in saline environments.

AB Whereas scientists interested in subterranean life typically insist that their research is exciting, adventurous, and important to answer general questions, this enthusiasm and potential often fade when the results are translated into scientific publications. This is because cave research is often written by cave scientists for cave scientists; thus, it rarely "leaves the cave". However, the status quo is changing rapidly. We analysed 21,486 articles focused on subterranean ecosystems published over the last three decades and observed a recent, near-exponential increase in their annual citations and impact factor. Cave research is now more often published in non-specialized journals, thanks to a number of authors who are exploiting subterranean habitats as model systems for addressing important scientific questions. Encouraged by this positive trend, we here propose a few personal ideas for improving the generality of subterranean literature, including tips for framing broadly scoped research and making it accessible to a general audience, even when published in cave-specialized journals. Hopefully, this small contribution will succeed in condensing and broadcasting even further the collective effort taken by the subterranean biology community to bring their research "outside the cave".

AB Stipa tenacissima steppes cover 70,000 km(2) in the Mediterranean basin. In these habitats, resprouting shrubs form woody patches that were removed in the past to promote fiber and forage production. Patches are recovering after decades of abandonment. Patches enhance plant richness and affect ecosystem functioning. Yet, they have been commonly considered as a single entity, paying scarce attention to patch heterogeneity, patch dynamics and their impact on community composition. We describe the physical and biotic structure of 450 patches in 15 catchments along a climate gradient in southeastern Spain, and analyze the drivers of overstory and understory composition and recruitment of patch-forming species. Patches were formed by one to six species (Quercus coccifera, Juniperus oxycedrus, Rhamnus lycioides, Ephedra fragilis, Pistacia lentiscus and Osyris lanceolata). Climate determined the species composition in each patch, their physical characteristics and the recruitment of patch-forming species. Species cover and richness depended on the dominant species. Our results suggest that patches dominated by Quercus coccifera and Juniperus oxycedrus may decline and patches dominated by Rhamnus lycioides and Ephedra fragilis may expand as climate warms. They also provide new insights on the interactions in patch communities very relevant for the conservation and management of S. tenacissima steppes.

AB Temporal changes in body size have been documented in a number of vertebrate species, with different contested drivers being suggested to explain these changes. Among these are climate warming, resource availability, competition, predation risk, human population density, island effects and others. Both life history traits (intrinsic factors such as lifespan and reproductive rate) and habitat (extrinsic factors such as vegetation type, latitude and elevation) are expected to mediate the existence of a significant temporal response of body size to climate warming but neither have been widely investigated. Using examples of rodents, we predicted that both life history traits and habitat might explain the probability of temporal response using two tests of this hypothesis. Firstly, taking advantage of new data from museum collections spanning the last 106 years, we investigated geographical and temporal variation in cranial size (a proxy for body size) in six African rodent species of two murid subfamilies (Murinae and Gerbillinae) of varying life history, degree of commensality, range size, and habitat. Two species, the commensal Mastomys natalensis, and the non-commensal Otomys unisulcatus showed significant temporal changes in body size, with the former increasing and the latter decreasing, in relation with climate warming. Commensalism could explain the increase in size with time due to steadily increasing food availability through increased agricultural production. Apart from this, we found no general life history or habitat predictors of a temporal response in African rodents. Secondly, in order to further test this hypothesis, we incorporated our data into a meta-analysis based on published literature on temporal responses in rodents, resulting in a combined dataset for 50 species from seven families worldwide; among these, 29 species showed no significant change, eight showed a significant increase in size, and 13 showed a decline in size. Using a binomial logistic regression model for these metadata, we found that none of our chosen life history or habitat predictors could significantly explain the probability of a temporal response to climate warming, reinforcing our conclusion based on the more detailed data from the six African species.

AB Industrial bulk material transfer and handling processes often result in large dust emissions and seriously threaten workers' health. Both dust dispersion and ventilation for dust removal are related to the entrained air flow field under the particle flow fall process. The PIV test system is used to test the entrained air flow field during the particle flow free and adheres wall fall process. The particle flow free fall process: The entrained air velocity show a Gaussian distribution at the different height sections. The particle diffuses mainly along the width-side (d), and the diffusion phenomenon is not obvious in the length-side(l) direction. The particle flow adheres wall fall process: When s/d <= 5, the existence of the vertical wall has a significant effect on the entrained air flow field, and the entrained air can better adhere to the vertical wall. When s/d>5, the existence of the vertical wall has a little effect on the entrained air flow field, and the entrained air is basically separated from the vertical wall. This study provides a theoretical basis for the ventilation design of industrial particulate transport systems (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Despite a large body of research, little agreement has been reached on the ultimate driver(s) of geographic variation in body size (mass and/or length). Here we use skull length measurements (as a surrogate for body mass) from five Australian marsupial species to test the primary hypotheses of geographic variation in body size (relating to ambient temperature, productivity, and seasonality). We used a revised articulation of Bergmann's rule, wherein evidence for thermoregulation (heat dissipation or heat conservation) is considered supportive of Bergmann's rule. We modeled the skull lengths of four Petaurid glider species and the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) as a function of indices of ambient temperature, productivity, and seasonality. The skull length of Petaurus ariel, P. notatus, and the squirrel glider (P. norfolcensis), increased with increasing winter minimum temperature, while that of T. vulpecula decreased with increasing summer maximum temperature. The skull length of P. ariel decreased with indices of productivity, falsifying the productivity hypothesis. Only P. ariel met the hypothesis of seasonality, as skull length increased with increasing seasonality. Thermoregulation was the most consistently supported driver of geographic variation in body size, as we found evidence of either heat conservation or heat dissipation in four of the five species examined. We found the geographic range of the individual species and the climate space in which the species occurred was integral to understanding the species' responses to climate variables. Future studies should use specimens that are representative of a species' entire geographic range, encompass a variety of climatic regions, and use consistent methodologies and terminology when testing drivers of geographic variation in body size.

AB Population manipulations such as translocation and head-starting are increasingly used as recovery tools for chelonians. But evaluating success of individual projects can require decades of monitoring to detect population trends in these long-lived species. Furthermore, there are often few benchmarks from stable, unmanipulated populations against which to compare demographic rates, particularly for the immature stages. We used 8 years of mark-recapture data to estimate apparent survival of immature gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) recruited into an introduced population of gopher tortoises first established on St. Catherines Island, Georgia, USA, in 1987. During 2006-2013, we conducted targeted trapping of immature gopher tortoises and compared survival of the hatchling, juvenile and subadult stages among treatments: individuals released shortly after hatching from eggs obtained from gravid female founders (direct releases), individuals reared in captivity for 6-9 months following hatching (head-starts), and individuals first encountered as free-ranging, wild-recruited offspring (wild recruits). Among the candidate models we examined, the best fit model included additive effects of tortoise stage and treatment; however, overlapping 95% credible intervals among treatments (CrI) suggested that survival did not vary significantly among treatments. Annual apparent survival increased over the immature period, highlighting the importance of calculating separate estimates for the different immature stages. Across all treatments, the additive model estimated annual apparent survival probability to be 0.37 (CrI = 0.25-0.48) for hatchlings, 0.71 (CrI = 0.61-0.81) for juveniles, and 0.83 (CrI = 0.74-0.94) for subadults. Our study, in combination with previous monitoring efforts at St. Catherines Island, provides strong evidence that the translocation and subsequent population augmentation efforts have been successful in establishing a robust population of gopher tortoises. Additionally, our results provide estimates of demographic rates for life stages that are poorly understood but critical to understanding population dynamics of this imperiled species.

AB Body size impacts nearly all aspects of an animal's life and can be subject to considerable variation in response to differences in climate and resource availability. We studied the impact of temperature and resource availability on arid-living Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris), relative to body size and degree of sexual dimorphism, over three locations differing in annual rainfall and temperature to test Bergmann's rule, the resource rule and Rensch's rule. We found that squirrels were the largest where resources were the highest and temperatures were the lowest but squirrels were similar in mass where resources were medium or low and temperatures medium and highest, partially supporting Bergmann's rule and the resource rule. Hind-feet were the largest where resources were medium and temperatures were medium and similarly small in low and high resource and high- and low-temperature areas. The degree of sexual dimorphism of hind-foot and mass was constant no matter the resource abundance or temperature, suggesting no impact of resource availability or temperature on the degree of sexual dimorphism, contradicting Rensch's rule. Our findings suggest that, while resource availability and temperature may have an impact on body size, other mechanisms may be important in limiting both body size and degree of sexual dimorphism in this species.

AB The concept of alternate stable states is important in ecological theory and models, but the application and implementation of these models have the potential to make significant future advances in the field of patterned landscapes. The bistable ridge and slough landscape is a central feature of Everglades restoration and provides an important opportunity to test stable state theory with multistate transition models. We used these models to estimate environmental parameters associated with state changes (water depths, edaphic factors, etc.) and develop a quantitative method to measure resilience and stability. The multistate model indicates that long-term, local hydrology (15-yr mean maximums and 15-yr mean amplitude) and edaphic factors control the local scale shifts between ridge and slough states. We show that multistate models can provide hydrologic envelopes for managers, produce a tool to help assess future water management scenarios, and address issues of sustainability, resilience, and restoration for any bistable system.

AB Aims Harsh environmental conditions in alpine ecosystems shape vegetation structure into patches, where many different plant species cluster and grow together. Yet, which factors are important for the structure and dynamics of such plant-patch networks remains poorly understood. We aim to assess which and how environmental and biotic factors predict the assembly of plant patch networks along a mountain range.
   Methods We examined the distribution of plant species in more than 5500 vegetation patches in 37 Mediterranean alpine grasslands distributed along a 500 m altitudinal gradient (National Park of Sierra Guadarrama, Spain). We established a plant-patch network for each grassland community and analyzed how nestedness and modularity vary with environmental (altitude, insolation and soil conditions) and biotic factors (number of species per plot, mean patch area and total pasture area).
   Important Findings Plant-patch networks showed consistent, non-random patterns characterized by a nested, but not modular, structure, which suggests that positive associations among co-occurring specialists promote their growth within patches as subsets of a pool with more generalist species. Both nestedness and modularity of plant patch networks varied among grasslands. Specifically, nestedness decreased with increasing species per plot and increased with mean patch area, while it was independent of environmental variables; modularity increased with increasing pasture area and species per plot. The negative relationship between species per plot and nested patterns may be linked to the restricted number of species that can coexist within the same patch at a given size. Moreover, the positive relationship between patch size and nestedness indicates that the growth of rare plant species within vegetation patches occupied by more abundant species is facilitated in bigger rather than smaller patches. Furthermore, these results indicate that the nested assembly of vegetation patches may be independent of abiotic conditions. These findings suggest that large and unfragmented vegetation patches are fundamental for the maintenance of plant diversity in alpine grasslands. Looking at species distribution at fine spatial scales may shed new light on the biotic processes underlying plant network assembly and provide novel ways for conserving biodiversity.

AB The seaweed Caulerpa cylindracea Sender is one of the most important invaders on Mediterranean rocky shores. However, many driving pressures affecting its spread are poorly understood and seem to involve the interactions between abiotic and biotic factors. We studied the invasiveness of C. cylindracea on two shallow vermetid platforms with a contrasting ecological status on which C. cylindracea was first detected simultaneously 15 years ago. The cover values of C. cylindracea and the other macroalgal species were assessed for one year, embracing the whole platform width. Caulerpa cylindracea cover was higher on the platform that had a low ecological status, especially during warmer months at the outer seaward margin. The ecological status of the overstory of native species seems to be a key point conditioning the success of C. cylindracea invasiveness on these platforms.

AB In long-lived species, usually with deferred maturity and low release numbers, the success of conservation translocations is especially sensitive to survival and site fidelity during the prolonged establishment phase. Concurrent management actions usually implemented in threatened populations may also influence translocation-related responses. Therefore, the specific performance of translocations should be ideally assessed on vital rates of comparable management groups while accounting for other conservation actions. In this study, we analysed the impact of translocation on the short-term survival and the relative contribution of electrocution on power pylons by comparing translocated and wild-reared radio-tracked juvenile Spanish imperial eagles Aquila adalberti before and after the implementation of further long-term conservation actions of the species and other generic measures in southern Spain. A multi-event multi-state capture-recapture approach accounting for tag retention was applied on a long-term dataset of resightings and dead recoveries throughout the first 2 years after fledging. Survival probability was similar in translocated and contemporary non-translocated eagles, but higher than in wild-reared birds before the generalization of multi-action plans from the 1980s. It was also higher during early dispersal than in the post-fledging dependence period. Although mortality due to electrocution decreased in absolute terms after implementing anti-electrocution measures, its relative contribution as the main mortality source did not differ between translocated and wild-reared birds or between periods (65%). Our results show that when translocations are properly implemented, observed vital rates of released animals can be comparable to those of wild-reared individuals subjected to similar generic management addressing mortality sources. As for any management action, post-release monitoring should play a key role in translocation programmes, with emphasis on comparative studies analysing potential factors affecting survival under active management contexts.

AB Industrial bulk material transfer and handling processes often result in large dust emissions and seriously threaten workers' health. Both dust dispersion and ventilation for dust removal are related to the entrained air flow rate under the particle flow fall process. Based on the air jet theory, this paper presents a model for unconfined and semi-confined particle flow fall processes. Theoretical formulas for the entrained air flow rate were developed, and a numerical simulation was performed to analyze the particle velocity and entrained air under unconfined and semi-confined particle flow fall processes. The results show that as the distance from the particle source to the wall's surface decreases, the particle velocity slightly increases; however, the value of the particle velocity always varies between that of unconfined fall and fall in vacuum. It is found that when the distance of the particle source from the wall's surface s is less than five times the width of the particle source d (s < 5d), the entrained air flow can adhere well to the wall's surface; and when s = 0d, the entrained air flow rate caused by the semi-confined particle flow fall process is minimal and is reduced by 22% compared to that of the unconfined fall.

AB The multiscale nature of ecohydrological processes and feedbacks implies that vegetation patterns arising in water-limited systems are directly linked to water redistribution processes occurring at much shorter timescales than vegetation growth. This in turn suggests that the initially available water in the system can play a role in determining the trajectory of the system, together with the well-known role of the rainfall gradient. This work explores the role of initial hydrological conditions on vegetation dynamics and vegetation patterns. To do so, the HilleRisLambers-Rietkerk model was solved with different rainfall amounts and a large range of initial hydrological conditions spanning from near-equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium conditions. The resulting vegetation patterns and ecohydrological signatures were quantitatively studied. The results show that not only do initial hydrological conditions play a role in the ecohydrological dynamics but also they can play a dominating one even resulting in divergent vegetation patterns that exhibit convergent mean-field properties, including a new set of hybrid patterns. Our results highlight the relevance of assessing both global ecological and hydrological signatures and quantitatively assessing patterns to describe and understand system dynamics and in particular to determine if the systems are transient or steady. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the trajectories the system follows during its transient stages cannot be neglected to understand complex dependencies of the long-term steady state to environmental factors and drivers.

AB Shrubs create heterogeneity in resource availability, yet the influences of shrub age and size on these conditions in semiarid ecosystems is largely unknown. In order to inform restoration and conservation efforts in global shrub-steppe ecosystems that are currently imperiled, we assessed plant age-size relationships within an Artemisia tridentata stand in southern Idaho, USA, and examined the dependence of 2 resources, soil water content (SWC) and light at the soil surface (photosynthetically active radiation [PAR]), on size of individual plants in understory and interspace microsites. Results included a positive relationship between shrub age and size, a median shrub age of 19 years old, and shrub sizes that varied by more than 3 orders of magnitude (i.e., 0.001 m(3) to 1 m(3)). Across this broad range in stand structure, PAR was significantly lower in understory than in interspace microsites, and it declined slightly with increasing shrub volume. Similarly, SWC declined faintly with shrub volume, but understory and interspace microsites did not differ. These findings indicate that resource heterogeneity created by shrubs is potentially dependent on shrub size within this ecosystem, and that variation in stand structure directly influenced resource heterogeneity between understory and interspace microsites. We suggest that routine monitoring of heterogeneity in stand structure could serve as a valuable indicator to assess site suitability for restoration activities and to make quantitative comparisons among sites to prioritize conservation efforts.

AB Riverbed terracing has been introduced in ancient times to retain water and soil, to reduce hydrological connectivity and erosion and to increase primary and secondary productivity of agro-ecological systems. These presently abandoned human-made landscapes have become novel ecosystems and a potential source of ecosystem services to humans in drylands. We use a mathematical-modeling approach to study factors that regulate terraced riverbeds and affect community and ecosystem attributes such as productivity, functional diversity and resilience to droughts. We introduce a model that captures the relationships between rainfall pattern, runoff coupling between adjacent terraces, and vegetation growth, taking into account competition for water and light. We found that a large number of weak rainfall events results in lower total biomass and functional diversity across the terraced riverbed compared with a few strong rainfall events. We further analyzed the filtering of species traits from pools of functional groups that make different tradeoffs between investment in above-ground biomass to capture canopy resources and investment in below-ground biomass to capture soil resources. Pools characterized by concave tradeoffs give rise to higher functional diversity, lower biomass production and lower resilience to droughts, as compared with convex pools. New empirical studies are needed to test these model predictions.

AB Cities are the keystone landscape features for achieving sustainability locally, regionally, and globally. With the increasing impacts of urban expansion eminent, policymakers have encouraged researchers to advance or invent methods for managing coupled human-environmental systems associated with local and regional sustainable development planning. Although progress has been made, there remains no universal instrument for attaining sustainability on neither regional nor local planning scales. Previous sustainable urbanization studies have revealed that landscape configuration metrics can supplement other measures of urban well-being, yet few have been included in public data dashboards or contrasted against local well-being indicators. To advance this sector of sustainable development planning, this study had three main intentions: (1) to produce a foundational suite of landscape ecology metrics from the 2007 land cover dataset for the City of Toronto; (2) to visualize and interpret spatial patterns of neighborhood streetscapepatch cohesion index (COHESION), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and four Wellbeing Toronto indicators across the 140 Toronto neighborhoods; (3) to quantitatively assess the global collinearity and local explanatory power of the well-being and landscape measures showcased in this study. One-hundred-and-thirty landscape ecology metrics were computed: 18 class configuration metrics across seven land cover categories and four landscape diversity metrics. Anselin Moran's I-test was used to illustrate significant spatial patterns of well-being and landscape indicators; Pearson's correlation and conditional autoregressive (CAR) statistics were used to evaluate relationships between them. Spatial "hot-spots" and/or "cold-spots" were found in all streetscapevariables. Among other interesting results, Walk Score (R) was negatively related to both tree canopy and grass/shrub connectedness, signifying its lack of consideration for the quality of ecosystem services and environmental public health-and subsequently happiness-during its proximity assessment of socioeconomic amenities. In sum, landscape ecology metrics can provide cost-effective ecological integrity addendum to existing and future urban resilience, sustainable development, and well-being monitoring programs.

AB Energy requirements of an animal are size dependent and, in this study, the average daily metabolic rate (ADMR) of six Negev Desert gerbilline rodents, ranging in body mass (m(b)) from 10 g to over 200 g, scaled to m(b)(0.57). Although gerbilline rodents are considered 'granivores', these rodents consume substantial amounts of green vegetation and the largest gerbil is a strict herbivore. We predicted that the lengths of the compartments of the digestive tract would scale allometrically to mb(0.33) and that ADMR would scale allometrically to the lengths of the compartments to the exponent of 1.73. Using log-transformed data, the length of the colon scaled to m(b)(0.50) = 0.74; p = 0.02), of the caecum to m(b)(0.45) = 0.80; p = 0.01) and of the small intestine to m(b)(0.30) = 0.59; p < 0.05). Therefore, the exponents for the colon and caecum were higher than predicted and were close to the exponent for ADMR generated for the rodents. The absolute lengths of the colon (r(adj)(2) = 0.68; p = 0.03; slope = 0.99) and of the caecum (r(adj)(2) = 0.79; p = 0.01; slope = 1.19) were related significantly to ADMR, but of the small intestine was not (r(adj)(2) = 0.04; p = 0.33; slope = 0.85). The exponents implied that the relationships were isometric and not allometric as predicted and that the rates of increase of the lengths of the intestine compartments were at the same rate as the increase in ADMR. The lengths of the colon and caecum were highly correlated between each other (r(adj)(2 )= 0.98; p < 0.001; slope = 1.12) and explained most of the variation in ADMR. Green vegetation could be a nutritional bottleneck for rodents as it is bulky and, consequently, limits the dietary intake, and fermentation occurs in the caecum and colon, whereas seeds, which are compact and are digested in the small intestine, would limit intake to a much lesser degree. However, when the effect of body mass was eliminated by using residuals of the variables on body mass, only the length of the small intestine was significant (r(adj)(2) = 0.86; p < 0.005; slope = -1.33) and was related negatively to ADMR. Therefore, when effects of body size were removed, most of the variation in ADMR was explained by the length of the small intestine and implied that the length of the small intestine increased with a decrease in ADMR. A higher energy expenditure was related to a shorter small intestine and, therefore, by implication, a higher concentration of metabolizable energy yield of the diet. We also questioned whether there are differences in the morphology of the digestive tract due to differences in dietary consumption. The digestive tracts of the gerbils were not diverse and could be characterized as structurally homogenous. All the gerbils had a uni-locular, hemiglandular stomach and the differences in the digestive tract among species did not seem to be of functional importance, but rather were related to the taxon. However, some important morpho-functional characteristics of the digestive tract emerged that apply to the whole group.

AB The sand viper Cerastes vipera can employ one of two distinct foraging modes, the widely foraging or sit-and-wait mode, depending on the interplay between external and internal factors. Here, I illustrate how tracking methods can be used to evaluate the relative usage of each of the two foraging modes by the sand viper. Foraging theory models generally refer to the time invested in foraging as the main indicator of the energy invested in foraging. I suggest that tracking and counting print marks on trails offer a more precise method of estimating foraging costs in the field. I model the benefits and costs of the viper employing each of the two foraging modes using tracking data, and discuss how it can be used to decipher its foraging mode. I present a measurement approach by which to assess the relative usage of different foraging modes. I contend that the proposed tracking methods and their analysis should prove to be equally applicable to other animals that leave print marks on sand or snow.

AB Vermetid reefs are distinctive bioconstructions of the Mediterranean and other warm temperate and subtropical seas. In the Iberian Peninsula the vermetid endemism Dendropoma lebeche Templado et al., 2016 and the coralline alga Neogoniolithon brassica-florida (Harvey) Setchell & Mason are the main biogenic engineers of this natural heritage. However, very few empirical studies deal with their early patterns of succession. We installed two sets of colonization plates in spring (May) and autumn (November) along a healthy vermetid reef on the island Nueva Tabarca (Alicante, SE Iberian Peninsula), to study the early succession patterns of assemblages. Taxonomic composition and the Shannon diversity index were considered over a 1-2 year period. The seasonal month of installation had a detectable effect on taxonomic composition during the first nine months of immersion, also conditioning the diversity pattern. The succession proceeded faster for the May installation set, where both engineering species showed higher cover values from the beginning. Even though there was hardly any three-dimensional accretion on the plates during this study, those that remained well over a year reached Dendropoma densities close to those reported for healthy Mediterranean vermetid reefs. The use of colonization plates as recruitment enhancers could be a potential tool for restoration procedures, because of the minor impact of their installation and the relatively short time required to achieve high vermetid densities.

AB Conservation translocation projects must carefully balance multiple, potentially competing objectives (e.g. population viability, retention of genetic diversity, delivery of key ecological services) against conflicting stakeholder values and severe time and cost constraints. Advanced decision support tools would facilitate identifying practical solutions. We examined how to achieve compromise across competing objectives in conservation translocations via an examination of giant tortoises in the Galapagos Islands with ancestry from the extinct Floreana Island species (Chelonoidis niger). Efforts have begun to populate Floreana Island with tortoises genetically similar to its historical inhabitants while balancing three potentially competing objectives - restoring ecosystem services (sustaining a high tortoise population size), maximizing genome representation of the extinct C. niger species and maintaining a genetically diverse population - under realistic cost constraints. We developed a novel approach to this conservation decision problem by coupling an individual-based simulation model with generalized additive models and global optimization. We identified several incompatibilities among programme objectives, with quasi-optimal single-objective solutions (sets of management actions) differing substantially in programme duration, translocation age, incubation temperature (determinant of sex ratio) and the number of individuals directly translocated from the source population. Quasi-optimal single-objective solutions were able to produce outcomes (i.e. population size and measures of genetic diversity and C. niger genome representation) to within 75% of their highest simulated outcomes (e.g. highest population size achieved across all simulations) within a cost constraint of c. $2m USD, but these solutions resulted in severe declines (up to 74% reduction) in outcomes for non-focal objectives. However, when all programme objectives were equally weighted to produce a multi-objective solution, all objectives were met to within 90% of the highest achievable mean values across all cost constraints. Synthesis and applications. Multi-objective conservation translocations are likely to encounter complex trade-offs and conflicts among programme objectives. Here, we developed a novel combination of modelling approaches to identify optimal management strategies. We found that solutions that simultaneously addressed multiple, competing objectives performed better than single-objective solutions. Our model-based decision support tool demonstrates that timely, cost-effective solutions can be identified in cases where management objectives appear to be incompatible.

AB Poor swimming performance and low hypoxia tolerance have been suggested as the main reasons for the dramatic decrease in the wild population of Chinese sucker. The present study aimed to investigate the potential for exercise training to enhance swimming performance and hypoxia tolerance in this fish species targeted for stocking enhancement. Fish were exercise trained (force to swim against a flow) once daily, twice daily or not exercise trained for 20 d and then detrained for 10 d (a period of nontraining). Training showed no significant effect on anaerobic swimming performance.. The fish from both training groups showed lower hypoxia tolerance and a lower survival rate under predation. Thus, the present study suggested thatexercise training showed little effect or even a negative effect on physiological function in Chinese sucker, and the forced training might not be the proper protocol to apply for improving the stocking enhancement of Chinese sucker..

AB Rodents play an important role in rangelands through the engineering of extensive burrow systems, which provides key habitats for many animal and plant species. We have analyzed the long-term variation in the abundance and distribution of rodent burrows in grazing ecosystems of southern Russia (Kalmykia) under the landscape change from desert to steppe caused by the drastic reduction of livestock after the collapse of the USSR in the early 1990s. We conducted burrow surveys in the "desert" (1980) and "steppe" (2017) periods on 19 3-km transects. We found considerable changes in burrow abundance and distribution, as well as evidence of desert habitat fragmentation and isolation caused by the expansion of tall-grass communities. Burrows of the open-dwelling diurnal ground squirrel (Spermophilus pygmaeus), the dominant and the keystone species during the "desert" period, almost completely disappeared from the rodent burrow network by 2017, indicating significant habitat loss. In contrast, the burrows of the folivorous social vole (Microtus socialis) which was rare in the 1980s, became abundant and ubiquitously distributed. The burrow density of the desert-dwelling psammophilous midday gerbil (Meriones meridianus) decreased, while the distances between occupied patches increased, indicating desert habitat fragmentation and loss of population connectivity. Burrows of the folivorous tamarisk gerbils (M. tamariscinus) were recorded only sporadically in both 1980 and 2017. The observed changes in the rodent burrow network, the key component of grazing ecosystems, correlate with rodent species ecology and can have long-term and important consequences for ecosystem functioning.

   MANAGEMENT; CONSEQUENCES
AB In temperate ecosystems, fire management involving prescribed burning and wildfire suppression often causes a shift in fire season from hot and dry summer conditions to cooler, moister conditions in spring or autumn. The effects of this change on seed dispersal by wind after fire are unknown. However, calmer wind conditions and increased standing vegetation after fires in cooler seasons may reduce seed dispersal following fire. We studied seed dispersal in different seasons for a serotinous obligate-seeder, Callitris verrucosa, growing in a semi-arid environment in South Australia. We measured primary (wind-borne) and secondary (on-ground) seed dispersal during spring, summer and autumn, using empirical observations and modelling based on detailed measurement of wind characteristics. At comparable horizontal wind speeds, primary dispersal was greater in summer compared to spring and autumn. Secondary dispersal was similarly short in all three seasons when vegetation cover was high, but when cover was low, seeds travelled much further in summer than in the other two seasons. A shift in the seasonal timing of seed release can decrease dispersal distances of serotinous obligate seeders, which is likely to reduce gene flow and the ability to colonise new sites. This can lead to changes in population and community structures which may further affect fire patterns. These findings could be applicable to other serotinous obligate seeding plant species found in other families such as Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, Pinaceae and Cupressaceae.

AB Ecosystems may be characterized by a complex dynamical behaviour where external disturbances and/or internal perturbations may trigger sudden/irreversible changes, called catastrophic shifts. Simple mathematical models in the form of ordinary and/or partial differential equations have been proposed to approximate in a qualitatively manner the observed complex phenomena, where catastrophic shifts are determined by bifurcation points. In this work, we show that in ecosystems, gradual/smooth changes may be transformed in sudden/catastrophic shifts as a consequence of codimension-2 bifurcations. We stress the importance of using the full arsenal of numerical bifurcation theory to systematically identify and characterize criticalities in ecological models in the 2D parameter space. For our demonstrations, we revisit the analysis of a simple model of a forest-grassland mosaic ecosystem constructing the 2D bifurcation diagram with respect to the impact of human influence and that of natural causes. Our numerical analysis reveals that this simple model is able to approximate both abrupt (catastrophic) and smooth transitions as the system undergoes Bautin bifurcations.

AB The principles and theory of landscape ecology can be used with careful spatial planning to maintain ecosystem function and services in the face of urbanisation and agricultural intensification of the rangelands. In the largely undisturbed catchment of Darwin harbour in Northern Australia, an area of cattle grazing, some agriculture and small urban areas, seasonally waterlogged grassy valley floors known as dambos are demonstrated to be of vital importance for the minimisation of fine sediment transport to the harbour. If the dambos are disturbed fine sediment from them will have potentially detrimental effects on the biodiversity of the upper harbour and may also add pollutants contained in the fine sediment. The incorporation of such important landscape features into landscape planning in rangelands worldwide is critical to the creation of sustainable future landscapes. Techniques that monitor condition and function of the landscape coupled with spatially informed design are able to assist in preserving the important ecosystem services that natural features can provide and thus have a significant contribution to make in landscape sustainability.

AB Fecundity in female primates is influenced by the nutritional condition. If when translocated howler monkeys exhibit the same breeding patterns as non-translocated members of the same genus, it is an indication that the translocated monkeys have become well adapted to their release site and that they are likely in good nutritional condition. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate this pattern by recording copulations (over 5years) and births (over 7years) after the translocation of a pair of black-and-gold howler monkeys (Alouatta caraya) and to evaluate their gestation period, seasonality of births, and intervals between births. The pair was released in November 2009 on the campus of the University of SAo Paulo in RibeirAo Preto, SAo Paulo State, Brazil. Data on copulations were collected from January 2010 to March 2011 and from January 2012 to December 2014. Births were collected from January 2010 to December 2016. During the 5-year observation period, 25 copulations were recorded. Seven births were recorded over a period of 7years, which included reproduction of the offspring of the translocated pair. Births occurred in the dry season between April and August. The interval between births was approximately 1year. Our data provide insight into the reproduction of howler monkeys that have been translocated to a new habitat. Translocation can provide a valuable approach for rescuing or restoring Alouatta, whose populations have been detrimentally impacted by long-term habitat fragmentation.

AB We propose the idea of phenotype diffusion, which is a rapid convergence of an observed trait in some human and animal populations. The words phenotype and diffusion both imply observations independent of mechanism as phenotypes are observed traits with multiple possible genetic mechanisms and diffusion is an observed state of being widely distributed. Recognizing shared changes in phenotype in multiple species does not by itself reveal a particular mechanism such as a shared exposure, shared adaptive need, particular stochastic process or a transmission pathway. Instead, identifying phenotype diffusion suggests the mechanism should be explored to help illuminate the ways human and animal health are connected and new opportunities for optimizing these links. Using the plurality of obesity epidemics across multiple species as a prototype for shared changes in phenotype, the goal of this review was to explore eco-evolutionary theories that could inform further investigation. First, evolutionary changes described by hologenome evolution, pawnobe evolution, transposable element (TE) thrust and the drifty gene hypothesis will be discussed within the context of the selection asymmetries among human and animal populations. Secondly, the ecology of common source exposures (bovine milk, xenohormesis and obesogens), niche evolution and the hygiene hypothesis will be summarized. Finally, we synthesize these considerations. For example, many agricultural breeds have been aggressively selected for weight gain, microbiota (e.g., adenovirus 36, toxoplasmosis) associated with (or infecting) these breeds cause experimental weight gain in other animals, and these same microbes are associated with human obesity. We propose applications of phenotype diffusion could include zoonotic biosurveillance, biocontainment, antibiotic stewardship and environmental priorities. The One Health field is focused on the connections between the health of humans, animals and the environment, and so identification of phenotype diffusion is highly relevant for practitioners (public health officials, physicians and veterinarians) in this field.

AB Patterns of geographic variation in body size are predicted to evolve as adaptations to local environmental gradients. However, many of these clinal patterns in body size, such as Bergmann's rule, are controversial and require further investigation into ectotherms such as reptiles on a regional scale. To examine the environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, topography and primary productivity) that shaped patterns of geographic variation in body size in the reptile Calotes versicolor, we sampled 180 adult specimens (91 males and 89 females) at 40 locations across the species range in China. The MANOVA results suggest significant sexual size dimorphism in C. versicolor (F-23,F-124 = 11.32, p < .001). Our results showed that C. versicolor failed to fit the Bergmann's rule. We found that the most important predictors of variation in body size of C. versicolor differed for males and females, but mechanisms related to heat balance and water availability hypotheses were involved in both sexes. Temperature seasonality, precipitation of the driest month, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the driest quarter were the most important predictors of variation in body size in males, whereas mean precipitation of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the wettest month were most important for body size variation in females. The discrepancy between patterns of association between the sexes suggested that different selection pressures may be acting in males and females.

AB Cost of reproduction is associated with a reduction in subsequent survival or future breeding success. A decrease in survival rate of parents during or after reproduction reduces the probability of their future reproduction. However, few studies have demonstrated such survival costs to parents. Females of Armadillidium vulgare hold their eggs in a marsupium and brood these until the young hatch. Caring for eggs in a marsupium seems to place a large burden on brooding females, and it restricts their predator avoidance behaviour. As such, costs of care may increase the mortality rates of brooding females. To reveal the costs of parental care, we examined the effects of egg brooding on behaviour and predation risk. Egg-brooding females decreased speed of locomotion and rolling duration, and were killed by predators at a higher rate. Our results indicate that egg brooding in A.vulgare has costs in the form of predation risk.

ID RESTORATION
AB Ecosystem management in South Korea dramatically changed in the early 1970s, shifting from historical utilization of natural resources to a strong management system that included forest promotion and restoration. The socio-economic and biological context underpinning this effort and the ecological consequences of this new policy have not been studied in South Korea. We analyzed landscape dynamics over a 90-year period (1918-2005), with particular attention to forest soil erosion, by using historical map and satellite images in Pohang. Our analysis revealed a dramatic increase in total vegetation cover (from 10,006.9 ha in 1918 to 17,868.7 ha in 2005) and an increase in the developed area. Meanwhile, the amount of barren mountainous area declined, shrub vegetation almost completely disappeared from the given area, and the salt marsh in the estuary completely disappeared. Mean soil loss declined from 12.6 ton ha(-1) year(-1) in 1973 to 0.2 ton ha(-1) year(-1) in 2005. A gradual landscape simplification occurred during the 90-year period. Socio-economic changes were the most important factor contributing to forest growth in South Korea. Various biological factors, including the absence of apex consumers due to their local extinction in the late 20th century, likely accounted for the rapid landscape transition. The new land management policy in South Korea resulted in the emergence of a forest ecosystem that is novel to this region and differs markedly from the historical environment, with a changed spatial arrangement of landscape elements and species assemblages.

   DETERMINANTS; CONSTRAINTS; MAINTENANCE; EXTINCTION
AB Trait-based theories of biodiversity consider interspecific tradeoffs among species-specific traits as prerequisites to maintaining community evenness, a component of species diversity. Such tradeoffs are commonly observed in plant communities, particularly in relation to traits associated with resistance to herbivory. Indeed, global experiments show that interspecific tradeoffs are common between plant defense and growth or competitive ability; however, the positive effects of herbivory on plant diversity predicted by theories with trait-based tradeoffs are far less commonly observed. Moreover, both the overall and relative importance of these tradeoffs in promoting plant diversity are not well known. To disentangle the relationships among growth, competition, and defense in relation to plant community evenness, we built a model that describes the effects of a shared herbivore on two plant species with the potential to differ in each of these traits. While tradeoffs between plant defense and growth or competitive ability can increase plant diversity via evenness, this is not always the case nor is it a requirement for increased diversity. Herbivores may increase plant diversity even in the absence of defensive tradeoffs, preferentially consuming apparently maladapted species, by limiting the negative effects of interspecific interactions. Therefore, the importance of defensive tradeoffs in increasing diversity may not be as important, or as straightforward, as previously hypothesized.

AB Current models of vegetation pattern formation rely on a system of weakly nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations that are coupled by their source terms. While these equations, which are used to describe a spatiotemporal planar evolution of biomass and soil water, qualitatively capture the emergence of various types of vegetation patterns in arid environments, they are phenomenological and have a limited predictive power. We ameliorate these limitations by deriving the vertically averaged Richards' equation to describe flow (as opposed to "diffusion") of water in partially saturated soils. This establishes conditions under which this nonlinear equation reduces to its weakly nonlinear reaction-diffusion counterpart used in the previous models, thus relating their unphysical parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficient) to the measurable soil properties (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) used to parameterize the Richards equation. Our model is valid for both flat and sloping landscapes and can handle arbitrary topography and boundary conditions. The result is a model that relates the environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation rate, runoff and soil properties) to formation of multiple patterns observed in nature (such as stripes, labyrinth and spots).

AB Reintroducing native wildlife populations is a common conservation-management approach aimed at reducing the threat of extinction and restoring ecosystem function. Captive-born individuals are sometimes used in reintroductions, but the effectiveness of this strategy is poorly understood due to insufficient post-reintroduction monitoring and evaluation. Our objective was to evaluate the utility of using captive-born individuals of an endangered rodent, the Perdido Key beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus trissyllepsis) to reestablish a population on the western end of Perdido Key at Gulf State Park, Alabama, from which it was extirpated in 1997. We released 48 captive-born mice in March 2010 and monitored the population through livetrapping across 8 sessions spanning 5 years. We evaluated temporal changes in microsatellite genetic diversity to determine whether mice born in the wild were derived from released mice. The number of mice declined by 73% to 13 individuals in the first 2 weeks after release but increased to an estimated 206 (95% confidence interval = 195-217) individuals after 5 years. Genetic monitoring demonstrated a slight decrease in diversity during the first 3 months but an increase by year 5. Admixture from a neighboring population was detected in year 2 and year 5, which corresponded to the largest increase in population size between trapping sessions. This change in abundance corresponded with a doubling of Ne/N signifying a possible role of admixture in population growth and resilience. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using captive-born beach mice to reestablish populations when wild populations are too small to serve as donors for a translocation. We could not, however, discern how gene flow from an expanding neighboring population affected growth or persistence of the reintroduced population. Our study emphasizes that in future reintroductions, genetics should be monitored together with demographic patterns, because cryptic gene flow could affect how we interpret reintroduction success.

AB Recent changes in the Earth's climate have been linked to changes in phenology, geographic distributions, and morphology of species, and warming temperatures associated with climate change have been predicted to result in decreases in avian body sizes. We examined changes in wing length and fat-free mass of 34,844 fall migrants from 31 neotropical migratory species captured at Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland between 1980 and 2012. Body size changes varied across species, but wing length and fat-free mass increased significantly over time in the pooled sample of all species. Magnitudes of change were small and similar to other studies, with mean wing length increasing 0.55% and mean fat-free mass increasing 1.30% across all species. General morphological changes at our site differed from those at a banding station located 235 km away. Across species, changes in wing length were weakly correlated between stations, and changes in fat-free mass were uncorrelated. Populations of some species showed opposite morphological changes, demonstrating that morphological changes can vary regionally. Over short time scales, factors other than climate might drive observed changes in body size of neotropical migrants, and alternative hypotheses for body size changes should be considered.

AB The weathering of silicate in the world's critical-zone (rock-soil interface) is a natural mechanism providing a feedback on atmospheric CO2 concentrations through the carbonate-silicate cycle. We examined culturable bacterial communities from a critical-zone in western Iceland to determine the optimum growth temperature and their ability to solubilize phosphate-containing minerals, which are abundant within the critical-zone area examined here. The majority of isolated bacteria were able to solubilize mineral-state phosphate. Almost all bacterial isolates were mesophilic (growth optima of 20-45 degrees C), despite critical-zone temperatures that were continuously below 15 degrees C, although all isolates could grow at temperatures associated with the critical-zone (-2.8-13.1 degrees C). Only three isolates were shown to have thermal optima for growth that were within temperatures experienced at the critical-zone. These findings show that the bacteria that inhabit the western Icelandic critical-zone have temperature growth optima suboptimally adapted to their environment, implying that other adaptations may be more important for their long-term persistance in this environment. Moreover, our study showed that the cold basaltic critical-zone is a region of active phosphate mineral-weathering.

AB We study localized states in the Swift-Hohenberg equation when time-periodic parametric forcing is introduced. The presence of a time-dependent forcing introduces a new characteristic time which creates a series of resonances with the depinning time of the fronts bounding the localized pattern. The organization of these resonances in parameter space can be understood using appropriate asymptotics. A number of distinct canard trajectories involved in the observed transitions is constructed.

AB The basic features of the Naghamish Basin and agro-ecosystem in the North West Coastal Zone of Egypt (climate, soils and vegetation cover) are mapped to analyse the wear and tear of physical components of the environment of three tribes' territories between 2006 and 2011 when a dry spell struck. Our land use mapping and results using RS and GIS indicate considerable and quick changes in the agricultural and biotic components in spite of an inter-annual long-term rainfall variability appearing standard for this low-rainfall desert region. After good rainy years (1985-1995), the impact of the following drought (1996-2011) perceived by the farmer and Bedouin communities is real and confirmed by our land cover mapping changes of the Nagamish watershed. The communities are correct in their perception of the drought and are deeply affected in their economy and social life.

AB Swim performance is considered a main fitness-determining trait in many aquatic organisms. Swimming is generally the only way most aquatic prey can escape predation, and swimming capacity is directly linked to food capture, habitat shifts, and reproduction. Therefore, evolutionary studies of swim performance are important to understand adaptation to aquatic environments. Most studies, however, concentrate on the importance of burst-swim responses to predators, and little is known about its effect on endurance. Even fewer studies associate differences in organism swim capabilities to key gender-specific responses. In this experiment, we assess the gender-specific genetic basis of swimming endurance among four different populations of Trinidadian guppies adapted to different predation regimes. Our results show that second-generation common-garden females adapted to a low-predation environment show longer swim endurance than fish adapted to a high-predation environment. We also find an expected effect of lowered swimming endurance during pregnancy, but interestingly, it did not matter whether the females were in advanced stages of pregnancy, which severely changes body morphology, versus mid-pregnancy. Males did not show the same trends across populations, and overall had lower swim endurances than female fish combined even when accounting for size differences. Populations recently transplanted from high- to low-predation environments showed similar endurance to natural low-predation environments in one population but not the other. This study highlights the importance of endurance in the adaptation of aquatic organisms to different predation regimes.

AB Abundance and biomass estimates are metrics usually taken for phytoplankton assays. Biomass is a proxy measure today in phytoplankton assays, while relative abundance is broadly used in diatoms investigations and application of ecological indexes. The question is how the two metrics respond to environmental conditions, based on diatoms species composition, in the plankton of lotic system, using the same statistical approach. The investigation was carried out based on monthly plankton sampling in four rivers during an annual cycle in southern Brazil. Relative abundance and relative biomass of diatoms showed distinct responses for each river, and the dominant species according to each metric were different. Relative abundance significantly correlated with seven of the eight physical and chemical variables, while relative biomass did not. Both metrics were appointed to the major diatom species of each river, but biomass showed low statistic robustness. The analysis with higher taxonomic rank (families) yielded more coherent outcomes between the metrics. The results showed that diatom relative abundance is effective to relate the composition to environmental conditions; therefore, the abundance should not be neglected in studies of phytoplankton structure and dynamics, mainly when the diatoms are dominant in the community, and the low taxonomic rank ecological indication is regarded.

AB The aim of this paper is to present a model that permits to assessment the quantitative green space and its costs in the urban. This approach is founded on the modelling of the functions and the corresponding spaces into an orthogonal parcel having a planar form. The elaboration of such as tool is a response to the sustainable urban development that recommends the optimization of land use. The summation of all spaces that compose the parcel defines the surface called plot surface. The green space into the parcel is a correlation of shape and disposition of the plots, and of the number of plots in the Master Plan. The urban composition is characterized by a mathematical system composed by two equations represented respectively by the urban density and the site coverage ratio. This system is indeterminate because there is one unknown: the building footprint; and one correlation: the plot surface. To solving this problem, it is demanded to use loop procedure, and finite difference method that consists to introduce a random value of urban density, then to compare the obtained density with the introduced value. At last, the study finishes by the presentation of graphs illustrating the ratio and the costs of green areas in function with the urban density, and by the showing of the software.

The sciences that have concentrated on deserts include ecology, geomorphology, hydrology, rangeland management, geography, surveying, meteorology and geology, plus many others. In recognition that desert science has surged ahead in the past few decades, we have invited contributors who describe various different desert initiatives. We use these case studies to open up the discussion about how Australians see their desert lands, how this has changed over time and how desert scientists from the rest of the world regard the distinctive desert country in Australia.

AB Self-organizing systems that show processes of pattern formation rely on positive feedback. Especially in swarm systems, positive feedback builds up in a transient phase until maximal positive feedback is reached and the system converges. We investigate alignment in locusts as an example of swarm systems showing time-variant positive feedback. We identify an influencing bias in the spatial distribution of agents compared to a well-mixed distribution and two features, percentage of aligned swarm members and neighborhood size, that allow to model the time variance of feedbacks. We report an urn model that is capable of qualitatively representing all these relevant features. The increase of neighborhood sizes over time enables the swarm to lock in a highly aligned state but also allows for infrequent switching between lock-in states.

AB Cyanobacterial community composition was studied along a salinity gradient from the saline Spring Fuliya towards the water column of Lake Kinneret. The samples included a gradient of salinities ranging from 4270 mg Cl L-1 (Saline Spring) to 239 mg Cl L-1 (Lake Kinneret). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and cloning of the 16 S rRNA gene, as well as cloning and sequencing of the psbA gene, were used to characterize cyanobacterial community composition. Despite the differences in salinity, similar cyanobacterial communities were observed in the lake and the saline spring, the only exception being the highest salinity sample (4270 mg Cl L-1). Both, DGGE patterns and results of the clone libraries revealed the dominance of cyanobacteria with colonial Gloeocapsa and unicellular Synechococcus as the closest known cultured relatives, independently of the salinity. These results suggest that cyanobacterial populations inhabiting this freshwater lake and its saline sources can adapt to a wide range of salinities.

DE Grazing on an interior patch; positive solutions; S-shaped bifurcation

AB We study the positive solutions to the steady state reaction diffusion equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions of the form
   -u" = { lambda[u - 1/K u(2) - c u(2)/1+u(2) ], x is an element of (L, 1- L), lambda[u - 1/K u(2)], x is an element of (0, L) boolean OR (1- L, 1), u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0
   and
   -u" = ( ?[u(u + 1)(b - u)- c u(2)/1+u(2) ], x is an element of (L, 1 - L), lambda[u(u + 1)(b - u)], x is an element of (0, L) boolean OR (1 - L, 1), u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0.
   Here, lambda, b, c,K, and L are positive constants with 0 < L < 1/2 . These types of steady state equations occur in population dynamics; the first model describes logistic growth with grazing, and the second model describes weak Allee effect with grazing. In both cases, u is the population density, 1/lambda is the diffusion coefficient, and c is the maximum grazing rate. These models correspond to the case of symmetric grazing on an interior region. Our goal is to study the existence of positive solutions. Previous studies when the grazing was throughout the domain resulted in S-shaped bifurcation curves for certain parameter ranges. Here, we show that such S-shaped bifurcations occur even if the grazing is confined to the interior. We discuss the results via a modified quadrature method and Mathematica computations.

AB Cultural landscape is a set of values consisting of all the formations, activities, local traditions and customs shaped in due to course as a result of the mutual interaction of the human and the environment. The aim of this study was to determine the cultural landscape values of Lake Sugla (Konya, Turkey) and its surrounding areas, which are rich in cultural values, and to develop a future management approach. In the study, in order to determine the cultural characteristics of the area, a method based on inventory work and the quantification of the data was used. In the study, in view of the assessment of the information forms applied to 34 settlements and expert opinions during the field studies, cultural values (trifle area were determined by twelve criteria. All the settlements were examined in terms of each criterion and given points. As a result of this assessment, Akcapinar, Ahirli, Baliklava, Ciftlikkoy and Kurucay in the study area were determined as the areas that have the highest cultural function. In conclusion, it was proved that stating the cultural landscape elements by quantificating them in terms of certain criteria can he an important source of data in the planning studies that will be done particularly at a sub-regional scale or on districts and village groups.

AB Plants often combine multiple strategies to achieve pollen transfer. The dioecious Clusia nemorosa (Clusiaceae) produces floral resin, a specialized reward for resin-collecting bees. It also exhibits floral automimicry with female flowers mimicking male flowers in order to attract pollen-collecting insects. We observed the hourly visitation frequency and behaviour of bee visitors on two rock savanna sites in French Guiana. The major strategy in pollen transfer and the variation in visitation rates among visitor species were examined. We hypothesized that the visitation rate will vary between the floral sexes and degree of this variation will differ between the two-reward systems. We found no evidence for visits being exclusively related to resin collection, which we expected to be the principal strategy in pollen transfer. Deceit pollination appeared to have minor importance and seemed to be locally associated with the site, where demand for pollen was greater. Flower visits that probably facilitated most pollen transfer, combined resin and pollen. The pollinators involved in this system collected pollen from male flowers and resin from female flowers. The fruit set was not particularly low (44.19%) so offering different rewards by different flower genders has not constrained reproductive success in this system. Pronounced variation in visitation rates between sexes was not related to the pollination mechanisms but to the demand for the two rewards. Overall demand for pollen was greater than demand for resin. Female flowers were visited much less frequently than male flowers. Peak pollen collection occurred in the morning, i.e., as soon as the resource was available, while resin was collected throughout the day. There was a local variability in demand for the two resources because both the visitation rate and the behaviour of foraging bees varied between the two observation sites.

AB The purpose of our study was to investigate the sub-lethal effects of millimeter wave carbon fibers (MWCF), a military obscurant, on filter-feeding freshwater invertebrates. We observed decreased survival, reproduction, and oxygen consumption in Daphnia magna at realistic loading rates. In experiments with the Asiatic clam (Corbicula fluminea), soft tissue dry weight and tissue condition index were not significantly different among control and MWCF exposed treatments; however, using a (15)N labeled alga as food, we observed decreased nitrogen turnover in tissues of clams exposed to MWCF, suggesting lower filtering or ingestion rates. Our findings combined with previous demonstrations of MWCF toxicity to green algae suggest that over a period of several months, bivalve growth may be inhibited, and cladoceran populations may be even more strongly affected by MWCF. Given that these fibers are persistent, further experiments should be conducted to determine the longer-term effects of contamination of water bodies with MWCF. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Ecosystems are complex systems which can respond to gradual changes of their conditions by a sudden shift to a contrasting regime or alternative stable state (ASS). Predicting such critical points before they are reached is extremely difficult and providing early warnings is fundamental to design management protocols for ecosystems. Here we study different spatial versions of popular ecological models which are known to exhibit ASS. The spatial heterogeneity is introduced by a local parameter varying from cell to cell in a regular lattice. Transport of biomass among cells occurs by simple diffusion. We investigate whether different quantities from statistical mechanics-like the variance, the two-point correlation function and the patchiness-may serve as early warnings of catastrophic phase transitions between the ASS. In particular, we find that the patch-size distribution follows a power law when the system is close to the catastrophic transition. We also provide links between spatial and temporal indicators and analyze how the inter play between diffusion and spatial heterogeneity may affect the earliness of each of the observables. Finally, we comment on similarities and differences between these catastrophic shifts and paradigmatic thermodynamic phase transitions like the liquid-vapor change of state for a fluid like water.

AB Stability analysis of the aquatic community is among the most important and complicated fields in modern ecology. Application of statistical approaches and modern automated tools has introduced new operational methods for the comparative analyses of aquatic assemblage structure. While much work has been done on two types of biomass size distributions or size spectra (BSS and NBS), the size-frequency distribution of taxonomic units, called here the traditional taxonomic size spectrum (TTSS), has been given much less attention. The composite size spectrum (CSS) described here compares several types of size structures. Two of them (NBS and TTSS) evidenced consistent patterns for Lake Kinneret phytoplankton. The high similarity level of the discussed patterns was estimated quantitatively by cluster analysis. While typical patterns were evident and consistent even during two extremely abnormal years (1997-1998), the fine structure of all size spectra was susceptible to strong environmental impacts. Several types of size spectra used simultaneously provide more comprehensive information describing community structural change.

AB Specific features in the distribution of plant species differing in their attitude toward thermal conditions have been studied in communities of the present-day timberline ecotone on Mount Iremel' in the Southern Urals. It has been shown that the distribution of such species is characterized by significant spatial nonuniformity. Elevation above sea level, local conditions in habitats located at the same altitudinal level, and specific features of mountain slopes account for 13-84, 5-30, and 0.4-14% of the total variance of test parameters, respectively. The abundance of plants changes nonlinearly along the altitudinal gradient, whereas changes in the species diversity of different plant groups have an almost linear pattern. Marked differences between plant communities with respect to the proportions of species differently responding to changes in thermal conditions have been revealed on all slopes in the upper part of the timberline ecotone, upon transition from the slopes proper to the plateau-like areas of intermontane depressions.

TI Grass grows, the cow eats: a simple grazing systems model with emergent
   properties
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID STABILITY
AB We describe a simple, yet intellectually challenging model of grazing systems that introduces basic concepts in ecology and systems analysis. The practical is suitable for high-school and university curricula with a quantitative orientation, and requires only basic skills in mathematics and spreadsheet use. The model is based on Noy-Meir's (1975) application of predator-prey theory to grazing systems. It comprises two rate functions which capture the essence of all grazing systems: grass growth and animal consumption. For simplicity, both rates are defined as functions of a single state variable - the grass mass per unit area. Superimposition of the two functions over a range of animal densities yields a graphical model with emergent properties of directionality, and with points of equilibrium which may be stable or unstable. In order to extend the model to conditions of seasonal growth, the rates are integrated numerically using a spreadsheet model, for which step-by-step instructions are given. The model output is depicted as three-dimensional surfaces that explore system response to two key management variables. The perspective gained on the complexities and behaviour of such simple systems is usually a rewarding eye-opener.

TI Simulations of random fishing behaviour as an independent validation for
   the effect of active targeting of greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata)
   aggregations
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Although active targeting of abalone aggregations is documented for various species, its impact on large aggregations is poorly understood. As large aggregations make the greatest contribution to reproductive success, yet are vulnerable to exploitation, it is important to understand how targeted fishing impacts aggregation structure. If observed postfishing patterns are equally likely to have occurred in response to more random, nontargeted fishing, then changes in aggregation patterns cannot be directly attributed to aggregation-based targeting behaviour. The effect of targeted fishing on greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata) aggregations was verified by simulating three different levels of "random" fishing behaviour to generate postfishing aggregation frequency distributions. Comparison of the output with postfishing survey distributions suggested that observed aggregation patterns could not have resulted from random search behaviour. The aggregation survey data can therefore be used as a valid basis on which to quantify both fishing behaviour in terms of aggregation-specific catch patterns and the response of aggregations to fishing.

AB The Optimal Foraging Theory predict that an animal should restrict its searching activity to those patches of environment, where the ratio of gain to time and energy spent is maximal. Experimenters usually verify the prediction against the null hypothesis of random activity distribution between patches. As animals always prefer profitable patches to some degree, experimental results can always be interpreted as confirmation of the theory. In opposite to this approach, we put forward the "regularity hypothesis". According to this hypothesis, the finding of a profitable item in some patch makes an animal to stay and test more items within the patch. The readiness to test decreases if the profitability of these items is low, and the animal eventually leaves the patch. It also searches in other patches less carefully. As a result, positive and negative responses to items are repeated by ordered series. In general, this regularity of responses helps animals to choose profitable patches. However, animals may also ignore some profitable patches because of the regularity, so that the behavioural optimazation fails. The regularity hypothesis have been tested in experiment with the search of building material and patch choice by caddisfly larvae. The first of two experimental patches contained egg shell fragments (profitable building material) mixed with a sand (uprofitable). The second patch contained sand only. Larva stayed within the first patch after a shell had been found, so that the probability to find more shells increased. However, larvae started walking after they had found several sand particles. Once starting to walk, they found new shell fragments and tested them, but tended to reject them and eventually leave the patch. Moreover, upon returning to the first patch, larvae also might reject fragments and leave the patch again. Rejections are accounted for by the fact that the duration of testing was too short to identify fragments correctly. As a result, negative responses were repeated to a certain degree independently of the profitability of building material, and the patch choice was not optimal. These results are agreed with the regularity hypothesis. It is argued that the hypothesis can be used as an alternative to the Optimal Foraging Theory.

AB This paper reports experimental and field studies on the cyclopoid Mesocyclops notius from subtropical Lake Donghu close to the Yangtze river. Mesocyclops notius, a dominant crustacean Zooplankter throughout tropical Australia, was previously considered to be endemic to Australia, but recently, Mesocyclops leuckarti in Lake Donghu was re-identified as M. notius. Laboratory culture experiments were conducted to reveal the effect of temperature (15, 20, 25 and 30 degreesC) on the development, growth and reproduction of M. notius. Temperature was inversely related to development times of eggs, nauplii and copepodites, body length and physiological longevity of adults, and brood size. Body length and physiological longevity of females were greater than those of males at the same temperature. No reproduction took place at 15 degreesC. Production and seasonal cycles of M. notius during 1980-1982 were studied at two sampling stations of Lake Donghu. At the mid-lake station, the annual production and production/biomass (P/B) ratio of M. notius varied between 6.0 and 18.0 g dry wt m(-2) year(-1) and 74.6 and 95.5, respectively. Mesocyclops notius reached their highest density peaks in the warm months (July-October), with a maximum density of 1256 individuals l(-1) at a littoral site. No reproduction and recruitment by AL notius took place during the cold months (December March) when the temperature of the lake water was < 15 degreesC. Mesocyclops notius were more abundant at a littoral station than at a pelagic station, possibly due to different food availability. The higher male:female sex ratio of M. notius at the littoral station was most likely caused by size-selective fish predation on larger females.

AB In this crucial transition stage from the industrial to the global post-industrial information-rich society, transdisciplinary, mission-oriented landscape ecology in cooperation with other transdisciplinary environmental sciences could play an important role in diverting the trajectory of bifurcations from leading to further rural landscape degradation and extinction towards sustained biological and cultural evolution and opening thereby the way for symbiotic relations between human society and nature. For this purpose, the threatening trends of urbanization, fragmentation, homogenization and pollution, leading to biological, cultural and scenic impoverishment, have to be overcome by establishing a proper balance between productive and rich natural, seminatural and agricultural biosphere landscapes and healthy and livable rural, and urban-industrial technosphere landscapes. Their structural and functional integration into a coherent matrix of Total Human Ecosystem landscapes can be ensured only by comprehensive land-use planning, environmental management and sustainable development. The role of landscape ecologists in this porcess is summarized by ten major "commandments".

AB Animals' associative learning plays a crucial role in many intraspecific or interspecific interactions, involving an animal's use of information on its interacting counterparts. Here, we present a theoretical model that captures the basic features of an animal's associative learning, which may involve generalization, for a simplest case of warning signals. Specifically: we derive formulae for the average level of associative memory as functions of a few parameters that reflect the population density of prey, predator's efficiency of prey detection, and the properties of predator's associative learning, including generalization and memory decay. This average level of associative memory is of central importance in determining prey's fitness and, thus, the evolution of warning signals (i.e. aposematism). The derived formula also shows that another species with similar signal enhances the fitness of an aposematic species of concern as long as their signal is similar enough for generalization to occur. The model developed here can be extended to more complicated cases and the basic idea can be applied to modeling other interactions involving associative learning with generalization.

AB A submarine pipeline, constructed in 1997-1998 to provide water to Redang Island, Malaysia traverses an area covered with corals. Biological studies were conducted before and following pipeline construction to monitor the changes in the biota at selected sites. Benthic invertebrates (including corals) were used as monitoring tools. Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA macroinvertebrates in pre- and post-construction analyses revealed that there was no significant difference in total abundance of sessile periods. Student's t-test revealed that there was a significant difference in mean of live coral coverage during pre and post-construction periods. There was no apparent change in total numbers of macroinvertebrates. Our results suggest only short-term impacts and recovery of the benthic community.

AB In this paper aspects of knowledge generation and administration concerning management of a rural enterprise in the Argentine Chaco region are analyzed, The deterioration of natural resources and human living conditions show that forest-cattle interaction and the ecological economics of the system are poorly understood or not properly taken into account. A methodological solution to a typical decision-making problem is proposed here and illustrated by a worked example extracted from a real feasibility study. The introduction provides a summary of the natural history and of the human interventions in the region. Arguments on the role of silvopastoral systems in reverting forest and soil degradation into sustainable productive undertakings are also exposed, The mathematical treatment of the problem follows a system theoretic approach, A basic nonlinear model for the dynamics is designed first. Its simplest version includes three state variables (livestock units, forest biomass and forage availability) and two manipulated variables (percentage of female calves sold each year and percentage of the cows that did not give birth during the past period and went for sale), States and controls are related by coupled differential-difference equations. Selected results from simulation are shown, Foundations are also laid for taking into account impulsional controls (selective and massive wood extractions, forage implantation, cattle additions and sales). The objective function reflects sustainable development principles, It evaluates the process in terms of usual economics and introduces ecological components of the management strategy, The total cost is expressed as the accumulation of net expenses made for a fixed number of years, minus the sale value of the firm at the end, Then a dynamic programming scheme is developed for finding optimal trajectories with respect to the basic setup, Shadow prices for the states are derived from the solution. Progress towards the building of a decision support system with the preceding elements is reported.

AB Diversity of rodent species was studied in relation to the abundance of grass vegetation, projection cover of arboreal and semi-arboreal vegetation, and mechanical soil composition in the Kyzyl Kum desert (Bukhara district, Uzbekistan) and in the Chihuahua desert (Bolson de Mapimi, Durango, Mexico), Species diversity indices for rodent communities in l-hectare plots significantly varied in both deserts in similar environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the obtained data agree with the data on the hill-shaped relationship between species diversity and productivity of the environment. Stepwise regression analysis of the linear component links suggests that the abundance of grass and the projection cover of arboreal and semi-arboreal perennials, rather than the type of soil surface, exert a significant influence on the diversity of rodent species. At a given projection cover of arboreal and semi-arboreal plants (or an abundance of grass), the diversity of rodent species in Bukhara decreases with an increase in grass abundance (or projection cover of arboreal and semi-arboreal plants). By contrast, in Mapimi the diversity increases. The difference is probably due to both specific environmental conditions and particular fauna genesis.

AB The present study identifies 18 vegetation groups associated with the distribution of Thymelaea hirsuta (an evergreen desert shrub) in six types of habitat (coastal ridge overlain by calcareous dunes, inland ridges, saline depressions, non-saline depressions, inland plateau with skeletal soils, and inland siliceous deposits) in the western Mediterranean region of Egypt. Five of these groups are dominated or codominated with T. hirsuta (2 on the ridges, 2 in the depressions and 1 in the inland plateau). The effective complexes of soil variables in the phytosociological behaviour of this plant are calcareous sedimentation and fertility on the ridges, salinity in the depressions, and siliceous sedimentation and salinity on the inland plateau. Although it tolerates wide environmental gradients, it does not perform best at their extremes.

AB Vegetation responses to variation in climate are a current research priority in the context of accelerated shifts generated by climate change. However, the interactions between environmental and biological factors still represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future scenarios, since the relationship between drivers and ecosystem responses has a complex and nonlinear nature. We aimed to develop a model to study the veg-etation's primary productivity dynamic response to temporal variations in climatic conditions as measured by rainfall, temperature and radiation. Thus, we propose a new way to estimate the vegetation response to climate via a non-autonomous version of a classical growth curve, with a time-varying growth rate and carrying capacity parameters according to climate variables. With a Sequential Monte Carlo Estimation to account for complexities in the climate-vegetation relationship to minimize the number of parameters. The model was applied to six key sites identified in a previous study, consisting of different arid and semiarid rangelands from North Patagonia, Argentina. For each site, we selected the time series of MODIS NDVI, and climate data from ERA5 Copernicus hourly reanalysis from 2000 to 2021. After calculating the time series of the a posteriori distribution of pa-rameters, we analyzed the explained capacity of the model in terms of the linear coefficient of determination and the parameters distribution variation. Results showed that most rangelands recorded changes in their sensitivity over time to climatic factors, but vegetation responses were heterogeneous and influenced by different drivers. Differences in this climate-vegetation relationship were recorded among different cases: (1) a marginal and decreasing sensitivity to temperature and radiation, respectively, but a high sensitivity to water availability; (2) high and increasing sensitivity to temperature and water availability, respectively; and (3) a case with an abrupt shift in vegetation dynamics driven by a progressively decreasing sensitivity to water availability, without any changes in the sensitivity either to temperature or radiation. Finally, we also found that the time scale, in which the ecosystem integrated the rainfall phenomenon in terms of the width of the window function used to convolve the rainfall series into a water availability variable, was also variable in time. This approach allows us to estimate the connection degree between ecosystem productivity and climatic variables. The capacity of the model to identify changes over time in the vegetation-climate relationship might inform decision-makers about ecological transitions and the differential impact of climatic drivers on ecosystems.

AB Plant-lizard interactions are still poorly studied, despite lizards are known to interact with flowering plants in many parts of the world. They are commonly reported on islands although the number of documented interactions has also increased in mainland, mostly in isolated environments. In this study, we first performed a global review to explore whether lizard-flower and lizard double mutualistic interactions in continents occur in environments similar to those of islands. Then, we aimed at explaining the factors driving the current distribution of such interactions worldwide. To do this, we considered four environmental factors (latitude, altitude, rainfall and temperature), and phylogeny and body size of lizards that may influence flower visitation. Furthermore, we investigated for the first time the functional role (legitimate visit versus florivory) of lizards in plant reproduction and the conditions under which each type of interaction occurs. Finally, we explored the factors influencing the distribution of lizard double mutualisms worldwide. We recorded a total of 452 lizard-flower interactions (ca 3.4% and 0.1% of the extant lizard and plant species, respectively). Lizard-flower interactions were more frequently recorded on islands (79%) regardless of phylogeny and lizard body size, whereas in mainland the number of interactions increased with altitude. Our analyses also revealed that only 20% of all interactions confirmed pollination effectiveness and a strong association of the type of interaction with environmental factors and species traits. Regarding the distribution of lizard double mutualisms, we found a positive effect of island and rainfall, but a decrease in their occurrence with latitude, altitude, temperature and body size. We predict that mutualistic plant-lizard interactions will be increasingly documented, especially in isolated environments (both on islands and continents), which will help us to better understand the biological patterns of this phenomenon and the mechanisms underlying them.

AB Dispersal is a fundamental mechanism for maintaining biodiversity, and long-distance dispersal (LDD) has attracted the interest of many researchers owing to its unusual characteristics. Conventionally, LDD has been defined based on absolute and proportional distances; however, it has recently been redefined based on geographic and genetic limits. Based on this redefinition, short-distance dispersal can have the same characteristics as LDD, depending upon the dispersal dynamics of an organism. However, the effects of LDD at a local scale on the genetic structure and diversification of organisms are poorly understood, since many studies have focused on definitive LDD, such as oversea dispersal. We focused on the freshwater snail Gyraulus sp. on an oceanic island, Chichijima Island, attempting to clarify the dynamics and effects of LDD on its genetic structure. We conducted molecular phylogenetic analyses, including divergence-time estimation, using mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA markers to reveal the origin of the snail. In addition, we clarified the genetic structure, gene flow, and evolutionary history of snails on the island using mitochondrial DNA and genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Finally, we followed a landscape ecology approach to identify barriers to dispersal. Our phylogenies suggested that the snail has a single origin. Based on our divergence-time estimation, colonisation was estimated to have occurred around the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene. Our population genetic analyses documented genetic differentiation even within this small oceanic island. Based on the divergence time estimation and approximate Bayesian computation using single-nucleotide polymorphisms, the differentiation was estimated to have begun around the late Pleistocene. Little gene flow occurred between the geographically structured snail genetic groups. Landscape analysis suggested that catchment boundaries were a major barrier to dispersal. Considering the geography of the island, these results suggested that low-frequency dispersal over barriers is an important factor in genetic differentiation within the island. Furthermore, dispersal over barrier may be considered LDD, even though the dispersal distance is only several kilometres. Genetic evidence also suggested that resistance to gene flow over the barrier, rather than distance, is more important in determining whether dispersal should be considered LDD. This suggests that a definition of LDD that depends only on the distance may mislead an understanding of dispersal mode.

AB Studied since late 1800, vermetid reefs are marine bioconstructions of well-acknowledged importance in the Mediterranean Sea. Despite their persistence being jeopardized in the whole basin, recent studies have referred to this bioconstruction as a neglected habitat. In this study, we assessed the neglected status of the Mediterranean vermetid reefs in the scientific literature producing a systematic map through a multi-method bibliometric protocol. Scopus and Web of Science databases were jointly used for data collection. Vermetid reefs publication rate (i.e., number of publications per year) was investigated compared to the other Mediterranean bio-constructions using ANOVA analysis and Zero-Inflated Poisson regression. Later, VOSviewer software was used to perform a bibliometric network analysis and for mapping visualization. The analysis aimed at investigating gaps, patterns, and trends of the vermetid reefs together with the other main Mediterranean bioconstructions (i.e., Astroides calycularis, Cladocora caespitosa and coralligenous formations, and sabellariid and Lithophyllum reefs). The ANOVA analysis of the number of publications from 1966 to 2020 found statistically significant differences between coralligenous and vermetid reefs publication rates in the 2006-2010, 2011-2015, and 2016-2020 timeframes and pointed out a clear before/after-2010 pattern in coralligenous publication rate, which was also confirmed by the Zero-Inflated Poisson regression model. The bibliometric network analysis of the bio-constructions literature revealed the same temporal pattern, with the vermetid reefs poorly investigated and weakly connected to newer research lines and conservation topics. Instead, coralligenous showed strong con-nections with biodiversity conservation and was indicated as a recent research hotspot. Overall, the results of this study confirm previous references of the vermetid reefs as a neglected habitat and, among others, show an increasing research interest in the coralligenous topic.

AB Human-induced water level fluctuations (WLFs) are among the major pressures threatening lake ecosystems. Their effect on meiobenthic species of the littoral zone has been poorly investigated. In this study, we aimed at assessing the effects of human-induced WLFs on the composition and functionality of the benthic copepod assemblages of the littoral zone of Lake Maggiore, Italy and Switzerland. From 1942 to present, the water level of Lake Maggiore has been regulated through the Miorina Dam. We monitored copepod assemblages during different water levels defined within the period of regulation by the dam, using taxonomy- and trait-based metrics. We observed variation in the overall abundance and biomass of copepods, as well as in the number of individuals belonging to some trait classes such as ovigerous females, opportunists, omnivores and deposit feeders. None of the investigated trait class was completely lost. The results of our study suggest that ecosystem services supplied by the littoral zone of Lake Maggiore are likely altered by human-induced WLFs. Our findings provide a first picture of WLF impacts on benthic copepod assemblages, which can be useful for future research expanding on other functional traits.

AB During a study of biodiversity of cyanobacteria in Gorely volcano soils (Kamchatka Peninsula), a strain of heterocytous, a false branching cyanobacterium with gradually tapered filaments, was isolated. Prominent features of the strain were purplish-grey trichomes and firm, distinct multilayered sheaths. Based on the results obtained from the morphological, ecological, and phylogenetic analysis using the 16S rRNA and 16S-23S ITS region, 16S-23S ITS secondary structure analysis, comparison of flanking regions of BoxB and V3 helices, and the p-distance between the 16S-23S ITS region, we describe our strain K7 as a novel species of the genus Roholtiella with the name Roholtiella volcanica sp. nov., in accordance with the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. This work continues the rapid expansion of the description of new taxa of cyanobacteria, and particularly demonstrates a coming phase in cyanobacterial taxonomy in which the discovery of new species in recently described genera rapidly increases our understanding of the diversity in this phylum.

AB Body size is an important species trait, correlating with life span, fecundity, and other ecological factors. Over Earth's geological history, climate shifts have occurred, potentially shaping body size evolution in many clades. General rules attempting to summarize body size evolution include Bergmann's rule, which states that species reach larger sizes in cooler environments and smaller sizes in warmer environments, and Cope's rule, which poses that lineages tend to increase in size over evolutionary time. Tetraodontiform fishes (including pufferfishes, boxfishes, and ocean sunfishes) provide an extraordinary clade to test these rules in ectotherms owing to their exemplary fossil record and the great disparity in body size observed among extant and fossil species. We examined Bergmann's and Cope's rules in this group by combining phylogenomic data (1,103 exon loci from 185 extant species) with 210 anatomical characters coded from both fossil and extant species. We aggregated data layers on paleoclimate and body size from the species examined, and inferred a set of time-calibrated phylogenies using tip-dating approaches for downstream comparative analyses of body size evolution by implementing models that incorporate paleoclimatic information. We found strong support for a temperature-driven model in which increasing body size over time is correlated with decreasing oceanic temperatures. On average, extant tetraodontiforms are two to three times larger than their fossil counterparts, which otherwise evolved during periods of warmer ocean temperatures. These results provide strong support for both Bergmann's and Cope's rules, trends that are less studied in marine fishes compared to terrestrial vertebrates and marine invertebrates.

AB Most of our understanding of island diversity comes from the study of aboveground systems, while the patterns and processes of diversification and community assembly for belowground biotas remain poorly understood. Here, we take advantage of a relatively young and dynamic oceanic island to advance our understanding of ecoevolutionary processes driving community assembly within soil mesofauna. Using whole organism community DNA (wocDNA) metabarcoding and the recently developed metaMATE pipeline, we have generated spatially explicit and reliable haplotype-level DNA sequence data for soil mesofaunal assemblages sampled across the four main habitats within the island of Tenerife. Community ecological and metaphylogeographic analyses have been performed at multiple levels of genetic similarity, from haplotypes to species and supraspecific groupings. Broadly consistent patterns of local-scale species richness across different insular habitats have been found, whereas local insular richness is lower than in continental settings. Our results reveal an important role for niche conservatism as a driver of insular community assembly of soil mesofauna, with only limited evidence for habitat shifts promoting diversification. Furthermore, support is found for a fundamental role of habitat in the assembly of soil mesofauna, where habitat specialism is mainly due to colonization and the establishment of preadapted species. Hierarchical patterns of distance decay at the community level and metaphylogeographical analyses support a pattern of geographic structuring over limited spatial scales, from the level of haplotypes through to species and lineages, as expected for taxa with strong dispersal limitations. Our results demonstrate the potential for wocDNA metabarcoding to advance our understanding of biodiversity.

AB Erosion by landslides is a common phenomenon in mountain regions around the globe, affecting all climatic zones. Landslides facilitate bedrock weathering, pedogenesis and ecological succession, being key drivers of biodiversity. Landslide chronosequences have long been used for studies of vegetation succession in initial ecosystems, but they further offer ideal model systems for studies of soil development and microbial community succession. In this review we synthesize the state of knowledge on the role of landslides in ecosystems, their influence on element cycles and interactions with biota. Further, we discuss feedback mechanisms between global warming, landslide activity and greenhouse gas emissions. In the view of increasing anthropogenic influence and climate change, soils are becoming a critical resource. Due to their ubiquity, landslide chronosequences have the potential to provide critical insights into soil development under different climates and thereby contribute to future soil restoration efforts.

AB Many animals have strict diel activity patterns, with unique adaptations for either diurnal or nocturnal activity. Diel activity is phylogenetically conserved, yet evolutionary shifts in diel activity occur and lead to important changes in an organism's morphology, physiology, and behavior. We use phylogenetic comparative methods to examine the evolutionary history of diel activity in skinks, one of the largest families of terrestrial vertebrates. We examine how diel patterns are associated with microhabitat, ambient temperatures, and morphology. We found support for a nondiurnal ancestral skink. Strict diurnality in crown group skinks only evolved during the Paleogene. Nocturnal habits are associated with fossorial activity, limb reduction and loss, and warm temperatures. Our results shed light on the evolution of diel activity patterns in a large radiation of terrestrial ectotherms and reveal how both intrinsic biotic and extrinsic abiotic factors can shape the evolution of animal activity patterns.

AB The ability to adapt to wide ranges of environmental conditions coupled with their long evolution has allowed cyanobacteria to colonize almost every habitat on Earth. Modern taxonomy tries to track not only this diversification process but also to assign individual cyanobacteria to specific niches. It was our aim to work out a potential niche concept for the genus Cyanocohniella in terms of salt tolerance. We used a strain based on the description of C. rudolphia sp. nov. isolated from a potash tailing pile (Germany) and for comparison C. crotaloides that was isolated from sandy beaches (The Netherlands). The taxonomic position of C. rudolphia sp. nov. was evaluated by phylogenetic analysis and morphological descriptions of its life cycle. Salt tolerance of C. rudolphia sp. nov. and C. crotaloides was monitored with cultivation assays in liquid medium and on sand under salt concentrations ranging from 0% to 12% (1500 mM) NaCl. Optimum growth conditions were detected for both strains at 4% (500 mM) NaCl based on morpho-anatomical and physiological criteria such as photosynthetic yield by chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements. Taking into consideration that all known strains of this genus colonize salty habitats supports our assumption that the genus might have a marine origin but also expands colonization to salty terrestrial habitats. This aspect is further discussed, including the ecological and biotechnological relevance of the data presented.

AB Gut microbial communities provide essential functions to their hosts and are known to influence both their ecology and evolution. However, our knowledge of these complex associations is still very limited in reptiles. Here we report the 16S rRNA gene faecal microbiota profiles of two lizard species endemic to the Balearic archipelago (Podarcis lilfordi and P. pityusensis), encompassing their allopatric range of distribution through a noninvasive sampling, as an alternative to previous studies that implied killing specimens of these IUCN endangered and near-threatened species, respectively. Both lizard species showed a faecal microbiome composition consistent with their omnivorous trophic ecology, with a high representation of cellulolytic bacteria taxa. We also identified species-specific core microbiota signatures and retrieved lizard species, islet ascription, and seasonality as the main factors in explaining bacterial community composition. The different Balearic Podarcis populations are characterised by harbouring a high proportion of unique bacterial taxa, thus reinforcing their view as unique and divergent evolutionary entities.

AB Complex dynamical systems have tipping points and exhibit nonlinear dynamics. It is difficult to predict and prevent the onset and progression of the tumors, mainly due to the complexity of interactions between tumor growth and tumor-immune cells involved. Moreover, previous models were based on the influence of the zero-dimensional systems and did not consider the spatiotemporal fluctuation in the tumor microenvironment. We here extend the previous model to a two-dimensional system and employ spatial early warning signals to study the spatially extended tumor-immune system with stochasticity. On the one hand, we obtain the stationary probability density of the system under the mean-field approximation assumption. It is found that the health state gets more and more stable than the disease state as the noise level increases when the system has a bistable state, and the system goes from health to disease state through a bistable region as the growth rate increases. On the other hand, we present a spatiotemporal diffusion coefficient indicator to predict upcoming critical transitions. It is shown that a rising spatiotemporal diffusion coefficient obtained from the spatial snapshot data can be an effective indicator for predicting upcoming critical transitions. Anticipating critical transitions in the spatial tumor-immune system with stochasticity can be greatly helpful to prevent disease onset and progression, which may intercept abrupt shifts from health to disease state.

AB This study made use of a microcosm experiment to inform a planned restoration project that aims to simultaneously address two global issues - stormwater management and saltpan abandonment, which leads to the loss of unique wetland habitats and the ecosystem services they provide. To reinstate the wetland function of an abandoned saltpan at the Swartkops Estuary, South Africa, an opportunity has been identified to fill it with stormwater which is currently a major source of nutrient pollution to the nationally important estuary. This study investigated the primary producer communities that may arise in response to the inundation of the saltpan with stormwater as well as the potential for the saltpan to remove nutrients from the stormwater. The microcosm experiment contained stormwater treatments and an estuary treatment consisting of water from the adjacent Swartkops Estuary to mimic the previous management regime of the saltpan. Initially, all treatments were eutrophic - the stormwater treatments had exceptionally high concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN & GE; 99 mu M), while the Estuary treatment was rich in dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP = 25 mu M) and were characterised by diatom blooms (> 20 mu g Chl-a l(- 1)). However, these blooms quickly assimilated inorganic nutrients and shifted the water column to an oligotrophic state, before subsequently collapsing. By the end of the study, diverse primary producer communities, dominated by benthic microalgae and submerged macrophytes, were able to assimilate the studied nutrients and all treatments reached an oligotrophic, clear water state. A phytoplankton (Tetraselmis sp.) bloom occurred in the Estuary treatment, but no evidence was found to support the potential for nuisance blooms if stormwater is pumped into the abandoned saltpan. This study highlights the potential for converting defunct saltpans, which have been abandoned in many parts of the world, to stormwater retention ponds that can reduce the anthropogenic nutrient loading of estuaries.

AB Understanding the mechanisms that create phenotypic variation within and among populations is a major goal of physiological ecology. Variation may be a consequence of functional trade-offs (i.e. improvement in one trait comes at the expense of another trait) or alternatively may reflect the intrinsic quality of an organism (i.e. some individuals are simply better overall performers than others). There is evidence for both ideas in the literature, suggesting that environmental context may mediate whether variation results from trade-offs or differences in individual quality. We tested this overarching 'context dependence' hypothesis by comparing the aquatic and terrestrial athletic performance of the amphibious fish Kryptolebias marmoratus captured from two contrasting habitats, a large pond and small burrows. Overall, pond fish were superior terrestrial athletes but burrow fish were better burst swimmers, suggestive of a performance trade-off at the population level. Within each population, however, there was no evidence of a performance trade-off. In burrow fish, athletic performance was positively correlated with muscle content and body condition, consistent with the individual quality hypothesis. In pond fish, there was only a relationship between glycolytic white muscle and aquatic burst performance. Notably, pond fish were in better body condition, which may mask relationships between condition and athletic performance. Overall, our data highlight that population-level trends are insufficient evidence for the existence of phenotypic trade-offs in the absence of similar within-population pattems. Furthermore, we only found evidence for the individual quality hypothesis in one population, suggesting that patterns of phenotypic covariance are context dependent.

AB The Lake Suwa (Japan) has a history of non-N-fixing Microcystis blooms. Lake Kinneret (Israel) experienced multiannual periods of sole domination by the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense and periods dominated seasonally by P. gatunense or cyanobacteria. Extensive studies have been carried out in both lakes regarding the role of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus as drivers of primary productivity. There is growing evi-dence that dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compounds also influence not only biomass and structure of phytoplankton communities but also microcystin production. This study focuses on relationships of DON with: (1) population dynamics of Microcystis spp. and concentrations of microcystins in Lake Suwa, and (2) population dynamics of P. gatunense as well as N-and non-N-fixing cyanobacteria in Lake Kinneret. Modelling results for historical data of Lake Suwa by means of the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA revealed that the prediction of abundances of four Microcystis species and concentrations of cyanotoxins achieved higher coefficients of corre-lation when DON/DIN-ratios were included as drivers. Population dynamics of P. gatunense in Lake Kinneret appeared to have a strong inverse relationships with DON/DIN-ratios reflected by inferential models of HEA with higher coefficients of correlation when driven by DON/DIN-ratios. When DON/DIN-ratios were included as drivers, models of Microcystis spp. in Lake Kinneret performed higher coefficients of determination compared to models of N-fixing cyanobacteria. The study highlights the need to consider DON for improved understanding and management of population dynamics of cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates in freshwater lakes.

AB Cephalopods are an important component of Southern Ocean food webs, but aspects of their trophic ecology remain unresolved. Here, we used archived squid (order Teuthida) beaks, collected from stomach contents of predators at Macquarie and Kerguelen Islands, to investigate the trophic structure within an assemblage of pelagic squids (Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Filippovia knipovitchi, Gonatus antarcticus, Histioteuthis eltaninae, Martialia hyadesi and Brachioteuthis linkovskyi). We combined bulk nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15(bulk)) with compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA) to estimate the trophic position (TP) of species and to assess isotopic relationships with body size at the species, community, and ocean basin levels. We observed significantly higher mean delta N-15(bulk) values for species at the Kerguelen Islands compared to conspecifics at Macquarie Island. This result was explained by regional variability in delta N-15 values of phenylalanine (delta N-15(Phe)), suggesting that predator species were accessing different isotopic baselines at each region. This may highlight the different foraging strategies of both species. The overlap in species TP estimates from CSIA-AA (TPCSIA) between the 2 communities (Macquarie Island TPCSIA min: 2.3, max: 5.3; Kerguelen Islands TPCSIA min: 2.7, max: 5.3) indicated a similar trophic structure at both locations. We note unrealistically low TPCSIA for some species, which we attribute to uncertainty of trophic discrimination factors. TP estimates suggested that squid encompass 3 trophic levels from mid-trophic levels to higher predators. We did not find strong or consistent relationships between TP and body size at either the species- or community-level. One of the largest squid species, M. hyadesi, occupied the lowest TP in both communities. These new insights into the trophic structure of the Southern Ocean squid community have important implications for the future representation of pelagic squids in ecosystem models.

AB Aims Heavy metal hyperaccumulators are widely used in mining restoration due to their ability to accumulate and transport heavy metals, compared to nonaccumulators. Rhizosphere bacteria in metal hyperaccumulators play a key role in the uptake of heavy metals from soil; however, assessments of the differences of rhizosphere bacteria between metal hyperaccumulators and nonaccumulator are scarce. Methods and results To understand the difference of bacterial composition between hyperaccumulator and nonaccumulator in rhizosphere, the diversity and composition of rhizosphere bacteria in a metal hyperaccumulator (Boehmeria nivea) and a nonaccumulator (Artemisia annua) grown in the same field in Xikuangshan were evaluated using Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing technology. Boehmeria nivea and A. annua had 3926 overlapping OTUs, 19,736 and 17,579 unique OTUs, respectively. Boehmeria nivea had lower Chao1 index, Shannon index and Pielou index than A. annua. The dominant phyla and genera of rhizosphere bacteria in B. nivea and A. annua were similar, but some rhizosphere bacterial communities with heavy metal remediation ability mainly appeared in the rhizosphere of the hyperaccumulator. Compared to A. annua, B. nivea showed a significantly higher relative abundance of rhizosphere bacteria, such as Acidobacteria and Bacteroidete at the phylum level and RB41 at the genus level. Some specific rhizosphere bacteria with the ability to bind metal, such as Leifsonia and Kibdelosporangium, were only found in the rhizosphere of B. nivea. Conclusion Results indicated that B. nivea, as a metal hyperaccumulator, has a key function in governing metal-resistant rhizosphere bacteria in response to antimony compound pollution stress. Significance and Impact of Study Understanding the diversity of rhizosphere bacteria between hyperaccumulators and nonaccumulators is beneficial to formulate strategies to improve metal uptake efficiency by selecting specific plant species and rhizosphere bacteria grown on polluted soil.

AB The search for traces of life is one of the principal objectives of Mars exploration. The global distribution of minerals associated with serpentinization in the Noachian terrains on Mars likely suggest that serpentinization commonly occurred early in the planets history. A consensus is that these reactions involved in the serpentinization may have provided the initial material and energy for the origin and early evolution of life on Earth. Comparably, the serpentine regions of Mars are potential target sites for the detection of the putative life on Mars. Herein, an actinobacterial species Streptomyces spp. FXJ8.102 is used as a model microbe to investigate the microbe-mediated dissolution of antigorite in liquid culture. The experimental results show that the strain can couple biomechanical and biochemical mechanisms in the serpentine dissolution, leading to the development of "cell-sized" and "cell-shaped" eroded pits/channels on the mineral surfaces, and the low Mg/Si ratios on the eroded sites. In addition, the cells can also induce the formation of secondary glushinskite during the dissolution process. By contrast, no distinguishable surface change on antigorite and secondary mineral formation can be observed in the control experiments without inoculation. Therefore, a collection of the features including the distinctive eroded texture and composition on serpentine surfaces, and the special mineral assemblage including the formation of secondary oxalate minerals may serve as a compelling biosignature for the search of life on Mars.

AB Simple Summary The artificial release of hatchery fish has not achieved expected results, mainly due to the low survival rate of the fish after being released into the natural environment. Many studies have shown that the implementation of pro-released training can improve the survival rate of hatchery fish. Rock carp (Procypris rabaudi) is a rare breed of fish in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The aim of this study is to investigate whether aerobic exercise training has positive effects on the growth, swimming ability, antipredation ability and immunologic function before releasing the species into the wild. The findings from this study indicate that the training regime at close to 2-4 bl s(-1) for 20 h per day for 42 days prior to release might be a suitable strategy to promote the survival rate of released juvenile rock carp in the wild. Many studies have found that aerobic exercise training at a moderate water velocity can improve the growth, swimming performance and survival rate of fish. To investigate the effects of aerobic exercise training on the growth, swimming performance, antipredation ability and immune parameters of rock carp, juveniles were placed in training channels with different water velocities (i.e., 3 cm s(-1), 1 (body length s(-1)) bl s(-1), 2 bl s(-1) and 4 bl s(-1)) for 6 weeks. Then, the specific growth rate, critical swimming speed (U-crit) and its metabolism, constant acceleration speed (U-cat), survival rate under predation, spleen index, lysozyme (LZM) activity and immunoglobulin (IgM) level were measured. Training showed no significant effect on the length-specific growth rate, weight-specific growth rate, U-crit, maximum metabolic rate (MMR), metabolic scope (MS), U-cat or spleen index. The resting metabolic rates (RMRs) of the 2 bl s(-1) and 4 bl s(-1) training groups were significantly higher than those of the control group and 1 bl s(-1) training group. The survival rate of the 1 bl s(-1) training group in the presence of predators was significantly higher than that of the control group but significantly lower than those of the 2 bl s(-1) and 4 bl s(-1) training groups. The LZM activity of the 4 bl s(-1) training group was significantly higher than that of the control group. The IgM level of the 2 bl s(-1) training group was significantly higher than that of the control group. These data indicate that aerobic exercise training does not improve the growth and swimming performance of juvenile rock carp but can improve their antipredation ability and immunologic function.

AB Given the global collapse of most oyster fisheries, we explored the conditions under which the interaction of oysters and fishers can lead to multiple system equilibria and how those conditions might affect management strategies and recovery efforts. Using simple, but plausible, models of oyster fisheries, we identified tipping points, multiple equilibria, and hysteresis under a wide range of realistic model parameterizations. In collapsed systems with hysteresis, recovery of the system will require far less harvest than that which precipitated the collapse, and recovery times can be on decadal scales. We also derived optimal, non-equilibrium, state-dependent fishing policies and found that these policies can perform well, but are accompanied by high variation in the allowable harvest. Critically, these optimal policies also require constant monitoring of system state and frequent control of fishing effort. Finally, we examined habitat-enhancement scenarios that mimic proposed and ongoing restoration programs. We found that these efforts can increase the number of fishers the system can support and reduce otherwise long recovery times in collapsed systems.

AB The field of chemical rodent control has seen no major developments in the last decades, even though anticoagulant rodenticides (AR), the mainly used substances to manage mice and rats, are known environmental pollutants and candidates for substitution under the European Biocidal Products Regulation 528/2012. Moreover, recent political developments in Europe and the USA demand more safety and sustainability in the management of chemicals, reinforcing the need for environmentally friendly substances. In this concept study, we present a step-by-step approach to improve the environmental properties of rodenticides. Repurposing of existing pharmaceuticals, the use of enantiomerically pure rodenticides, or the improvement of the formulation by microencapsulation can help to alleviate environmental problems caused by AR in the short term. Modification of the chemical structures or the development of prodrugs as medium-term strategies can further improve environmental properties of existing compounds. Ultimately, the development of new substances from scratch enables the utilisation of so far ignored modes of actions and the application of modern safe and sustainable-by-design principles to improve target specificity and reduce the negative impact on non-target organisms and the environment. Overall, our concept study illustrates the great potential for improvement in the field of chemical rodent control when applying available techniques of green and sustainable chemistry to known or potential rodenticides. Most promising in the medium term is microencapsulation that would allow for the use of acutely acting substances as it could circumvent bait shyness. On a longer timescale the de novo design of new rodenticides, which is the only method that can combine a high target specificity with good environmental properties, is the most promising approach.

AB Aim Animal body size is recurrently associated with climate. Bergmann's rule proposes that larger endotherms inhabit higher latitudes because higher latitudes are generally colder, and larger body sizes promote heat conservation. However, body size variation of ectotherms has been associated with other climatic variables as anurans in drier environments reach larger sizes for water conservation. We tested whether body size variation of anuran amphibians can be explained by the heat conservation or water conservation hypotheses. Location Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Taxon Anuran amphibians. Methods We selected anurans from different phylogenetic groups. The size was defined by snout-vent length (SVL) and stoutness. We implemented spatial regressions including morphological dimensions and variables describing temperature and water availability. Results Only Haddadus binotatus had SVL size negatively associated with temperature, in accordance with the heat conservation hypothesis (HCH). Itapotihyla langsdorffii had SVL positively associated with temperature, contrary to the HCH. Cycloramphus eleutherodactylus had SVL negatively associated with potential evapotranspiration, in accordance with the water conservation hypothesis (WCH). Thoropa miliaris+T. taophora and Ischnocnema guentheri showed no associations between SVL and climate. Stoutness was poorly associated with climate, with a negative relationship found only in Rhinella crucifer+R. ornata in accordance with the WCH. Main conclusions The heat conservation and water conservation hypotheses do not offer general explanations for the body size variation in anurans from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Natural history, functional and ecological traits are more likely to affect anuran body size and they should be considered in posterior analyses.

AB The objective of this work was to identify microbial communities associated with the surfaces of alkali feldspars and to determine whether these microbes might be involved in the weathering of these rocks for agronomic benefit. Samples were taken from weathering profiles and soils developed on a syenite, considered as a raw material for agromineral production, located in the municipality of Triunfo, in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Molecular microbiological techniques (qPCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing) were used, and data were interpreted by the analysis of variance, hierarchical cluster analysis, and principal coordinates analysis. In addition, scanning electron microscopy was used to image mineral surfaces. Similar bacterial communities were observed in all samples, showing that the bacteria found in soil are present at the earliest stages of rock weathering and are available to play a role in nutrient release. In particular, Actinobacteria and, within this phylum, Actinomycetales were proportionally more abundant than other taxa in rock-dominated soil samples, i.e., in thin soils on or between fractured or broken syenite. The analysis of rock dust used as a remineralizer, crushed with no further treatment, shows that Actinobacteria play a role in the early stages of weathering of feldspar-bearing rocks.

AB Ecological restoration is poised to become an increasingly important component of landscape management in the coming years as countries work to halt the rate of biodiversity loss. The success of future restoration projects will depend equally on both achieving biological objectives and on producing conditions that meet public expectations. Yet we often know very little about either how the public perceives the purpose or goals of ecological restoration, or how restoration might fit into public expectations for landscape management. We surveyed a representative sample of the Norwegian population (n = 4,077) to determine how familiar the Norwegian public is with ecological restoration, to explore their perceptions of restoration's purposes and goals, and to assess their preferences for types of common Norwegian landscapes. Survey participants generally had little familiarity with ecological restoration, yet they had a greater tendency to view restoration's purpose as enhancing naturalness than as providing benefits for humans. Public attitudes regarding landscape management were reasonably balanced between preserving cultural landscapes and promoting natural landscapes free from traces of human activity. While participants gave agricultural landscapes the highest scores for desirability, the survey did not reveal any conspicuous variation in landscape preferences among the Norwegian public. Policymakers, land managers, and ecological restoration practitioners should use insights from studies such as ours to help identify which future projects are most likely to enjoy widespread support, and to tailor their communication with stakeholders.

ID INERT; BEETLE; PLANTS; AREA
AB Airborne particulate matter is a significant concern to human health, but the effects of the deposition of dust on other species in the wild has not been well investigated. The vulnerability of insects to mineral dusts has been well known from agricultural management and the current co-occurrence of endangered species with dustproducing industry makes this knowledge more relevant and in need of expansion. To investigate the effects of fugitive gypsum dust on an endangered butterfly species, we exposed a surrogate lepidopterous species (Gloveria medusa; Lasiocampidae) to realistic quantities of gypsum dust either on its hostplant or externally applied to larvae. We then used surviving larvae in a choice experiment to ascertain if previous exposure to gypsum contaminated hostplant affected larval preferences. Consumption of gypsum-dusted foodplant increased risk of death for larvae significantly compared with both controls (hazard ratio = 4.80; 95% CI = 2.08-11.03; p = 0.0002) and the external treatment (HR = 2.85; 95% CI 1.41-5.76; p = 0.003). External treatment elevated death rate, but not significantly (HR = 1.68; 95% CI =0.65-4.33; p = 0.28). Elevated risk of death was greater for smaller larvae. Hostplant choice after previous exposure was not significant, but suggestive that larvae consume more of the hostplant in the condition that they previously experienced (either with or without gypsum). Based on these results and previous studies, we conclude that fugitive gypsum dust may affect populations through direct mortality, reduced developmental rates, lower weights, and extended development periods that disrupt natural phenology. Use of dust to reduce insect infestations is an ancient practice, and knowledge of these effects should be revived to address chronic harms of fugitive dust on insects as they face worldwide declines.

AB Toxic phytoplankton in the aquatic ecosystems are dynamic, affecting water quality. It remains unclear as to how possible toxic phytoplankton assemblages vary vertically and temporally in Swakoppoort and Von Bach dams, located in a dry subtropical desert region in central Namibia. The following variables were analyzed: pH, Secchi depths, turbidity, water temperature, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton cells, and water depths. Cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton community in the autumn, winter and spring (dry) and summer (wet) seasons, at all the depth ranges in both dams. Microcystis dominated the vertical and temporal dynamics, followed by Dolichospermum. In the dry seasons, higher cyanobacteria cell numbers were observed in comparison to the rainy season in both dams. Spring blooms of cyanobacteria were evident in the Von Bach Dam while autumn and spring cyanobacteria blooms were observed in the Swakoppoort Dam. In the Swakoppoort Dam, the preferable depth ranges for toxic cyanobacteria species were at 5 to 10 m while in the Von Bach Dam at 0 to 5 m range. The findings of the current study indicate that the traditional selective withdrawal of water in the two dams should be performed with vertical and temporal dynamics of possible toxic cyanobacteria accounted for to aid the abstraction of water with the lowest possible toxic phytoplankton numbers, which could lower the public health risk.

AB Monitoring the demographics and genetics of reintroduced populations is critical to evaluating reintroduction success, but species ecology and the landscapes that they inhabit often present challenges for accurate assessments. If suitable habitats are restricted to hierarchical dendritic networks, such as river systems, animal movements are typically constrained and may violate assumptions of methods commonly used to estimate demographic parameters. Using genetic detection data collected via fecal sampling at latrines, we demonstrate applicability of the spatial capture-recapture (SCR) network distance function for estimating the size and density of a recently reintroduced North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) population in the Upper Rio Grande River dendritic network in the southwestern United States, and we also evaluated the genetic outcomes of using a small founder group (n = 33 otters) for reintroduction. Estimated population density was 0.23-0.28 otter/km, or 1 otter/3.57-4.35 km, with weak evidence of density increasing with northerly latitude (beta = 0.33). Estimated population size was 83-104 total otters in 359 km of riverine dendritic network, which corresponded to average annual exponential population growth of 1.12-1.15/year since reintroduction. Growth was >= 40% lower than most reintroduced river otter populations and strong evidence of a founder effect existed 8-10 years post-reintroduction, including 13-21% genetic diversity loss, 84%-87% genetic effective population size decline, and rapid divergence from the source population (F-ST accumulation = 0.06/generation). Consequently, genetic restoration via translocation of additional otters from other populations may be necessary to mitigate deleterious genetic effects in this small, isolated population. Combined with non-invasive genetic sampling, the SCR network distance approach is likely widely applicable to demogenetic assessments of both reintroduced and established populations of multiple mustelid species that inhabit aquatic dendritic networks, many of which are regionally or globally imperiled and may warrant reintroduction or augmentation efforts.

AB To manage populations of threatened species according to the IUCN's One Plan Approach, knowledge about both in situ and ex situ populations is required. To enhance the conservation of threatened skinks and to gain an overview which skink species are kept in zoos, and thus already have an ex situ conservation component, we analysed data from the Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS): their individual numbers, breeding success, and the number of holding institutions. We categorised species as threatened or non-threatened based on IUCN Red List assessments. Only 92 (similar to 5%) of 1727 recognized skink species are held in ZIMS institutions worldwide, mostly in Australia, Europe, and North America. 77% of the species kept globally are classified as non-threatened and similar to 23% (21 species) are threatened. Only 28% of the species kept have successfully bred in the last year, mostly in one zoo each. Of these seven species were threatened. All threatened species are kept by four zoos at most, generally only in one. Half of the skink species kept are represented by less than 10 individuals. Mainly Australian skink species were kept. To improve the conservation of threatened skinks, a shift towards keeping threatened species should be considered within captive management programmes. European and North American zoos offer capacities and expertise for skink conservation but are outside skink species richness hotspots. Cooperative projects with institutions and stations in such hotspots could greatly benefit the conservation of skinks. Thus, according to the One Plan Approach, the ex situ populations could directly contribute to in situ protection.

AB For reintroduction programs to succeed, it is vital to identify suitable release sites. This is especially true for low dispersing habitat specialists, which are at particular risk from habitat fragmentation. The habitat specialist Muscardinus avellanarius (hazel dormouse) is part of a large-scale reintroduction program in the UK. The program began in 1993 and has so far had varying levels of long-term success across 24 sites. Although the causes of population persistence at reintroduction sites are not well understood, continued habitat suitability is hypothesized to play an important role. Here, we establish broad-scale habitat descriptors associated with the current distribution of natural hazel dormouse populations in England, using ecological niche factor analysis and remotely sensed, open-source maps. We also apply generalized linear mixed effects models to long-term monitoring data for reintroduced hazel dormouse populations, revealing that broad-scale habitat factors strongly influence the number of animals present in nest boxes. To aid conservation practitioners in future site selection, we illustrate the practical application of habitat suitability mapping to help prioritize the most appropriate woodlands for future hazel dormouse reintroductions, using the county of Cheshire as an example. Although demonstrated here for the hazel dormouse, this approach to reintroduction site selection could be beneficial to a broad range of species.

AB Interactions between neighboring plants are critical for biodiversity maintenance in plant populations and communities. Intraspecific trait variation and genome duplication are common in plant species and can drive eco-evolutionary dynamics through genotype-mediated plant-plant interactions. However, few studies have examined how species-wide intraspecific variation may alter interactions between neighboring plants. We investigate how subspecies and ploidy variation in a genetically diverse species, big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), can alter the demographic outcomes of plant interactions. Using a replicated, long-term common garden experiment that represents range-wide diversity of A. tridentata, we ask how intraspecific variation, environment, and stand age mediate neighbor effects on plant growth and survival. Spatially explicit models revealed that ploidy variation and subspecies identity can mediate plant-plant interactions but that the effect size varied in time and across experimental sites. We found that demographic impacts of neighbor effects were strongest during early stages of stand development and in sites with greater growth rates. Within subspecies, tetraploid populations showed greater tolerance to neighbor crowding compared to their diploid variants. Our findings provide evidence that intraspecific variation related to genome size and subspecies identity impacts spatial demography in a genetically diverse plant species. Accounting for intraspecific variation in studies of conspecific density dependence will improve our understanding of how local populations will respond to novel genotypes and biotic interaction regimes. As introduction of novel genotypes into local populations becomes more common, quantifying demographic processes in genetically diverse populations will help predict long-term consequences of plant-plant interactions.

AB This article deals with the possibility of using cement by-pass dust (CBPD) in the garden architecture elements, specifically in curbs for park use. To increase the positive effect on the environment, other secondary raw materials were also used in the research, specifically blast furnace granulated slag and silica fly ash. Mixtures were based on alkali activation, where cement as a binder was 100% replaced by raw materials with waste properties. In the research, properties of used materials and also the basic physical-mechanical and durability properties of prepared mixtures were determined Part of the research focused on the effect of the tested beams on the grassland planted around the beams. Any significant negative impact was not registered, except for low pH increase of soil. Infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis were performed on selected samples. Testing has shown that the products are in accordance with the Czech standard requirements for concrete curbs in garden architecture. The samples did not pass only the scaling test, which is, however, a condition for concrete curbs used for roads. For garden architecture this test is not required.

AB Coral transplantation helps to reinstate coral cover in degraded reefs, but the general success of this approach is hampered by limited understanding of how coral-fragment size affects growth and survival of transplants of non-branching species. In this study, we compared the effects of three size classes of coral fragments (small: 2-4cm, medium: 5-7cm and large: 9-11cm) on the post-transplantation survivorship and growth of Favites complanata (n=51), Favites pentagona (n=54) and Platygyra sinensis (n=60) attached to granite rocks on a subtidal seawall in Singapore. After 18 months, transplants of all species showed high survivorship (all >64%) and up to 6.3-fold increase in live tissue area. Survivorship was not significantly different among the size classes of each species. Mean linear extension rates were fastest only for small F. complanata transplants compared to medium-sized ones. Our findings also suggested that the transplantation of only small fragments could generate better yield in live coral cover and present the most optimal use of the original amount of coral source material. Such information is critical for formulating management and conservation strategies in urbanized reef systems typically dominated by non-branching corals.

AB In this paper, to monitor fugitive dust in construction sites, we propose a portable and inexpensive mea-surement system that can accurately measure the mass concentration of the total suspended particles (TSPs, that is, particles smaller than 50 mu m) in real time. The proposed system can measure the real-time mass concentration of the TSPs, which cannot be measured by conventional mass concentration mea-surement devices. It has four components: (1) particle collection section, (2) temperature and humidity measurement section, (3) particle measurement section, and (4) signal-processing circuit. When parti-cles of different sizes reach the proposed system, they are selectively collected based on their size in the collection section. Thereafter, the collected particles reach the particle measurement section via the temperature and humidity measurement section. The particles are detected in the particle measurement section, and the mass concentration is calculated in the signal-processing circuit. Further, we analyzed the characteristics of each section, and the measurement results of the proposed system were compared using a filter-based gravity method. The calculated mass concentration of the TSPs corresponds to the results measured obtaining using the filter-based gravity method. Moreover, field test results indicate that the proposed system was successfully applied in construction sites. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The efficacy of translocation as a method for conserving species in peril has not been fully evaluated. Post-release monitoring rarely involves long-term assessments and initial success metrics may not translate to population viability. In particular, genetic factors may play a critical role in fitness following release as founder effect, genetic drift, inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression can influence extinction risk. As part of a multi-year recovery effort, we translocated populations of the endangered Stephens' kangaroo rat (Dipodomys stephensi; SKR), in order to restore population connectivity. Here we evaluate the success of the translocation efforts through long-term population estimation and genetic analyses. We conducted post-release assessments for 9 years, and used Bayesian clustering analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) of 24 microsatellite markers developed for this species to assess genetic admixture between source and translocated populations. Demographic results indicate long-term translocation success, as evidenced by founder survival and establishment, and population growth and regulation. Genetic results show admixture at the release site between genetically discrete source populations, provide definitive evidence that translocated individuals, not immigrants, produced offspring at the release site, that these offspring successfully reproduced and that even with moderate to great genetic differentiation of source populations, outbreeding depression was not detected. Despite the historical failure of heteromyid translocation efforts, our long-term study illustrates how the development of species-specific best practices led to an effective strategy for SKR recovery. More broadly, our results suggest efforts that use a systematic hypothesis-testing framework alongside long-term monitoring offer great promise in improving translocation outcomes.

TI Specialist versus Generalist at the Intraspecific Level: Functional

AB Synopsis Populations of the same species occupying different microhabitats can either exhibit generalized traits across them or display intraspecific variability, adapting to each microhabitat in order to maximize performance. Intraspecific variability contributes to the generation of diversity, following selection and adaptation, and understanding such variability is important for comprehending how individuals choose their microhabitats. Compared with interspecific variability, however, intraspecific variability in functional morphology and its relationship with microhabitat preference and use have been relatively little studied. Here we examined whether populations of the gecko Mediodactylus kotschyi that differ in the substrates they occupy display habitat-specific behaviors and differing morphologies associated with functional adaptation to their microhabitats. We collected 207 geckos from under or on rocks or on trees from seven populations in Greece. On large islands individuals occupy both substrates; whereas small islets are devoid of trees and the geckos are restricted to rocks, while on the mainland they are only found on trees. We determined gecko substrate preferences in the laboratory, together with their clinging abilities to the different substrates. We measured their limbs, digits, and claws and assessed how these measurements relate to clinging ability. Geckos from all populations preferred the tree made available to them, but this preference was not statistically significant. Geckos from both large and small islands clung better to the tree than to the rock in the laboratory, while those from the mainland clung similarly to both substrates. Geckos collected from trees had longer manual digits and hind limbs. Geckos collected from large and small islands had taller (longer on the dorso-ventral axis; henceforth "deeper") claws. Longer digits and deeper but shorter claws were associated with a better ability to cling to rocks. Our findings suggest that while M. kotschyi is potentially preferentially arboreal, due to the great variation and plasticity it possesses, it can successfully also exploit the habitats available on the smallest, treeless islets in the Aegean Sea. Our study suggests that the dichotomous use of generalist versus specialist in describing species' habitat use is oversimplified, and we suggest the use of a generalist-specialist gradient instead.

   RESPONSES
AB The island species area relationship (ISAR) is an important tool for measuring variation in species diversity in variety of insular systems, from true-island archipelagoes to fragmented terrestrial landscapes. However, it suffers from several limitations. For example, due to the sample-area effect, positive relationships between species and area cannot be directly interpreted as evidence for deterministic effects of area per se. Additionally, richness-based analyses may obscure species-level responses to area and isolation that may better inform conservation practice. Here, we use random placement models to control for variation in abundance, occupancy and richness associated with the sample-area effect, allowing deterministic effects of area and isolation, and how they vary with species' functional traits, to be resolved using linear mixed effects models. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using a butterfly assemblage persisting on a naturally fragmented landscape of lake islands. The ISAR did not significantly deviate from random placement in relation to island area, isolation or habitat diversity, supporting stochastic assembly consistent with the sample-area effect. Such inferences support the habitat amount hypothesis, which prioritizes preserving the maximum amount of habitat irrespective of its degree of fragmentation. However, species-level analyses demonstrated that species' abundances were significantly lower on both smaller and more isolated islands than what is predicted by the sample-area effect. Moreover, effects of area per se were significantly greater for smaller, less mobile and rare species. Species' occurrences also significantly deviated from predictions of the sample-area effect in relation to island isolation. Thus, our approach illustrates that richness-based analyses not only result in incorrect inferences on mechanisms underlying ISARs, but also obscure important effects of area per se and isolation on individual species that vary with functional traits. We therefore suggest that these effects should not be solely inferred from richness-based analyses, but rather evaluated on a species-by-species basis.

AB The bio-weathering process contributes majorly in the physical shaping of earth's surface. The weathering of mineral is coupled to the formation of new minerals and release of bio-available nutrients for flora as well as microbial communities. Granites from the Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC) India are felsic plutonic igneous rock composed of nutritive minerals. The major elemental composition of granite is such that, it forms an ancient ecological niche for diverse microbial communities. Interdisciplinary approaches were taken to construct a more comprehensive understanding of potential functional attributes of Actinobacteria in bio-weathering of granite. This work includes molecular characterization of the isolated strains, detecting their granite bioweathering potentials through leaching experiments where Nocardioides showed highest mineral leaching indices with iron (Fe) being the most leached element (similar to 6372 ppm). Scanning electron microscopic imaging indicated biofilm formation and Actinobacterial hyphae colonization. Petrographic, XRD and FTIR based study shows formation of secondary minerals (kaolinite, vermiculite and smectite). To further establish the hypothesis of soil formation and nutrition transport, long-term (360 days) microcosm was developed. Deterioration and grain size alternations with increase in clay based minerals (kaolinite, vermiculite) and total protein content was observed. A bioinformatics based functional biodiversity approach in link to global bio-weathering of rocks by the genus Actinobacteria was adopted to understand their distribution patterns and contribution to alterations of rock minerals.

AB Continuous movement monitoring is a powerful tool for evaluating reintroduction techniques and assessing how well reintroduced animals are adjusting to the wild. However, to date, continuous monitoring has only occurred for large-bodied species capable of carrying heavy tracking devices. In this study we used an automated VHF radio telemetry array to investigate the exploratory behavior and movement patterns of critically endangered ?Alal? (Corvus hawaiiensis), reintroduced to the Island of Hawai?i in 2017. The 11 juvenile ?Alal? we tracked exhibited high site fidelity and initial survival. Over time the birds showed decreased time spent at the supplemental feeders, and transitioned to more focused use of the landscape, suggesting increased foraging on wild food items. Birds with seemingly less spatial neophobia at release also made larger post-release exploratory movements. This study provides the first evidence that 1) supplemental feeding can support site fidelity for reintroduced ?Alal? without restricting a transition to independent foraging, and 2) that pre-release personality metrics may be useful predictors for predicting post-release movements of ?Alal?. Our work is the first to demonstrate the utility and power of automated telemetry for monitoring the reintroduction of small species.

AB The biodiversity of freshwater fauna of the Arctic Islands of the Russian Federation is currently poorly studied and to date there are insufficient molecular genetic data concerning most of the taxa. This study presents the new data on species composition and distribution of freshwater benthic invertebrates in lakes of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago and Vaigach Island based on both the published and the original records. A total of 29 species of invertebrates in 4 classes and 14 orders were found. Considering the published data, the list of species expands to 136 species. The copepod Mesocyclops leuckarti, the pontoporeid amphipod Monoporeia affinis, the ostracod Leucocythere mirabilis, and the mollusk Euglesa globularis were recorded for the first time from the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago. The oligochaete Rhyacodrilus coccineus, the stonefly Nemoura sahlbergi, the caddisflies Agrypnia obsoleta, Micrasema gelidum and Philarctus bergrothi were registered for the first time from Vaigach Island; P. bergrothi was also recorded for the first time from Europe. The crane fly larvae of Tipula (Arctotipula) were recorded as inhabitants of the bottom layer of Arctic lakes for the first time. The obtained molecular data are in accordance with the tabula rasa hypothesis that the invertebrate fauna of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago and Vaigach Island are the result of recent species immigration after the Last Glacial Maximum. Our data can be used in further ecological studies and conservation management. The molecular data are of considerable interest for the taxonomy and biogeography of the fauna of the Arctic islands during the Pleistocene.

AB Aims Isolating a novel bacterial source of fructan from a saltern and analysis of its genome to better understand the possible roles of fructans in hypersaline environments.
   Methods and Results Bacteria were isolated from crude salt samples originating from camalti Saltern in Western Turkey and screened for fructanogenic traits in high-salt and sucrose-rich selective medium. Exopolysaccharide accumulated in the presence of sucrose by isolate OK12 was purified and chemically characterized via HPLC, FT-IR and NMR, which revealed that it was a levan-type fructan (beta-2,6 linked homopolymer of fructose). The isolate was taxonomically classified as Bacillus licheniformis OK12 through 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome sequencing methods. Strain OK12 harbours one levansucrase and two different levanase genes, which altogether were predicted to significantly contribute to intracellular glucose and fructose pools. The isolate could withstand 15% NaCl, and thus classified as a halotolerant.
   Conclusions Fructanogenic traits in halotolerant B. licheniformis OK12 are significant due to predicted influx of glucose and fructose as a result of levan biosynthesis and levan hydrolysis, respectively.
   Significance and Impact of the Study Fructans from the residents of hypersaline habitats are underexplored compounds and are expected to demonstrate physicochemical properties different from their non-halophilic counterparts. Revealing fructanogenic traits in the genome of a halotolerant bacterium brings up a new perspective in physiological roles of fructans.

AB The genetic structure of a population can provide important insights into animal movements at varying geographical scales. Individual and social behaviors, such as philopatry and dispersal, affect patterns of relatedness, age and sex structure, shaping the local genetic structure of populations. However, these fine scale patterns may not be detected within broader population genetic structure. Using SNP genotyping for pairwise relatedness estimates, we investigated the spatial and genetic structuring of 141 red foxes within south-central Sweden at two scales. First, we looked at broad scale population structuring among red foxes at the regional level. We then estimated pairwise relatedness values to evaluate the spatial and genetic structure of male, female and mixed sex pairs for patterns of philopatry and dispersal at a more localized scale. We found limited genetic differentiation at the regional scale. However, local investigations revealed patterns of female philopatry and male biased dispersal. There were significant differences in pairwise geographic distances between highly related same sex pairs with the average distance between related males, 37.8 km, being six times farther than that of related females, averaging 6.3 km. In summary, the low levels of genetic differentiation found in this study illustrates the mobility and dispersal ability of red foxes across scales. However, relatedness plays a strong role in the spatial organization of red foxes locally, ultimately contributing to male biased dispersal patterns.

AB This article analyses the factors underlying the spatial distribution of a rodent community in the arid conditions of the Caspian Lowland. Based on a habitat selection model, we hypothesized that sympatric species would occupy and utilize species-specific environmental habitats and resources in common spaces and that niche overlap between species would be low. Thirteen environmental parameters were chosen for study. Nine parameters significantly discriminated interspecies differences (Meriones meridianus occurred in dry microhabitats, Meriones tamariscinus occurred in wetter microhabitats, and Apodemus witherbyi and Cricetulus migratorius showed eurybiotic spatial patterns). Mus musculus was predominantly found in wet environmental conditions. Thus, A. witherbyi and C. migratorius were characterized by the greatest range of spatial niches in the community, and M. musculus was characterized by the narrowest range of spatial niches. Pairwise comparisons of rodent spatial niches revealed low overlap values.

AB Coral reefs are among the many communities believed to exhibit regime shifts between alternative stable states, single-species dominance, and coexistence. Proposed drivers of regime shifts include changes in grazing, spatial clustering, and ocean temperature. Here, we distill the dynamic regimes of coral-macroalgal interaction into a three-dimensional geometry based on stability, akin to thermodynamic phase diagrams of state transitions, to facilitate analysis. Specific regime-shifting forces can be understood as trajectories through the cubic regime geometry. This geometric perspective allows us to understand multiple forces simultaneously in terms of the stability and persistence of interacting species. For example, in a coral-macroalgal community, grazing on macroalgae leads to alternative stable states when there is no spatial clustering (e.g., high habitat connectivity), while warming decreases coexistence. However, with spatial clustering, grazing promotes coexistence because of elevated local intraspecific competition. The geometry of regime shifts provides a general framework to analyze two-species communities and can help conservation efforts navigate complexity and abrupt environmental changes.

AB The mhorr gazelle (Nanger dama mhorr) is the westernmost-distributed mama gazelle subspecies and it has been considered extinct in the wild since 1968. Much of the survival of this subspecies depends on its ex situ captive population and future reintroduction projects. However, this subspecies disappeared before it could be well studied; and most of the knowledge regarding the mhorr's ecological requirements in its native range comes from early observations in the 40s and 50s and are general description of their native habitats. In 2015 a group of mhorr gazelle was released in the Safia Nature Reserve (Morocco) as the first step to establish a long-sustainable wild mhorr gazelle population. This project offered an opportunity to determine the habitat requirements of the mhorr in terms of surface area (size), landscape and the vegetation's characteristics. The results come from seven (2.5) collared adult mhorr gazelles. Once released into the wild, the gazelles explored extensive areas in all directions around the point of release but they established their territories understood as the home range just to the north of the point of release, far from any human presence (borders or roads) and in flat areas where the acacia tree cover was abundant; the core areas were settled also in the most flat and vegetated areas inside the home range. All the gazelles except one female occupy the same region with a very high overlap in their home range (between 28.4 and 75.8%). Regarding the extent of the home range (average 119.9 +/- 27.5 km(2)) and core areas (average 20 +/- 4.2 km(2)) depends on time of sampling and highlight the differences between the space needed by the mhorr gazelles to satisfy their needs in the wild and the space provided for the species in previous reintroduction projects in fenced-off areas.

TI Fairy circles in Namibia are assembled from genetically distinct grasses
SO COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DESERT; HYPOTHESES; DISCOVERY; GRASSLAND; FORMAT; PLANTS
AB Fairy circles are striking regularly sized and spaced, bare circles surrounded by Stipagrostis grasses that occur over thousands of square kilometres in Namibia. The mechanisms explaining their origin, shape, persistence and regularity remain controversial. One hypothesis for the formation of vegetation rings is based on the centrifugal expansion of a single individual grass plant, via clonal growth and die-back in the centre. Clonality could explain FC origin, shape and long-term persistence as well as their regularity, if one clone competes with adjacent clones. Here, we show that for virtually all tested fairy circles the periphery is not exclusively made up of genetically identical grasses, but these peripheral grasses belong to more than one unrelated genet. These results do not support a clonal explanation for fairy circles. Lack of clonality implies that a biological reason for their origin, shape and regularity must emerge from competition between near neighbor individuals within each fairy circle. Such lack of clonality also suggests a mismatch between longevity of fairy circles versus their constituent plants. Furthermore, our findings of lack of clonality have implications for some models of spatial patterning of fairy circles that are based on self-organization. Christian Kappel et al. examine the genetic composition of fairy circles, regular circular patterns of grasses in the Namib Desert, using ddRAD-seq. They find that these grasses are made up of multiple unrelated genets rather than genetically identical grasses, suggesting non-clonality.

AB The majority of previous studies on the value modulation of attention have shown that the magnitude of value-driven attentional bias correlates with the strength of reward association. However, relatively little is known about how uncertainty affects value-based attentional bias. We investigated whether attentional capture by previously rewarded stimuli is modulated by the uncertainty of the learned value without the influence of the strength of reward association. Participants were instructed to identify the line orientation in the target color circle. Importantly, each target color was associated with a different level of uncertainty by tuning the variation in reward delivery (Experiment 1) or reward magnitude (Experiment 2). Attentional interference for uncertainty-related distractors was greater than that for certainty distractors in Experiments 1 and 2. In addition, uncertainty-induced attentional bias disappeared earlier than attentional bias for certainty. The study demonstrated that uncertainty modulates value-based attentional capture in terms of strength and persistence, even when the effect of expected value remains constant.

AB Food selection by foragers is sensitive to the availability of resources, which may vary along geographical gradients. Hence, selectivity of food types by foragers is expected to track these resource gradients. Here we addressed this hypothesis and asked if foraging decisions of seed-eating ants differ along a geographic gradient of habitat productivity. The study was carried out for two years at five sites along a natural climatic gradient, ranging from arid to Mediterranean, where plant productivity varies six-fold across a short geographic distance of 250 km. We found that in ant colonies of the genusMessor, collective foraging decisions differed along the gradient. Specifically, at the high-productivity sites, a stronger association was found between plant seed availability and selectivity, suggesting that colonies respond more accurately to within-patch variation in food amounts. In contrast, colonies in low-productivity sites foraged in patches with higher concentration of seeds, suggesting that they respond more accurately to among-patch variation in food amounts. Moreover, at the high-productivity sites, colonies were more discriminating in their choice of food and preferred bigger seeds, while in the low-productivity sites, where smaller seeds were relatively more abundant, food collection depended mostly on seed availability. An experiment with artificial seed patches performed along the same climatic gradient, revealed no difference in food selectivity across sites when food type and availability were similar, and a general preference for bigger over medium-sized seeds. Overall, our findings suggest that resource availability is an important factor explaining food choice along a climatic gradient and imply that in low-productivity regions small-seeded species incur high predation pressure, whereas in high-productivity regions, large-seeded species suffer higher predation. This could have important consequences for plant species composition, particularly at the face of climate change, which could dramatically alter the foraging decisions of granivores.

AB The set of ancient lakes on Sulawesi, Indonesia, represents a unique global hotspot of aquatic biodiversity. These lakes have been recognized widely because of their high number of endemic species with specialized and distinctive morphological characters, life history and ecological adaptations. An interesting case of unusual life history involving brood care exists in the planorbid limpets of the genus Protancylus, which live exclusively as epizoans on the endemic pachychilid gastropod Tylomelania. We aimed to unravel the evolutionary and phylogeographical patterns of Protancylus from the Malili lakes and Lake Poso using two mitochondrial markers in an integrated framework that includes morphological, life-history and ecological data. At least three species of Protancylus evolved allopatrically, with a newly recognized species occurring in lakes Matano and Mahalona. All species are characterized by low morphological variation, shared life-history traits including a unique reproduction strategy. Our genetic data indicates that a drift-based geographic speciation mode correlates with the present distribution pattern. The initial diversification significantly predates the ages of the respective lakes and the lineages of Protancylus are significantly older than their corresponding Tylomelania `hosts'. The deep split between P. pileolus of Lake Poso and the populations in the Malili lakes is remarkable and hints to a very early separation in a time frame when Sulawesi reached its current composition. As colonization and onset of diversification is strikingly different in Tylomelania and the epizoic Protancylus, co-evolutionary components in this association can be excluded and both evolved largely independently. We discuss and compare our findings to other invertebrate assemblages in the ancient lakes of Sulawesi. (C) 2020 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Body size is a key factor in predicting the outcome of organisms' interaction with their environment. A negative temperature-size relationship (TSR) is claimed to be one of the universal responses to climatic warming. Studies on extant biota also predicted that groups with narrow latitudinal range, tropical affinity, and higher body size would show higher sensitivity to climatic fluctuation. To confirm the generality of these relationships among marine ectotherms, we compiled the data on body size and global temperature over the Cenozoic using a global database of marine molluscs of Class Gastropoda and Bivalvia. Molluscan species do not show any signature of TSR for any taxonomic, regional, or ecological category during the Cenozoic. We did not find any evidence supporting heightened response in groups with limited latitudinal spread or with large body size. The body-size response of tropical species is not different from those of temperate species. Response of infauna and epifauna does not show any difference either and hence, refutes the predicted variation due to difference in their thermal-specialisation. Our results highlight the limited validity of 'universal rules' in explaining the climate-induced morphological response of marine communities in deep time and underscore the complexity in generalising the biotic outcome of climatic fluctuation.

AB Pollution and pesticide use have been linked to evolution of chemical resistance and phenotypic shifts in invertebrates, but less so in vertebrates. Here we provide evidence that poisoning directed towards a mammalian carnivore, the dingo (Canis dingo), is linked to an increase in dingo body mass. We compared the skull length of dingoes, a proxy for size, from three regions where dingo populations were controlled by distributing poisoned meat baits and an unbaited region, before and after the introduction of the toxin sodium fluoroacetate (Compound 1080). Following 1080 introduction, dingo skull length increased in baited regions but not in the unbaited region. We estimate that after 1080 introduction, the skull length of female and male dingoes in baited regions increased by 4.49 and 3.6 mm, respectively. This equates to a 1.02- and 0.86-kg increase in mean body masses of female and male dingoes, respectively. We hypothesize that dingo body size has increased in baited regions due to 1080 selecting for animals with larger body size or because a reduction in dingo abundance in baited areas may have removed constraints on growth imposed by intraspecific competition and prey availability. Our study provides evidence that pesticide use can prompt phenotypic change in comparatively large and long-lived large vertebrates.

AB Theoretical models suggest that ecosystems can be found in one of several possible alternative stable states, and a shift in structural stable state (SSS) can trigger a change in functional stable state (FSS). But we still lack the empirical evidence to confirm these states and transitions, and to inform the rates of change. Here, a 30-yr dataset from long-term ungrazed and grazed temperate grasslands was analyzed to determine whether abrupt transitions of SSS and FSS can occur. We found that the long-term ungrazed grassland experienced abrupt transitions in the dominant plant functional type (shift in SSS) that was followed by a transition between carbon sink and source 1-2 year later (shift in FSS). A directional shift in precipitation and temperature accounted for 40% of the variation in the SSS transition, while the SSS transition explained 20% of the variation in the FSS transition. In contrast, no abrupt transitions for SSS and FSS were observed in the long-term moderately grazed grassland. These findings provide important insight into the interacting effects of climate change and livestock grazing on ecosystem transitions in temperate grasslands. Moderate utilization of production in ecosystems that have co-evolved with herbivores can offset structural and functional transitions induced by climate change.

AB From year-to-year, environment is becoming one of the major concerns of human societies. Few studies have investigated the biological processes involved in environmental scene perception. Here, we initiate a line of research by beginning to study emotional processes involved in this perception. Our results demonstrate a clear distinction between "Clean" and "Polluted" environments according to the pleasure and approach desire ratings they induced. Moreover, women expressed higher pleasure in the "Clean" condition, as did older participants. Finally, rural scenes induced higher pleasure in participants than urban ones.

AB Analysis of craniometric structure based on four skull measurements has been performed in 37Martes martespopulations to assess their size distribution within the species range. The results show that groups of martens with the smallest skull size live in the northeastern part of European Russia (the Sukhona, Vyatka, Kama, Sylva, and Chusovaya river basins; 48 degrees-58 degrees N, 55 degrees-62 degrees E). The condylobasal length (CL) in males reaches a maximum in southern Sweden and on Menorca Island, with its sample mean value ranging from 80.42 to 88.00 mm; in females, in northern Sweden and Belgium (73.58-80.10 mm). Skull size shows a strong, statistically significant negative correlation with longitude. The correlation of CL with latitude is weaker but also negative and statistically significant, which is not consistent with Bergmann's rule. An inverse trend is observed in the eastern part of the range, where the size of martens is relatively large. In general, variation in size has a polyclinal pattern. The recent size distribution of\M. martesover the range probably reflects the course of initial expansion over Europe of the ancestral species, MioceneMartes laevidens,which had a small body size. These results agree with the hypothesis that the ancestors ofM. marteshad originated in Eastern Europe and then expanded to the west, northwest, and east.

AB Physiological plasticity allows animals to adjust their physiological function to abiotic and biotic variations. It has been mostly studied in the context of response to external factors and not much is known on how animals adjust their physiology to cope with variations in internal conditions. The process of reproduction implies gonadal maturation and other internal changes, bringing various challenges to the animal such as an increased demand for energy and oxygen. Here, the capacity of the sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus to adjust its respiratory function and physiological mechanisms during reproduction was studied using a time-lapse videography and metabolomics approach. The results showed that reproduction caused a significant increase in oxygen consumption in A. japonicus. Interestingly, breeding sea cucumbers can accommodate the high oxygen demand by accelerating respiratory rate. However, to maintain a necessary high level of respiratory activity during reproduction, sea cucumbers need consume large amounts of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In addition, the metabolomic data suggests that oxidative stress and hormone regulation are the physiological mechanisms linking reproduction and respiratory function. Altogether, these findings suggest that plasticity of respiratory function is an effective tactic to cope with high oxygen demand during reproduction.

AB Forests in the montane-Mediterranean zone have only recently began to be affected by wildfires, therefore the knowledge necessary for restoration projects is missing. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of factors related to seedling attributes, weather conditions and site suitability on seedling performance. The characterisation of sites was based on bedrock and soil clay content as well as pre-fire vegetation. Apical growth and survival of seedlings was monitored for four years in Parnitha National Park. The parameters of a linear mixed model were estimated using annual apical growth of seedlings surviving in the end of the study as the dependent variable and type of site, rainfall, initial seedling height and age as explanatory ones. A quantile regression model using all the data available was estimated for each year of study, taking into account only initial height and site type as well as a logistic regression model of survival. The findings indicate that the growth of Greek fir seedlings depends on May rainfall mediated by soil clay content, which in turn depends on bedrock, which is consistent with the "inverse texture hypothesis". Sites with low soil clay content were always more beneficial for survival, which was stronger affected by summer-autumn rainfall. In both contexts, drought stress due to soil clay content fades with increasing age. Sites that were not fir dominated prior to fire proved unsuitable also for planting fir seedlings. A minor part of the observed variability could be associated with the initial height of seedlings, especially for seedlings showing high rates of apical growth.

AB The advent of electronic documentation systems has made it easy to generate and store vast amounts of information, and has enabled easy access to patient care information, so much so that they are now considered a critical infrastructure for supporting the cognitive tasks in healthcare work. But, electronic documentation systems are not without their share of problems. Accountability and liability requirements have made electronic information creation and documentation particularly challenging. Mandatory documentation requirements and templated electronic formats have increased the amount of information, but have not always resulted in reliable, useful, or meaningful information. Documentation systems have become rigid, offering little opportunity for healthcare providers to engage in meaningful conversations about the information, and to sense problem status without additional coordination. A particularly significant information interaction problem that we have identified from our field work in healthcare information modeling, which this paper focuses on, deals with what we term creator-consumer interaction behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to examine in-depth the problem of creator-consumer information interaction behaviors in electronic healthcare documentation systems. A creator-consumer interaction behavioral framework highlights satisficing behavior during creation and consumption of medical documentation, and the characteristics of the work system that may lead to satisficing on documentation tasks.

AB Microorganisms play an important role in the formation and decomposition of clay minerals. In this research the release of iron, silicon and non-exchangeable potassium from vermiculite owing to heterotrophic bacteria was examined. For this, an experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design at three replications. The experiment factors consisted of bacterial inoculation (control, Pseudomonas sp. Rhizo_9, Enterobacter cloacae Rhizo_33) and incubation period (7, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days). Results showed a significant effect of bacterial inoculation and incubation period on silicon, non-exchangeable potassium and iron release. The most active release of potassium, silicon and iron was recorded at the presence of Enterobactercloacae on the 15, 30 and 45 days after the incubation, respectively. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the organic acids in the culture broth of both strains exhibited spots of malic, tartaric and citric acid, produced by Pseudomonas sp. and oxalic, tartaric and unknown acid produced by Enterobactercloacae. The XRD results of mineral decomposition with bacterial treatments indicated converted vermiculite with limited expansion into expansible smectite.

AB Effective conservation requires prioritizing areas that are vulnerable to large, irreversible changes. Unfortunately, rigorously documenting these changes with experiments and long-term monitoring is not only costly, but may provide evidence that is too late to facilitate proactive decisions.
   We use a simple model to illustrate that commonly available short-term spatial, "snapshot", data from a given ecosystem along an environmental gradient can be used to identify environmental conditions under which different ecosystem states (e.g. different species compositions) co-occur in space. These environmental conditions are those under which future perturbations have the potential for discontinuous large, sometimes irreversible, effects; and can be mapped in space to predict potential spatial hotspots of ecosystem fragility.
   We apply these insights to ecologically important high-elevation subalpine meadows of the Sierra Nevada (California). Our analysis reveals specific areas within meadows that may be more vulnerable than others because their plant communities have the potential to shift to a different state. These shifts can be mechanistically explained by interactions between the vegetation and the local water regimes and/or the upper soil conditions.
   Our study provides a simple workflow using commonly available data to help prioritize conservation areas based on their potential sensitivity to upcoming perturbations. Such an approach could be very valuable to make most efficient use of conservation and management resources in the context of ongoing global changes.

AB Clutch size and number of clutches per reproductive cycle are important life history traits that can he influenced by anatomical, physiological, evolutionary, and ecological factors. This report on the clutch size and number of clutches of an endemic Mexican whiptail lizard, Aspidoscelis costatus costatus (Cope, 1878), is based on a study of population at an unusually high elevation for a member of this genus. The study site is located in Ixtapan de la Sal, southeastern Estado de Mexico, Central Mexico, at 2090 m a.s.l. Lizards were sampled in June 2006, and from May to July 2007, where females of Aspidoscelis costatus costatus were collected by hand along a drift fence. Female reproductive condition was evaluated based on abdominal palpation for presence of developing eggs; clutch size was determined by actual counts of either vitellogenic follicles or oviductal eggs. The smallest reproductive female was 77 mm snout-vent length; females produced a minimum of two clutches during the breeding season, the mean clutch size of 6.5 eggs (n = 33) was one of the largest reported for the genus. However, both length and width of its eggs, and the relative clutch mass have not been diminished by development of a large clutch. Additionally, comparisons of clutch size were undertaken within the polytypic A. costatus complex, within the genus Aspidoscelis, and between certain genera of whiptail lizards. This apparently represents the first study of whiptail lizards (genus Aspidoscelis), assessing the aforementioned reproductive characteristics, in a population above 2000 m.

AB Body size, growth, and longevity in Northern Map Turtles (Graptemys geographica) from Dewart Lake in northern Indiana were studied from 1979 to 2016. Based on captures of 214 males (72 recaptures) and 99 females (40 recaptures), we generated von Bertalanffy growth equations which corroborated our growth curves based on counts of plastral growth rings and recaptured turtles. Females diverge from males in their faster growth by the end of their second season. Our oldest females were only 18-20 seasons old, and the oldest males were only 13-15 seasons old, suggesting a short generation time and a possible sexual difference in longevity. For the species, we detected no latitudinal pattern of size or age at maturity but found some support for a latitudinal increase in body size in accordance with Bergmann's Rule.

AB The Mediterranean coastal dune habitat of Israel is diminishing rapidly, mostly due to massive urbanization, changes in habitat characteristics caused by dune stabilization and the presence of Acacia saligna, an invasive species brought to Israel for the purpose of dune stabilization. In this study we document the effect of sand stabilization on the composition of small mammal communities in the Ashdod-Nizzanim sands, Israel. We analyzed differences in species diversity and abundance for species of rodents in four types of habitat: unstable (mobile) sand dune, semi-stabilized dune, inter-dune depression and a plot of the invasive Acacia saligna. Rodent communities were found to undergo gradual changes concurrently with the stabilization of the sands. The mobile dune was the only habitat in which the strict psammophiles Jaculus jaculus and Gerbillus pyramidum were captured in abundance. No species commensal with human were captured neither in the mobile nor in the semi-stabilized dunes. However, in the inter-dune depression there was quite a large representation of Mus musculus, a rodent commensal with humans. The Acacia saligna plot had the lowest number of captures and the lowest rodent biomass calculated, with Mus musculus composing nearly half of the captures. The results of this study demonstrate that stabilization of the sands in Ashdod-Nizzanim area is associated with the disappearance of psammophile rodents and the appearance of species commensal with humans. In order to preserve the habitat for psammophile rodents, measures should be taken to halt the spread of acacia and the continuing stabilization of the sands.

AB Acoustic communication in many anuran species can show the effects of both natural and sexual selection. This is reflected in the sexually dimorphic anatomy of the larynx and ear structures, as well as the allometric relationship of these morphological traits to head or body size. In this study, we examined laryngeal and ear structures of cricket frogs Acris crepitans not only as sexually dimorphic characteristics, but also as they differ across populations in environmentally different habitats. We used 2-way ANOVA to determine whether the volumetric or linear measurements of these structures differed by sex and population. Females have significantly larger body, head, and ear sizes, but significantly smaller larynges than males. Furthermore, females as well as males show larger body and head sizes, ears, and larynges in a dryer open habitat. An ANCOVA analysis shows that males, but not females, differ in laryngeal size across populations beyond the allometric changes attributable to head size alone indicating that males have a greater degree of laryngeal population variation. In contrast, our covariate analysis found that in both sexes many of the ear differences are non-significant once head size is accounted for, suggesting that most of the population-level ear variation is due to allometric effects of body size. We conclude that although both sexes show size differences in the larynx related to selection for larger body size in dry, open habitats, selection on males for larger larynx size related to the production of lower frequency calls in those habitats does not result in correlated changes in the female larynx. The results suggest that in anurans, selection for changes in body and head size affects both sexes equally, male calls and the vocal structures responsible for them can further diversify without concordant changes in females.

AB Foraging and operant models suggest that animals will tolerate uncertainty or risk to obtain food quickly. In modern food environments, sustained access to quick energy-dense foods can promote weight gain. Here, we used a discrete-choice procedure to examine peoples' decisions about when next to eat high-value, palatable food rewards, probabilistically delivered immediately or following longer delays. In Experiment 1, moderately hungry young females showed consistent preferences for a variable delay option that delivered food rewards immediately or following long delays over a fixed delay option that delivered the same rewards following intermediate delays. These preferences were stronger in females with higher BMIs compared with lower BMIs, suggesting that quick food can enhance the value of uncertain or 'risky' food-seeking strategies in individuals vulnerable to future weight gain. In Experiment 2, prior exposure to a subtle and not easily identifiable food aroma increased selections of the variable delay option following delayed food rewards in a mixed sample of male and female adults, providing preliminary evidence that food cues can sustain uncertain food-seeking strategies. These data highlight a working hypothesis that the rapid delivery and consumption of food rewards, and food cues, can increase risk-tolerance in the food-seeking behaviours of individuals who are vulnerable to weight gain.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Risk taking and impulsive behaviour: fundamental discoveries, theoretical perspectives and clinical implications'.

AB Species translocations are increasingly being used as a management tool to mitigate population losses due to such factors as habitat degradation and fragmentation, but post-introduction follow-up is relatively sparse. Post-translocation telemetry can assess success by identifying activity, emigrations, survival, habitat usage, and reproductive events, aiding in the continued management of translocated populations and informing future efforts. This study assessed movement of translocated adult lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) immediately post-release and a decade later, and tested for associations between environmental variables and spawning movements. Prior to their translocation in 2002, 13 of 51 adult lake sturgeon were surgically implanted with radio telemetry tags and tracked for 1 year. In 2011 and 2013, eight additional adults were captured within the reintroduction site and implanted with radio-tags. Six of the 13 sturgeon tagged in 2002 dispersed downstream over a dam during the early post-release period. In spring 2014, tagged adults were tracked to the spillway at the release area's inflow, and spawning was confirmed by larval captures. Movement data for tagged adults differed between the two tracking periods, showing marked differences in behaviour over time. Water velocity was correlated with upstream and downstream spawning movements, with water temperature also correlated with downstream movement. Research regarding post-translocation movement and dispersal provides insight on behavioural responses following translocation, and may improve outcomes by informing future efforts.

AB Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) comprised of mixed seagrass and algae species in shallow water has gathered more attention in recent studies at local, regional, and global scales. The objective of this research is to validate and to investigate the potential of several spectral indices for percentage of submerged aquatic vegetation cover (PSAVC) density mapping in the southwest of Arabian-Gulf. The analysis was based on Landsat-OLI data and field sampling (seabed-truth). Statistical test has been undertaken using regression analysis with a confidence interval of prediction p < 0.05. Image data were radiometrically calibrated, atmospherically corrected, as well as geometrically rectified. For validation purposes, field sampling campaign was organised simultaneously with OLI image acquisition for 55 selected sampling locations associated with shallow water areas (-0.5 to -7 m depth) with variable biomass cover. The, predicted percentage cover was derived from OLI image data and statistically validated against seabed-truth (observations) extracted from underwater vertical digital photos for each sampling location using Isodata classier. The results obtained showed that only four indices are characterized by significant fits. The best fit (R-2 of 0.93) was obtained using Difference-Index exploiting the blue and green bands, followed by Simple-Ratio the VIN (R-2 of 0.81), then the MNDWI (R-2 of 0.76), and finally the VARI (R-2 of 0.66).

AB Noy-Meir's simple but insightful model of grazing-system dynamics was used to draw broader inferences from empirical data generated by a 17-year field trial with beef cattle grazing a Mediterranean grassland in northern Israel. After calibration of its parameters against the field results, the model predictions were tested against an independent set of data obtained from the study site; they were within acceptable deviations from the inherently noisy field data. The calibrated model was used to analyse the effects of changes to two key grazing-management factors - stocking density and early-season grazing deferment - on biomass dynamics and forage consumption. The simulated results were used to calculate forage deficits and supplementary feed requirements for optimum herd performance during the growth ('green') season and throughout the year. The results revealed a critical stocking density of 0.7 Animal Units (AU)/ha, above which early-season deferment reduced the amount of supplementary feed required to maintain the optimum production of the herd. Optimum stocking is higher when the grassland is used mainly in the highly nutritious green season. Responses of the strongly seasonal Mediterranean grassland to the interaction between stocking density and early-season grazing deferment were expressed by a calibrated model, in terms that determine the efficiency of forage supplementation of the herd during the green season and throughout the year.

AB THIRTY-FOUR actinobacteria strains were recovered from diorite rocks of South Sinai, Egypt, using direct isolation. The predominant types were Streptomyces and Nocardioides (8 strains, each), followed by Kitasatosporia and Nocatdiopsis (4 strains, each). Twenty-five strains were active against Escherichia coil NCMB 11943, two clinical cultures (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans) and/or three solid tumor cell lines (colon C38, colon H-116, lung H-125 M).
   One strain showed potent activity towardsS. autrus,C. albicans and inhibited colon HCT116 and liver HepG2 carcinoma cell lines at IC50 3.2 and 1.3 mu g/ml, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated its identity as Micromonaspora citrea, at 99.6% similarity. MALDI/TOE-MS analysis of its metabolic extract revealed 18 compound masses, molecular weight range of 585.52 to 669.64Da. Statistical general full factorial design indicated varying effects of four - carbon and three-nitrogen sources on its bioactivity. Starch and potassium nitrate at 1% w/v, as C- and N-sources, respectively, were significantly effective for enhancing the antitumor activity up to 1.3-fold (P = 0.007).
   M. citrea extract revealed non-significant cytotoxic effects in rats, at 10mg/kg injection dose, every two days for two weeks. The kidney and liver functions were not significantly impaired, as indicated from results of serum enzymatic activities, urea, total protein and albumin levels. The strain was deposited at the Egyptian Microbial Culture Collection as M citrea SP1 EMCC 1923 and was patent registered (Egyptian Patent Office, No. 655). These results indicate the importance of actinobacteria inhabiting arid rocks of Sinai for production of promising antibiotic leads.

AB Background: The new glasses from harmful environmental waste such as cement dust; limestone phosphate, sand and borax (Genkare) were manufactured. Investigation of the radioactivity present in these materials (Phosphate rock, cement dust, limestone, sand and borax) enables one to assess any possible radiological hazard to humankind by such materials. Materials and Methods: Fifteen samples were collected from five locations. Activity measurements have been performed by gamma-ray spectrometer, employing a high-resolution scintillation detector Nal (TI) crystal 3 x 3 inch. In addition, the radiological hazards were calculated for the investigated samples. Results: The average values of activity ranged from 28 +/- 2 to 163 +/- 12, 2.8 +/- 0.7 to 40 +/- 3 and from 49 +/- 4 to 1337 +/- 74 Bq kg-1 for R-226, Th-232 and( 40)K, respectively. The values of absorbed dose rates, radium equivalent activities and annual effective dose due to Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 respectively, are ranged from 22.05 to 101.59 nGy h-1, 45.90 to 224.22 Bq kg(-1) and 27.04 to 124.59 mu Sv y-1. In addition, the values of external hazard index, internal hazard index and gamma index have been calculated. Conclusions: According to the obtained results, all materials would not present a significant radiological hazard except phosphate. The results of the study could serve as important baseline radiometric data for future epidemiological studies and monitoring initiatives.

AB Xenarthra is one of the most peculiar mammalian groups to have originated in South America, where most of its evolutionary history has taken place. Xenarthrans have experienced significant climatic changes and also geographical isolation for most of the Cenozoic. Thus, the cranial morphology of xenarthrans may reflect the different pressures that the group is currently undergoing. Our objective is to identify the drivers of phenotypic variation of the skull (both shape and size) in widespread representatives of the superorder Xenarthra throughout South America. We tested the influence of allometry and neutral and niche processes on three extant species, using a geometric morphometric approach: the three-toed sloth Bradypus variegatus, the lesser anteater Tamandua tetradactyla, and the armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus. Our results show that allometry is present, but has a weak effect on shape variation. Geography has a greater impact than allometry in explaining the size variation of T. tetradactyla and the shape of B. variegatus which is, interestingly, the only studied species that follows Bergmann's rule. Most importantly, the environment drives most of the variation in the shape and size of the three species studied. The responses of B. variegatus and T. tetradactyla to geographical space are congruent with their low mobility and more limited dispersal. The environment mainly affected B. variegatus (e.g., following Bergmann's rule), probably because of its particularly low metabolism, and D. novemcinctus, due to its high dispersal capacity.

AB Ferula ovina is a forage species, and of the species that is very important in soil conservation and water protection in the rangelands. It has become an endangered species in Iran due to regular cutting and overgrazing. The focus of this study is to investigate the effect of ecological factors on distribution of F. ovina in the study area. Samples were collected from three habitats (sites) where F. ovina was present along with three sites which did not have it. Three 150 m transects were established based on random-systematically method on each site. On each transect, 10 square plots (2x2 m) were set up, and soil surface features were measured. Climatologic factors were assessed and physiographic factors were extracted for each site. Soil samples were collected from a 0-30 cm depth for each transect, and the values of soil were determined through laboratory analysis. According to the results, a significant difference was found for the parameters of elevation, slope, aspect, temperature, EC, pH, OC, phosphorus, clay, silt and sand (P <= 0.01) between habitats where F. ovina were present and absent. Results of discriminant analysis suggested that the amount of sand and gravel on soil surface, phosphorous, clay, and EC were effective factors in the distribution of target species.

AB The release of captive dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) from South Korean marine parks, which occurred in 2013, 2015, and 2017, is described and evaluated for its usefulness for conservation of coastal ecosystems. The campaign to free the dolphins created a flagship species, uniting the efforts of national government agencies, local government, and NGOs. However, the Korean management agencies framed the release as a species-specific conservation intervention, while the NGOs brought forward welfare-based demands for the curtailment of cetacean captivity. We argue that the release of the Korean dolphins changed the policy climate, to facilitate two major policy changes: revision of anti-whaling regulations to prohibit capture of cetaceans for exhibit, and improvement of regulations for rescue, rehabilitation, and release of stranded marine animals. Tradeoffs between welfare and conservation concerns are described in terms of risk for the management agency, welfare for the animals, and feasibility of a continued commitment to maintain the viability of the dolphin stock in the wild. The release of captive animals to their native range relies on a single-species conservation focus which poses little risk for management agencies but does not guarantee their continued commitment.

AB A biomonitoring field study was conducted to test the deposition of airborne metals on chicken eggshell. The goal was to correlate PM2.5 particle concentration in air, absolute (metals in air) and relative (metals in PM2.5 particles) metals, and metal accumulation on eggshell. The PM2.5 sample was collected for 8 h at different air pollution sites as well as an unpolluted site with glass fiber filters via a fine particulate sampler (with and without addition of eggshell). The PM2.5 particle concentration was high at a cement factory site and low at a sugar factory site. The highest absolute total mass of metal (total mass of all metals in air) was found in the traffic site, and the highest relative total mass of metal (total mass of all metals in PM2.5 particles) was found at the tannery factory. The accumulation of Zn and Pb in eggshell was high at the tannery and sugar factory sites, and Fe was high in the other areas. Three common metals including Cd, As, and Pb were found with significant positive correlation between absolute and relative metals with the metals accumulated in eggshell. The results concluded that the eggshells might be useful tools for monitoring the airborne metals.

AB This study reports on the identity and coverage of rocky intertidal species in the major inlets of Floridas Atlantic coast. From north to south, these inlets are Fort George, St. Augustine, Ponce De Leon, Port Canaveral, Sebastian, Fort Pierce, Jupiter, Lake Worth, Boca Raton, Port Everglades, Bakers Haulover, and Port of Miami. Dominant coverage in the southerly inlets included star corals (Siderastrea radians, 62% Port of Miami), ribbed barnacles (Tetraclita stalactifera, 18% Port Everglades), and zoanthid corals (Palythoa sp., 40% Bakers Haulover). In the north, the community shifted and species absent in the south became common (e.g., eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica, 9% Fort George, 15% St. Augustine; the macroalga Enteromorpha lactuca, 10% Fort George, 17% Sebastian Inlet). The invasive bryozoan Bugula neritina was always present north of the Port of Miami and was a major community component north of Port Everglades (e.g., 27% Fort Pierce Inlet and 22% Ponce de Leon Inlet). Correlations between intertidal populations and environmental indicators included the oyster C. virginica with various sea surface temperature (SST) parameters (e.g., inverse correlations with max SST, R-2 = 0.81, p = .038). Likewise, the coralline alga Pneophyllum fragile was correlated with various SST parameters (e.g., min SST, R-2 = 0.51, p = .020). Bare rock and B. neritina both showed inverse correlations with the human population of inlet drainage basins (R-2 = 0.28, p = .040 and R-2 = 0.33, p = .026, respectively), the latter relationship an unexpected pattern for a notorious invader. These data show latitudinal patterns and provide baselines for future comparisons in the wake of projected climate change.

   Gamma(1) - {(q, r) :q(a) - a[2a(p) - (p-2)]/a(p) - (p-1),

   (ii) r <= n(2)(*),(p)q and (q, r) lies on or below the curve inverted right perpendicular1, where n(1,p)(*) and n(2,p)(*) are 1/P
   two positive constants, and C-p(*); (P-2 +(3)p-4+P root P-2+6P-7/4) (1/p). Then on the (lambda,vertical bar|u|vertical bar infinity)-plane, we give a classification of three qualitatively different bifurcation curves: an S-shaped curve, a broken S-shaped curve, and a monotone increasing curve. Hence we are able to determine the exact multiplicity of positive solutions by the values of q, r and lambda.

AB When evaluating the wettability formed in the process of underground mining of coal dust, it is important to take into account not only the brand of coal produced, determined by the output of volatile substances and vitrinite reflectance, but also its physical properties (moisture content, ash content), and petrographic features and chemical formula. The workers of the coal industry are the most susceptible to the influence of harmful factors, including the effects of coal and rock dust. Thus, according to the data for 2013, in Kemerovo region, where the rate of occupational diseases is the highest, and per 10 thousand of the employed population, it equals 14,4 of those found in coal mines. All together, there are 322 occupational diseases found among drifters and stope miners: 95. among the drivers of mining excavation machines, 95. among the underground electricians, and 51. among underground miners. The article presents an analysis of existing technologies to combat dust in the coal mines of the Kemerovo region. The results of a study of the application of a special wetting agent developed at the Mining University, which can be recommended for spraying during mining operations, are presented.

AB Many aquatic ecosystems are experiencing a decline in their oxygen (O-2) content and this is predicted to continue. Implications of this change on several properties of bacterioplankton (heterotrophic prokaryotes) remain however are poorly known. In this study, oxic samples (similar to 170 mu M O-2 = controls) from an oligohaline region of the Scheldt Estuary were purged with N-2 to yield low-O-2 samples (similar to 69 mu M O-2 = treatments); all were amended with C-13-glucose and incubated in dark to examine carbon incorporation and cell size of heterotrophic prokaryotes, and relationships between organic matter (OM) degradation and phosphate (P) availability in waters following O-2 loss. Stable isotope (C-13) probing of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) and flow cytometry were used. In samples that have experienced O-2 loss, PLFA biomass became higher, prokaryotic cells had significantly larger size and higher nucleic acid content, but P concentrations was lower, compared to controls. P concentration and OM degradation were positively related in controls, but uncoupled in low-O-2 samples. Moreover, the dominant PLFA 16:1 omega 7c (likely mainly from Gram-negative bacteria) and the nucleic acid content of heterotrophic prokaryotic cells in low-O-2 samples explained (62-72 %) differences between controls and low-O-2 samples in P amounts. Shortly after incubations began, low-O-2 samples had consistently lower bacterial PLFA C-13-enrichments, suggesting involvement of facultatively anaerobic metabolism in carbon incorporation, and supporting the view that this metabolic pathway is widespread among pelagic bacteria in coastal nutrient-rich ecosystems. Estimates based on C-13-enrichment of PLFAs indicated that grazing by protozoa on some bacteria was stronger in low-O-2 samples than in controls, suggesting that the grazing pressure on some heterotrophic prokaryotes may increase at the onset of O-2 deficiency in nutrient-rich aquatic systems. These findings also suggest that physiological responses of heterotrophic prokaryotes to O-2 loss in such ecosystems include increases in cell activity, high carbon incorporation, and possibly phosphorus retention by cells that may contribute to reduce phosphate availability in waters.

AB The pattern of increasing species body size with increasing latitude has been noticed in different groups of animals. Here, we used seven key environmental factors and independent contrasts to assess body size latitudinal clines in Cyprinidae at two phylogenetic levels (inter- and intragenera), which were defined using a genus-level supertree. Model selection procedures revealed that environmental factors shaping body size variation in Cyprinidae differed according to the phylogenetic scale considered. At the higher phylogenetic level, we found that both temperature (negative effect) and habitat availability (positive effect of drainage basin surface area) constituted mechanistic explanations of large-scale body size distribution. No temperature-related body size cline was observed at the intragenus level. Instead, competitive interaction (negative effect of species richness), habitat availability (positive effect of drainage basin surface area), migration ability and available energy (positive effects of glacial coverage and actual evapotranspiration) constitute alternative explanations at this lower phylogenetic scale. We conclude that (i) at the intergenus level, cyprinids do show a tendency to be smaller at high temperatures and larger at low temperatures, (ii) this tendency no longer exists at the intragenus level, (iii) latitude per se is a weak predictor of body size clines whatever the taxonomic level analysed, (iv) generalising geographical body size patterns may be rendered difficult by the superimposition of a series of mechanisms across different taxonomic scales, and (v) habitat size, here acting positively at both taxonomic scales, may play a major role in shaping riverine species body size clines.

   WESTERN CAPE; LAYING DATE; BIRDS
AB African Black Oystercatchers Haematopus moquini produce a modal clutch size of two eggs and only rarely lay three eggs. A review of over 4 000 nest records from across their breeding range (dating back to the early 1960s) revealed that three-egg clutches have become more frequent, rising from 2% of recorded clutches before 1975 to >5% since 2000. Three-egg clutches are found predominantly in the south-western Cape and are clustered at specific sites in the region. They are produced earlier in the season compared to smaller clutch sizes and rarely occur after January. As this increase in three-egg clutch frequency is site specific, it might result from either a phenotypically plastic response to local resource availability, or a localised change in breeding system potentially resulting in more than one female laying in the same nest. While increased food availability might be the cause of changes in three-egg clutch frequencies, this is unlikely linked to the spread of the invasive mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Further research is needed to identify the cause of this phenomenon and evaluate how this change may affect the breeding success of this species.

AB Cement plants are responsible for particle and gaseous emissions into the atmosphere. With respect to particle emission, the greater part of is in the range from 0.05 to 5.0 mu m in diameter. In the last years attention was paid to submicron particles, but there is a lack of available data on the emission from stationary sources. In this paper, concentration and size distribution of particles emitted from four cement kilns, in relationship to operational conditions (especially the use of alternative fuel to coal) of the clinker process are reported. Experimental campaigns were carried out by measuring particles concentration and size distribution at the stack of four cement plants through condensation particle counter (CPC) and scanning mobility particle sizer spectrometer (SMPS). Average total particle number concentrations were between 2000 and 4000 particles/cm(3), about 8-10 times lower that those found in the corresponding surrounding areas. As for size distribution, for all the investigated plants it is stable with a unimodal distribution (120-150 nm), independent from the fuel used.Implications:The study provides information on submicron particles emitted from cement kilns in different driving conditions. In particular, the total particle number is modest and considerably lower than that measured in ambient air, whereas the particle size distribution could be influenced by the operational conditions.

AB The Cinnamon Tanager Schistochlamys ruficapillus inhabits semi-open grassy country, primarily in Brazil south of Amazonia. Three subspecies are currently recognized, one of which, S. r. sicki, is poorly known and endemic to the central Brazilian savannas (Cerrado). This paper analyses individual and geographic variation in this species on the basis of body measurements and plumage coloration. Larger birds are usually found farther south and at higher elevations, while smaller birds are found farther north and at lower elevations, as predicted by Bergmann's rule. Nevertheless, some unexpectedly small individuals (referable to S. r. sicki) can be found in central Brazil. Individual and geographical variation in plumage coloration is substantial, but it is not closely tied to variation in body size. Therefore, given the large number of specimens intermediate between the three subspecies, we propose to consider the Cinnamon Tanager a monotypic but highly variable species. The recognition of three subspecies by previous taxonomists was due to small sample sizes associated with large gaps in sampling.

AB Ringing data from the South African bird ringing unit, SAFRING, were analysed to explore variations and trends in population parameters of the Sombre Greenbul Andropadus importunus in southern Africa. Adult and juvenile body mass increased southwards, whereas the relative sizes of wings and bills decreased southwards. Recapture and recovery data indicated that adults have very high site fidelity and suggested that juvenile dispersal is limited. The annual survival rate of adults was on average more than twice that of juveniles and there was little regional variation within either age group. The onset of primary wing moult became progressively later northwards, but the duration of moult did not vary significantly with latitude. Juveniles started their first normally descendent wing moult sequence about one month after adults.

AB Variability is true heterogeneity existing within a population that cannot be reduced or eliminated by more or better determinations. Uncertainty represents ignorance about poorly characterized phenomena, but it can be reduced by collecting more data. The aim of this paper was to study the impact of the variability and uncertainty of the main variables, i.e., emissions and meteorology, of the PM10 concentration caused by a point source located at Malagueno (Cordoba, Argentina). To perform this analysis, a scheme was developed using the USEPA Industrial Source Complex model algorithms with a Monte Carlo methodology. Using a simulation with one hundred thousand iterations, the concentration distribution was obtained and showed that the uncertainty in wind direction had the greatest impact on the estimates.

ID MULTIARMED BANDITS; RATIONAL CHOICE; MODEL
AB We propose a satisficing objective for the multi-armed bandit problem, i.e., where the objective is to achieve performance above a given threshold. We show that this new problem is equivalent to a standard multi-armed bandit problem with a maximizing objective and use this equivalence to find bounds on performance in terms of the satisficing objective. For the special case of Gaussian rewards we show that the satisficing problem is equivalent to a related standard multiarmed bandit problem again with Gaussian rewards. We apply the Upper Credible Limit (UCL) algorithm to this standard problem and show how it achieves optimal performance in terms of the satisficing objective.

AB The Weierstrass elliptic functions can be parameterised using either lattice generators or invariants. Most presentations adopt the former approach. In this paper the authors give formulae that enable conversion between the two representations. Using these, they obtain differential equations satisfied by the mean values of P over its periods; these mean values are considered as functions of the invariants. They show how to construct exact solutions for the means in terms of both hypergeometric functions and Legendre functions. These solutions are valid for both real and complex values of the invariants. For the case of real invariants, the authors prove various monotonicity results for the means with respect to the invariants. They also discuss the numerical computation of the means, and show a number of plots of the means against both real and complex valued invariants. Finally, they consider an application of their results to vegetation patterning in semi-arid landscapes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bergmann's rule (BR) is a classical eco-geographic rule that relates body size of homoiothermal animals with environmental temperature (or latitude). Contemporary data indicate that latitudinal dines in body size, predicted by BR, also exist in ectothermic organisms and in some groups appear to be fairly common. Despite plenty of data from literature, it is still impossible to estimate the frequency of Bergmann's clines occurrence in ectotherms as thoroughly as it is done for homoiotherms. Within large taxa of ectotherms (Arthropoda, Mollusca, Pisces), Bergmann's clines occur alongside with anti-Bergmann's and U-shaped ones. Since classic explanation of BR, which is based on thermoregulation principles, is not applicable to most ectotherms, quite a few hypotheses have been proposed that appeal to other foundations in search of such an explanation. One part of them suggests a direct modifying influence of temperature, though most authors look for adaptive sense in increase of ectotherms size at high latitudes and/or low temperatures. It appears that a single universal explanation of all the cases of Bergmann's variability in ectotherms can not be formulated. Observed clines, as it seems, arise as a result of synergetic interactions between several factors that are covaried with latitude (or altitude above sea level). It is not always possible to estimate the exact contribution of each one of them.

AB Many species are considered to be threatened by the direct and synergistic effects of increased temperatures and less reliable rainfall caused by anthropogenic climate change. The climate of arid Australia is naturally defined by high temperatures and highly variable rainfall. In these environments the survival of small mammals is facilitated by a range of physiological, morphological and behavioural adaptive traits (e.g. insectivorous diets, torpor, nocturnal activity and sheltering in burrows). Features within the landscape associated with these traits may have a proximal influence on species occurrence and be critical for predicting the distribution of arid species. Here we explored the contribution of coarse- and fine-scale environmental variables, sampled from 150 to 10,000 m from known species records, to the development of more robust species distribution models. The inclusion of environmental variables representing topography, soil and vegetation better modelled occurrence for all five small mammal species (up to 55.2 % DE increase over climate-only models) and increased discrimination of species occurrence in an out-of-sample cross-validation for Antechinomys laniger, Dasyuroides byrnei and Notomys cervinus (e.g. increase in area-under-the curve by 0.4). For these species, model performance (% DE) increased with the resolution of environmental data used, reflecting a coarse-scale relationship with distance to watercourse (e.g. at 1,000 m), but masking a fine-scale relationship with rainfall during winter (at 150 m). The inclusion of a fine-scale variable shrub cover under 0.5 m (SD) improved the representation of S. macroura occurrence. These results show improved representation of habitats and resources using course- and fine-scale variables, which may be vital to model the occurrence of some species and their refuge habitats, but as static variables may limit accurate predictions of the effect of climate change on species range dynamics.

AB We and others have previously shown that browsing by large mammalian herbivores can alter the fractal dimension and other architectural properties of plant crowns. Using data from an experiment in northern Sweden which manipulated moose population densities from 0 to 50 moose per 1000 ha and measured architectural responses of birch, Betula pendula and B. pubescens, and Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris, we constructed a simulation model to examine how these changes in plant crown architecture affect moose population dynamics. Architectural changes in birch tree crowns caused forage availability to increase from low to moderate moose population densities, then decline at higher densities. In contrast, forage availability of pine decreased monotonically with increasing moose population density. The model, which incorporated equations fitted to these experimental results, predicted realistic moose population densities for northern Sweden. More importantly, the model also predicted that the quadratic responses of birch crowns to moose browsing results in moose population oscillations on high productivity sites because the moose population density overshoots the maximum birch forage availability then declines. Changes in the geometry of plant canopies caused by mammalian browsers and soil fertility may feed back on the population dynamics of the browsers themselves and even result in complex dynamics such as population oscillations.

AB We consider the existence of multiple positive solutions to the steady state reaction diffusion equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions of the form:
   { -u '' = lambda [u - u(2)/K - c u(2)/1 + u(2) - epsilon], x epsilon (0, 1)
   u (0) = 0 = u(1).
   Here 1/lambda is the diffusion coefficient and K, c and epsilon are positive constants. This model describes the steady states of a logistic growth model with grazing and constant yield harvesting in a spatially homogeneous ecosystem. It also describes the dynamics of the fish population with natural predation and constant yield harvesting. In this paper, we discuss the occurrence of a Sigma-shaped bifurcation diagram for positive solutions. In particular, for certain parameter values of c, K, epsilon and the diffusion coefficient, we prove the existence of at least four positive solutions. We prove our results by the quadrature method.

AB Despite the identification of early-warning signals precluding ecosystems regime shifts, limited evidence exists that they can be used to forecast the actual timing of a critical shift. Here, we propose a probabilistic Bayesian approach to forecast the timing of a shift by combining uncertain prior information about the ecosystem dynamics (parameters and drivers) and sampled spatial and temporal correlation and variance of ecosystem states, which are well known early-warning signals. For an ecosystem of logistically growing vegetation under linear increase in grazing pressure, we show that the use of sampled early-warning signals results in lower prediction uncertainty in forecasted timing of shifts compared to forecasts made with sampled mean state variables. In addition, we show that uncertainty in ecosystem parameters decreases well ahead of a shift. An important conclusion of our study is that the use of early-warning signals in forecasting of shifts is promising, provided that a large number of samples are collected (n approximate to 10(4) in our study). This explains the limited success of finding early warning signals from field studies of real world ecosystems.

AB Landscape ecology planning of a scenery district is the typical application of landscape ecology principles and methods. It focuses on the spatial pattern, ecological process, and especially the relationship between human activities and landscape characteristics in a scenery district. In this paper, the spatial pattern of the Wuyishan Scenery District was studied at two scale levels: 1) landscape elements and 2)the whole landscape. The change in spatial patterns for 10 types of landscapes from 2001 to 2006 was analyzed using diversity, dominance, evenness, and fragmentation. According to widely accepted landscape ecological classification principles, a new characteristic evaluation index system for landscape ecological suitability evaluation for a scenery district, including representativeness, stability, coordination, particularity, ornamental value, society, and gradient, was applied to assess its ecological suitability by the analytic hierarchy process and the composite evaluation index (CEI) was further calculated. By CEI, the ecological suitability of the scenery district was divided into three classes, including urgent landscape, normal landscape, and ideal landscape. (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB The N:P stoichiometry of a water body is one of the most commonly used indicators of its nutrient status. However, in a dynamic aquatic ecosystem the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton is highly variable depending on a range of factors that influence their growth. In this study, a 1D hydrodynamic-ecological model was used to examine how the internal nutrient ratios of phytoplankton relate to nutrient ratios within the water column in Lake Kinneret, Israel. We identified that seasonal patterns of the simulated dissolved inorganic N to total P (DIN:TP) ratios in the water column were a useful indicator of the N:P stoichiometry of the combined phytoplankton community. However, the internal N:P patterns of individual phytoplankton groups did not necessarily relate to DIN:TP patterns. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V.

AB This paper introduces a threshold policy with hysteresis (TPH) for the control of the logistic one-species model, the Lotka-Volterra and Rosenzweig-MacArthur two species density-dependent predator-prey models. A nonstandard scheme is used for the discretization of the models since it results in preservation of the qualitative characteristics of the continuous-time models. Two theorems that establish the global stability of the discrete logistic model subject to the threshold policy (TP) and the TPH are proved. The proposed policy (TPH) is more realistic than a pure threshold policy (TP) proposed earlier in the literature and changes the dynamics of the system in such a way that a low amplitude bounded oscillation, far from the extinction region, is achieved. Furthermore, it can be designed by a suitable choice of so called virtual equilibrium points in a simple and intuitive manner. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Applied landscape ecology is considered to have a limited impact on decision-making. To improve the effectiveness of research, above all, closer cooperation between researchers and nonacademic actors is needed. We argue that a suitable research approach in this context is transdisciplinarity (td). We refer to td as interdisciplinary research that takes place in a complex environment-society context with a strong involvement of non-academic actors during the entire research process. A brief synthesis of a case study focusing on 'Off-site Effects of Soil Erosion on the Swiss Plateau' illustrates a promising application of a td approach.

AB The "patch model" of optimal foraging theory (OFT) assumes that animals choose and exploit patches of food in order to maximise their food intake rate and derives the foraging rules (patch selection and exploitation) to achieve this. While evidence from field studies has been found to be broadly consistent with the predictions of OFT, this does not imply that animals actually forage using OFT rules, however, as the same observations could possibly arise as the result of non-optimising foraging rules (e.g., avoidance of low food intake rate). Because OFT is potentially very useful for the purpose of managing animal production systems (e.g., for predicting and manipulating the intake of grazing dairy cows), it is of interest to know to what extent OFT remains useful if animals actually behave sub-optimally. This paper examines this question by simulating animals foraging in a two-dimensional spatially heterogeneous environment (New Zealand dairy cows grazing grass pasture) using six different foraging rules with varying degrees of optimality. The results showed that both optimal patch selection and optimal patch residence time rules significantly increase intake rate in this type of environment, but differences resulting from use of different variations of the patch selection rules are small. Therefore, although OFT is highly simplified, and animals' senses and knowledge are imperfect, this need not preclude the use of OFT in practical applications, as the predictions of OFT are likely to be similar to the predictions of other, more realistic, foraging strategies, even when these are quite sub-optimal in formulation.

AB The naupliar stages of the Asian copepod, Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides Harada, 1931 are described from laboratory-reared specimens collected near the type locality, in Taiwan. The morphology of the Taiwanese nauplii differs from a previous description of nauplii assigned to Mesocyclops cf. thermocyclopoides from Sri Lanka. The morphology of M. thermocyclopoides also differs in several respects from that of its congeners for which nauplii are known, thus supporting previous statements about the identity of the Sri Lankan specimens as related to M. thermocyclopoides but in reality belonging to a different species. It is speculated that several species, even those with morphologically close forms as adults, have recognizable differences at the earliest developmental stages; our findings in M. thermocyclopoides support the hypothesis that naupliar characters are complementary tools in distinguishing closely related species. The maturation time of M. thermocyclopoides is the shortest known in the genus. This species has the smallest genome size reported for Mesocyclops, a feature presumably related to both their small body size and their short maturation time. These features seem to be most relevant when considering this species for culturing, i.e., as a potential control for vector mosquito larvae.

AB In a natural flat area of deep loess soil in the Negev Desert of Israel, near Sede Boker, the distribution of seeds of different species, in the seed bank, is a result of their strategies of seed dispersal, seed size and structure and seed germination. Samples were collected in summer from 39 plots measuring 350cm(2). In Carrichtera annua (L.) DC., which has a protection strategy, seeds are enclosed in lignified structures as aerial seed banks on the dry and lignified plant until they are dispersed by rain. Of 3244 C. annua seeds, 3110 were found in the aerial seed bank. In Spergularia diandra (Guss.) Heldr. & Sart., which has an escape strategy, the tiny dust-like mature seeds are dispersed into cracks in the soil by wind. Of 1043 seeds, 896 were found in the upper 0-1 cut layer of soil and only 99 at a depth of 1-2 cm. No seeds remained on the dry plants. Neotorularia torulosa (Desf.) Hedge & J. Leonard has developed a dual dispersal strategy. Of 954 N. torulosa seeds, 630 were found protected in the aerial seed bank. The rest were dispersed by wind, 177 escaped into the upper 0-1 cm layer of soil and 147 were at a depth of 1-2 cm.

AB Within the aspen boreal ecosystems, little information exists on the seasonal dynamics of available herbage and the effects of varying defoliation regimes on accumulated herbage growth and associated opportunities for animal production. We examined seasonal changes in herbage phytomass in conjunction with defoliation treatments in Bromus inermis-Poa pratensis grasslands in central Alberta. Changes in herbage pools were examined by sampling at five monthly intervals from April to September 1997 and 1998, inclusive. Vegetation was also subjected to a factorial experiment with an initial defoliation in late-May, June or July, at heights of 2.5, 7.5, or 15 cm, and repeated at 3, 6- or 9-week intervals until the end of September. Green herbage, standing dead and fallen litter increased from spring to summer and decreased from summer to fall. Average growing conditions resulted in a peak phytomass of 350 g m(-2), and varied by year. Weathering losses of green herbage, standing dead and fallen litter over winter were 34%, 52% and 51%, respectively. Dry matter losses of total herbage (all three pools) over winter were 58% of 1997 summer green phytomass. Initial timing, height, and frequency of clipping all affected accumulated herbage yield (P < 0.001). The greatest accumulated herbage yield was from clipping initiated in May. Light clipping resulted in less phytomass accumulation relative to moderate and heavy clipping. Clipping frequencies of six and nine weeks resulted in similar phytomass removal, but were greater than herbage removal associated with three weeks frequency. The interaction between clipping date and frequency of clipping demonstrates the importance of temporal rest and sensitivity of forage plants to defoliation, and lends support to the use of rotational grazing systems.

AB Aesthetic and symbolical relations of humans to nature were not properly considered either in theory or in practice of urban planning as it was carried out in our country in the 1970s and 1980s. The fact, that elements of nature within urban environment play an important role as they partly satisfy the biophila needs of man, i.e. his affinity with plants and animals, was generally neglected.
   The contribution describes the attitudes of inhabitants in the housing estate of the town of Tabor, South Bohemia to the urban environment they live in. Based on the empirical evidence, two conclusions can be arrived at. Absence of nature, at least in its symbolical form, proved to be the factor limiting the "pleasant existence" of the people living within housing estates. Low willingness of inhabitants to actively participate in the process of making their urban environment livable seems to remain one of the most crucial problems inherited from the former totalitarian regime.

AB The abundance and succession of bacterial populations, and their biovolume has been studied in the deepest station of Lake Kinneret, Israel during spring-summer. These parameters were then related to the chemical, biological and physical/hydromechanical conditions in the lake. Medium sized cells (2-3 mu m) dominated the bacterial population in the spring, then in mid-slimmer the smaller cell fraction (1 mu m) took over. Relatively low numbers of large cells (10 mu m) were counted, but the biovolume of this fraction was significant, especially in mid-summer. Both the abundance and biovolume of medium sized cells were positively correlated with NH4+ and O-2 concentrations, but not with NO3-, inorganic orthophosphate (P-i) and Total-P. At water temperatures above 28 degrees C, the biovolume of medium sized cells decreased, probably due to faster grazing of zooplankton. When water circulation in the vertical plane was dominant, large cells disappeared from the water column, due to sinking to the bottom. We conclude that chemical parameters, such as NH4+ and O-2 concentrations, had a long-term effect on bacterial succession and size distribution, whereas hydromechanical mechanisms, such as turbulent mixing in the horizontal or vertical planes, had a short-term effect.

AB Lepidium sisymbrioides comprises three subspecies endemic to South Island, New Zealand. The taxa have very different abundances: L. s. ssp. sisymbrioides is geographically widespread, L. s. ssp. kawarau has a few populations in two localities, and L. s. ssp. matau has only one main population. This study sought ecological reasons for these differences in abundance. Population structures, flowering, and seed production were recorded in two populations of Lepidium sisymbrioides ssp. sisymbrioides (Patearoa, Pisa Flats), two populations oft. s. ssp. kawarau (Slapjack Creek, Falls Dam), and the only known population oft. s. ssp. matau (Galloway). Seed germination for each population was tested in vitro. Germination, growth, flowering, and rosette production were recorded in reciprocal sowings of seed from the five populations in soils from each of the sites. Taxonomic characters were compared between plants of these five and a third population oft. s. ssp. kawarau also grown in these soils. lit vitro seed germination varied between populations and between years. L. s. ssp. kawarau seeds from Falls Dam failed to germinate in vitro, and their germination rates in soil were lower than those of the other populations. Seedling growth rates were similar between populations. Falls Dam L, s. ssp. kawarau plants grown from seed flowered one (male) or two (female) years later than those of the same sexes from other populations. Thereafter, flowering rate and frequency, and rosette production, did not differ markedly between populations in cultivation, as was also the case in the wild. Soil bioassay (Lolium perenne dry weights) indicated that soils occupied by L. sisymbrioides plants were more fertile than adjacent soils, but there were no differences in fertility between the soils occupied by different populations oft. sisymbrioides: There was a gradient of taxonomic characters between two populations oft, s. ssp. sisymbrioides and L. s. ssp. matau, between three populations oft. s. ssp. kawarau, and between these two main groupings. Differences in germination, growth, reproduction, and population structure between taxa and populations did not explain their relative abundance in the wild.

AB The United States submarine Memphis grounded in approximately 10 m water depth on a tropical coral reef off southeast Florida in February, 1993. The grounding caused extensive physical and biological damage to the reef substrate and to the coral community. As part of a claim by the State of Florida against the United States, the impact of the grounding was assessed, and the area of damage was determined through field and photographic studies. A recovery rate for the reef was assigned from literature estimates. The NOAA Habitat Equivalency Model (HEM) was used to calculate the reef area needed to be replaced in order to compensate for damages. A plan devised to restore the reef included: removal of loose rubble generated from the grounding; stabilization of reef faces in danger of collapse; emplacement of six different types of artificial reefs; transplantation of reef-building corals (15% of the number damaged) to bare damaged substrate and to the artificial reefs; and a 20 year monitoring period to assess restoration plan efficacy. Settlement of the claim in April, 1997 resulted in an award of $750,000 to the Ecosystem Management Trust Fund of the State of Florida. Utilization of this fund necessitates a revised plan to restore the damaged reef within economic constraints. This plan will involve rubble removal/stabilization, artificial reef emplacement, stony coral transplantation, and monitoring.

SO FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
LA English
DT Article
AB A model of the attack rate for a grazing herbivore, the citrus rust mite, is obtained as a Type 2 functional response analogous to Holling's disc equation. The attack rate is given by A' = cx'/1 + ct(h)x' (cells mite-1 d-1) where c is the maximum cell attack rate given by c = q-upsilon square-root delta . t(h), q, upsilon and delta are the handling time attack-1, probability of attack, the velocity while grazing, and the total cell density cm-2 respectively. x' is the proportion of the total cells which remain alive. A' needs to be multiplied by the proportion of time spent "grazing" if this is less than one. If y is the mite density in any area having perimeter/area ratio P/a then the emigration rate is given by m' = P/a upsilon/1 + ct(h)x' y (mites cm-2 d-1) m' also needs to be multipled by the proportion of time spent grazing. Egg production rate, E, was assumed proportional to A' so that E = E(max) A'/A'(max) = E(max) (1 + ct(h))x'/1 + ct(h)x' (eggs d-1) where E(max) is the maximum egg production rate when food is maximum (x' = 1).

AB Long-distance dispersal plays a key role in species distribution and persistence. However, its movement metrics and ecological implications may differ whether it is undertaken by juveniles (natal dispersal) or adults (breeding dispersal). We investigated the influence of life stage on long-distance dispersal in the Arctic fox, an important tundra predator. We fitted 170 individuals with satellite collars during a 13-year study on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada), and analysed the tracks of 10 juveniles and 27 adults engaging in long-distance dispersal across the Canadian High Arctic. This behaviour was much more common than expected, especially in juveniles (62.5%, adults: 19.4%). Emigration of juveniles occurred mainly at the end of summer while departure of adults was not synchronized. Juveniles travelled for longer periods and over longer cumulative distances than adults, but spent similar proportions of their time travelling on sea ice versus land. Successful immigration occurred mostly in late spring and was similar for juveniles and adults (30% versus 37%). Our results reveal how life stage influences key aspects of long-distance dispersal in a highly mobile canid. This new knowledge is critical to understand the circumpolar genetic structure of the species, and how Arctic foxes can spread zoonoses across vast geographical areas.

AB The technology of cultivating salt-tolerant limnetic microalgae in seawater reduces the freshwater demand and costs of biodiesel production. However, all current trials still occur on the bench scale, and efforts for pilot-scale operation are urgently needed. This study firstly optimised the diameter of the photobioreactors (PBRs) to 0.2 m, as the single module to produce lipid-rich Golenkinia sp. SDEC-16 because of the better algal growth and light attenuation in the PBRs, and then established a 1000 L algal cultivation system. In a medium of seawater sup-plemented with monosodium glutamate wastewater at a ratio of 1:1000 (S-MSGW), the biomass productivity was 0.26 g/L/d, which was approaching the 0.30 g/L/d obtained in BG11, and the lipid productivity (98.99 mg/L/d) was doubled in comparison to growth in BG11. C16-C18 accounted for more than 98% of the total fatty acid in S-MSGW, and the biodiesel properties also met the biodiesel standards. The input cost of the biodiesel in this pilot -scale system was estimated to be 2.2 $/kg. When considering the carbon reduction and diversified application of the biomass, Golenkinia sp. would annually capture 186.77 kg/m3 PBR of CO2, and yield an output-to-input ratio (OIR) of 3.4 in S-MSGW, higher than the 2.8 in BG11.

AB Nested subset pattern (nestedness) is an important part of the theoretical framework of island biogeography and community ecology. However, most previous studies often used nestedness metrics or randomization algorithms that are vulnerable to type I error. In this study, we investigated the nestedness of lizard assemblages on 37 islands in the Zhoushan Archipelago, China. We used the line-transect method to survey species occurrence, abundance, and habitat types of lizards on 37 islands during 2 breeding seasons in 2021 and 2022. We applied the nested metric WNODF and the conservative rc null model to control for type I error and quantify the significance of nestedness. Spearman rank correlations were used to evaluate the role of 4 habitat variables (island area, 2 isolation indices, and habitat diversity) and 4 ecological traits (body size, geographic range size, clutch size, and minimum area requirement) in generating nestedness. The results of WNODF analyses showed that lizard assemblages were significantly nested. The habitat-by-site matrix estimated by the program NODF was also significantly nested, supporting the habitat nestedness hypothesis. The nestedness of lizard assemblages were significantly correlated with island area, habitat diversity, clutch size, and minimum area requirement. Overall, our results suggest that selective extinction and habitat nestedness were the main drivers of lizard nestedness in our system. In contrast, the nestedness of lizard assemblages was not due to passive sampling or selective colonization. To maximize the number of species preserved, our results indicate that we should protect both large islands with diverse habitats and species with large area requirement and clutch size.

AB Simple Summary Understanding variations in the morphology and age of animals along a geographical gradient may aid in our comprehension of the evolution of these animals. In this view, we studied variation in the age and body size of Andrew's toad (Bufo andrewsi) across 31 populations along a geographical gradient. The results revealed that along with a decrease in the annual mean temperature, the age structure increased, whereas body size did not indicate an increasing trend, showing no support for Bergmann's rule. Precipitation seasonality negatively correlated with longevity and mean age, whereas precipitation of the driest month positively correlated with body size. Moreover, we also found that UV-B seasonality positively correlated with age structure traits and body size. The present study provided critical cues that explain the considerable variability observed in the ecogeographic patterns among Andrew's toads. Environmental variation likely modifies the life-history traits of vertebrates. As ectothermic vertebrates, it is possible that the body size of amphibians is impacted by environmental conditions. Here, we firstly quantified age and body size variation in the Andrew's toad (Bufo andrewsi) across the Hengduan Mountains. Then, we examined the environmental correlates of this variation based on the literature and our unpublished data on the age and body size of the Andrew's toad from 31 populations distributed in southwestern China. Although our analysis revealed significant variations in age and body size across B. andrewsi populations, neither latitude nor altitude correlated with this variability in age and body size. We found that age at sexual maturity, mean age, and longevity increased with decreasing annual mean temperature, whereas age at sexual maturity increased with decreasing temperature seasonality, implying that temperature was a crucial habitat characteristic that modulated age structure traits. Moreover, we revealed positive associations between age structure and UV-B seasonality, and negative relationships between both mean age and longevity and precipitation seasonality. We also found that body size increased with increasing precipitation in the driest month and UV-B seasonality. However, body size did not covary with temperature, signifying no support for Bergmann's rule. These findings help us to understand amphibians' abilities to adapt to environmental variation, which is particularly important in order to provide a theorical basis for their conservation.

AB Savannas are characterized by the coexistence of two contrasting plant life-forms: woody and herbaceous vegetation. During the last decades, there has been a global trend of an increase in woody cover and the spread of shrubs and trees into areas that were previously dominated by grasses. This process, termed bush encroachment, is associated with severe losses of ecosystem functions and typically difficult to reverse. It is assumed to be an example of a critical transition between two alternative stable states. Overgrazing due to unsustainable rangeland management has been identified as one of the main causes of this transition, as it can trigger several self-reinforcing feedback loops. However, the dynamic role of grazing within such feedback loops has received less attention. We used a set of coupled differential equations to describe the competition between shrubs and grasses, as well as plant biomass consumption via grazing and browsing. Grazers were assumed to receive a certain level of care from farmers, so that grazer densities emerge dynamically from the combined effect of vegetation abundance and farmer support. We quantified all self-reinforcing and self-dampening feedback loops at play and analyzed their relative importance in shaping system (in-)stability. Bistability, the presence of a grass dominated and a shrub dominated state, emerges for intermediate levels of farmer support due to positive feedback that arises from competition between shrubs and grasses and from herbivory. We furthermore demonstrate that disturbances, such as drought events, trigger abrupt transitions from the grass dominated to the shrub dominated state and that the system becomes more susceptible to disturbances with increasing farmer support. Our results thus highlight the potential of interaction networks in combinations with feedback loop analysis for improving our understanding of critical transitions in general, and bush encroachment in particular.

AB Epiphytic communities offer an original framework to disentangle the contributions of environmental filters, biotic interactions and dispersal limitations to community structure at fine spatial scales. We determine here whether variations in light, microclimatic conditions and host tree size affect the variation in species composition and phylogenetic structure of epiphytic bryophyte communities, and hence, assess the contribution of environmental filtering, phylogenetic constraints and competition to community assembly. A canopy crane giving access to 1.1 ha of tropical rainforest in Yunnan (China) was employed to record hourly light and microclimatic conditions from 54 dataloggers and epiphytic bryophyte communities from 408 plots. Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling was implemented to analyse the relationship between taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover among epiphytic communities, host-tree characteristics and microclimatic variation. Within-tree vertical turnover of bryophyte communities was significantly about 30% higher than horizontal turnover among-trees. Thus, the sharp vertical variations in microclimatic conditions from tree base to canopy are more important than differences in age, reflecting the likelihood of colonization, area, and habitat conditions between young and old trees, in shaping the composition of epiphytic bryophyte communities. Our models, to which microclimatic factors contributed most (83-98%), accounted for 33% and 18% of the variation in vertical turnover in mosses and liverworts, respectively. Phylogenetic turnover shifted from significantly negative or non-significant within communities to significantly positive among communities, and was slightly, but significantly, correlated with microclimatic variation. These patterns highlight the crucial role of microclimates in determining the composition and phylogenetic structure of epiphytic communities. Synthesis. The mostly non-significant phylogenetic turnover observed within communities does not support the idea that competition plays an important role in epiphytic bryophytes. Instead, microclimatic variation is the main driver of community composition and phylogenetic structure, evidencing the role of phylogenetic niche conservatism in community assembly.

However, knowledge about bacterial and fungal communities in karst tiankengs is still limited. Therefore, soil samples from five karst tiankengs were collected and subjected to high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS genes, and multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed abundant and diversified bacterial and fungal communities in karst tiankeng. The bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria, and the fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in bacterial and fungal communities among the five karst tiankengs, which may indicate that the distribution of bacterial and fungal communities was driven by separate karst tiankengs. The co-occurrence network structure was characterized by highly modularized assembly patterns and more positive interactions. The keystone taxa were mainly involved in nutrient cycling and energy metabolism. The null model analysis results showed that the stochastic process, especially dispersal limitation, tended to be more important in controlling the development of bacterial and fungal communities in karst tiankeng. The bacterial community structure was significantly associated with soil properties (SWC, TN, AN, and BD), while the fungal community structure was significantly associated with soil properties (SWC and TP) and plant diversity. These results can expand our knowledge of the karst tiankeng microbiome.

AB Background: Silviculture and land-use change has reduced the amount of natural forest worldwide and left what remains confined to isolated fragments or stands. To understand processes governing species occurrence in such stands, much attention has been given to stand-level factors such as size, structure, and deadwood amount. However, the surrounding matrix will directly impact species dispersal and persistence, and the link between the surrounding landscape configuration, composition and history, and stand-level species occurrence has received insufficient attention. Thus, to facilitate optimisation of forest management and species conservation, we propose a review addressing 'To what extent does surrounding landscape explain stand-level occurrence of conservation-relevant species in fragmented boreal and hemi-boreal forest?'.
   Methods: The proposed systematic review will identify and synthesise relevant articles following the CEE guidelines for evidence synthesis and the ROSES standards. A search for peer-reviewed and grey literature will be conducted using four databases, two online search engines, and 36 specialist websites. Identified articles will be screened for eligibility in a two-step process; first on title and abstract, and second on the full text. Screening will be based on predefined eligibility criteria related to a PECO-model; population being boreal and hemi-boreal forest, exposure being fragmentation, comparator being landscapes with alternative composition, configuration, or history, and outcome being occurrence (i.e., presence and/or abundance) of conservation-relevant species. All articles that pass the full-text screening will go through study validity assessment and data extraction, and be part of a narrative review. If enough studies prove comparable, quantitative meta-analyses will also be performed. The objective of the narrative review and the meta-analyses will be to address the primary question as well as six secondary questions, and to identify important knowledge gaps.

AB Understanding the response of soil microbial community to abnormal natural radionuclides is important to maintain soil ecological function, but the underlying mechanism of tolerance and survival of microbes is poorly studied. The effects of natural radionuclides on the topsoil microbial communities in anomalous natural radiation area were investigated in this work, and it was found that microbial community composition was significantly influenced by the specific-activities of natural radionuclides. The results revealed that relative abundances of 10 major microbial phyla and genera displayed different patterns along specific-activity gradients, including decreasing, increasing, hump-shaped, U-shaped, and similar sinusoidal or cosine wave trends, which indicated that the natural radionuclides were the predominant driver for change of microbial community structure. At the phylum and genus level, microbial communities were divided into two special groups according to the tolerance to natural radionuclides, such as 238U and 232Th, including tolerant and sensitive groups. Taken together, our findings suggest that the high specific-activities of natural radionuclides can obviously drive changes in microbial communities, providing a possibility for future studies on the microbial tolerance genes and bioremediation strains.

AB The railway is using gravel to mitigate impact and noise. Since these gravel tracks are deformed due to wear and weathering, they must be replaced at regular intervals. A large amount of fugitive dust(FD) is generated during the gravel replacement work, but research on the amount of generation has not been conducted. The characteristics of FD generated from railway maintenance vehicles (RMVs) operating on gravel tracks were investi-gated. FD concentrations were measured during the operation of three types of RMV machines: the multiple tie tamper (MTT), ballast regulator (RE), and ballast cleaner (BC). The concentrations of FD generated from MTT, RE, and BC use were 10.69, 16.58, and 17.55 mg/m3, respectively. Annual FD fluxes were calculated based on FD concentrations and emission speeds as well as annual RMV operating times. The EPA AP-42 provides a formula for calculating the FD generated by cars, but this formula is not applicable to railroad vehicles. In previous FD studies, FD flux was calculated using nearby wind speeds, but in this study, we took the speed of the force each RMVs applied during maintenance work as the emission speed. The results of this study can be used as baseline data in future studies of the environmental aspects of gravel track and precast concrete slab track use.

AB Cadmium (Cd) contamination of agricultural soils poses a potential public health issue for humans. Phytoremediation-based accumulating plants are an effective and sustainable technology for Cadmium remediation of contaminated agricultural soil. The rhizosphere microbiome can promote the growth and Cadmium accumulation in hyperaccumulators, but its taxonomic and functional traits remain elusive. The present study used two ecotypes of Sedum alfredii, an accumulating ecotype (AE) and a non-accumulating ecotype (NAE), as model plants to investigate the rhizosphere microbiome assemblages and influence on plant growth under high cadmium conditions. Our results showed that distinct root microbiomes assembled in association with both ecotypes of S. alfredii and that the assemblages were based largely on the lifestyles of the two ecotypes. In addition, we demonstrated that the functions of the microbes inhabiting the rhizosphere soils were closely associated with root-microbe interactions in both ecotypes of S. alfredii. Importantly, our results also demonstrated that the rhizosphere microbiome assembled in the AE rhizosphere soils contributed to plant growth and cadmium uptake under high cadmium conditions through functions such as nitrogen fixation, phosphorus solubilization, indole acetic acid (IAA) synthesis, and siderophore metabolism. However, this phenomenon was not clearly observed in the NAE. Our results suggest that the rhizosphere microbiome plays important roles in biogeochemical nutrient and metal cycling that can contribute to host plant fitness.

AB Extensive home ranges of marine megafauna present a challenge for systematic conservation planning because they exceed spatial scales of conventional management. For elusive species like dugongs, their management is additionally hampered by a paucity of basic distributional information across much of their range. The Red Sea is home to a wide-spread, globally important but data-poor population of dugongs. We surveyed the north-eastern Red Sea in the waters of NEOM, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to locate feeding sites and determine priority areas for dugong conservation. We conducted large-scale in-water surveys of dugong feeding trails across 27 seagrass meadows that span 0.7 degree of latitude and recorded nine seagrass species and 13 dugong feeding sites. Spread over similar to 4,061 km(2) of nearshore and offshore waters, many of these sites clustered around five main core feeding areas. Dugong feeding trails were mostly recorded at sites dominated by the fast-growing pioneer seagrasses Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis and/or H. stipulacea. Multispecific meadows with pioneer seagrasses tended to be sheltered and shallow, reflecting a similar spatial pattern to the identified dugong feeding sites. Often close to hotels and fishing harbours, these high-use dugong areas are subject to high boat traffic, fishing, and coastal development which places considerable pressures on this vulnerable mammal and its seagrass habitat. The rapidly accelerating coastal development in the northern Red Sea directly threatens the future of its dugong population. Although our sampling focuses on feeding signs in early successional seagrasses, the results are valuable to spatial conservation planning as they will trigger overdue conservation interventions for a globally threatened species in a data-poor area. Urgent dugong conservation management actions in the northern Red Sea should focus on shallow waters sheltered by coastal lagoons, bays and the lee of large islands.

AB Aim Viviparity has evolved more times in squamates than in any other vertebrate group; therefore, squamates offer an excellent model system in which to study the patterns, drivers and implications of reproductive mode evolution. Based on current species distributions, we examined three selective forces hypothesized to drive the evolution of squamate viviparity (cold climate, variable climate and hypoxic conditions) and tested whether viviparity is associated with larger body size. Location Global. Time period Present day. Taxon Squamata. Methods We compiled a dataset of 9061 squamate species, including their distributions, elevation, climate, body mass and reproductive modes. We applied species-level and assemblage-level approaches for predicting reproductive mode, both globally and within biogeographical realms. We tested the relationships of temperature, interannual and intra-annual climatic variation, elevation (as a proxy for hypoxic conditions) and body mass with reproductive mode, using path analyses to account for correlations among the environmental predictors. Results Viviparity was strongly associated with cold climates at both species and assemblage levels, despite the prevalence of viviparity in some warm climates. Viviparity was not clearly correlated with climatic variability or elevation. The probability of being viviparous exhibited a weak positive correlation with body size. Conclusions Although phylogenetic history is important, potentially explaining the occurrence of viviparous species in regions that are warm at present, current global squamate distribution is characterized by a higher relative abundance of viviparity in cold environments, supporting the prediction of the "cold-climate" hypothesis. The roles of climatic variation and hypoxia are less important and not straightforward. Elevation probably exerts various selective pressures and influences the prevalence of viviparity primarily through its effect on temperature rather than on oxygen concentration.

AB We analyzed individual growth and body mass allometry of the temperate stock of Sardinops sagax from samples collected on commercial fleet during 2005 to 2014 in the southern California Current System. Ages were estimated on otolith growth ring reading. Age (years) and standard length (SL; mm) data were fitted using four growth models: von Bertalanffy (VBM), Gompertz (GM), logistic (LM), and Schnute (SM) models. Parameters of each model were calculated by the maximum likelihood method using Akaike information criterion and Akaike's weight (WAIC(i)) to select the model with the greatest plausibility. Additionally, the interannual growth performance (phi') variation was described. Body mass allometry was established from the relationship between total body mass (TM; g) and standard length. The sardine samples ranged in size from 114 to 226 mm SL and in weight from 20 to 192 g TM; ages varied from 0.5 to 6.0 years. The allometric parameter (b) was estimated to be 3.155 (3.154-3.156), showing a hyper-allometry growth type. On the basis of raw data, we found that the LM model fit the original data better (WAIC(i) similar to 35%). When models were fitted to data bolstered with simulated values, the VBM model obtained the greatest weight (WAIC(i) = 60.9%), but the LM model had null plausibility. Consequently, we determined that the Pacific sardine growth pattern was best described by the VBM model, which appears to be more robust against biased data. The phi' showed interannual variation (2.13-2.51), with an average of phi' = 2.25. An apparent inverse relationship was observed between phi' and the Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the apparent positive relationship between Upwelling Index (UI) and phi'.

AB The installation of shrimp and salt ponds has contributed to the devastation of several mangroves worldwide. In semiarid regions, where few mangroves are able to cope with the harsh environment, these forests are more vulnerable to human impacts. In Brazil, several aquaculture and salt ponds have been established over mangroves and salt flats ('apicuns') i.e. sandier natural areas contiguous to mangroves. These areas, often hypersaline, can be colonized by mangroves if tidal coverage increases, and should, therefore, be protected to ensure mangrove conservation against predicted sea level rise. To restore a mangrove stand in an abandoned saltworks (former 'apicum' area) in northeast Brazil, hydrological restoration measures were applied, which involved digging channels to restore estuarine water flux to planted and water-borne propagules. In two years, mangroves developed rapidly in the intervention area, after decades of slow monospecific Avicennia germinans recovery. Survival of planted Rhizophora mangle propagules was high, and naturally established Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa reached far higher densities and heights in channels with respect to the condition before channeling. These results provide valuated insight into mangrove expansion over salt flats by increasing tidal coverage from ongoing rising sea levels. Associated with ecological changes after mangrove rehabilitation and driven by the return of plant and faunal key groups, ecological interactions like facilitation, herbivory and bioturbation increased in the restored area. Our results shed light on the processes related to forest recovery of degraded littoral areas, and contribute to improving the restoration and management of mangrove forests in semiarid coasts.

AB Inselbergs are azonal formations found scattered in different biomes globally. The first floristic list focusing on an inselberg in the Brazilian Amazon is presented here. We aimed to investigate floristic and phylogenetic connections among Neotropical inselbergs and analyze whether environmental variables act as a filter of plant lineages. We used a database compiled from 50 sites spanning three main Neotropical biomes (Amazon, 11 sites, Atlantic Forest, 14 sites, and Caatinga, 25 sites) comprising 2270 Angiosperm species. Our data highlight the vastly different inselberg flora found in each biome. The inselberg floras of the Atlantic Forest and Caatinga show closer phylogenetic ties than those seen in the other biome pairs. The phylogenetic lineages found in all three biomes are also strongly divergent, even within plant families. The dissimilarity between biomes suggests that distinct biogeographical histories might have unfolded even under comparable environmental filtering. Our data suggest that the inselberg flora is more related to the biome where it is located than to other factors, even when the microclimatic conditions in the outcrops differ strongly from those of the surrounding matrix. Relative to the other biomes, the flora of the Caatinga inselbergs has the highest level of species turnover. There is a possibility that plants colonized these rather distant inselbergs even when they were found under very different climatic conditions than those in the Amazonian and Atlantic Forest biomes. It is worth noting that none of the studied inselbergs found in the Caatinga biome is protected. In view of the uniqueness and drought-resilient lineages present in each group of inselbergs, along with their vulnerability to destruction or disturbance and their strong connection with water availability, we stress the need to protect this ecosystem not only to conserve plants potentially useful for ecological restoration but also to preserve the balance of this ecosystem and its connections.

AB Sea level exerts a fundamental influence on the intertidal zone, where organisms are subject to immersion and emersion at varying timescales and frequencies. While emersed, intertidal organisms are exposed to atmospheric stressors which show marked diurnal and seasonal variability, therefore the daily and seasonal timing of low water is a key determinant of survival and growth in this zone. Using the example of shallow coral reefs, the coincidence of emersion with selected stressors was investigated for eight locations around the Australian coastline. Hourly water levels (1992 - 2016) from a high-resolution sea level hindcast (http://sealevelx.ems.uwa.edu.au), were linked to maximum surface solar radiation data from the Copernicus ERA5 atmospheric model and minimum atmospheric temperature observations from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to identify seasonal patterns and historical occurrence of coral emersion mortality risk. Local tidal characteristics were found to dictate the time of day when low water, and therefore emersion mortality risk occurs, varying on a seasonal and regional basis. In general, risk was found to be greatest during the Austral spring when mean sea levels are lowest and a phase change in solar tidal constituents occurs. For all Great Barrier Reef sites, low tide occurs close to midday during winter and midnight in the summer, which may be fundamental factor supporting the historical bio-geographical development of the reef. Interannual variability in emersion mortality risk was mostly driven by non-tidal factors, particularly along the West Coast where El Nino events are associated with lower mean sea levels. This paper highlights the importance of considering emersion history when assessing intertidal environments, including shallow coral reef platform habitats, where critical low water events intrinsically influence coral health and cover. The study addresses a fundamental knowledge gap in both the field of water level science and intertidal biology in relation to the daily timing of low tide, which varies predictably on a seasonal and regional basis.

AB Studying species interactions in nature often requires elaborated logistics and intense fieldwork. The difficulties in such task might hinder our ability to answer questions on how biotic interactions change with the environment. Fortunately, a workaround to this problem lies within scientific collections. For some animals, the inspection of preserved specimens can reveal the scars of past antagonistic encounters, such as predation attempts. A common defensive behaviour that leaves scars on animals is autotomy, the loss of a body appendage to escape predation. By knowing the collection site of preserved specimens, it is possible to assess the influence of organismal biology and the surrounding environment in the occurrence of autotomy. We gathered data on tail loss for 8189 preserved specimens of 33 snake and 11 amphisbaenian species to investigate biological and environmental correlates of autotomy in reptiles. We applied generalized linear mixed effect models to evaluate whether body size, sex, life-stage, habitat use, activity pattern, biome, tropicality, temperature and precipitation affect the probability of tail loss in limbless reptiles. We observed autotomy in 23.6% of examined specimens, with 18.7% of amphisbaenian and 33.4% of snake specimens showing tail loss. The probability of tail loss did not differ between snakes and amphisbaenians, but it was higher among large-sized specimens, particularly in adults and females. Chance of tail loss was higher for diurnal and arboreal species, and among specimens collected in warmer regions, but it was unaffected by biome, precipitation, and tropicality. Autotomy in limbless reptiles was affected by size-dependent factors that interplay with ontogeny and sexual dimorphism, although size-independent effects of life-stage and sex also shaped behavioural responses to predators. The increase in probability of tail loss with verticality and diurnality suggests a risk-balance mechanism between species habitat use and activity pattern. Although autotomy is more likely in warmer regions, it seems unrelated to seasonal differences in snakes and amphisbaenians activity. Our findings reveal several processes related to predator-prey interactions involving limbless reptiles, demonstrating the importance of scientific collections to unveil ecological mechanisms at different spatio-temporal scales.

AB Understanding the causes of morphological variation of organisms along climatic gradients has been a central challenge in ecological research. We studied the variation of community weighted mean (CWM) and two functional diversity metrics (Rao-Q and functional richness) computed for five morphological traits of wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) related to thermal performance (namely body size, relative appendage length and hairiness), at community and interspecific levels, along an elevation gradient in a Mexical-type scrubland. At the community level we found a decreasing CWM of body size pattern with increasing elevation which is consistent with the species-energy theory (and contrary to Bergmann's rule). We also found an increase in the CWM of relative tibia length, which is contrary to Allen's rule. Additionally, we found an increase in the CWM of relative hair length towards high levels of elevation, which would be consistent with the hypothesis that hairiness plays an important role as thermal insulation. We found that functional diversity was larger at low elevations with respect to high elevation for body size and hair length, which could imply that highland communities were more sensitive towards environmental changes than lowland communities. Overall, at intraspecific level, most of species showed no pattern for any of the traits along the elevation gradient. Future research should provide further evidence on the possible behavioral or physiological mechanisms behind it.

AB Alterations in body size can have profound impacts on an organism's life history and ecology with long-lasting effects that span multiple biological scales. Animal body size is influenced by environmental drivers, including climate change and land use change, the two largest current threats to biodiversity. Climate warming has led to smaller body sizes of many species due to impacts on growth (i.e., Bergmann's rule and temperature-size rule). Conversely, urbanization, which serves as a model for investigating the effects of land use changes, has largely been demonstrated to cause size increases, but few studies have examined the combined influences of climate and land use changes on organism size. We present here the background theory on how each of these factors is expected to influence body size, summarize existing evidence of how size has recently been impacted by climate and land use changes, and make several recommendations to guide future research uniting these areas of focus. Given the rapid pace of climate change and urbanization, understanding the combined effects of climate and land use changes on body size is imperative for biodiversity preservation.

AB Conceptual frameworks for landscape restoration commonly take an approach focused on ecological (biotic and abiotic) aspects. Yet the recent initiatives demanding that restoration be scaled up to restore millions of hectares of degraded land often encounter socio-cultural challenges too, such as competing land-use interests and low stakeholder engagement. Thus, consideration also needs to be given to cultural landscapes, broadly defined as regions that reflect the long-term interactions between people and the environment. Based on a literature survey we here identify and then discuss features from cultural landscapes-ecological restoration research, which can be relevant to ecological restoration upscaling. Overall, research encompassing cultural landscapes is revealed as less narrowly-focused than that on landscape ecology linked with ecological restoration: our selected studies quite frequently considered social and landscape aspects in addition to ecological aspects. Geographically, research is strongly biased towards Europe and North America, although the most ambitious restoration targets are in the tropics. Taking cultural landscapes into account could enhance restoration by (1) moving towards a transdisciplinary approach thereby offsetting the overemphasis on ecological aspects, and (2) mitigating issues of land use and stakeholder engagement. Further research, paying special attention to the tropics, should aim at integrative approaches that would contribute to scaling up restoration, not only in single large-scale projects but also through the sum of small but concerted actions.

AB Anthropogenic activities are increasingly affecting ecosystems across the globe. Meanwhile, empirical and theoretical evidence suggest that natural systems can exhibit abrupt collapses in response to incremental increases in the stressors, sometimes with dramatic ecological and economic consequences. These catastrophic shifts are faster and larger than expected from the changes in the stressors and happen once a tipping point is crossed. The primary mechanisms that drive ecosystem responses to perturbations lie in their architecture of relationships, i.e. how species interact with each other and with the physical environment and the spatial structure of the environment. Nonetheless, existing theoretical work on catastrophic shifts has so far largely focused on relatively simple systems that have either few species and/or no spatial structure. This work has laid a critical foundation for understanding how abrupt responses to incremental stressors are possible, but it remains difficult to predict (let alone manage) where or when they are most likely to occur in more complex real-world settings. Here, we discuss how scaling up our investigations of catastrophic shifts from simple to more complex-species rich and spatially structured-systems could contribute to expanding our understanding of how nature works and improve our ability to anticipate the effects of global change on ecological systems.This article is part of the theme issue 'Ecological complexity and the biosphere: the next 30 years'.

AB Understanding the role of traits in dispersal is necessary to improve our knowledge of historical biogeography, community assembly processes and predictions of species' future movements. Here we aimed to determine the relationship between three traits (coastal distribution, body size, position on the fast/slow life history continuum) and past dispersal probability on an evolutionary timescale in chameleons (Chamaeleonidae). Using species' distribution data we identified the nine most important biogeographic regions for all included chameleons (181/217 species). We compiled life history trait data and used phylogenetic factor analysis to infer independent body size and fast/slow life history trait axes. Finally, we tested whether traits and trait combinations related to biogeographic dispersal success in the past, using trait-dependent biogeographic models. All three traits were associated with past biogeographical movements. Lineages having coastal distributions and those with large bodies had higher dispersal probabilities. Interestingly, chameleons with either a very fast or very slow life history were more successful dispersers than species with an intermediate strategy. Together, the three traits - coastal, large-bodied and extreme life history - form a dispersal syndrome. Traits have played an important role in the biogeographic history of chameleons. While only fast traits have been linked to present-day invasion success in reptiles, both extremes of the life history spectrum were likely advantageous for dispersal and establishment during past biogeographic movements. Fast-living species may be less susceptible to stochastic extinction in the first phases of a colonization (due to rapid population growth), and slow-living species may be less vulnerable to environmental stochasticity (due to low demographic variability). Our results call for broader analyses testing the general influence of life history strategy in biogeographic dispersal success, which would help explain species distribution patterns on Earth.

AB Antimicrobial resistance is an escalating health crisis requiring urgent action. Most antimicrobials are natural products (NPs) sourced from Actinomycetota, particularly the Streptomyces. Underexplored and extreme environments are predicted to harbour novel microorganisms with the capacity to synthesise unique metabolites. Herring Island is a barren and rocky cold desert in East Antarctica, remote from anthropogenic impact. We aimed to recover rare and cold-adapted NP-producing bacteria, by employing two culturing methods which mimic the natural environment: direct soil culturing and the soil substrate membrane system. First, we analysed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from 18 Herring Island soils and selected the soil sample with the highest Actinomycetota relative abundance (78%) for culturing experiments. We isolated 166 strains across three phyla, including novel and rare strains, with 94% of strains belonging to the Actinomycetota. These strains encompassed thirty-five 'species' groups, 18 of which were composed of Streptomyces strains. We screened representative strains for genes which encode polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, indicating that 69% have the capacity to synthesise polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide NPs. Fourteen Streptomyces strains displayed antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial and yeast pathogens using an in situ assay. Our results confirm that the cold-adapted bacteria of the harsh East Antarctic deserts are worthy targets in the search for bioactive compounds.

AB One hundred and forty nine bacterial strains were isolated from arsenic contaminated paddy field soil of West Bengal following enrichment upon As(III), As(V) and control plates. The maximum tolerable concentration (MTC) of the bacterial population isolated towards As(V) and As(III) was found to be 600 mM and 10 mM, respectively. Eight isolates with varying MTC values were chosen to study their As ad-/ab-sorption abilities to form a consortium for bioremedial applica-tion to As contaminated soil. The As(III) or As(V) ab-/ad-sorption abilities of the chosen isolates positively correlated to their respective As(III) or As(V) MTC values. Phylogenetic analyses of the isolates affiliate them to be the members of genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Staphylococcus and Ralstonia. A consortium comprising the eight chosen isolates were incubated under eight microcosm conditions with combinations of flooded or non-flooded, sterile or non-sterile soils with low (6.1 mg/kg) or moderately high (19.5 mg/kg) As concentrations. The consortium revealed an overall appreciable activity of As mobilization and sequestration with best cellular As accumulation under non-flooded low As concentration soil incubation. While the microcosm with highly contaminated soil allowed best microbial As sequestration under flooded condition when incubated solely in sterile soil. Bacterial sequestration and removal of the toxic metalloid may find important implications in As bioremediation in agricultural fields hence, reducing the bioavailability of this toxic element for further translocation into the crop. The study, thereby, provides a novel insight for potential use of the consortia in bioremediating As contaminated soil through microbial biosequestration approach.

AB Context Habitat loss and fragmentation can interact with other threats, including altered fire regimes, and responses to these effects can be mediated by functional traits. Objectives To determine how richness and abundance of reptile trait groups respond to habitat fragmentation, patch isolation and fire. Methods We surveyed reptiles in 30 sites over 3 years. Sites in remnant patches in farmland were adjacent to a conservation park with either recently burnt or long-unburnt habitat. The remnant patches were stratified by distance from the reserve. Sites were spatially paired, and we experimentally burnt one of each pair in farmland. Trait groups included size, reproduction, habitat position, diet, and activity period. Results None of the trait groups benefited from experimental burns, while the burns reduced abundance of viviparous, small, and above-ground species. Species richness was lower in isolated sites than in sites close to the conservation park, while generalist trait groups appeared unaffected by patch isolation. Large-sized reptiles had higher abundance in remnants. There was not more rapid colonisation of burnt sites near recently burnt conservation park. Instead, low initial abundance may have been caused by fire in combination with drought, with high rainfall during the study allowing recovery and spill-over into adjacent remnants. Conclusions Landscape structure appears to interact with natural fires, restoration burns and longer-term climatic trends to influence the abundance and distribution of reptiles. Traits mediate responses, enabling us to formulate a set of testable mechanistic hypotheses, which illustrates a pathway to generalisation and prediction.

AB Here, we aimed to define ecological indicators of environmental change for monitoring the effect of a reintroduced species, the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), over the vegetation of a natural protected area with contrasting habitats. This species was reintroduced 30 years ago in the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park, Spain, and its population has since grown exponentially, reaching high densities in some areas. We tested the suitability of two complementary indicators: browsing damage on woody species and the percentage of moss cover loss on rocky outcrops. For this purpose, we used a mathematical approach to zone the natural protected area according to the historical presence of the species and established five different Iberian ibex pressure classes (Classes I-V). Our results showed a direct link between Iberian ibex pressure and vegetation status. Model predictions suggested 10% moss loss in the areas with low pressure (Class I) but 64% loss in the areas with high pressure (Class III), mostly due to ungulate trampling on rocks. Similarly, browsing damage increased with increasing pressure classes for different woody species. Low palatable plant species such as Pinus spp. showed little change in browsing damage for increasing ungulate pressure whereas more palatable plants (e.g., Erica arborea) showed significantly greater browsing damage variation across pressure classes (i.e., high sensitive to herbivory pressure). Both, moss cover on rocks and widely distributed palatable woody plants proved useful ecological indicators for monitoring ungulate populations in mountainous areas with a diverse array of habitats (e.g., rocky vs. woody). This methodology may help select the most suitable indicators for each type of ecosystem or dominant habitat in ungulate-dominated ecosystems.

AB The current coral reefs crisis is motivating a number of innovative projects attempting to leverage new mechanisms to avoid coral bleaching, reduce coral mortality and restore damaged reefs. Shading the reef, through seawater atomised fogging, is one tool in development to reduce levels of irradiance and temperature. To evaluate the potential viability of this concept, here we review 91 years (1930-2021) of published research looking at the effects of different levels of shade and light on coral reefs. We summarised the types of studies, places, coral species used, common responses variable measured, and types of shades used among studies. We discuss issues related to reef scale shading applicability, different methods used to measure light, standardisation methods and most importantly the positive and negative effects of shading corals.

AB Biodiversity varies predictably with environmental energy around the globe, but the underlaying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The evolutionary speed hypothesis predicts that environmental kinetic energy shapes variation in speciation rates through temperature- or life history-dependent rates of evolution. To test whether variation in evolutionary speed can explain the relationship between energy and biodiversity in birds, mammals, amphibians, and reptiles, we simulated diversification over 65 myr of geological and climatic change with a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary simulation model. We modeled four distinct evolutionary scenarios in which speciation-completion rates were dependent on temperature (M1), life history (M2), temperature and life history (M3), or were independent of temperature and life-history (M0). To assess the agreement between simulated and empirical data, we performed model selection by fitting supervised machine learning models to multidimensional biodiversity patterns. We show that a model with temperature-dependent rates of speciation (M1) consistently had the strongest support. In contrast to statistical inferences, which showed no general relationships between temperature and speciation rates in tetrapods, we demonstrate how process-based modeling can disentangle the causes behind empirical biodiversity patterns. Our study highlights how environmental energy has played a fundamental role in the evolution of biodiversity over deep time.

AB Raphidiopsis raciborskii is a notorious bloom-forming and filamentous cyanobacterium that has been extensively investigated into its toxicity, phylogeny, and spreading potential. Studies have demonstrated that this species has spanned different climates from tropical zones to temperate regions, suggesting that R. raciborskii is becoming a cosmopolitan species in freshwater systems around the world. In fact, it has been proposed that several characteristics of R. raciborskii may explain its spread and dominance. In particular, R. raciborskii is known to display a high extent of physiological plasticity regarding nutrients, light regimes, and temperatures. Moreover, this species illustrates different ecotypes with distinct environmental requirements. Here, we present an overview of R. raciborskii's global distribution and adaptation strategy based on the recent findings from genome variance, toxicity, and ecophysiology. The expansion of its geographical distribution can be linked to its genome, toxicity, and ecophysiology. The variable genes are mainly associated with the stress response, phage defense, DNA repair, cell cycle control, and membrane transport, illustrating the species' adaptability in response to changing environments. In fact, the species shows rapid adaptability to low and/or variable nutrient availability, especially changing phosphorus availability. Moreover, the variabilities of strains within the population extend their flexibility to adapt and acclimate to ambient environment. In addition, cylindrospermopsins (CYN) appear to have a potential biological role in facilitating theirs dominance or bloom. These strategies of R. raciborskii make it a challenge to manage in a freshwater system, reflecting the management of its bloom from further evidence of the complex ecophysiology, toxicity, and genome of this species.

AB Biomanipulation by piscivore stocking has been widely used to combat eutrophication in north temperate lakes, but its applicability in warm lakes has not yet been well elucidated. Here, we used experimental mesocosms to test the effects of a native benthi-piscivore (snakehead, Channa argus Cantor) on water clarity under subtropical conditions where small omni-benthivorous fish like crucian carp (Carassius carassius L.) prevail. Our results showed that, despite of a great reduction of crucian carp biomass, snakehead stocking did not create a strong trophic cascade as neither (herbivorous) zooplankton biomass nor their grazing pressure, indicated by biomass ratio of (herbivorous) zooplankton to phytoplankton, changed significantly. Moreover, snakehead stocking significantly increased water non-algal turbidity as well as nutrient and chlorophyll -a concentrations, suggesting that these benthi-piscivores also disturbed sediments like crucian carp did. Our study showed that biomanipulation by stocking of snakehead does not facilitate clear-water state in warm shallow lakes, even on the short-term.

AB Giant brachiopods, including representatives of the order Chonetida, appeared in the second half of the Tournaisian and in the Visean (Early Carboniferous). Based on known gigantism in extant organisms, the origin of this phenomenon can be associated with the maximum of a large Early Carboniferous transgression, which caused deepening of marine basins and a decrease in the temperature of the bottom water layers.

AB Few concurrent studies exist of sympatric gray wolf (Canis lupus) and coyote (C. latrans) harvest at far northern latitudes. Moreover, no studies explicitly examine effects of concurrent harvest on phenotypes of wolves and coyotes. We documented changes in sex and age characteristics and morphology of gray wolves and coyotes harvested by hunters near Ptarmigan Lake, east-central Alaska, USA, between 1998 and 2001. We hypothesized that the harvest would result in larger, heavier canids, reduce densities, and increase young to adult ratios in both wolves and coyotes. We generated von Bertalanffy growth curves indicating that wolves and coyotes of both sexes increased in length or weight until 2 or 3 years old. No significant changes in either mean length or weight or length to weight ratios occurred during the 3-year study, except that coyote mean length was longer over the last winter of study. Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) for wolves ranged from 0.061 to 0.112 killed/day and for coyotes from 0.552 to 0.11 killed/day over the study. CPUE indicated that coyotes but not wolves declined in abundance. Changes in male to female and young to adult ratios did not differ significantly for either canid. We posit that coyote populations were disproportionately affected by the conflation of the severe Arctic environment and sustained harvest. Our findings will be beneficial for managing sympatric canid populations and for understanding demographic responses to density-dependent processes in wolves and coyotes, especially at far northern latitudes.

AB The preservation of our planet's decreasing biodiversity is a global challenge. Human attitudes and preferences toward animals have profound impacts on conservation policies and decisions. To date, the vast majority of studies about human attitudes and concern toward animals have focused largely on western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (i.e., WEIRD) populations. In order to mitigate biodiversity loss globally, an understanding of how humans make decisions about animals from multicultural perspectives is needed. The present study examines familiarity, liking and endorsement of government protection amongst six broad cultural groups living in Qatar for five threatened animal species indigenous to the Arabian Gulf. Our findings highlight similarities and differences across cultures toward animals. Overall, familiarity did not predict endorsement for government protection after liking was accounted for. Liking, however, emerged as an important predictor of endorsement for government protection across cultures, although the degree of animal liking varied culturally. WEIRD and South East Asian participants showed similar and more positive attitudes toward animals compared to the other groups. Participants from the Arabian Gulf, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia responded similarly toward the animals. Interestingly, the Arabian Gulf group demonstrated significantly less liking and protection endorsement for animals, including those animals which play an important role in their culture. This research highlights intriguing avenues for future research and points to liking as a possible universal human attitude toward animals that influences decision making about conservation across all cultures while suggesting applications for improving education.

AB We construct a generic ecosystem model that features the basic mechanisms of alternative stable states as well as two different stochastic influences. In particular, we use a mean-reverting jump-diffusion process to model the evolution of the ecosystem state over time. We review key concepts of multistability theory and the simple heuristics commonly employed to illustrate them. We then provide mathematical definitions for these concepts in the model context. Our contribution to the literature is twofold: we improve the representation of stochasticity in, and clarify key concepts of, multistability theory. The simplicity of the model enables a number of applications, such as finding economically optimal management strategies, identifying criteria for sustainable ecosystem management in a stochastic viability framework, deriving the probability of a regime shift, or empirically identifying the factors which have caused a specific regime shift. Recommendations for resource managers: Stochasticity is an important feature of multistable ecosystems and may by itself cause abrupt regime shifts. This highlights the role of active resilience management. Previously deemed safe management strategies can trigger undesired regime shifts under changed environmental conditions. Hence, managers need to adapt to changing conditions. Different types of management actions come with different probabilities of (un)desired regime shifts.

AB Mountains are considered island-like systems often characterized by exceptional biodiversity and endemism. There are many highly isolated mountain ranges in Africa that collectively have been called the Afromontane archipelago. Freshwater snails of the genus Bulinus are composed of many veterinary and biomedical important species. These intermediate hosts for schistosomiasis parasites are wide spread and some of the species are considered to be highly adapted to very harsh environmental conditions such as droughts or low temperatures. However, the extent to which the Bulinus have adapted to live in high-altitudes and factors influencing these range shifts are not well investigated. In this study, we analyzed pan-African Bulinus species from various habitats across different altitudinal ranges, focusing on the high mountains or "sky islands" to examine how the contemporary climate and historical geological factors affect species distributions and evolutionary processes. Using a fossil-calibrated multigene phylogeny composed of two mitochondrial genes (cox1, 16S) and two nuclear genes (ITS2 and H3), we tested: 1) how often and when extreme altitudes were colonized, 2) what are the biogeographical affinities and degree of isolation of high-altitude species, 3) which lineages diversified and evolved endemism in the Afromontane environments, and 4) whether the Afromontane regions represent "sky islands". Bayesian phylogenetic inference employing a fossil-calibrated molecular clock resulted in a strongly supported phylogeny resolving the relationships between the four Bulinus groups. High-altitude colonization exists exclusively within the Bulinus truncatus/tropicus complex. Several independent colonization events occurred in the Pliocene and Pleistocene throughout Africa, mostly from nearby regions of the respective mountain ranges. Most species evolved in low to mid-altitudinal ranges. Endemism is pronounced in the Ethiopian Highlands and those of Kenya and Lesotho. A previously unknown species was found at an extreme altitude (similar to 4,000 m a.s.l.) on Mt. Elgon/Uganda extending the formerly known altitudinal maximum of the genus by roughly 900 m. The endemic species has already diverged in the Pliocene (similar to 4 myr) and is currently characterized by low genetic diversity. There is further cryptic diversity in mountain ranges of Lesotho. Our findings are discussed in a biogeographical, conservation and biomedical context.

AB One of the core issues in community ecology is the understanding of mechanisms that determine community structure. In this study, we examine how two structurally distinct habitats (campo sujo - a grassy savanna habitat with low shrubby cover - and seasonal semi-deciduous forest) and distinct hydrological seasons (dry and rainy) influence the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of lizard assemblages in a savanna area in the Brazilian Cerrado. We used pitfall traps to sample lizards from May 2000 to February 2002. To quantify spatio-temporal changes in the lizard assemblages, we used parameters of taxonomic (species richness - SR), functional (functional diversity - SES.FD, functional redundancy - FR and functional dispersion - FDis), and phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic species richness - PSR and phylogenetic species variability - PSV). We also estimate functional and phylogenetic structure of the assemblages in each habitat during dry and rainy seasons. We recorded 182 lizards distributed among 14 species. Species composition differed among habitat types, but did not differ seasonally within habitats. SES.FD, FDis, and FR also differed among habitat types but not among seasons, with SES.FD and FDis being greater in seasonal semi-deciduous forest, while FR was greater in campo sujo. SR, PSR, and PSV were not influenced by the factors analysed. The lizard assemblage of campo sujo was functionally clustered in the dry season and phylogenetically clustered in the rainy season. These results demonstrate that differences among habitat types and seasons are important in shaping the taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic diversity and structure of lizard assemblages in the savanna area studied. Our study also demonstrates the importance of using different measures of diversity to obtain a better understanding on the mechanisms that influence the lizard assemblages in a highly seasonal environment.

AB The article presents a list of algal species and cyanobacteria found in the continental waters of Israel in 1898-2022. Research progressed in 2000-2022 by increasing the list from 1261 to 1628 species belonging to fourteen phyla. Taxonomic analysis shows that diatoms, cyanobacteria, and green algae predominated. The first-time data has been synthesized to identify the indicator properties of Israel's aquatic flora carried out on algae and cyanobacteria, which can be used to monitor water quality. The species' ecological preferences are given for ten environmental variables: substrate preference, temperature, oxygen saturation with water mobility, water pH preferences, water salinity, organic pollution according to Watanabe and Sladecek with species-specific index of saprobity S, trophic state, and type of nutrition (autotrophic or heterotrophic). This list of species with indicator values for each species is used to characterize the water properties in Israel. In addition, it can be applied to assess the state of aquatic ecosystems and monitor water quality based on bioindication methods.

AB Unidentified human remains are frequently recovered in urban environments in South Africa, which undergo forensic (medico-legal) investigations. These remains often exhibit animal scavenging modifications and are frequently scattered by animals. This impacts the collection and forensic analysis of the remains. This study aimed to identify scavenging animals present in two urban environments in Johannesburg, South Africa, and describe their scavenging and scattering behaviours. Six pig carcasses (Sus scrofa domesticus) (30-80 kg) were placed in a veldt in Johannesburg and in an abandoned building complex. Motion-activated cameras recorded the scavenging activities. Scavenger species were identified and their behaviours, scattering pattern, and scavenging bone modifications were described. Slender mongooses (Galerella sanguinea) were the most prolific veldt scavengers. They scattered remains to a maximum distance of 10.5 m in two directions: north and southeast. These mongooses scavenged during the advanced and dry decomposition stages. Gnawing on the angle of the mandible - with multiple parallel scores on the flat surfaces and the angle margin having a stepped appearance may be a distinguishing scavenging modification feature of the slender mongoose. Hadeda ibis (Bostrychia hagedash) were the only scavengers recorded scavenging on the intestines of a pig carcass in the abandoned building complex. They favoured colonizing insects and created multiple, large holes in the skin and removed the lips to access the insects. The described scavenging behaviours will assist in the reconstruction of postmortem events in forensic cases and the location and collection of scattered remains in Southern Africa.

AB Cannibalism, the act of preying on and consuming a conspecific, is taxonomically widespread, and putatively important in the wild, particularly in teleost fishes. Nonetheless, most studies of cannibalism in fishes have been performed in the laboratory. Here, we test four predictions for the evolution of cannibalism by conducting one of the largest assessments of cannibalism in the wild to date coupled with a mesocosm experiment. Focusing on mosquitofishes and guppies, we examined 17 species (11,946 individuals) across 189 populations in the wild, spanning both native and invasive ranges and including disparate types of habitats. We found cannibalism to be quite rare in the wild: most populations and species showed no evidence of cannibalism, and the prevalence of cannibalism was typically less than 5% within populations when it occurred. Most victims were juveniles (94%; only half of these appeared to have been newborn offspring), with the remaining 6% of victims being adult males. Females exhibited more cannibalism than males, but this was only partially explained by their larger body size, suggesting greater energetic requirements of reproduction likely play a role as well. We found no evidence that dispersal-limited environments had a lower prevalence of cannibalism, but prevalence was greater in populations with higher conspecific densities, suggesting that more intense resource competition drives cannibalistic behavior. Supporting this conclusion, our mesocosm experiment revealed that cannibalism prevalence increased with higher conspecific density and lower resource levels but was not associated with juvenile density or strongly influenced by predation risk. We suggest that cannibalism in livebearing fishes is rare in the wild because preying on conspecifics is energetically costly and only becomes worth the effort when competition for other food is intense. Due to the artificially reduced cost of capturing conspecifics within confined spaces, cannibalism in captive settings can be much more frequent.

AB Research on populations of the family Mugilidae is necessary for the framework of their good use and conservation, given the documented spatial-temporal variation in their attributes and biological processes. Mugil curema has also shown particularities in the southeastern Gulf of California, which should be considered. In total, 626 individuals were collected from February 2015 to August 2016. The gonad development pattern was asynchronous and divided into six ovarian and five testicular phases. The sex succession as size increases, the presence of only males in smaller sizes, some aspects of the ovarian structure, and the eosinophilic cells in the ovarian stroma suggest that M. curema could be a protandrous hermaphroditic species. Thus, the size at sexual maturity was smaller in males (18.26 cm in total length) than in females (22.08 cm). This information is greatly relevant for fishery management measures and the sustainable use approach and, at the same time, arouses interest in future research.

AB Background Natural and semi-natural ecosystems in the Egyptian Western Desert are in serious danger of being degraded or lost through overgrazing, and overcutting of dominant vegetation, shrubs and trees and tourism activities. The study shows the effect of Man's use during 1990 and recently in 2018 led to desertification. Results Thymelaea hirsuta (L.) (Thymelaeceae) was an important component (shrubs) in the natural ecosystems of the Egyptian Western Desert that harbors rich arthropod fauna all the year around. The spiders, pesudocorions (Arachnida: Araneae), and insects associated with this shrub were monthly sampled in 1990 at two different protected sites. One is on a very nice coastal ridge, semi-arid site, and the other is in the inland depression, arid site. The sites had distinctive characteristic of populations of non-insect predatory arthropods responding to habitat characteristics. The insects, spiders and pseudoscorpions occurred throughout the year in both sites. However, on the less arid site, the pronounced insect population occurred in winter months while the non-insect was relatively higher in summer months. On the more arid site, the highest insect population was in winter and the non-insect population was higher in autumn. The false-scorpion Olpium kochi Simon (Arachnida, Pseudoscorpionida, Olpiidae), a native rare predator to the Saharan fauna, was very common and its activity reflects its effective predatory role in both sites. In 2017-2018, several visits to the above sites showed that they were completely degraded and most of figs, olive, palm trees and dominant vegetations were removed. The survived shrub populations were very far from each other, sparse very low number and are very poor in arthropod fauna. Thus, several visits were essential to be paid just to collect enough numbers of O. kochi. The life-cycle of O. kochi is through egg-stage and three nymphal instars. There was no active feeding period by the end of each of these stages. Adults can live for 2-4 months. The developmental period takes 10 to 14 months/generation. Cannibalism tendency was among nymphs, but was very rare among fed or starved adults. Conclusions The study sites were seriously degraded with irreversible changes. The nice cost ridge was completely degraded and lost by removing the leading dominant vegetations and fruit trees and replacing building houses. Houses replaced most of the site in the inland depression for more desertification.

AB Specimen-based data have played a central role in documenting body-size shifts as a possible response to global warming over the last century. Identification of the drivers and patterns of these trends requires comparisons across taxa, often through meta-analyses; however, a lack of repeatability within and interoperability (i.e. the potential for a dataset to be augmented for future research) among published studies is a major obstacle. We reviewed published studies on mammal body-size changes in the Anthropocene, focusing on those that used museum specimens to analyse body-size trends over time in at least one species. We assessed these papers for repeatability and interoperability with the following criteria: raw data and specimen identifiers were published and accessible, measurements were unambiguously defined, and potential sex- and age-based size differences among individuals were accounted for. Most published body-size studies have low potential for replication or augmentation; only one of 27 met all of our criteria. Although these 27 papers collectively generated an estimated 51,790 new body-size measurements, only 1.25% (649) could be repeated or readily used in further investigations, as the remainder did not include raw data and/or specimen identifiers. Based on these findings, we recommend the following best practices in the study of body-size trends. First, authors should explicitly define and justify all measures of size and quantify measurement error and publish all data, including measurements and specimen catalogue numbers. In addition to complying with the fundamental scientific tenet of repeatability, this minimizes redundant handling and the concomitant risk of damage to irreplaceable and often fragile museum specimens. Second, authors should test and account for the effects of demography, as some dimensions can change throughout an individual's life. Adopting these practices will improve the quality of body-size studies, enhance the utility of extended specimen data from natural history collections, and enable researchers to conduct more expansive investigations of size trends over time.

AB Island biogeography provides concepts for conservation management as fragmented habitats are comparable to ocean islands. Remote sensing can help to extract terrestrial habitat islands on the landscape scale. However, little is known about the effects of image resolution and classification algorithms on resulting island size and related parameters. We study the combined effect of three image resolutions (2, 10, and 30 m) and three classification algorithms (Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) by extracting quartz islands from WorldView-2 imagery using image segmentation. We compared four island parameters (i.e., area, distance, shape index, and perimeter-area ratio between resolutions and classifiers). We found that in all cases, image resolution and classification algorithms had a strong effect. However, image resolution was more important for area and shape. Artificial Neural Network always provided the best performance as a classifier (OA: 0.880, kappa: 0.801, F1: 0.912). Hence, conservation strategies could lead to different results when different pattern extraction strategies are applied. Future studies which aim at extracting terrestrial habitat islands from image datasets should aim for the highest possible resolution and compare the outcomes of different classifiers to ensure the best possible results.

AB Detecting dolphins, accurately identifying species, and estimating group size during manned aerial surveys can be challenging. We used images obtained during a manned aerial survey over 13 non-consecutive days and covering a total of 3732 km of transects, in a high-wing aircraft flown at 185 km/h and an altitude of 152 m, equipped with three Single Lens Reflex cameras, to supplement estimates of dolphins recorded by observers. We used this opportunity to assess the adequacy of the resulting images for species identification of two morphologically similar dolphin species (i.e., with similar coloration and body size): the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) and the Australian humpback dolphin (Sousa sahulensis) and to accurately estimate dolphin group size. We also compared dolphin group estimates and species identification made by observers during the aerial survey, with manual review of the aerial images, where images overlapped with the observers' field of view from the aircraft. We collected and reviewed 413000 images and found that an image resolution of 1.25 cm per pixel was adequate to distinguish between the two targeted dolphin species. Our findings suggest that aerial images can improve species identification and estimates of group size > 5. The camera setup and photography parameters that we describe here, with the survey altitude and speed that were used, has the potential to be used to identify, and accurately estimate other morphologically similar small-bodied (< 3 m) species in the marine environment. This will be an important consideration for future aerial surveys of low density, threatened species, that form small and sometimes mixed species groups, including humpback and bottlenose dolphins where their distribution overlaps.

AB As body size often predicts energetic requirements and fecundity, understanding the drivers behind size variation is important. Neo-Bergmann's rule states that larger individuals are found at higher latitudes and this size variation is attributable to temperature gradients. In ectotherms, this macroecological pattern has mixed support within the literature-both the direction and mechanism of size correlation with latitude varies. We asked if two species of freshwater mussels with different thermal niche preferences, Amblema plicata and Lampsilis cardium, follow neo-Bergmann's rule and what mechanisms might drive that latitudinal variation. Lampsilis cardium is a thermally sensitive species intolerant of high temperatures, and A. plicata is more tolerant of a wide range of temperatures. We predicted that the thermally sensitive species at southern latitudes would have stunted growth in the summer and that this stunting would produce a steeper relationship with latitude than in the thermally tolerant species. We collected and thin-sectioned 113 A. plicata shells from 23 sites and 85 Lampsilis cardium shells from 12 sites across a latitudinal gradient in the eastern U.S.A. We used back-calculated size-at-age data to determine logistic growth parameters for each taxon across this gradient. We used Bayesian model selection to evaluate how environmental information correlated with potential maximum size. We found that both mussel species reached a larger potential maximum size at higher latitudes, with the thermally sensitive species having the larger increase in potential maximum size across the gradient when compared to the thermally tolerant species. Average annual water temperature explained mussel potential maximum size better than annual catchment precipitation, annual minimum flow ratio, and species identity. Both increased average water temperature and annual catchment precipitation, two predicted outcomes of climate change, were associated with smaller potential maximum size. Reductions in mussel maximum size due to climate change induced shifts in temperature regimes and precipitation patterns could lead to reduced reproductive output of this threatened guild and subsequent changes in ecosystem function and services, such as decreased biofiltration. As climate change alters precipitation patterns and stream productivity, and increases water temperature, understanding size variation and its cause in aquatic organisms will be important for managing these vulnerable populations.

AB Explosive bouts of diversification are one of the most conspicuous features of the tree of life. When such bursts are repeated in similar environments, it suggests some degree of predictability in the evolutionary process. We assess parallel adaptive radiation of South American pike cichlids (Crenicichla) using phylogenomics and phylogenetic comparative methods. We find that species flocks in the Uruguay and Iguazu River basins rapidly diversified into the same set of ecomorphs that reflect feeding ecology. Both adaptive radiations involve expansion of functional morphology, resulting in unique jaw phenotypes. Yet, form and function were decoupled such that most ecomorphs share similar mechanical properties of the jaws (i.e., jaw motion during a feeding strike). Prey mobility explained 6- to 9-fold differences in the rate of morphological evolution but had no effect on the rate of mechanical evolution. We find no evidence of gene flow between species flocks or with surrounding coastal lineages that may explain their rapid diversification. When compared with cichlids of the East African Great Lakes and other prominent adaptive radiations, pike cichlids share many themes, including the rapid expansion of phenotypic diversity, specialization along the benthic-to-pelagic habitat and soft-to-hard prey axes, and the evolution of conspicuous functional innovations. Yet, decoupled evolution of form and function and the absence of hybridization as a catalyzing force are departures from patterns observed in other adaptive radiations. Many-to-one mapping of morphology to mechanical properties is a mechanism by which pike cichlids attain a diversity of feeding ecologies while avoiding exacerbating underlying mechanical trade-offs.

AB Squamate reptiles exhibit two reproductive modes: oviparity and viviparity. Existing large-scale studies suggest that viviparous species are more vulnerable to climate warming based on viviparous species occupying relatively colder environments, which are predicted to decline in availability under climate warming. However, oviparous and viviparous squamates are geographically widespread and their distributions often overlap. Are oviparous or viviparous squamates more vulnerable to climate warming when they inhabit similar thermal environments? We used Sceloporus lizards in North America as a model system to predict the impact of climate warming on oviparous and viviparous species in sympatric zones. We used mechanistic models to quantify the changes in maternal energy balance (MEB) and offspring energy balance (OEB) under a climate warming scenario. We then projected the fitness impacts of future climate warming based on estimates of MEB and OEB. Under a climate warming scenario (RCP8.5), oviparous females are predicted to increase reproductive frequency more than viviparous females, which restricts time for postpartum energy accumulation before the end of the season and decreases MEB. Under climate warming, OEB of oviparous species increased more than viviparous species, but the increases were less geographically widespread. Interestingly, the developmental success and OEB of oviparous species are predicted to decline at some sites under climate warming, which is not predicted to happen for viviparous species. Our results highlight that oviparous species will respond more variably to climate warming than viviparous species. More specifically, oviparous species in hot areas with high temperature variation may be especially vulnerable under climate warming compared to sympatric viviparous species.

AB As the world becomes more urbanized, identifying traits that allow some species to thrive in cities will be key to predicting which species will probably remain common and which may require conservation attention. Large, diverse, widely distributed and readily documented raptors represent an ideal taxonomic group to understand how species persist and thrive in urban areas. Global community science datasets can reveal patterns that might be obscured in studies limited to a small number of locations, those relying on presence/absence data or those conducted by a small number of observers. We analysed 127 species of raptors (hawks and related species; Family: Accipitridae) using recent community-science (eBird) records from 59 cities on five continents, modelling two indices of occurrence with five ecological and life history traits, and incorporating phylogenetic relatedness. Based on previous studies of avian traits in urban vs. rural populations, and well as our casual observations of birds in cities across the USA and around the world, we hypothesized that urban raptor communities would be dominated by smaller, ecological-generalist species regardless of the regional species pool. We defined urban occurrence in two ways: urban abundance (the frequency of breeding season reports within 10 km of a city centre) and species proportion (the relative abundance of each species in the local raptor community). We did not detect a strong phylogenetic signal for either urban occurrence index, suggesting that various unrelated raptor species may become common in cities of the world. In the best-performing models, both urban indices were significantly negatively associated with body mass, and significantly positively associated with habitat breadth; species proportion was also significantly associated with nest substrate breadth. Our analysis suggests that there may be an 'archetypal urban raptor' and that species lacking these traits (e.g. large, specialist taxa) may be at greater conservation risk as global urbanization increases.

AB We investigated how mangrove-island micro-elevation (i.e., habitat: center vs edge) affects tree physiology in a scrub mangrove forest of the southeastern Everglades. We measured leaf gas exchange rates of scrub Rhizophora mangle L. trees monthly during 2019, hypothesizing that CO2 assimilation (A(net)) and stomatal conductance (g(sw)) would decline with increasing water levels and salinity, expecting more considerable differences at mangrove-island edges than centers, where physiological stress is greatest. Water levels varied between 0 and 60 cm from the soil surface, rising during the wet season (May-October) relative to the dry season (November-April). Porewater salinity ranged from 15 to 30 p.p.t., being higher at mangrove-island edges than centers. A(net) maximized at 15.1 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), and g(sw) was typically <0.2 mol m(-2) s(-1), both of which were greater in the dry than the wet season and greater at island centers than edges, with seasonal variability being roughly equal to variation between habitats. After accounting for season and habitat, water level positively affected A(net) in both seasons but did not affect g(sw). Our findings suggest that inundation stress (i.e., water level) is the primary driver of variation in leaf gas exchange rates of scrub mangroves in the Florida Everglades, while also constraining A(net) more than g(sw). The interaction between inundation stress due to permanent flooding and habitat varies with season as physiological stress is alleviated at higher-elevation mangrove-island center habitats during the dry season. Freshwater inflows during the wet season increase water levels and inundation stress at higher-elevation mangrove-island centers, but also potentially alleviate salt and sulfide stress in soils. Thus, habitat heterogeneity leads to differences in nutrient and water acquisition and use between trees growing in island centers versus edges, creating distinct physiological controls on photosynthesis, which likely affect carbon flux dynamics of scrub mangroves in the Everglades.

AB The Mediterranean Basin is the world's second richest hotspot, and one of the most important locations on the planet for endemic taxa. However, there is no available up-to-date list of Mediterranean endemics. Available data are frequently insufficient or outdated. Therefore, this study aimed at delimiting the Mediterranean floristic region in Egypt, screening its Mediterranean endemics, and determining their habitats, life forms, flowering periods, dispersal types and phyto-geographical distribution. From a list of 275 Mediterranean endemic taxa in Egypt compiled from literature, this study reduced it to 57 taxa (including species, subspecies and varieties; 20.7%) belonging to 46 genera and 22 families. Fifteen major habitats harbored Mediterranean endemics in Egypt, with coastal dunes (17 taxa = 29.8%) and non-saline depressions (16 taxa = 28.1%) being the most represented. Moreover, the Mareotis (west) subsector was the richest (46 taxa = 80.7%). The largest number of taxa was recorded in North African sub-region (52 taxa = 91.2%), followed by Eastern (levant) sub-region (36 taxa = 63.2%). Therophytes were the most recorded life form, while ballochory was the most represented dispersal type. In conclusion, it is crucial to shed the light on Mediterranean endemics and provide an up-to-date documented database to help future management plan that support their conservation and sustainable use.

AB Identifying how reproductive strategies such as the trade-off between clutch size versus egg mass vary with elevational gradients is essential for our understanding of life-history evolution. We studied lacertid lizards (Eremias argus) in China, from six populations at different altitudes, to assess elevational variation in reproductive strategy. We found significant between-population variation in maternal body size and clutch mass, but these variations were not explained by elevational differences. However, high-elevation females tended to produce smaller clutches of larger eggs compared with their low-elevation counterparts, demonstrating an elevational change in the trade-off between egg size and number. The egg size-number trade-off is a reproductive strategy that may favor large offspring, better enabling them to survive severe and unpredictable environments found at high elevations.

AB A strain designated GUMF5 was isolated in Goa-India from sediments of Dead Sea-Israel and identified as haloarchaeon Halomicroarcula pellucida based on 16S rRNA gene analysis similarity value of 99.84%. Strain GUMF5 grew on mineral salts medium with 20% NaCl and 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose-sodium (CMC-Na) as a sole source of carbon and produced haloextremozyme cellulase. The enzyme was concentrated using Sephadex G20, precipitated with ethanol, dialyzed and retentate purified using Sephadex G200, the size exclusion chromatography. A yield of 78.53% cellulase with an activity of 131.13 U/mg and 1.24-fold purity was obtained. The purified cellulase had optimum activity at 20% NaCl, at 40 oC, 0.5% CMC-Na, pH 7 and 150 rpm. SDS-PAGE combined with zymographic analysis revealed the molecular weight of cellulase as 240 kDa, 40 kDa and 17.4 kDa. The activity of the enzyme was stimulated by metallic cations in the order of Ca+2 > Mn+2 > Mg+2 > SO42- > NH4+ and was inhibited by Ag+ > Fe+2 > Cu+2. Methanol and ethanol enhanced the cellulase activity by 6% and 26%, respectively. The haloextremozyme cellulase degraded Whatman No. 1 filter paper indicated in scanning electron micrographs, exposure of open pores and fibers without any intra connectivity corresponding to paperase activity and implicating the possible use of enzyme to bio-convert cellulosic waste. Conclusively, Halomicroarcula pellucida GUMF5 (Accession number: MH244431), globally, is the only Halomicroarcula pellucida isolated from the sediments of Dead Sea producing haloextremozyme cellulase, and hence is an important biotechnological resource.

AB When managing grazing pressure for conservation, understanding forage dynamics is essential. In south-eastern Australia, ongoing grazing is inhibiting regeneration in several semi-arid woodland communities. Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus (Desmarest, 1817)) have been identified as a key component of total grazing pressure. They are thought to switch from grass to lower-quality browse, including tree seedlings, when grass biomass falls below 400 kg ha(-1). One static threshold may not adequately capture the spatial and temporal hazard associated with kangaroo grazing, and this study aimed to explore how grassy biomass varies across a case-study landscape. Understorey biomass and species composition data were collected in the field on seven occasions between December 2016 and May 2019. We used Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to describe the influence of environmental and herbivory variables on total (live and dead) understorey, live understorey, and grass (live and dead) biomass. Canopy cover showed the strongest influence on understorey biomass, with more biomass found in open sites than in woodland. Understorey biomass levels were lowest in summer and autumn. Grass biomass, in particular, fell below the 400 kg ha(-1) forage-switch threshold in wooded areas during this time. We anticipate that an increased understanding of understorey biomass dynamics will inform managers as to when and where to focus management efforts to promote regeneration and sustained recovery of these semi-arid woodlands. Results of this study suggest that conducting management efforts before the summer/autumn decline in understorey biomass, particularly in woodlands, is critical in reducing the browsing risk to seedlings.

AB The biogeochemistry of dissolved selenium (Se) was investigated over 3 years (2015-2017) in the subtropical, warm monomictic and meso-eutrophic Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel). We monitored seasonal variation and vertical distribution of dissolved total Se (T.Se), inorganic oxyanions (Se(IV) & Se(VI)), reduced Se fraction (Red.Se), organic (Org.Se) and volatile Se compounds. T.Se varied between similar to 100 and 160 ng L-1 with Red.Se comprising 40-80% of the Se inventory, and Se(VI) dominating over Se(IV) most of the time. The variation in T.Se and species correlated with winter holomixis vs. summer fall stratification periods. The annual cycle includes: (a) increase of T.Se from fall/winter to spring, representing increased allochthonous Se input flux, along with Se recycling via holomixis; (b) decrease of T.Se from spring to the end of the year, representing the diminishing Se inputs and the evolving output fluxes to the lake's bottom and to the atmosphere. Org.Se variations are directly associated with Chlorophyll-a and primary production attesting for the significant role of phytoplankton activity in the Se cycle. An important Se output flux comprises spring to summer Se uptake by phytoplankton and further volatile compounds production and volatilization accounting for similar to 10% of estimated Se input. The similarity of total dissolved Se concentrations in this work and from mid 1990s attests for long-term stability of the Se inventory. The TVSe concentrations in lacustrine systems being similar to that of estuary systems, the biological role of phytoplankton and eventually the degradation of organic material may produce similar fluxes of volatile Se to the atmosphere.

AB Attractors in Boolean network models representing complex systems such as ecological communities correspond to long-term outcomes (e.g., stable communities) in such systems. As a result, identifying efficient methods to find and characterize these attractors allows for a better understanding of the diversity of possible outcomes. Here we analyze networks that model mutualistic communities of plant and pollinator species governed by Boolean threshold functions. We propose a novel attractor identification method based on generalized positive feedback loops and their functional relationships in such networks. We show that these relationships determine the mechanisms by which groups of stable positive feedback loops collectively trap the system in specific regions of the state space and lead to attractors. Put into the ecological context, we show how survival units-small groups of species in which species can maintain a specific survival state-and their relationships determine the final community outcomes in plant-pollinator networks. We find a remarkable diversity of community outcomes: up to an average of 43 attractors possible for networks with 100 species. This diversity is due to the multiplicity of survival units (up to 34) and stable subcommunities (up to 14). The timing of species influx or outflux does not affect the number of attractors, but it may influence their basins of attraction.

AB Particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and trace gas (CO2, NO2, and SO2) emissions were measured at different units of the Mugher cement factory and nearby residential areas. The prevalence of respiratory system diseases of the community proximate and distant from the factory was also analyzed using clinical records. The emission dispersion pathways were also investigated using a web-based online READY HYSPLIT Dispersion Model and wind rose diagram. Results show the mean ambient air quality for particulate matter PM2.5 (120-973 mu g/m(3)) and PM10 (140-998 mu g/m(3)) at the Mugher cement plant and PM2.5 (106-198 mu g/m(3)) and PM10 (101-303 mu g/m(3)) at a nearby village. The emissions of particulate matter at the factory and nearby village were above the limited value of 150 mu g/m(3) prescribed by Ethiopian ambient air quality guidelines. Acute bronchitis (37.4%), chronic bronchitis (20%), and skin infection (15%) were the dominant diseases observed. Based on age, the highest impact (50.8%) was observed in ages ranging from 0 to 14 whereas that of the age group 15 to 60 was 47%. Restriction of cement particulate emission and demarking a buffer zone between the cement factory and settlements complemented with continued monitoring, and regulatory enforcement should be a top priority to the local authority.

AB Exploring interaction of Beautiful China and SciTech Innovation is an important way to realize economic transformation and sustainable development in China. Existed researches have analyzed the development of ecology or development of SciTech Innovation in China while few have studied the correlation between Beautiful China and SciTech innovation. This study takes Zhejiang province as a case and analyzed the integration level of Beautiful Zhejiang and SciTech Innovation with an aim to shed light on policy making. Evaluating index systems of Beautiful Zhejiang and SciTech Innovation with 8 subsystems and 36 indicators are established. The weights of indexes are calculated with more precise accuracy by combing Structure Entropy Method and Mean Squared Deviation Method. Related statistics of 11 cities of Zhejiang province are collected for time period of 2007-2017, and comprehensive development indexes are evaluated. Coupling coordination degree between the two systems is computed, and coupling coordination degree of 2018-2021 is predicted based on Back Propagation Neural Network. The results show as follows. (1) The development of both systems of Beautiful Zhejiang and SciTech Innovation are in a steady upward trend with SciTech Innovation lagging behind Beautiful Zhejiang. The system of Beautiful Zhejiang ranks as Hangzhou > Ningbo > Wenzhou > Shaoxing > Jinhua > Taizhou > Jiaxing > Huzhou > Zhoushan > Lishui > Quzhou. The system of SciTech Innovation ranks as Hangzhou > Ningbo > Jiaxing > Shaoxing > Wenzhou > Taizhou > Jinhua > Huzhou > Zhoushan > Lishui > Quzhou. (2) The integration level of Hangzhou and Ningbo are developing from Barely Balanced stage to Superior Balanced stage in 2007-2017; Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Shaoxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Zhou Shan, and Taizhou are developing from Slightly Unbalanced stage to Barely Balanced stage; Lishui has the lowest integration level developing from extremely unbalanced stage to barely balanced stage. (3) The integration level based on coupling coordination degree is predicted with the method of Back Propagation Neural Network, and it is found that by 2021 Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Shaoxing and Taizhou will enter the Superior Balanced stage successively while Jiaxing, Huzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, Zhoushan, and Lishui will remain in the Barely Balanced stage.

AB The Galapagos Archipelago is a place where terrestrial adaptive radiations of finches, mockingbirds, and tortoises have been studied extensively. In contrast, little is known about the potential for marine species to diverge among islands. The overall degradation of coral reefs in the Galapagos makes understanding the mechanisms and factors of speciation, the engine of biodiversity, important, and timely. While speciation in marine archipelagos has been described in the past, such as for cone snails in Cabo Verde Archipelago and limpets in Hawaii, adaptive radiations in the marine environment are still rare and poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the Galapagos blue-banded goby, Lythrypnus gilberti, a small endemic fish that is found in shallow subtidal rocky habitats. Using RAD sequencing, we analyzed 19,504 loci that were either neutral, or potentially under directional selection. As expected, considering the small geographic range, population structure based on neutral markers was weak. For loci under directional selection, however, marked differences between islands suggested potential for local adaptation. Our data suggest that for marine species, where dispersal barriers are less apparent, mechanisms of local adaptation may also be at play in the Galapagos Archipelago.

AB On the River Ticino in northern Italy, a small number of captive Eurasian otters Lutra lutra, belonging to the European breeding programme for self-sustaining captive populations, were reintroduced in 1997, after the species had been declared locally extinct in the 1980s. We surveyed for otter signs in 2008, 2010, 2016-2017 and 2018, confirming the presence of what is probably a small population. To assess the abundance and viability of the population, we genotyped fresh spraints collected during the last two surveys, using 11 microsatellite markers, and modelled the population trend using Vortex. A minimum of six individuals were identified from 25 faecal samples. The analysis of mitochondrial DNA determined that the reintroduced otters share a transversion that is characteristic of the Asiatic subspecies Lutra lutra barang, confirming the contribution of the Asiatic subspecies to the genetic pool of the captive-bred founder population. Population size was consistent with the release of three pairs of otters and all models implied that the number of founders was too small to ensure the long-term survival of the population. Stochastic factors are therefore likely to threaten the success of this reintroduction.

AB Ecogeographic rules that describe quantitative relationships between morphologies and climate might help us predict how morphometrics of animals was shaped by local temperature or humidity. Although the ecogeographic rules had been widely tested in animals of Europe and North America, they had not been fully validated for species in regions that are less studied. Here, we investigate the morphometric variation of a widely distributed East Asian passerine, the vinous-throated parrotbill (Sinosuthora webbiana), to test whether its morphological variation conforms to the prediction of Bergmann's rule, Allen's rules, and Gloger's rule. We at first described the climatic niche of S. webbiana from occurrence records (n = 7838) and specimen records (n = 290). The results of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) suggested that the plumage coloration of these parrotbills was darker in wetter/warmer environments following Gloger's rule. However, their appendage size (culmen length, beak volume, tarsi length) was larger in colder environments, the opposite of the predictions of Allen's rule. Similarly, their body size (wing length) was larger in warmer environments, the opposite of the predictions of Bergmann's rule. Such disconformity to both Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule suggests that the evolution of morphological variations is likely governed by multiple selection forces rather than dominated by thermoregulation. Our results suggest that these ecogeographic rules should be validated prior to forecasting biological responses to climate change especially for species in less-studied regions.

AB Understanding ecosystem stability and functioning is a long-standing goal in theoretical ecology, with one of the main tools being dynamical modelling of species abundances. With the help of spatially unresolved (well-mixed) population models and equilibrium dynamics, limits to stability and regions of various ecosystem robustness have been extensively mapped in terms of diversity (number of species), types of interactions, interaction strengths, varying interaction networks (for example plant-pollinator, food-web) and varying structures of these networks. Although many insights have been gained, the impact of spatial extension is not included in this body of knowledge. Recent studies of spatially explicit modelling on the other hand have shown that stability limits can be crossed and diversity increased for systems with spatial heterogeneity in species interactions and/or chaotic dynamics. Here we show that such crossing and diversity increase can appear under less strict conditions. We find that the mere possibility of varying species abundances at different spatial locations make possible the preservation or increase in diversity across previous boundaries thought to mark catastrophic transitions. In addition, we introduce and make explicit a multitude of different dynamics a spatially extended complex system can use to stabilise. This expanded stabilising repertoire of dynamics is largest at intermediate levels of dispersal. Thus we find that spatially extended systems with intermediate dispersal are more robust, in general have higher diversity and can stabilise beyond previous stability boundaries, in contrast to well-mixed systems.

AB Self-organised regular pattern formation is one of the foremost examples of the development of complexity in ecosystems. Despite the wide array of mechanistic models that have been proposed to understand pattern formation, there is limited general understanding of the feedback processes causing pattern formation in ecosystems, and how these affect ecosystem patterning and functioning. Here we propose a generalised model for pattern formation that integrates two types of within-patch feedback: amplification of growth and reduction of losses. Both of these mechanisms have been proposed as causing pattern formation in mussel beds in intertidal regions, where dense clusters of mussels form, separated by regions of bare sediment. We investigate how a relative change from one feedback to the other affects the stability of uniform steady states and the existence of spatial patterns. We conclude that there are important differences between the patterns generated by the two mechanisms, concerning both biomass distribution in the patterns and the resilience of the ecosystems to disturbances.

AB Seed dispersal plays an important role in population dynamics in agricultural ecosystems, but the effects of surrounding vegetation height on seed dispersal and population connectivity on the landscape scale have rarely been studied. Understanding the effects of surrounding vegetation height on seed dispersal will provide important information for land-use management in agricultural landscapes to prevent the spread of undesired weeds or enhance functional connectivity. We used two model species, Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia, growing in small natural ponds known as kettle holes, in an agricultural landscape to evaluate the effects of surrounding vegetation height on wind dispersal and population connectivity between kettle holes. Seed dispersal distance and the probability of long-distance dispersal (LDD) were simulated with the mechanistic WALD model under three scenarios of "low", "dynamic" and "high" surrounding vegetation height. Connectivity between the origin and target kettle holes was quantified with a connectivity index adapted from Hanski and Thomas (1994). Our results show that mean seed dispersal distance decreases with the height of surrounding matrix vegetation, but the probability of long-distance dispersal (LDD) increases with vegetation height. This indicates an important vegetation-based trade-off between mean dispersal distance and LDD, which has an impact on connectivity. Matrix vegetation height has a negative effect on mean seed dispersal distance but a positive effect on the probability of LDD. This positive effect and its impact on connectivity provide novel insights into landscape level (meta-)population and community dynamics - a change in matrix vegetation height by land-use or climatic changes could strongly affect the spread and connectivity of wind-dispersed plants. The opposite effect of vegetation height on mean seed dispersal distance and the probability of LDD should therefore be considered in management and analyses of future land-use and climate change effects.

AB Tooth size variation within fossil assemblages can be associated with intra- or interspecific variation, functional, developmental, and geographical factors, and/or sexual dimorphism. Understanding these sources of variation is necessary to develop diagnoses for fossil mammals, where teeth are usually the most frequent remains. Tremacyllus (Ameghino, 1891) (Hegetotheriidae, Notoungulata) is a genus of small-sized herbivorous mammals abundant in late Miocene to Pliocene outcrops of southern South America. Its simplified, euhypsodont dentition and size variability have hampered systematics studies and led, for instance, to an overestimation of the number of species. I analyzed tooth size variations within assemblages of Tremacyllus in a quantitative framework to test three hypotheses: (1) magnitudes of size variation are different among tooth loci and assemblages; (2) tooth size follows a geographical pattern within the analyzed sample (Bergmann's rule), but is also associated with taxonomy; and (3) there is a correlation between size variation and sexual dimorphism reflected in distinguishable subgroups. Results indicate that patterns of variation might be associated with eruption time and/or functional position. Northwestern forms are larger than southwestern-Pampean ones, not conforming to Bergmann's rule but revealing a strong influence of latitude. Size differences between assemblages agree with dental features that distinguish T. incipiens and T. impressus, allowing expanded species diagnoses. Two size subgroups might reflect sexual dimorphism in the absence of biostratigraphic or morphological differences between them. This interpretation indicates that northwestern specimens referred to T. diminutus should be referred to T. incipiens.

AB The skink genus Lobulia is endemic to New Guinea, the largest and highest tropical island in the world. Lobulia and its related genera represent an important component of the montane herpetofauna of New Guinea, but it remains understudied and poorly known. We here provide the first, large-scale, systematic revision of Lobulia, using molecular phylogenetic and morphological comparisons to assess the monophyly of the genus and the diversity of species within it. We find that Lobulia, as currently defined, is polyphyletic. The eight species currently assigned to it form three clades. Furthermore, many specimens from New Guinea of unknown specific affinity are genetically and morphologically distinct from each other. Based on these data, we re-diagnose Lobulia and two of its closely related genera, Prasinohaema and Papuascincus. We erect four new genera (Alpinoscincus gen. nov., Nubeoscincus gen. nov., Ornithuroscincus gen. nov. and Palaia gen. nov.) to address the problem of polyphyly and describe nine new species Lobulia fortis sp. nov., Lobulia huonensis sp. nov., Loublia marmorata sp. nov., Lobulia vogelkopensis sp. nov., Ornithuroscincus bengaun sp. nov., Ornithuroscincus inornatus sp. nov., Ornithuroscincus pterophilus sp. nov., Ornithuroscincus shearmani sp. nov. and Ornithuroscincus viridis sp. nov. We supplement this taxonomic revision by investigating the biogeographic history of Lobulia s.l. and find evidence for a large radiation in the accreted terranes of New Guinea, with multiple independent colonizations of montane habitats and subsequent recolonization of lowland habitats. Our study reinforces the uniqueness and richness of the montane herpetofauna of New Guinea and the importance of mountains to biodiversity in the Tropics.

AB Naturally fragmented landscapes are adequate systems for evaluating patterns and mechanisms that determine species distribution without confounding effects of anthropogenic fragmentation and habitat loss. We aimed to evaluate an ant metacommunity's spatiotemporal patterns in montane forest islands amid a grassland-dominated matrix. We assessed these patterns by deconstructing the ant metacommunity into forest-dependent and habitat generalist species. We sampled twice a year (summer and winter) over 2 years (2014 and 2015), using soil and arboreal pitfall traps, in fourteen forest islands (varying in size, shape, and connectivity) in the Espinhaco Range Biosphere Reserve, Brazil. We evaluated the relationship between ant species richness, composition (beta-diversity), and predictor variables of forest island structure (canopy cover and understory density) and landscape structure (forest amount, number of forest islands, and shape). We sampled 99 ant species, 66.7% of which were classified as forest-dependent and 33.3% as habitat generalist species. We found that ant beta-diversity was higher in space than in time, and that species composition variation in time (temporal beta-diversity) differed between ant species groups. Both ant groups responded differently to forest island and landscape structure characteristics. Landscape structure seems to act as a spatial filter and the forest islands' local characteristics as an environmental filter, which jointly determine the local and regional diversity. We demonstrate the importance that forest archipelagos pose to ant metacommunity's structure and dynamics in montane tropical regions. Mountaintop conservation and management strategies must consider the forest island archipelago to maintain the biodiversity and the functioning of these systems.

AB Horse mussels Modiolus modiolus can occur in dense aggregations and form areas of ecological and biological significance. In the Bay of Fundy, Canada, aggregations of horse mussels are associated with flow parallel bedforms, and this area is under consideration for designation as a sensitive benthic area which would provide protective measures. Basic demographic information is required to inform the development of effective conservation and management strategies and although general life-history characteristics of M. modiolus are known, detailed quantitative demographic information on this population is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize the population structure of horse mussels in the Bay of Fundy and assess change in key demographic characteristics since the last study in this area in 1997/1998. There have been significant changes in the population since 1998: the 2017 population contains larger, older, mature individuals, with significantly more females; 35% of the current population is over 20 yr of age. Direct evidence that this population has been impacted by bottom-contact fishing gear was also observed. Consistent with M. modiolus populations worldwide, this population demonstrates life-history traits (e.g. slow growth rates, late age of maturity, long lifespan) that make it sensitive and susceptible to disturbance. Coupled with the knowledge that this population overlaps with significant fishing activity, this study supports the assumption that this population is vulnerable to bottom-contact fishing and that recovery from adverse impacts would be slow and uncertain.

AB The development of coastal vermetid reefs and rocky shores depends on the activity of several reef builders, including red crustose coralline algae (CCA) such as Neogoniolithon sp. To initiate studies on the interaction between Neogoniolithon sp. and its associated bacteria, and their impact on the algae physiological performance, we characterized the bacterial community by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These were extracted from the algal tissue and adjacent waters along two sampling campaigns (during winter and spring), in three study regions along a reef in the east Mediterranean Israeli coast and from laboratory-grown algae. The analysis revealed that aquaria and field communities differ substantially, suggesting that future research on Neogoniolithon sp. interaction with its microbiome must rest on aquaria that closely simulate coastal conditions. Some prokaryote classes found associated with the alga tissue were hardly detected or absent from surrounding water. Further, bacterial populations differed between sampling campaigns. One example is the presence of anaerobic bacteria and archaea families in one of the campaigns, correlating with the weaker turbulence in the spring season, probably leading to the development of local anoxic conditions. A better understanding of reef-building activity of CCA and their associated bacteria is necessary for assessment of their resilience to climate change and may support coastal preservation efforts.

AB A pregnancy imposes a heavy reproductive burden on females. Some live-bearing species have evolved reproductive adaptations to reduce this burden, which may influence their ability to use specific microhabitats. We investigate whether two such reproductive adaptations, placentation (embryo provisioning via a placenta) and superfetation (the ability to carry multiple broods at various developmental stages), influence microhabitat selection by five sympatric Costa Rican live-bearing fish species (family Poeciliidae). Theory predicts that placentation and superfetation should both reduce the reproductive burden of females during pregnancy, improve their body streamlining, and swimming performance, and consequently allow them to use more performance-demanding microhabitats. Here we apply underwater visual fish surveys to test a key prediction of this hypothesis, which is that the presence of these two reproductive adaptations is correlated with the use of microhabitats in the river that are characterised by a higher-flow velocity. Consistent with our predictions, we observed significant interspecific differences in daytime microhabitat use: species that had both placentation and superfetation were found in deeper and faster-flowing parts of the river, species that lacked both adaptations were confined to shallow slow-flowing areas, and species with one adaptation (i.e. only superfetation) inhabited intermediate areas. This interspecific daytime microhabitat use was strongest in reproductive adults, intermediate in immatures, and absent in juveniles (the latter of which were all found in shallow low-velocity zones), suggesting that ontogeny influences species-specific microhabitat use. Finally, at night, all fishes, regardless of the species or age-class, congregated in shallow slow-flowing waters to rest (sleep) on the river bottom. Taken together, our results suggest that placentation and superfetation may be hitherto unrecognised reproductive features that help to explain differences in ontogenetic and diurnal microhabitat preferences between sympatric live-bearing fish species living in environments characterised by large flow variation.

AB Animals must often decide between exploiting safe options or risky options with a chance for large gains. Both proximate theories based on perceptual mechanisms, and evolutionary ones based on fitness benefits, have been proposed to explain decisions under risk. Eusocial insects represent a special case of risk sensitivity, as they must often make collective decisions based on resource evaluations from many individuals. Previously, colonies of the ant Lasius niger were found to be risk-neutral, but the risk preference of individual foragers was unknown. Here, we tested individual L. niger in a risk sensitivity paradigm. Ants were trained to associate one scent with 0.55 M sucrose solution and another with an equal chance of either 0.1 or 1.0 M sucrose. Preference was tested in a Y-maze. Ants were extremely risk-averse, with 91% choosing the safe option. Based on the psychophysical Weber-Fechner law, we predicted that ants evaluate resources depending on their logarithmic difference. To test this hypothesis, we designed 4 more experiments by varying the relative differences between the alternatives, making the risky option less, equally or more valuable than the safe one. Our results support the logarithmic origin of risk aversion in ants, and demonstrate that the behaviour of individual foragers can be a very poor predictor of colony-level behaviour.

AB Hot Lake is a small heliothermal and hypersaline lake in far north-central Washington State (USA) and is limnologically unusual because MgSO4 rather than NaCl is the dominant salt. In late summer, the Hot Lake metalimnion becomes distinctly green from blooms of planktonic phototrophs. In a study undertaken over 60 years ago, these blooms were predicted to include green sulfur bacteria, but no cultures were obtained. We sampled Hot Lake and established enrichment cultures for phototrophic sulfur bacteria in MgSO4-rich sulfidic media. Most enrichments turned green or red within 2 weeks, and from green-colored enrichments, pure cultures of a lobed green sulfur bacterium ( phylum Chlorobi) were isolated. Phylogenetic analyses showed the organism to be a species of the prosthecate green sulfur bacterium Prosthecochloris. Cultures of this Hot Lake phototroph were halophilic and tolerated high levels of sulfide and MgSO4. In addition, unlike all recognized species of Prosthecochloris, the Hot Lake isolates grew at temperatures up to 45 degrees C, indicating an adaptation to the warm summer temperatures of the lake. Photoautotrophy by Hot Lake green sulfur bacteria may contribute dissolved organic matter to anoxic zones of the lake, and their diazotrophic capacity may provide a key source of bioavailable nitrogen, as well.

AB The abiotic noise of streams can mask the acoustic signals of anurans with a large body size calling at low frequencies, but not the signals emitted by anurans with a small body size calling at high frequencies. As a consequence, the body size of species in assemblages alongside streams is, on average, lower and less variable than that of assemblages away from streams. Given that the body size in anurans is frequently related to life-history traits, it is expected that functional diversity (FD) will be lower in anuran assemblages alongside streams than in assemblages away from streams. We calculated and compared FD, based on six functional traits, for anuran species in seven localities in different biogeographical regions in the Neotropics. In five lowland localities, FD was lower in assemblages alongside streams than in assemblages away from streams. However, the reverse trend was found in two Andean localities. Noise from streams, acting as an environmental filter, could promote low FD because taxa whose phenotype differs from an optimal type (high call frequency, small body size and associated traits) are excluded from riparian places. However, such habitat filtering could be stronger and affect more anurans in lowland assemblages than in those at medium elevation.

AB Investigators rely on brood surveys to estimate annual fecundity of game birds. However, investigators often do not account for factors that influence brood detection probability nor rarely document how much females and their broods are disturbed (flush rates) during surveys, which could lead to biased survival estimates. We used 45 radio-tagged female Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) with broods to compare detection probabilities and document disturbance among four survey methods to allow future investigators to select the method that best meets their objectives. These methods included daytime flush, daytime visual, nocturnal spotlight, and fecal surveys at nocturnal roost sites, with the latter being a novel method. We used Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) models to compare detection probability and daily survival estimates for visual and fecal surveys of broods 0-47 d post-hatch and a double-survey approach to compare detection probabilities among flush, fecal, and spotlight surveys similar to 42 d post-hatch when investigators often determine brood fate. From CJS models, detection probability for visual surveys increased with brood age (0.618-0.881), whereas detection probability for fecal surveys did not (0.748). Daily survival probability estimates increased with brood age and differed annually based on fecal surveys (2016: 0.978-1.000 and 2017: 0.839-0.998). We detected age-specific daily survival probability with visual surveys (0.956-0.997), but not annual differences. Based on the double-survey approach, detection probability was high (0.857-1.000) for all methods. We flushed similar to 310-750% fewer females and broods during fecal and spotlight surveys than during both types of daytime surveys. Our results highlight the need to account for detection probabilities among methods and document disturbance to hens and broods that can help investigators design surveys to minimize impacts to birds. Furthermore, our result suggest that actions to improve brood survival during the first week post-hatch may improve local recruitment.

SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
LA English
DT Review
DE Poeciliidae; evolution; fin; regeneration; diversification
AB The capacity of regenerating a new structure after losing an old one is a major challenge in the animal kingdom. Fish have emerged as an interesting model to study regeneration due to their high and diverse regenerative capacity. To date, most efforts have focused on revealing the mechanisms underlying fin regeneration, but information on why and how this capacity evolves remains incomplete. Here, we propose the livebearing fish family Poeciliidae as a promising new model system to study the evolution of fin regeneration. First, we review the current state of knowledge on the evolution of regeneration in the animal kingdom, with a special emphasis on fish fins. Second, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms behind fin regeneration in fish. Third, we discuss potential evolutionary pressures that may modulate the regenerative capacity of fish fins and propose three new theories for how natural and sexual selection can lead to the evolution of fin regeneration: (1) signaling-driven fin regeneration, (2) predation-driven fin regeneration, and (3) matrotrophy-suppressed fin regeneration. Finally, we argue that fish from the family Poeciliidae are an excellent model system to test these theories, because they comprise of a large variety of species in a well-defined phylogenetic framework that inhabit very different environments and display remarkable variation in reproductive traits, allowing for comparative studies of fin regeneration among closely related species, among populations within species or among individuals within populations. This new model system has the potential to shed new light on the underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms driving the evolution and diversification of regeneration in vertebrates.

AB Hysteresis dynamics has been described in a vast number of biological experimental studies. Many such studies are phenomenological and a mathematical appreciation has not attracted enough attention. In the paper, we explore the nature of hysteresis and study it from the dynamical system point of view by using the bifurcation and perturbation theories. We firstly make a classification of hysteresis according to the system behaviours transiting between different types of attractors. Then, we focus on a mathematically amenable situation where hysteretic movements between the equilibrium point and the limit cycle are initiated by a subcritical Hopf bifurcation and a saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles. We present a analytical framework by using the method of multiple scales to obtain the normal form up to the fifth order. Theoretical results are compared with time domain simulations and numerical continuation, showing good agreement. Although we consider the time-delayed FitzHugh-Nagumo neural system in the paper, the generalization should be clear to other systems or parameters. The general framework we present in the paper can be naturally extended to the notion of bursting activity in neuroscience where hysteresis is a dominant mechanism to generate bursting oscillations.

TI A spatial genetic framework for koala translocations: where to?

AB Wildlife translocations are gaining acceptance as a valuable conservation tool for threatened Australian fauna. The 20192020 bushfire crisis has significantly affected koala habitat across four states, and translocations, when properly implemented, could facilitate the demographic and genetic recovery of affected populations. Current translocation policies lack an appropriate spatial framework to guide conservation actions and this could lead to unexpected or undesirable outcomes with the potential to hinder population recovery. To address these concerns, we propose development of a spatial framework based on knowledge of population genetic structure and population-specific dispersal patterns estimated from molecular data. At an operational level, application of a spatial genetic framework obviates the need to specify restrictive translocation limits, reduces reliance on subjective interpretations of population structure, and provides the potential to improve translocation success and conservation outcomes. We strongly encourage implementation of a spatial genetic framework and its integration into the decision-making process for selection and prioritisation of release sites for translocated koalas by wildlife carers, researchers and wildlife managers. The proposed framework would also support koala conservation and management more broadly.

AB Body size is believed to be one of the most fundamental functional traits in animals and is evolutionarily conserved in order to guarantee the survival of the species. Besides the phylogenetic backgrounds, body size patterns might be a product of environmental filters, especially within fine taxonomic levels (i.e., within species or geographical lineages). Here, we evaluated the responses of scorpion body size at different organizational levels (inter and intraspecific) along a dry-wet climatic gradient in Brazilian forests. Scorpions were collected from 20 localities in northeastern Brazil, covering 12 sites of dry forests and eight sites in rainforest environments. As a proxy for body size, we measured the carapace length of 368 adult scorpions belonging to 11 species and applied linear mixed-effects models to investigate the potential effects of climatic features and geographical tendencies in this trait at inter- and intraspecific levels. Our findings suggest the existence of a longitudinal pattern of body size in scorpions with species becoming larger in an east-west direction (i.e., towards the continent); such geographical tendency was also detected for one of the three species analyzed at the population level. In addition, the warmer temperature had a negative effect on body size in scorpions at inter- and intraspecific levels. Based on these findings, we assert that body size in scorpions is not affected solely by their phylogenetic history, but also by the physiological constraints imposed by the environment, which becomes more evident across climatic gradients.

AB Over the last 130 years, the landscapes of northern Iceland's fishing villages have experienced repeated reconfigurations based on changing technology, cultural developments, and ecological shifts. However, the interconnected nature of these changes and their role in enabling industrial success have not been systematically assessed. This project aimed to evaluate the ecological and cultural histories of the herring industry of northern Iceland vis-a-vis the built environments in Siglufjorour in order to understand how changes in the built environment facilitated resiliency or increased vulnerability in the adaptive cycle through the spatial and temporal analyses of maps and aerial photographs of the landscape. This paper utilises an adaptive cycle framework to better understand how communities responded to disruptions in the fishing industry. Understanding the relationship between the built environment and the adaptive cycles of industrial communities can help illuminate the factors that cause settlements to succeed or fail.

AB Drylands are ecosystems, where lack of rains imposes harsh conditions for the survival of organisms. These ecosystems are also susceptible to degradation and desertification. Their conservation depends on the understanding of the ecological functioning of vegetation and soil. In drylands, the vegetation is spatially structured as a mosaic of patches (vegetation) and interpatches (bare soil). This structure is a consequence of plant-plant interactions (facilitation and competition). Empirical data and modeling approaches reinforce the role of ecological facilitation for the maintenance of all organisms in drylands. However, the true range of facilitation is still poorly known. Here, we explored data of meso- and microarthropods living in soil, as bioindicators, to infer the range of facilitation provided by plants to soil. As dependent variables, we regard data of abundances and species richness collected in random patches (independent samples) and bare soil places. Data from patch size and distances between bare soil and patches were arranged in a single chute. Thus, one may consider a one-dimensional coordinate system, where zero is the border; negative coordinates are distances between bare soil and the border, while positive coordinates represent patch sizes. Discrete portions of this system are taken to calculate averages and variances of abundance and species richness. With these statistics, we investigate how soil communities vary across the patch border. Techniques of data transformation and signal analysis allowed us to reduce the data noise, reveal a continuous mean behavior, and fit a logistic function. Our findings indicate that soil communities change suddenly from simple patterns to numerous and diverse communities in bare soil regions. This abrupt change of fauna quantities, around 0.35 and 0.5 m outside the patch border, means that the facilitation of vegetation on soil goes beyond the patch border. However, the abundance and richness of soil communities in bare soil are small in comparison to overall quantities of soil arthropods. Consequently, variations in quantities of arthropods on bare soil do not necessarily reflect the main role of these soil arthropods for soil functions, which mainly occurs under the patches. Also, we found a minimum patch size (radius approximate to 0.5 m) able to maintain high diverse communities in soil. Accordingly, our results reveal information that can be interpreted in terms of soil amelioration, and, therefore, it indicates the range of plant facilitation, and the minimum patch size able to produce soil amelioration. These findings provide objective values that can be employed to update the general understanding of the ecological dynamics of drylands,as well as to better plan restoration and conservation actions.

AB Microscopy and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) detect and quantify algae differently. It is not known if microscopy-based abundance or biomass better compare to HTS data or how methodological differences affect ecological inferences about the phytoplankton communities studied.
   We investigated methodological (abundance(microscopy) vs. abundance(HTS), biomass(microscopy) vs. abundance(HTS)), habitat (littoral, pelagic, deep hypolimnion), and year (2014 vs. 2017) differences for phytoplankton communities of Lake Tovel (Italy) using ANOVA. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that depending on comparing abundance(microscopy) or biomass(microscopy) to abundance(HTS) different effects would be indicated; we called this the metric effect. Furthermore, using samples from 2014 to 2017, we investigated environment-community relationships by a redundancy analysis based on abundance(microscopy), biomass(microscopy), and abundance(HTS), and compared the results.
   Approximately 9 times more operational taxonomic units were reported with HTS (n(2014) = 819, n(2017) = 891) than algal taxa with microscopy (n(2014) = 90, n(2017) = 109) in 2014 and 2017. While microscopically assessed algal taxa were evenly distributed among phyla, the vast majority of operational taxonomic units were attributed to Chrysophyta (2014 = 54%, 2017 = 62%) and Bacillariophyta (2014 = 19%, 2017 = 17%). A metric effect for method differences was generally observed comparing abundance(microscopy) to abundance(HTS) with Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta, and Dinophyta showing higher % abundance with microscopy while richness and Chrysophyta showed higher values with HTS. Almost no metric effects were found in 2014, but they were common across phyla in 2017. Bacillariophyta and Eustigmatophyta showed the same habitat differences when comparing biomass(microscopy) to abundance(HTS).
   Dinophyta showed habitat differences only with microscopy, while Chyrsophyta showed habitat differences only with HTS; these results were probably related to technical bias and strengths of HTS, respectively.
   Habitat differences of phyla were reasonably related to their ecological niche and linked to factors such as temperature and feeding preferences; furthermore, phyla often showed a significant 2014-versus-2017 year effect. The year 2014 was very wet while 2017 had a dry winter, and we attributed the patterns found to allochthonous nutrient input by rain and decreased turbulence. Redundancy analyses based on phytoplankton communities assessed with microscopy and HTS, respectively, equally indicated the importance of hydrology, nutrients, and temperature for phytoplankton communities and discriminated the littoral from the deep hypolimnion. However, variance explained was higher with HTS, and the pelagic was similar to the deep hypolimnion with microscopy but to the littoral with HTS.
   Despite the different strengths of microscopy and HTS for biodiversity assessment, both datasets outlined similar large-scale patterns linked to strong environmental control of phytoplankton communities as they related to habitat and year differences. According to our hypothesis, metric effects were common; however, no general rule was found as to whether abundance(microscopy) or biomass(microscopy) should be compared to abundance(HTS).
   Notwithstanding metric effects, HTS-based data provided similar and more detailed information than microscopy, supporting the promise of HTS becoming the tool of the future for biodiversity research.

AB Precipitation is predicted to become more intense in Southern China in the context of climate change; however, the responses of microbial communities to variations in soil moisture have not been well documented for karst areas. The climate is typically in a subtropical monsoon category with two different seasons: a dry season (December-May) and a wet season (June-November). Based on a randomized complete block design (RCBD), a water addition experiment (0, +20, +40, and +60% relative to local precipitation) was established in April 2017, with five replicates, in a degraded grass-shrub community. Sampling was performed in May and at the end of August of 2017. Macroelements (C, H, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S), microelements (Mn, Fe, Zn, and Cu), and non-essential elements (Na, Al, and Si) were quantified in the soil. The total DNA of the soil samples was analyzed through 16S rRNA amplicon by Illumina Miseq. Subsequent to the addition of water during both the dry and wet seasons, the concentrations of non-metal elements (C, H, N, S, and P, except for Si) in the soil remained relatively stable; however, metal elements (K, Na, Fe, and Mg, along with Si) increased significantly, whereas Zn and Ca decreased. During the dry season, fungal and bacterial communities were significantly distinct from those during the wet season along the PC axis 1 (p < 0.001). Water addition did not alter the compositions of bacterial or fungal communities during the dry season. However, during the wet season, water addition altered the compositions of bacterial rather than fungal community based on principal component analysis. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased with water addition and had a significantly positive correlation with K+ (r(2) = 0.70, p < 0.001) and Na+ (r(2) = 0.36, p < 0.01) contents, whereas that of Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia decreased and showed negative correlation with soil K and Na content, and no changes were observed for the fungal phyla. This suggests that the karst bacterial communities can be influenced by the addition of water during the wet season likely linked to changes in soil K and Na contents. These findings implied that increased rainfall might alter the elemental compositions of karst soils, and bacterial communities are likely to be more sensitive to variations in soil moisture in contrast to their fungal counterparts.

AB My aim is to identify the general and specific patterns in the geographical distribution of sable, Martes zibellina, and pine marten, Martes martes, sizes, as well as one sibling species in the general range. For each species, a comparative analysis of the response to environmental gradients in different areas of their ranges was carried out. For the range of each species, as for the twin species, the global trend presented an increase in size from the Pacific to the Atlantic, which revealed a negative longitudinal trend that was more pronounced in the marten. The sable follows Bergmann's rule, whereas the marten demonstrates a significant reverse trend. As a species, the marten shows a significant clinal growth that is directly correlated to the increase in the average annual temperatures and January temperatures, as well as with increased elevation (without any reaction to the July temperatures). As a species, the sable does not correlate with the temperature or elevation gradients. New and diverse patterns of sable and marten sizes across Eurasia were identified. The two species demonstrate the existence of a single zone of minimum sizes in the entire range, and there is a new feature of the growth to the east of the zone where the dimensions are minimal. The marten is adapted to a temperate climate, whereas the sable is adapted to cold and extreme climates. I have proposed several corrections to the conservation plans based on knowledge of the biological characteristics of the marten and sable populations and subspecies.

AB Barriers between islands often inhibit gene flow creating patterns of isolation by distance. In island species, the majority of genetic diversity should be distributed among isolated populations. However, a self-incompatible mating system leads to higher genetic variation within populations and very little between-population subdivision. We examine these two contrasting predictions in Erysimum teretifolium, a rare self-incompatible plant endemic to island-like sandhill habitats in Santa Cruz County, California. We used genome skimming and nuclear microsatellites to assess the distribution of genetic diversity within and among eight of the 13 remaining populations. Phylogenetic analyses of the chloroplast genomes revealed a deep separation of three of the eight populations. The nuclear ribosomal DNA cistron showed no genetic subdivision. Nuclear microsatellites suggest 83% of genetic variation resides within populations. Despite this, 18 of 28 between-population comparisons exhibited significant population structure (mean F-ST = 0.153). No isolation by distance existed among all populations, however when one outlier population was removed from the analysis due to uncertain provenance, significant isolation by distance emerged (r(2) = 0.5611, p = 0.005). Population census size did not correlate with allelic richness as predicted on islands. Bayesian population assignment detected six genetic groupings with substantial admixture. Unique genetic clusters were concentrated at the periphery of the species' range. Since the overall distribution of nuclear genetic diversity reflects E. tereifolium's self-incompatible mating system, the vast majority of genetic variation could be sampled within any individual population. Yet, the chloroplast genome results suggest a deep split and some of the nuclear microsatellite analyses indicate some island-like patterns of genetic diversity. Restoration efforts intending to maximize genetic variation should include representatives from both lineages of the chloroplast genome and, for maximum nuclear genetic diversity, should include representatives of the smaller, peripheral populations.

AB Premise Variation in local density and sex ratio in dioecious plants can affect mating success through the actions of pollen vectors, principally generalist insects or wind. Increased density and male-biased sex ratios should promote pollen transfer and seed production, but their combined effects have not been investigated for ambophilous species, which exhibit both insect and wind pollination.
   Methods We manipulated density (low vs. high) and sex ratio (1:1 vs. 3:1 male-biased) in arrays of dioecious ambophilous Thalictrum pubescens. We quantified visitation rates and foraging times to examine whether pollinators exhibited sex-specific preferences and determined the seed set of arrays.
   Results Pollinators visited more plants per foraging bout at high than low density. Visitation rates and foraging times of visitors were greater for male than for female plants but did not depend on the density or sex ratio of arrays. However, whereas solitary bees displayed a strong preference for males, hover flies were indifferent to plant sex phenotype. Solitary bees also visited significantly more plants per foraging bout than hover flies. There was a significant interaction between density and sex ratio on seed set. At low density, seed set was greater for 3:1 than for 1:1 arrays, but at high density the opposite pattern occurred.
   Conclusions The demographic factors we investigated had complex influences on pollinator foraging behavior and patterns of seed set. Several factors may explain our results, including the influence of density and sex ratio on pollen export from arrays, grooming by pollinators, and the contribution of wind pollination.

AB Seed survival is of great importance for the performance of plant species and it is strongly affected by post-dispersal seed removal by either different animals such as granivorous species and secondary dispersers or abiotic conditions such as wind or water. The success of post-dispersal seed removal depends on seed specific traits including seed size, the presence of coats or elaiosomes, the mode of seed dispersion, and on the habitat in which seeds happen to arrive. In the present study we asked how seed traits (dehulled vs. intact; size; dispersal mode), habitat (forest vs. grassland), and time of day (night vs. day) influence post-dispersal seed removal of the four plant species Chelidonium majus, Lotus corniculatus, Tragopogon pratensis and Helianthus annuus. Seed removal experiments were performed in three regions in Hesse, Germany. The results showed different, inconsistent influences of time of day, depending on habitat and region, but consistent variation across seed types. C. majus and dehulled H. annuus seeds had the fastest removal rates. The impact of the habitat on post-dispersal seed removal was very low, only intact H. annuus seeds were removed at significantly higher rates in grasslands than in forests. Our study demonstrates consistent differences across seed types across different habitats and time: smaller seeds and those dispersed by animals had a faster removal rate. It further highlights that experimental studies need to consider seeds in their natural form to be most realistic.

AB Background. Aggregation affects the fertilization rate of species that utilize external fertilization. However, the process of aggregation has not been studied in detail, using either theoretical models or real world observations. We used the Ezo abalone Haliotis discus hannai as a model animal species to evaluate whether mucus trail following (MTF) facilitates aggregation by reducing the distance between members of opposite sexes. We also examined whether the fertilization rate increase with mucus-trail-following is an evolutionary driving force in mucus following behavior.
   Methods. We used a y-maze to test whether H. discus hannai follows the mucus trails of other individuals. Distances between members of the opposite sex of MTF individuals were compared to non-MTF individuals using an individual-based model (IBM) consistent with the behavior of H. discus hannai. To examine whether MTF behavior evolved to reduce distances between members of the opposite sex, we constructed simple population genetic models of a diploid population with nonoverlapping, discrete generations.
   Results. Haliotis discus hannai chose the y-maze arm with the mucus trail more frequently than the one without, regardless of the sex of the abalone that secreted the mucus or the reproductive season. In the IBM the distance between opposite sexes was significantly reduced by MTF behavior; however, the difference in distances between opposite sex compared to same sex individuals was only several centimeters. Simple population genetic models indicated that the aggregating effect of MTF between the opposite sex members could be an evolutionary driving force.
   Conclusions. These results suggest that observed MTF behavior might have evolved as a mechanism to increase the fertilization rates although other factors could also be involved.

AB Many biological, psychological and economic experiments have been designed where an organism or individual must choose between two options that have the same expected reward but differ in the variance of reward received. In this way, designed empirical approaches have been developed for evaluating risk preferences. Here, however, we show that if the experimental subject is inferring the reward distribution (to optimize some process), they will rarely agree in finite time that the expected rewards are equal. In turn, we argue that this makes discussions of risk preferences, and indeed the motivations of behaviour, not so simple or straightforward to interpret. We use this particular experiment to highlight the serious need to consider the frame of reference of the experimental subject in studies of behaviour.

AB The freshwater dinoflagellate represent microfossils which are very rarely noted in lake deposits. In Late Holocene sediments of the Lake Mlynek, the Ilawa Lakeland, northern Poland, we identified intense blooms of algae of the genus Palatinus. They occurred primarily in the period of strong human impact during expansion of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Order. The most amazing thing is that samples in which conventional palynological maceration has been used dinoflagellate are represented by armored vegetative forms instead of cysts. During this laboratory processes, especially acetolysis, cellulosic thecae of armored forms should be destructed. This is the second known example of acetolysis resistant thecae of modern dinoflagellate, built by substance other than cellulose. Palatinus blooms were associated probably with the hydrotechnical works made by Teutonic Knights in the catchment, which caused supply and discharge of micronutrients e.g. selenium in the basin.

AB Results of a study of the water temperature and phytoplankton abundance in different regions of Lake Baikal according to 15 expeditions from 1994 to 2013 during late summer are present. The spatial distribution and interannual dynamics of phytoplankton are analyzed. The total abundance of phytoplankton in late summer is shown to be high. Its average long-term value for all of the open area of Lake Baikal is 532 +/- 17 thousand cells/L. In Southern Baikal, the west coast is characterized by higher average phytoplankton abundance; in Middle and Northern Baikal, the east coast is rich. No significant differences were found between the hollows of the lake in terms of the development of late summer phytoplankton. The long-term average abundance of phytoplankton in the southern, middle, and northern hollows differs only by <= 1.2 times, but in the middle hollow it is significantly higher than in the northern. In the long-term dynamics, no significant increase in the abundance of late summer phytoplankton was recorded in any of the regions of the lake. The dependence of the total phytoplankton abundance on water temperature is weak; the correlation coefficients between the average annual values of these indicators are <= 0.50.

AB East Africa is one of themost important paleoanthropological localities on Earth. Laetoli and Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania) are among the world's premier areas for Australopithecus afarensis, Paranthropus boisei, and Homo habilis remains. Laetoli is also unique in its preservation of footprint trails within Tuff 7 left by Australopithecus afarensis. Tuff 7 has been studied to characterize microorganisms living inside these tuffs and to estimate their potential involvement in destructive processes; 35 species of microfungi, as well as sterile white and dark mycelia were identified by cultural method. The results of the metagenomic analysis show that anamorphic ascomycetes are the predominant group in all samples. They occur as hyphae and mycelia inside the tuffs, and are concentrated in pores, microcracks and cavities. The number of micromycetes is moderate (up to 7000 CFU per gram of substrate). Typical cultivated microfungi are from genera Aspergillus and Fusarium. They are known as active destructors of natural and artificial substrates and can colonize building materials. Molecular genetic methods revealed a large group of different bacteria (23 phyla) within the tuff. The microbiota consists mostly of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria. Their relative distribution shows the preferential occurrence of Bacteroidetes in the upper part of stratigraphic sections (soil), and concentration of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria within the tuffs. Exposure of the Footprint tuff could lead to the development of photosynthetic microorganisms (Cyanobacteria). We conclude that microbiological activity within the study area appears to be moderate and the Footprint Tuff does not presently require any treatment with biocides. However, the presence of black biofilms on the surface of the Footprint conservationmound concrete shows that biodestruction does occur.

AB Benthic substrate of Tuxpan reef, Veracruz, Mexico, with emphasis on scleractinian coral community was characterized in order to define a model of richness and coral cover for platform reefs of Veracruz. 117 phototransects were distributed in 4 zones and 16 reef habitats during 2015. A total of 2,920 photographs were taken on transects with 25 m in length for estimate morpho functional groups (MFG) and coral cover using the Coral Point Count program. Richness and coral cover were compared in order to determine their similarity between zones and reef habitats regarding MFG and coral cover using statistical or ecological tests. scleractinian coral community of Tuxpan reef was composed by 36 species and the richness showed differences between zones and was greater in reef slopes. According with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and ANOSIM, the GMF and species coral cover characterized 4 reef zones: reef flat, reef crest, windward slope and leeward slope. Leeward coral cover was inversely proportional to depth, higher values were observed on 3 to 15 m depth. Windward coral cover did not show relationship with depth, the higher values were detected on 10 to 20 m. The characterization of Tuxpan reef could serve as model of platform reefs of Veracruz as well as to management plans of this Natural Protected Area, especially on snorkel and diving practices.

AB Although animal reintroductions are commonly used for conservation, documented successes with imperiled rodents are limited. Most Neotoma (woodrat) reintroduction attempts have released small numbers of individuals and either failed to establish populations or required frequent management for populations to persist. The translocation of 422 N. floridana (Eastern Woodrat) to 5 sites in the southeastern tip of Illinois during 2003-2009 and 172 Eastern Woodrats to 2 southern Illinois state parks during 2013-2014 are the only woodrat reintroductions to date with > 50 individuals released per site. We evaluated the success of these Illinois reintroductions by comparing Eastern Woodrat abundance and evidence of reproduction to published performance indicators. During 2012-2014, we captured 436 individual Eastern Woodrats and observed signs of reproduction in 63% of females from the southeastern tip of Illinois and captured Eastern Woodrats nearly 9 km from release sites. In 2017, we captured 52 Eastern Woodrats at Illinois state parks and observed signs of reproduction in 73% of females. Our findings indicate that the 2003-2009 Eastern Woodrat reintroduction and a 2013-2014 Eastern Woodrat reintroduction can be considered successful (all performance indicators met), while the other 2013-2014 Eastern Woodrat reintroduction can be considered potentially successful (1 out of 2 performance indicators met). Our study adds to the sparse information on successful rodent reintroductions that managers can use to inform structured decision making for future conservation and management actions.

AB Latitudinal diversity gradients are well-known for plants and animals, but only recently similar patterns have been described for some specific microbial communities in distinct habitats. Although microbial diversity is well-investigated worldwide, most of the studies are spatially too restricted to allow general statements about global diversity patterns. Additionally, methodological differences make it hard and often impossible to compare several studies. This study investigated the cyanobacterial diversity in tidal flats along geographical and ecological gradients based on high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene fragments (Illumina MiSeq) and environmental data on a large spatial scale from the subtropics to the Arctic. Latitude and strongly correlated environmental parameters (e.g. temperature) were identified as important drivers of cyanobacterial diversity on global scale resulting in a latitudinal diversity gradient similar to that known from plants and animals. Other non-correlated parameters (e.g. grain size) were shown to be more important on local scales, although no consistent pattern occurred across different locations. Among a total number of 989 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) only one cosmopolitan (classified as Coleofasciculus chthonoplastes), but many location-specific and putative endemic ones (78%) were detected. High proportions of rare members of the community (up to 86%) were found in all samples. Phylogenetic beta diversity was shown to be influenced by the developmental stage of the mat community becoming increasingly similar with increasing stabilization.

AB This study aimed to determine the effect of cadmium pollution on some life history traits of Porcellio laevis populations sampled along a contamination gradient in the region of Sfax (central Tunisia). To characterize each population, woodlice were collected in the spring and parameters such as the number of individuals, sex-ratio, body length and cephalothorax width of the different categories of individuals were determined. Since the sampling period coincided with the reproduction period of the species, number and diameter of eggs, embryos, and mancas were counted and measured for ovigerous females of each of the studied population. Relative growth was estimated using a morphometric relationship between the body length and the cephalothorax width to determine the type of relationship (isometric/allometric). The number of eggs, embryos and mancas varied between the sampled populations and ranged between 13.25 + 7.18 and 58.85 + 36.37; 25 + 8.71 and 40.9 + 11.47; 11.5 + 7.77 and 29 mm, respectively. The mean size of eggs, embryos and mancas ranged between 0.491 +/- 0.077 and 0.558 +/- 0.098 mm, 0.697 +/- 0.070 and 0.918 +/- 0.206 mm, and 0.945 +/- 0.248 and 1.554 +/- 0.236 mm, respectively. Body length, cephalothorax width, eggs and embryos sizes, were lower in the population sampled from the most polluted site compared to the other populations. Additionally, based on the Pearson's correlation, negative and non-significant correlations were found between the number and the size of the different reproductive stages (eggs, embryos and mancas), and cadmium soil content. The morphometric parameters showed a significant correlation between the body length and the cephalothorax width, and globally a negative allometry was observed.

AB Organisms that live in coastal estuaries often experience significant seasonal and annual fluctuations in salinity that they must either endure or move to avoid. Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides is a freshwater fish that lives in coastal estuaries and does not migrate/move to avoid seasonal salinity increases. Additionally, estuarine Largemouth Bass exhibit growth rates, condition factors, and life history strategies that differ from their inland counterparts. These differences suggest the potential for physiological adaptations to tolerate and even thrive in estuarine environments. We compared swimming performance (quantified as critical swimming speed, U-crit) of Largemouth Bass (280-404mm total length) from an Alabama estuarine population versus an inland population at 0, 4, 8, and 12ppt salinities to test for physiological performance-based adaptation to tolerate elevated salinities. U-crit values did not differ between inland and estuarine Largemouth Bass nor were there any salinity effects. Although inland and estuarine Largemouth Bass may possess different physiological mechanisms for tolerating salinity, those mechanisms did not affect swimming performance.

AB The present study investigates whether experiential learning through cultural promenades and ancient Greek drama can constitute an effective method of instilling cultural values in the new generation. For this reason, field research was conducted in the broader area of Acropolis in Athens, Greece. Qualitative research through in-depth interviews followed, in order to record 42 student teachers' perceptions after their own experiential contact with the method of cultural promenades. This research method with teacher candidates during their vocational training as future teachers is of great importance, as it will indicate whether the method of instilling cultural values through cultural promenades and ancient Greek drama is effective enough to be adopted in later teacher candidates' teaching in schools. The choice of the sample is strategic, since the teaching specialty of the majority is economics and management, and thus teachers get acquainted with an innovative experiential methodology on teaching economic and cultural sustainability, which-according to literature-are interconnected. The findings reported valuable insights on the effectiveness of the said teaching methodology. The present research is the first that focuses on the descriptive interrelations among cultural promenades, experiential learning, cultural values, and sustainability, and thus it provides policy makers and teachers with invaluable insights.

AB In this paper we study a model of population which is described by positive solutions to the nonlinear boundary value problem
   { -Delta u = au - bu(2) - cu(2)/1+u(2) - epsilon, x is an element of Omega,
   n.del u + g(u) = 0, x is an element of partial derivative Omega.
   Here Omega is a bounded smooth domain of R-N, Delta is the Laplacian operator, a, b, c, epsilon are positive parameters and g is an element of C-1 ( [0, infinity), [theta, infinity)) is decreasing for some theta > 0. This model describes the dynamics of the fish populations. Our existence results are established via the well-known sub-super solution method.

ID PAPER UNDERSTANDING EXPANSION; HEAVY-METALS; EARLY HYDRATION; BELITE
   CEMENTS
AB One of the benefits of calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements is that these materials gain strength rapidly, and strength development is often measured in hours instead of days. This property makes these materials desirable for use in temporary, nonreinforced repairs of roadways, airfields, and navigable locks. The rapid repair of these infrastructure elements is critical to transporting supplies into regions devastated by disaster. In these austere environments, potable water may not be available in sufficient quantities to make vital repairs, and the use of impure water in the production of CSA cement-based concrete would be advantageous. However, the hydration products formed by CSA cement are significantly different from those formed by portland cement and may react differently to alkalis, chlorides, sulfates, and other contaminates that these impure water sources may contain. This article investigates the impact of calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium chloride and calcium, sodium, and magnesium sulfate on the early-age unconfined compressive strength development of commercially available CSA cement-based concrete. Of these salts, calcium chloride had the greatest effect on early-age concrete properties, retarding unconfined compressive strength development. The strength results obtained from CSA cement-based concrete mixed with these saline solutions are compared with those obtained from potential real-world sources of mixing water, including seawater and greywater.
