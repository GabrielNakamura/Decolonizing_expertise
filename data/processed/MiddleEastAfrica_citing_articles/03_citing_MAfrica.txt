AB While induced defense of aquatic organisms against predators has been considerably studied by both laboratory and field research, our understanding is still limited about, for example, whether induced defense is variable between microhabitats within the same lake and how multiple predators influence induced defense in the natural environment. Here, we examined whether a rotifer species, Brachionus calyciflorus showed a different development degree of induced defenses against its predator Asplanchna and cyclopoid copepods between the microhabitats of a macrophyte bed consisting of Trapa species and open water. B. calyciflorus was more abundant and had larger posterolateral spines as a defensive trait in open water than in the Trapa bed. Asplanchna was more abundant in open water than in the Trapa bed, whereas cyclopoids were more abundant in the Trapa bed. Both of the predators significantly affected the development of the defense trait. The effect of Asplanchna on the defense trait was positive, whereas the effect of cyclopoids was negative. Thus, a spatial difference in the development degree of induced defense between the microhabitats occurred as the dense Trapa bed influenced the abundance of the two predators. The results also suggest that the induced defense of B. calyciflorus was effective in reducing the predation pressure from Asplanchna while B. calyciflorus was not able to avoid predation by cyclopoids in the Trapa bed.

AB Females of the solitary digger bee Andrena florea Fabricius, 1793 (Hymenoptera, Andrenidae) nest in aggregations and collect pollen almost exclusively on dioecious plants of the genus Bryonia, making this species a good model to study the relationship between nest density, male density, male behaviour and female lecty. At a study site in the valley of the river Serio, in Italy, an aggregation of this bee showed low density of randomly distributed nests and was closely surrounded by B. dioica plants. Female nectar foraging and male feeding and mate-searching activity, confined to the host plants, peaked at similar hours across the day, while female pollen foraging peaked earlier. Males fed on plants of both sexes but seemed to perch waiting for females more frequently on male B. dioica leaves. Individual males more often visited only one of the male plants, for up to four days; here they did not interact aggressively with conspecifics, suggesting scramble competition in resource-based home ranges and not territoriality. These findings are preliminarily in accordance with the predicted resource-based rendez-vous sites at low nest density for oligolectic bees and the predicted occurrence of scramble competition in case of high male density. Additionally, males would maximize their mating opportunity by mainly perching on male plants, the only source of the most limited resource for females (pollen).

AB The reality of spatial clinal variation in morphological traits of freshwater pulmonate snails (Gastropoda: Pulmonata) has repeatedly been questioned or totally discounted. There is a lack of sound statistical evidence in the articles hitherto published on this subject supporting these claims. Here, by means of different analytical methods (analysis of spatial autocorrelation, linear regression analysis, canonical correlation analysis and others), we demonstrate that shell variation in the dwarf pond snail, Galba truncatula, is patterned in space throughout the northern and central Palearctic, with latitudinally-oriented clines in body size and in some shell proportions. Shell size in G. truncatula decreases with latitude and temperature, representing a special case of converse Bergmann cline. However, the temperature itself is hardly the main driver of shell size variation. It is argued that the shorter growing seasons at high latitudes may represent a better explanation for the observed trend. Shell proportions in the dwarf pond snails vary weakly at the macrogeographic scale, being spatially patterned at lower (mesogeographic) scales around 1200-1500km. In general, spatial variation in G. truncatula shell size is decoupled from variation in shell shape, demonstrating clear scale-dependence similar to that found in different species of terrestrial (non-aquatic) pulmonate snails.

AB To assess the success of a European badger reintroduction after 10 years, we monitored the reintroduction area (Regional Park of Montevecchia and Curone Valley, N Italy) using camera-trapping. Badgers were recorded 94 times by 20 camera-traps, spread over 12 out of the 15 1 km(2) grid-squares totally or partially surveyed. Eighteen videoclips recorded cubs, providing evidence of the occurrence of at least two litters. The occurrence of five badger social groups could be assessed, corresponding to 0.9-1.15 individual/km(2). All suitable habitats of the reintroduction area have been currently colonised.

AB MARRUBIUM VULGARE L (white horehound) is a perennial flowering species belongs to Labiatae (Lamiaceae). Marrubium genus is native to North Africa, Europe, and the Mediterranean basin. Worldwide, it represented by 30 species. In Egypt, there are two species only distributed in the northern coastal belt wherever calcareous or oolitic sand formation, especially in marginal lands and waste ground, the ruins of the old abandoned house and road sides. The main differences between the two species are life span (perennial and annual), number of calyx teeth (10 and 5) and the color of the corolla (white and pale pink) of M. vulgare and M. alysson, respectively. With the accelerated rate of climate change and urbanization and their destroyed effects on biodiversity loss and fragmentation of habitat. This study examines if some species could adapted to habitat disturbance. For this purposes we choose M. vulgare as a model species for habitat disturbance. Phenological aspects, distribution, density, size structure and reproductive efforts of M. vulgare were studied in four different locations in the western Mediterranean section. Locations are representing two different habitats: Road sides (wild habitats) and abandoned places (urban habitat). The study claimed that there are a significant difference between reproductive efforts, size index and density, whereas, no differences between the phenological aspects.

AB It is a common understanding that rotational cattle grazing provides better yields than continuous grazing, but a quantitative analysis is lacking in agricultural literature. In rotational grazing, cattle periodically move among paddocks in contrast to continuous grazing, in which the cattle graze on a single plot for the entire grazing season. We construct a differential equation model of vegetation grazing on a fixed area to show that production yields and stockpiled forage are greater for rotational grazing than continuous grazing. Our results show that both the number of cattle per acre and stockpiled forage increase for many rotational configurations.

AB Progressive body-size dwarfing of animal populations is predicted under chronic mortality stress, such as that inflicted by human harvesting. However, empirical support for such declines in body size due to elevated mortality is lacking. In fact, the size of three macropodid species the two grey kangaroo species, Macropus fuliginosus and M.giganteus, and the Red-necked Wallaby, M.rufogriseus appears to have increased since European settlement in Australia, despite these species being subjected to size-selective harvesting over this period. To test whether this unexpected trend also characterises other species, we sought evidence of human-induced body-size changes in the two most widely distributed kangaroo species, the Euro Macropus robustus and Red Kangaroo M.rufus, from the late 19th Century onwards. Spatial autoregressive models controlling for age, sex and island effects were first used to identify environmental predictors of body size and to evaluate multi-causal explanations for spatial body-size patterns. Primary productivity emerged as the key driver of body size in both species, while heat conservation was supported as a further mechanism explaining the large body size of M.robustus in cold climatic regions. After controlling for these environmental factors, we find that the size of M.rufus has been stable over time and limited support for a small increase in the size of M.robustus. Hence, there is no empirical evidence that contemporary size-selective harvesting has reduced body size in these species. Rather, the latter result supports the possibility that pasture improvement and/or dingo control (and associated reduction in predation pressure) facilitated body-size increases following European settlement in Australia.

AB In this study I tested the effect of Syagrus loefgrenii nut size and number on the intensity of removal by rodents across seasons. Trials were performed in which piles of either small or large endocarps (1, 3, 6, 12, and 25) were subjected to removal by rodents in the Cerrado (Brazilian savanna). Despite of variations in the intensity of removal, always this process decrease conform endocarp number. Also, mean proportion of endocarp removal was unrelated to year period, initial number, and size of endocarps. Hence, endocarp removal was consistently negative density-dependent. As, in principle, the observed patterns of nut removal point out similar survival chances for both nut sizes, the pervasive negative density-dependent response emerges as a strategy in S. loefgrenii to swamp rodents all year round irrespective of seed size.

AB Seagrass (Halodule uninervis and Halophila stipulacea) and algae (green and brown) species are widely distributed along the coastal zones of the Bahrain national water. In this study the potential of Landsat-OLI VNIR spectral bands was investigated for distinction and discrimination among these species using spectral reflectances. The measured spectra's of each species considering different coverage rate (0, 10, 30, 75 and 100%) were transformed using continuum-removed (CR) approach, resampled and convolved in the solar-reflective spectral bands of OLI using a radiative transfer code, then converted to water vegetation indices (WVI). Regression analysis were performed between the transformed WVI and the coverage rates of each species individually (seagrass and algae) and mixed; as well between WVI and NIR reflectances. Spectral and CR analyses showed that the blue and the green bands perform better than the coastal and the red bands for seagrass and algae classes' discrimination. This result was further corroborated by the WVI. Regression results between the coverage rates and WVI calculated with green and NIR bands showed that the TDAVI and WAVI discriminate significantly among the mixed species (R-2 of 0.70), and between individual species (R-2 of 0.80 for algae and for seagrass). Accomplished between WVI and NIR reflectances, regression correlations were more significant when all mixed samples (R-2 of 0.95) have been considered, likewise when we consider individually the two seagrass (R-2 of 0.95) and the two algae species (R-2 of 0.82).

AB Howler monkeys (genus Alouatta) are large folivorous primates living in South America. We tested for the application of both Rensch's rule and Bergmann's rule to body size variation in Alouatta. We found that Rensch's rule does apply in howlers. In Alouatta, males exploit dominance rank competition, and take advantage from seasonal abundance of high nutritious fruit supply in their diet. This mating system and dietary charateristics suggest positive male selection for body size is responsible for Rensch's rule. However, since folivory favors large body size in primates (to lower mass specific metabolic rate) and it is the primary dietary habitus in howlers, larger species do occur in the Amazon basin, originating a reversed Bergmann's rule pattern for both males and females at the interspecific level. The spatial and phylogenetic components of such body size patterns of variation are both important, implying Alouatta ecomorphological differences to occur above the species level, justifying their non-overlapping geographic distribution.

AB Rehabilitation and reintroduction have become important to the management and welfare of primates worldwide. However, the suitability and success of these practices must be evaluated to determine their effectiveness as well as to improve programs and methods, as little is known about the factors influencing survival of released individuals. Between 2011 and 2014, 28 howler monkeys, Alouatta pigra, were released at Fireburn Reserve, northern Belize by the Primate Rehabilitation Centre of Belize: Wildtracks. From March to August 2015, field trips were made to determine the number and identity of surviving individuals to assess whether differences in individual outcomes (survived or disappeared) could be associated with specific characteristics or backgrounds of the monkeys. Fourteen of the twenty rehabilitated monkeys and seven of the eight translocated monkeys were found alive. The proportion of surviving individuals was not significantly different between rehabilitants and translocated animals, males and females, former pets and wild animals, short-and long-term rehabilitants, or different ages at release or intake. As mortality was low and none of the general factors analyzed influenced survivorship, it is suggested that chance or individual traits may be important in the outcomes of releases. This study provides an example of successful population reintroduction from both rehabilitation and translocation programs, and the first analyses of characteristics impacting the success of releases of howler monkeys.

AB Tasmanian Mountain Pepper is a new crop that produces a valuable flavoring agent derived from its fruit. However, annual yields are unpredictable and its commercial prospects depend upon a reliable fruit set. As poor pollination is a possible cause, the pollination biology of this dioecious plant was examined in natural and plantation settings using direct observations, sticky traps, gas chromatography, and microscopy. A community of small insects visits the flowers, and the insect species represent at least seven families of small flies, three families of beetles, and various wasps and moths. Pollen grains were observed on the bodies of bibionid flies (Bibionidae), syrphid flies (Syrphidae), and snail-flies (Sciomyzidae). The tetrahedral tetrad pollen grains are unlikely to be suitable for dispersal by wind. Similar volatiles were emitted by both males and females; several ocimene compounds are attractants for insect pollen vectors. The female flowers also emitted indole, a known fly attractant. It is therefore likely that Tasmannia lanceolata is dependent on the services of diverse insects, especially Diptera, for promoting fruit set. Plantations should be established in the vicinity of biodiverse native vegetation that supports a wide variety of native flying insects capable of transferring pollen.

AB The area and length of the right fore and hind wings and the abdomen length were analysed in specimens from two Iberian populations of Libellula quadrimaculata Linnaeus, 1758, one on a plateau (782 m a.s.l.) and another in the mountains (1909 m a.s.l.), with a view to ascertaining whether their morphometric characteristics vary with altitude. Allometric relationships in terms of length and area of the fore and hind wings of both populations were found. The wings are longer and have a greater area in plateau specimens whereas the length of the abdomen did not vary between populations. Between the populations there was an overlap in the wing length measurements. The significance of these parameters in aiding the dragonflies' flight capacity and hence the effects on their lifestyle under different environmental conditions is discussed.

AB Question: We asked whether a desert ant population and a community of heteromyid rodents select Dithyrea californica seeds in relation to their size, frequency of seed sizes, and absolute density and thus have the capacity to influence natural selection on seed size.
   Hypothesis: Following the predictions of optimal diet theory, we hypothesized that seed predators will prefer to prey upon larger seeds, that seed selection should be frequency independent, and that only variation in the absolute density of the preferred seeds will influence predator behaviour by lowering their preference for larger seeds.
   Organisms: A colony of the desert harvester ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus and a community of heteromyid rodents (Dipodomys merriami and Dipodomys desertii).
   Site of experiments: Reserva de la Biosfera El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar and Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico.
   Methods: We conducted two preference experiments in which we offered D. californica seeds that varied in size, relative frequency of sizes, and absolute density of seeds to a population of the harvester ant and to the community of heteromyid rodents of the Sonoran Desert.
   Results: We found that ants had a preference for larger seeds whereas rodents had an equal preference for large and small seeds, despite variation in seed frequency and density. In accordance with optimal diet theory, seed predation was frequency independent. Contrary to our predictions, neither changes in absolute density of larger seeds nor of smaller seeds had a significant influence on predator behaviour.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that only Pogonomyrmex rugosus influenced selection on seed size, which it does by preferring larger seeds and counteracting the competitive effect of larger seeds in other life stages. Selection via seed predation conflicts with post-germination selection on seed size, when encountered by ants but not rodents.

AB Desertification in dryland ecosystems is considered to be a major environmental threat that may lead to devastating consequences. The concern increases when the system admits two alternative steady states and the transition is abrupt and irreversible (catastrophic shift). However, recent studies show that the inherent stochasticity of the birth-death process, when superimposed on the presence of an absorbing state, may lead to a continuous (second order) transition even if the deterministic dynamics supports a catastrophic transition. Following these works we present here a numerical study of a one-dimensional stochastic desertification model, where the deterministic predictions are confronted with the observed dynamics. Our results suggest that a stochastic spatial system allows for a propagating front only when its active phase invades the inactive (desert) one. In the extinction phase one observes transient front propagation followed by a global collapse. In the presence of a seed bank the vegetation state is shown to be more robust against demographic stochasticity, but the transition in that case still belongs to the directed percolation equivalence class.

AB Reproductive traits provide information about the ways by which available resources are allocated during breeding. We tested for environmental drivers of large scale geographical patterns in assemblage mean clutch size, number of broods and overall reproductive investment per breeding season in European birds. We combined data about geographical distribution with published information about reproductive traits, and calculated mean trait values for avian assemblages occurring in 50 x 50 km grid cells. In total, we employed data from 499 species and 2059 assemblages. As the time available for breeding and the amount of food limit the reproductive effort, we related the geographical variation in reproductive traits to the length of breeding season, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a surrogate of resource availability, and its seasonality. Geographical patterns in traits may differ between reproductive modes, thus we performed the analyses separately for altricial Passerines (n = 203) and precocial non-passerine species (n = 164) and controlled for the effect of taxonomy. Large clutches dominated in areas with high NDVI and, in precocial birds, also in areas with high annual seasonality and a long breeding season. High number of broods and high overall reproductive investment dominated in areas with a long breeding season, and high number of broods was found also in areas with low annual seasonality, but only in precocial species. High overall reproductive investment dominated in highly productive areas and also in areas with low annual seasonality in both groups. The increase in reproductive investment is caused mostly by an increase in the number of broods related to the length of season and partly by increase in clutch size related to NDVI. We found a negative correlation between clutch size and the number of broods in Passerines, which might suggest a trade-off between these traits. Processes behind trait patterns differ between altricial and precocial species.

AB Since juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) occupy a similar habitat in Lake Ontario tributaries, we sought to determine the degree of diet similarity between these species in order to assess the potential for interspecific competition. Atlantic salmon, an historically important but currently extirpated component of the Lake Ontario fish community, are the focus of a bi-national restoration effort. Presently this effort includes the release of hatchery produced juvenile Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario tributaries. These same tributaries support substantial numbers of naturally reproduced juvenile Pacific salmonids including Chinook salmon. Subyearling Atlantic salmon and subyearling Chinook salmon had significantly different diets during each of the three time periods examined. Atlantic salmon fed slightly more from the benthos than from the drift and consumed mainly chirononmids (47.0%) and ephemeropterans (21.1%). The diet of subyearling Chinook salmon was more closely associated with the drift and consisted mainly of chironomids (60.2%) and terrestrial invertebrates (16.0%). Low diet similarity between subyearling Atlantic salmon and subyearling Chinook salmon likely minimizes competitive interactions for food between these species in Lake Ontario tributaries. However, the availability of small prey such as chironomids which comprise over 50% of the diet of each species, soon after emergence, could constitute a short term resource limitation. To our knowledge this is the first study of interspecific diet associations between these two important salmonid species.

AB Incubated branches of coral Stylophora pistillata in five sites along the Jordanian coast of the Gulf of Aqaba were investigated to determine trace elements composition and mineral phase in their skeleton using Energy Disperse X-rays (EDX) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD), respectively. The mineral phase was identified as aragonite. Six trace elements were found in coral skeletons: Mg, Sr, S, Cl, Ni, and Na. Coral branches from the Public Beach site was found to contain the highest concentrations of trace elements compared to other sites due to the impact of human activities. Samples from the Phosphate Terminal were poorly mineralized and dominated by organic matrix, having only 10% of the average calcium present in the samples from other sites. This could be attributed to the role of phosphate in inhibition of calcification and enhancement of photosynthesis. The variations in elemental contents of the coral from different sites along the Jordanian coast of the Gulf of Aqaba are proposed as environmental proxies of seawater chemistry and anthropogenic activities.

AB The industrial heritage in any landscape is represented by objects and other traces left by industry and associated human activities, which do not serve the present industry and inhabitants in the same way as they did before. Spatial concentrations of objects of such heritage form post-industrial landscapes (PIL). The paper deals with the procedures for PIL identification on the Czech national level, classification of PIL and their initial assessment for management done for PIL in the Czech border zone with Austria. Publicly accessible data sources on man-made land forms, land use, brownfields, mined sites, contaminated sites, industrial architectural heritage, etc. were used with GIS technology. The outline, area, content and topic description are essential for decision making about PIL future. The generic classes of PIL were assessed from the viewpoint of their possible impact on human life and activities. Preliminary management proposals were developed.

AB Translocation is one of the fundamental tools in wildlife management but only if appropriately undertaken. In 2009, 30 black lechwe antelopes were suddenly translocated from the State House Habitat (STH) into the newly established Lusaka National Park (LNP). However, within 4 months of being translocated to LNP, 28 black lechwes (93%) died. A pathological report produced by veterinarians following a postmortem examination suggested no disease incidence affected the antelopes. The food quality of LNP was tested and compared to that in the STH and the antelopes' native habitat of the Bangweulu wetlands (BGW) to establish if variations in food quality were responsible for the antelopes' mortality. The findings suggest that the food quality in LNP was greatly inferior to that in STH, which could explain the observed high mortality of the antelopes in LNP. Further, the quality of food in LNP did not widely differ from that in the BGW, suggesting that the antelopes might not have survived had they been translocated to their native habitat, as they had already adapted to feeding on highly nutritious supplementary feed at the STH.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS

DT Article
ID SYSTEMS; THRESHOLDS
AB There is an undeniable disconnect between theory-heavy economics and the real world, and some cross polination of ideas with econophysics, which is more balanced between data and models, might help economics along the way to become a truly scientific enterprise. With the coming of the era of Big Data, this transformation of economics into a data-driven science is becoming more urgent. In this article, I use the story of Kepler's discovery of his three laws of planetary motion to enlarge the framework of the scientific approach, from one that focuses on experimental sciences, to one that accommodates observational sciences, and further to one that embraces data mining and machine learning. I distinguish between the ontological values of Kepler's Laws vis-a-vis Newton's Laws, and argue that the latter is more fundamental because it is able to explain the former. I then argue that the fundamental laws of economics lie not in mathematical equations, but in models of adaptive economic agents. With this shift in mind set, it becomes possible to think about how interactions between agents can lead to the emergence of multiple stable states and critical transitions, and complex adaptive policies and regulations that might actually work in the real world. Finally, I discuss how Big Data, exploratory agent-based modeling, and predictive agent-based modeling can come together in a unified framework to make economics a true science.

AB The natural species are likely to present several interesting and complex phenomena under random perturbations, which have been confirmed by simple mathematical models. The important questions are: how the random perturbations influence the dynamics of the discrete population models with multiple steady states or multiple species interactions? and is there any different effects for single species and multiple species models with random perturbation? To address those interesting questions, we have proposed the discrete single species model with two stable equilibria and the host-parasitoid model with Holling type functional response functions to address how the random perturbation affects the dynamics. The main results indicate that the random perturbation does not change the number of blurred orbits of the single species model with two stable steady states compared with results for the classical Ricker model with same random perturbation, but it can strength the stability. However, extensive numerical investigations depict that the random perturbation does not influence the complexities of the host-parasitoid models compared with the results for the models without perturbation, while it does increase the period of periodic orbits doubly. All those confirm that the random perturbation has a reverse effect on the dynamics of the discrete single and multiple population models, which could be applied in reality including pest control and resources management.

Among the dense population of benthic and bottom-dwelling inhabitants of the reef, many significant species remain hidden or neglected by researchers. One such example is the vermetids, a unique group of marine gastropods. The present study attempts for the first time to assess the density and identify preferred reef substrates in the Gulf of Kachchh, state of Gujarat, on the western coast of India. A total of three species of the family Vermetidae were recorded during the study and their substrate preferences identified.

AB In arid areas where organisms are subjected to environmental extremes, ecological communities are simple and provide useful models for studying community organisation. We used capture, mark and release methods between November 2014 and May 2015 to assess the rodent community in the Hajar Mountains of Ras Al Khaima along an altitudinal gradient from 460 m to 1650 m. We captured three rodent species; Arabian Spiny Mouse, Acomys dimidiatus, Wagner's Gerbil, Gerbillus dasyurus and a Black Rat, Rattus rattus (the latter only represented by a single specimen on one occasion). The structure of rodent communities varied altitudinally with the relative abundance of Spiny Mice decreasing and Wagner's Gerbils increasing with altitude.

AB Periodical patterns of vegetation in an arid or semiarid ecosystem are described using statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo numerical simulation technique. Plants are characterized by the area that each individual occupies and a facilitation-competition pairwise interaction. Assuming that external resources (precipitation, solar radiation, nutrients, etc.) are available to the ecosystem, it is possible to obtain the persistent configurations of plants compatible with an equitable distribution of resources maximizing the Shannon entropy. Variation of vegetation patterns with density, critical cluster size, and facilitation distance are predicted. Morphological changes of clusters are shown to be a function of the external resources. As a final remark, it is proposed that an early warning of desertification could be detected from the coefficient of variation of the mean cluster size together with the distribution of cluster sizes.

AB Fugitive emissions pose problems both for general air quality management as well as for the operational management of the facilities. In harbours, activities such loading, unloading and transport of dusty materials are important sources of particulate fugitive emissions. Therefore, there is a growing concern about air quality in these areas as a result of the high impact of the operations on human health and environment. The objectives of this study were to estimate the impact of harbour activities on air particulate matter (APM) levels and to compile an inventory of chemical profiles of harbour particulate fugitive emissions. This preliminary work was based on experimental campaigns carried out in a Portuguese harbour when different types of bulk materials were handled. High time resolution monitors were installed close to the unloaded area and recorded APM concentrations and meteorological variables. PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 were collected during unloading operations and a complete chemical characterization of collected samples was made by the techniques k (0)-instrumental neutron activation analysis and particle induced X-ray emission. Results showed that manipulation of materials during harbour operations resulted in high emissions of particles, especially from the coarse fraction. These emissions were very affected by the granulometry and chemical composition of the handled materials and by the meteorological conditions.

AB Bathyal and abyssal benthonic foraminiferal assemblages have been thought to undergo community- and species-level regime shifts between glacials and interglacials. Comparisons between communities and oxygen isotope curves are, however, few. Comparisons between multiple aspects of the benthonic foraminiferal community and the oxygen isotope curve are made here for the abyssal Upper Quaternary of ODP Hole 994C (Blake Ridge, western Atlantic Ocean). Presumed allochthonous species were removed from the dataset to give an in situ abyssal assemblage dominated by Brizalina lowmani with subordinate Cibicides wuellerstorfi and other species. The total number N of benthonic foraminifera/20 cm(3) sediment sample, the point diversity measured using the information function H, and max(pi) (the proportional abundance of the most abundant species in each sample) all fluctuated between samples. These variables apparently mirrored the oxygen-isotope curve based on planktonic foraminifera, and so show potential for tracking marine isotope stages (MIS). However, neither abundance biozone boundaries nor species-level regime shifts (i.e., points of change in percentage carrying capacity, K-p) coincided or showed consistent associations with terminations (pronounced boundaries between isotopic maxima and minima). Cibicides wuellerstorfi was most abundant towards the base of the section, which might indicate stronger current action. Most abundance biozones (ABs) had a Type 0 community structure, but Type 1 community structure was recorded in ABs from the upper part of Glacial Cycle E (glacial MIS 10) and the lower part of Glacial Cycle D (interglacial MIS 9), for which this community structure may mark an extended period of stress. Peaks in percentage abundance of Uvigerina spp. occurred in glacial MIS 2, 6, and 8, but not in MIS 4, 10, and 12. It is, therefore, recommended that workers be cautious when using glacial-interglacial cycles to explain ecostratigraphic events in abyssal Pleistocene successions, especially in the absence of an oxygen-isotope curve.

AB Nutrient cycling in the pelagic zone of aquatic ecosystems is generally controlled by the interactions between zooplankton, phytoplankton and bacteria. However, very little is known about how microbial interactions influence the stoichiometry of trophic levels within freshwater ecosystems. In order to better understand these interactions, we examined how the microbial loop shaped the N:P stoichiometry of food web components in Lake Kinneret. We used two microbial loop sub-models incorporated into a one-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM) to simulate the effect of microbial loop processes on the N: P stoichiometry of the food web. The stoichiometry of nutrient recycling pathways illustrated that the ability of bacteria to regulate phytoplankton stoichiometry is a significant factor that has ecosystem wide implications. The results showed that the average internal N: P ratios of the combined phytoplankton community followed their C biomass patterns. However, variations in the internal N: P ratios of the five simulated phytoplankton species occurred depending on the operation of the microbial loop, suggesting that predicting the N: P ratios of the nutrient flux pathways between bacteria, zooplankton and inorganic matter are important in correctly predicting the available nutrients for individual phytoplankton groups, and their overall patterns of growth. The dynamic shifts in nutrient stoichiometry induced by changes in the microbial loop within Lake Kinneret provide an improved mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions in aquatic ecosystems.

AB In the present study, we selected a total of 26 Salix sphaeronymphe Gorz shrubs of various sizes on a cutover in the eastern Tibetan Plateau to evaluate the effects of shrub size on richness, cover and biomass of the understorey herbaceous community, grasses and forbs, as well as litter cover and biomass. Results indicated that the richness of herbaceous community, grasses and forbs significantly increased with the increased area of both undershrub canopies and open field. However, the cover and biomass of the herbaceous community beneath the shrub canopies decreased with increasing shrub size. Grasses and forbs, as different functional groups, responded differently to the increasing area of shrubs: the cover and biomass of grasses decreased while those of forbs increased. The cover and biomass of herbaceous community, grasses and forbs in the open field did not obviously vary with area. Under the shrub canopies, the cover and mass of litter positively correlated to area, but this was not the case in the open field. Our results suggest that shrubs have a positive effect on diversity and a negative effect on the cover and productivity of the herbaceous community in forest secondary succession on the alpine cutovers, and that these effects are size-dependent. Moreover, different functional groups of herbaceous plants can respond differently to the presence of shrubs.

AB Net nitrifying activity of epiphytic biofilms was examined on the submersed macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum in the Danube River floodplain Kopacki Rit. Macrophytes were collected monthly during the summer 2003. Nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured after incubation of shoots of different age in the inorganic synthetic media with ammonia salt as the sole source of nitrogen. The net nitrifying activity was significantly higher during the end of the summer, only on the mature shoots. The concentration of both nitrites and nitrates was significantly higher. Consequently, spatial differences in the net nitrifying activity emerged between the shoots of different age. It seems that physical and chemical environment were not the cause of the established differences, as the macrophytes were developed in the vicinity and within the same environmental conditions. Spatial distribution of the net nitrifying activity coincided with the establishment of filamentous epiphytes well-developed only on the mature shoots. Epiphytes probably enhanced the net nitrifying activity by providing new colonization surface. Beside the effect of the new surfaces on the nitrification, the results suggest that it is in relation to the environmental concentration of organic matter.

AB In hummingbird-pollinated plants, the variation in the nectar quantity and quality within the flowers of a single species, due to variation in nectar production by the plant and previous exploitation of other foragers, means that the nectar is a naturally risky resource. This variation in the nectar availability and quality can commonly be increased by antagonists such as nectar robbers. Here, simulating different intensities of nectar theft in the distylous shrub Bouvardia ternifolia, and manipulating nectar volume and concentration, I evaluated its effects on the foraging patterns of the White-eared Hummingbird (Hylocharis leucotis). My results showed that increasing only the variance in nectar volume per flower (but not in nectar concentration), simulating the action of nectar robbers, results in fewer Bouvareia flowers visited by hummingbirds, suggesting risk-aversion in this bird species.

AB We developed a computer model (PASTURE) to simulate both condition of pastures grazed by farmed wildlife and animal performance as dual measures of system performance. For representative habitat types (e.g., aspen forest and open grasslands), the model simulates herbage growth, maturation and senescence, habitat and diet selection, and nutrient intake of several wild ruminant species. The model generated seasonal patterns of pasture productivity and animal behavior expected for Brornus-Poa pastures in aspen boreal ecosystems. Model calibration was conducted using data collected from studies conducted within the aspen boreal ecosystems at the Ministik Research Station in 1997 and 1998, and Elk Island National Park and the University of Alberta greenhouse in 1999 and parameters adjusted until the predicted and observed results were visibly close. Evaluation of the model was conducted using statistical criteria of calculating average error, root mean square, root mean square error, coefficient of residual mass and modeling efficiency and comparing these statistics against optimal values. Statistical tests indicated a good fit between predicted and observed values for cumulative phytomass, herbage use and animal performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many approaches exist for modeling the response of animals to environmental condition and change. Regardless of the model selected, uncertainty is a major component in the modeling of complex physical-biological relationships. Structured methods exist for handling uncertainty in these modeling studies, and can facilitate decision-making among stakeholders with differing values. We describe two different approaches for modeling population response to environmental pattern. Then, we propose a simple means for incorporating uncertainty into the modeling process using structured and transparent means. First, a model formula is selected and applied with a structured uncertainty analysis during parameterization. Second, Monte Carlo simulation is applied to propagate the uncertainties in the model outputs induced by the uncertain inputs. Finally, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is applied to prioritize model forecasts (i.e., of the likely input conditions) according to perceived value, relevance, accuracy, and uncertainty. The structure discussed is simple and can be modified in many ways to meet the demands of a particular study. This paper provides (I) a brief look at alternatives for modeling animal populations and (2) how these types of models can be applied within a structured and transparent framework for handling uncertainty that saves time, money, and effort.

AB The first prograding bioclastic bodies of the Messinian carbonate platform from Melilla-Nador (Morocco) contain numerous feeding tubes of Vermetidae (Petaloconchus) shells. This accumulation results from dense littoral settlements of vermetids, sometimes preserved in place in the higher part of the system, having produced during their life several tubes in a short duration, probably under repeated stressing environmental conditions. The progradation of the system allows, under constant sea level, the continuity of the process. This original construction-cutting-accumulation phenomenon could be related to the fluctuations of the palaeoproductivity characterizing this period.

AB Habitat structure and productivity are suggested as important determinants of community structure. We manipulated food abundance and shelter availability in an ephemeral community of wintering passerine birds by augmenting seeds and by adding a large bush to experimental plots in the northern Negev, Israel. In Experiment-1, we augmented seven 1-ha subplots with seeds for 5 weeks, keeping adjacent subplots as controls. We then switched treatments between the subplots for 4 additional weeks. In Experiment-2, we had five independent 4-ha plots, divided into four 1-ha subplots allocated to four treatments: Control, Seed Augmentation, Shelter Addition, and both Seed Augmentation and Shelter Addition. Species richness and bird abundance increased with food abundance, suggesting that birds either move into sites with more food, allocate more time to foraging in them, or both. Bird abundance and species richness were not affected by the shelter addition. Food abundance affected species diversity only during Experiment-2. These results indicate that seed abundance influences the habitat use and local abundance of granivorous passerines wintering in desert environments and suggest that wintering bird populations as well as bird movements may be affected by the distribution of food resources in our study area.

AB The plankton community of hypersaline salterns located in Tamilnadu coast, India was studied. The cyanophycean filamentous algae such as Oscillatoria salina, O. formosa, Lyngbya majuscula, Xenococcus acervatus and diatoms such as Amphora spp., Navicula sp., Nitzschia longissima, Pleurosigma salinarum and Surirella ovalis were found to tolerate wide range of salinity (41-150 ppt), while Anacystis dimidiatus, Coccochloris elabens, Spirulina platensis and Dunaliella salina were present only in hypersaline conditions. Altogether 33 species of microalgae were identified belonging to 22 genera 6 belonged to cynophyceae, 5 to chlorophyceae, 21 to bacillariophyceae and 1 belonged to dinophyceae. The cyanaphycean filamentous algae were found to be major primary producers in the evaporator ponds followed by chlorophyceae and bascillariophyceae.
   Zooplanktons were simple in composition than phytoplankton. Protozoa and copepods formed major components. The holobiont group included Bodo sp and Artemia Halophilic group comprised of Nassula sp; Rhabdonella sp; Diacypris sp and harpaticoid copepod. More zooplanktons were identified under stenohaline group such as Flavella sp; Brachionus sp;medusa, polychaete and calonoid copepod and larvae of molluscs.
   Based on the relative abundance of different species in relation to salinity the plankters were grouped into three categories, namely halobiont, halophilic and stenohaline. These observations present first hand knowledge about the co-existence of various species endemic to peculiar environments offered by the solar salt works. The paper evaluates their interaction among themselves in relation to the Artemia population and with the hydrological factors especially salinity. Field data month wise with reference to species richness, correlation matrix of gross primary productivity with hydrological factors have been discussed.

AB The Dead Sea is very harsh environment even for microorganisms adapted to hypersaline environment. Not only does the Dead Sea contain the highest salt concentration of all natural lakes inhabited by living organisms, but the peculiar ionic composition of its water, with its high concentration of divalent cations magnesium and calcium, is highly inhibitory even to those microorganisms that are the most adapted to life in the sea. In this research imaging spectroscopy and microbiological studied used to investigate the spatial distribution of various Archaea populations according to the salty saturation of Mor swamp, Dead Sea Basin. Data from the DLR airborne sensor DAIS-7915 in the spectral range between 0.4 to 2.4 mum were acquired along with field and laboratory spectral measurements. The spatial and spectral data were completed by microbiological analysis. The spectral information helped to detect a concentric distribution of the Archaea population, which seems linked to the state of the salty substrate. In the wet muddy central zone lives an Archaea with the relatively lowest salt tolerance. From this centre to the peripheries, the tolerance to salt of the Archaea population was found to be increasing, as the substation changes from salty pools to salty muds and finally to massive salt layers.

A model for the conservation of the forested grassland is also proposed and analysed. It is shown that uncontrolled grazing and increasing pollution may lead to eventual extinction of the forested grassland but it can be conserved by using an appropriate effort.

AB Three feeding strategies with different rules for prey selectivity were evaluated by Monte Carlo computer simulation. The predator must obtain a minimum quantity of each of three different nutrients, and it sequentially encounters one of three kinds of prey that differ in both their nutrient compositions and their relative abundances. Within patches, prey may be randomly dispersed or aggregated with Markovian transition probabilities. Overall cost is the sum of search time plus consumption cost plus emigration (between-patch traverses) risk. The predator will emigrate if it is unsuccessful in acquiring a minimum of Gamma units of any needed nutrient within the T most recent prey encounters. The three strategies are (1) no discrimination-with potentially high consumption costs, (2) minimal consumption-with potentially very prolonged search times, and (3) a hybrid strategy that requires a physiological monitoring of net nutrient acquisition (or the bookkeeping of highly correlated gustatory cues). Each strategy has its characteristic dynamics and optima, but collectively these simulations show that no one strategy is superior and that over a large portion of the parameter space the differences in overall cost are relatively small.

AB Differences in body weight were studied in the associations of sympatric five-toed jerboas of the genera Allactaga and Pygeretmus on the territory of the former USSR and Mongolia. The distribution of weight ratios in real associations was compared with the theoretical distribution obtained using the random combination of species and subspecies. The differences between two distributions were evaluated using the Kholmogorov-Smirnov test. The differences were significant when the pairs of species (or the pairs of subspecies of different species) in different associations could be represented more than one time. When a pair could be included only once into analysis, the character of real distribution did not change much, while the difference from theoretical distribution was insignificant. The weight ratio in the pairs of sympatric five-toed jerboas was changeable. The natural associations of the species with similar body weights (weight ratio from 1 to 1.25), as well as of the species with very different body weights (weight ratio from 2.5 to 3) were frequently encountered. That can be explained by similar directions of distribution of different ancestral forms.

AB We analyzed the spatial organization of Mongolian desert rodent fauna by the use of stepwise discriminant function analysis and cluster analysis. Geographical variation in niche breadth and niche position among rodent communities from Southern, Western and Eastern Gobi was consideres in coordinated for the whole fauna. To reduce the environmental constraints in regional communities, niche breadth was estimated along comparable parts of discriminant scores and was measured by use of Shannon-Weaver index. Absolute niche overlap values were calculated for each community type as a probability of displacement along the discriminant axis. Guild structure of the fauna, demonstrated by our analysis, reflects the adaptation of species to the range of main landscape types of the desert zone. Species mainly shift their preferences along the axes of ecological space independently. This is also true regarding changes in niche breadth and niche overlap. These results challenge the viewpoint that the spatial guilds are stable coadapted assemblages. An extreme value of the coefficient of variation in niche overlap among nearest neighbors in Southern Gobi indicates the absence of dense niche packing. The most even distribution of niche overlap values revealed by the nearest neighbor analysis is a characteristic of the Western Gobi community. We did not find any features of regularity in body size distribution among Mongolian desert rodents. Species pairs from one genus with low niche overlap have the same body weight ratio as species pairs with high overlap.

TI ON THE INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE CHORD DISTANCE WITH SOME CLASSIFICATION

SO ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII
LA English
DT Article
ID SIMULATED VEGETATIONAL DATA; MODELS
AB Mathematical meaningful of some numerical methods used in studies of plant communities was analysed in this paper. Although methods combining the chord distance with some classification and ordination algorithms were frequently used in vegetational studies such combinations are improper in a mathematical sense. The chord distance is a quantitative measure of compositional dissimilarity between plant communities. This measure is derivable from the Euclidean distance after a standardization of vegetational samples to equal totals. The standardization implicitly translates samples to an unit radius hypersphere. Sphericity of thus transformed Euclidean space restricts the compatibility of the chord distance and algorithms of PCA as well as both Orloci's <<optimal clustering>> and centroid clustering. The incompatibility is attributable to a mismatch between the geometrical properties of an n-dimensional unstandardized Euclidean spare and corresponding n-dimensional hypersphere. Admissible combinations of the chord distance and these classification and ordination algorithms were presented in this paper.

AB Examination of microbial populations of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers in model tanks used for farming of air-breathing catfish (ABFFS), polyculture of herbivorous carps (PS) and control system (CS) revealed maximum abundance of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers in ABFFS and minimal in CS. In any of the two culture systems, the chemical concentration or density of bacteria developed due to feed application was many times higher than other management factors. At a given time, the bacteria of each group occurring in any management protocol of ABFFS was about 10% higher than PS. Culture of air-breathing fishes caused greater abundance of ammonia and nitrite oxidizers than the herbivorous carps. There was a strong positive correlation between each of the chemical concentration of produced nitrite (ammonia oxidizers) and density of nitrite oxidizers and ratio of total nitrogen to phosphate.

AB Aim: The emergence of large-scale patterns of animal body size is the central expectation of a wide range of (macro)ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. The drivers shaping these patterns include climate (e.g. Bergmann's rule), resource availability (e.g. 'resource rule'), biogeographic settings and niche partitioning (e.g. adaptive radiation). However, these hypotheses often make opposing predictions about the trajectories of body size evolution. Therefore, whether underlying drivers of body size evolution can be identified remains an open question. Here, we employ the most comprehensive global dataset of body size in amphibians, to address multiple hypotheses that predict patterns of body size evolution based on climatic factors, ecology and biogeographic settings to identify underlying drivers and their generality across lineages.Location: Global.Time: Period Present.Major Taxa Studied: Amphibians.Methods: Using a global dataset spanning 7270 (>87% of) species of Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona, we employed phylogenetic Bayesian modelling to test the roles of climate, resource availability, insularity, elevation, habitat use and diel activity on body size.Results Only climate and elevation drive body size patterns, and these processes are order-specific. Seasonality in precipitation and in temperature predict body size clines in anurans, whereas caecilian body size increases with aridity. However, neither of these drivers explained variation in salamander body size. In both anurans and caecilians, size increases with elevational range and with midpoint elevation in caecilians only. No effects of mean temperature, resource abundance, insularity, time of activity or habitat use were found.Main Conclusions: Precipitation and temperature seasonality are the dominant climatic drivers of body size variation in amphibians overall. Bergmann's rule is consistently rejected, and so are other alternative hypotheses. We suggest that the rationale sustaining existing macroecological rules of body size is unrealistic in amphibians and discuss our findings in the context of the emerging hypothesis that climate change can drive body size shifts.

AB Objectives: To investigate whether the Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico (Latitude: 18.1564 degrees N; temperature range 19 degrees C to 32 degrees C) rhesus macaque population has acclimated to their tropical island conditions since arriving from Lucknow, India (Latitude: 26.8470 degrees N; temperature range 8 degrees C to 41 degrees C) in 1938.
   Materials and Methods: Using the derived skeletal collection, measurements were taken of long bone lengths, diaphyseal circumference, and body weight using 635 (237 males and 398 females) skeletally mature individuals. Measurements sampled colony members born over a 51-year time span at Cayo Santiago, from 1951 to 2002.
   Results: Results demonstrated that body weights and diaphyseal circumferences significantly declined in both males and females. Long bone lengths relative to body weight and diaphyseal circumference also increased in females. Whereas body weight, long bone length and diaphyseal circumference declined at near parallel rates in males.
   Discussion: The population has acclimated to homogenous, tropical, conditions of the Caribbean island since their arrival over 80 years ago. Trends in both sexes aligned with Bergmann's rule, though females displayed a greater decline in body weight, as well as greater affinity with Allen's rule, than did males. Buffering effects related to male competition may be responsible for this discrepancy. Overall, the Cayo Santiago populations, as shown over a significant period (1951-2002) of their history, have acclimated to their island conditions by decreasing in size and altering body proportions.

AB Animals in urban areas can be exposed to human-mediated land use change and radiant heat (called urban heat island effect). Few studies have empirically evaluated the effects of urban heat on wild vertebrates. We live-trapped desert wild rodents from a large metropolitan area in the Sonoran Desert, USA, across seven field sites spanning three strata of land surface temperatures. During the summers of 2019 and 2020, we captured 116 adult pocket mice (Chaetodipus spp. and Perognathus spp.) and Merriam's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys merriami) in mountainous urban parks and open spaces. We measured body condition, proxy for health, using percent body fat (i.e., fat mass divided by body mass). For mammals, this parameter estimates the storage of energy-rich fat, which is important for growth, survival, and reproduction. We measured body condition using a noninvasive quantitative magnetic resonance instrument. Site-level surface temperatures were measured using data loggers and long-term climate data. Results supported the prediction that body condition was greatest in cooler temperature strata compared to the hottest areas. To relate body condition to resource availability, we evaluated vegetation cover and degree of urbanization. Body fat of adult pocket mice was greater in areas with more vegetation cover and where nighttime temperatures and surface temperatures were lower and urbanization was greater. Kangaroo rats had more fat in areas with the lowest strata of surface temperature. These results demonstrate that extreme heat negatively covaries with small mammal body condition, which indicates that urbanization and climate change have the potential to reduce rodent fitness.

AB Although macroalgae are regarded as the emerging fourth category of "blue carbon", few studies are available on the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release. Sargassum thunbergii is a typical intertidal macroalgae; and tidal action usually triggers instantaneous changes in temperature, light and salinity. Therefore, we inves-tigated the mechanism of short-term changes in temperature, light and salinity on DOC release by S. thunbergii. As well as these factors coupled with desiccation, the combined effect of DOC release was revealed. The results showed the DOC release rate of S. thunbergii was from 0.028 to 0.037 mg C g-1(FW) h-1 under different photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 0-1500 mu mol photons m- 2 s- 1). The DOC release rate of S. thunbergii was from 0.008 to 0.208 mg C g-1(FW) h-1 under different salinity (5-40). The DOC release rate of S. thunbergii was from 0.031 to 0.034 mg C g-1(FW) h-1 under different temperature (10-30 degrees C). Either the increase in intracellular organic matter concentration due to increased photosynthesis (change in PAR and temperature, active), cell dehydration due to dry-out process (passive) or the decrease in extracellular salt concentration (passive) would lead to an increase in the difference in osmotic pressure and promote DOC release.

AB Halophilic archaea are the dominant type of microorganisms in hypersaline environments. The diversity of halophilic archaea in Zehrez-Chergui (Saharian chott) was analyzed and compared by both analysis of a library of PCR amplified 16S rRNA genes and by cultivation approach. This work, represents the first of its type in Algeria. A total cell count was estimated at 3.8 x 10(3) CFU/g. The morphological, biochemical, and physiological characterizations of 45 distinct strains, suggests that all of them might be members of the class Halobacteria. Among stains, 23 were characterized phylogenetically and are related to 6 genera of halophilic archaea.The dominance of the genus Halopiger, has not been reported yet in other hypersaline environments. The 100 clones obtained by the molecular approach, were sequenced, and analyzed. The ribosomal library of 61 OTUs showed that the archaeal diversity included uncultured haloarcheon, Halomicrobium, Natronomonas, Halomicroarcula, Halapricum, Haloarcula, Halosimplex, Haloterrigena, Halolamina, Halorubellus, Halorussus and Halonotius. The results of rarefaction analysis indicated that the analysis of an increasing number of clones would have revealed additional diversity. Surprisingly, no halophilic archaea were not shared between the two approaches. Combining both types of methods was considered the best approach to acquire better information on the characteristics of soil halophilic archaea.

AB The stochastic stability for the irregular attraction basin in a time-delayed vegetation-water ecosystem disturbed by Levy noise is explored. We first discuss that average delay time does not change the attractors of the deterministic model but affects the corresponding attraction basins, and we present the generation of Levy noise. Then, we investigate the influence of stochastic parameters and delay time on the ecosystem by two statistical indicators, the first escape probability (FEP) and the mean first exit time (MFET). The numerical algorithm for calculating the FEP and the MFET in the irregular attraction basin is implemented, which is effectively verified by Monte Carlo simulations. Furthermore, the metastable basin is defined by the FEP and the MFET and confirms the consistency of the two indicators reflecting results. The result shows that the stochastic stability parameter, especially the noise intensity, decreases the basin stability of the vegetation biomass. In this environment, the time delay effect can validly alleviate its instability.

AB 1. Predictable aggregations of large marine mammals are valuable conservation targets, but aggregated populations can also be exposed to site-level threats.
   2. The globally vulnerable Dugong dugon has a wide distribution but is found in large numbers mainly in Australia and the Arabian Gulf. Though Australian dugong populations are well studied, much less is known of the dugongs in the Arabian Gulf.
   3. The spatial and temporal persistence of dugongs around Bahrain, with a focus on large dugong groups (>50 dugongs), was determined using an occupancy modelling framework supported by historical records, structured interviews, citizen science network reports, and small-scale boat and unmanned aerial vehicle surveys.
   4. Historical records and current distributional studies confirmed that large dugong groups have been reliably sighted around Hawar Island (Bahrain) since at least 1986, forming large, clumped groups that persist almost year round. The largest recorded so far in the world, these fluid groups (maximum of similar to 700 dugongs) account for similar to 60% of the dugongs found in Bahrain and similar to 12% of all dugongs in the Arabian Gulf.
   5. The delineated occupancy core area of large dugong groups (similar to 145 km(2)) straddles the Bahrain-Qatar border, reflecting the transboundary nature of these groups.
   6. Careful management of human-induced stressors (in particular, fishing, boating, and coastal development) combined with regular monitoring of Hawar Island's large dugong groups and their seagrass habitat is critical to safeguard this globally important population.
   7. The effectiveness of any conservation management is predicated on strengthening cooperation among all range states in the Arabian Gulf. A key recommendation of this study is to establish a regional network of marine protected areas encompassing core aggregation sites for dugongs, particularly the Hawar Islands in Bahrain, the north-western waters of Qatar, Marawah Island in the United Arab Emirates in addition to the shallow waters between Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates.

AB The Anthropocene era is characterized by a biodiversity crisis, where many species are pushing to extinction, causing alteration of the stability in the ecosystems and loss of their services. In this context, the translocation of endangered species is a powerful resource in conservation as long as its goals and appropriateness are clearly stated and it matches unambiguous criteria. Patella ferruginea is one of the most endangered marine species in the Mediterranean, and several translocations have been made with limited results in terms of survival. A methodology that mimics the natural topography of the substrate in the donor population based on Artificial Inert Mobile Substrates (AIMS, 40x20x10 cm) is proposed for restocking purposes. Three different treatments were tested: on substrate, slope, and cantilever depending on the position in which the AIMS were deployed. A total of 660 AIMS were installed within the donor area. The installation of such AIMS did not negatively affect either donor or receiving populations. A total of 188 specimens were translocated in three different attempts in 2018, 2019, and 2020, and no mortality was observed during the translocation process that lasted 24 h. Survival through the medium and long-term for the translocated specimens ranged from 80.6 to 91.5% after one month, 55.5 to 80.9% after eight months, and 48.4 to 76.6% after one year, with survival in the control population being 91.6% after four months and 87.5% after one year. Overall, recruits showed higher survival values than adults, whereas substrate treatment hosted more specimens (both recruits and adults) than slope and cantilever ones, while recruits were more abundant on cantilever treatment. The methodology has been proven to be useful for restocking and reintroduction purposes between donor and receiving areas.

AB Water availability has major effects on community structure and dynamics globally, yet our understanding of competition for water in the tropics is limited. On the tropical Trindade Island, we explored competition for water in the context of the rapid exclusion of an endemic sedge, Cyperus atlanticus (Cyperaceae), by a pantropical, N-fixing shrub, Guilandina bonduc (Fabaceae). Guilandina patches were generally surrounded by rings of bare soil, and dead Cyperus halos commonly surrounded these bare zones. With geo-referenced measurements, we showed that Guilandina patches and bare soil zones rapidly expanded and replaced adjacent Cyperus populations. We found that soil water potentials were much lower in bare soils than soils under Guilandina or Cyperus, and that leaf water potentials of Cyperus plants were lower when co-occurring with Guilandina than when alone. When Guilandina was removed experimentally, Cyperus populations expanded and largely covered the bare soil zones. Our results indicate that when Guilandina establishes, its root systems expand beyond its canopies and these roots pull water from soils beneath Cyperus and kill it, creating bare zone halos, and then Guilandina expands and repeats the process. This scenario indicates rapid competitive exclusion and displacement of an endemic by a common pantropical species, at least in part through competition for water.

AB The impacts of species invasions can subside over time as ecosystems 'adapt' and invaders decline or increase over time as additional species invade. The character and timescales of invasion impacts provide important insights into ecosystem dynamics and management. Yet long-term studies of invasion impacts remain rare and often confound invasive species impacts with coincident environmental change. One way to address this challenge is to ask: what ecological changes over time since invasion are recapitulated in ecosystems that span a range of conditions, are located in different regions, and were invaded in different decades? We synthesize many-decade time series across seven ecosystems to resolve shared changes in seven key ecosystem features following invasion by zebra mussels and subsequent invasion by quagga mussels. These two congeners are among the most widespread invasive species that re-engineer and increasingly co-invade freshwater ecosystems. Seven polymictic shallow lakes with long-term data sets reveal remarkably similar trends, with the strongest ecosystem impacts occurring within 5-10 years of zebra mussel invasion. Surprisingly, plankton communities then exhibited a partial, significant recovery. This recovery was absent, and impacts of initial invasion amplified, in four lakes where quagga mussels outcompeted zebra mussels and more completely depleted phytoplankton. Thus, we show that the ecosystem impacts of invasive species can subside over time but amplify with serial introductions of competing, even closely similar, taxa.

AB Reintroductions are increasingly used for re-establishing populations, though the documented success rates are variable. Success is typically measured by the survival and breeding success of released individuals and subsequent establishment and growth of the population. However, few studies quantify demographic rates of reintroduced populations of long-lived species, with slower dynamics and lower reproductive rates, and the demographic rates of subsequent generations, which determine population growth and persistence, are often unknown. We document the success of the reintroduction of the Common Crane Grus grus to south-west England in the UK, using survival analysis and population modelling to determine whether the overarching aim of establishing a self-sustaining population is likely to be achieved. Between 2010 and 2014, 93 Common Cranes were hatched from wild eggs, custom-reared and soft-released into suitable habitat. Survival of all age-classes was apparently higher than survival of healthy wild individuals, particularly in juvenile age-classes, and was higher in females than in males. Productivity was relatively low, but increased with age. Assuming that the demographic rates of subsequent generations are at the levels estimated for the captive-reared population, slow positive population growth is predicted over the next 30 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the persistence of this population is sensitive to even a slight decrease in values of adult survival, and growth is impacted to a lesser extent by juvenile survival and levels of productivity. This study highlights the ability to achieve persistence in a reintroduced population despite low levels of productivity when survival is exceptionally high. It also illustrates the need for long-term monitoring to establish reintroduction success in animals that have slow life histories: 9 years after initial releases, the Common Crane population remains dominated by first-generation birds and productivity is skewed by transient age-structure and the late onset of reproductive success.

AB Context. As threatening processes continue to impact rare plant populations, the use of translocations is becoming increasingly frequent. The ultimate success of translocation, attaining long-term persistence, is determined by species' ability to reproduce, recruit, and maintain levels of genetic diversity that permits the capacity to adapt to environmental change. Aims. This study aimed to assess translocation success of Banksia brownii. Methods. We compared genetic diversity, reproductive output and aspects of the mating system of a translocated population with four reference wild populations. Key results. We found that the use of multiple source populations for the translocation resulted in levels of genetic diversity comparable to reference populations of high diversity. Reproductive output was highest in the translocated population and a positive relationship between plant size and number of flowers across all populations was evident. However, mating system analysis revealed a large difference in outcrossing rates between populations in different habitats despite common pollinators, with the translocated population having the highest rates of selfing. Conclusion. Whilst genetic diversity and reproductive output were comparable or higher in the translocated population than in the reference populations, assessing translocation outcomes by these measures alone can potentially mask the longer-term erosion of genetic diversity through unfavourable patterns of mating. Implications. We recommend using multiple metrics of reproductive, recruitment and genetic diversity to properly assess plant translocation success.

AB Though considered a significant barometer of urban sustainable development, urban carrying capacity (UCC) has yet to be clearly defined and the concepts it comprises have not received adequate scholarly attention in relation to their empirical applicability. This article, by introducing the concept of human well-being and redefining it in the context of UCC, presents a novel framework for UCC assessment. The proposed framework discards the pursuit of "limits of growth," but instead focuses on whether the human well-being has been (or will be) compromised through monitoring the status of the associated UCC indicators. This framework is further applied to China's four first-tier cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, to assess their UCC in empirical terms. The results show that all of them are generally able to meet the survival-related well-being, while the prospect of meeting challenges of varying magnitude in order to realize higher-level goals. We developed this UCC assessment framework to provide a rational way for the implementation of UCC monitoring and forewarning, and in turn, to guide sustainable development of urban areas according their urban carrying status.

AB AimsIdentifying major reasons for species imperilment is a necessary step for conservation, but the degree to which we can generalize is hard for species-rich yet less-studied taxa, such as lizards. Here, we aim to bridge the gap by providing comprehensive analyses of the correlates and processes of species extinction and threats for global lizards. LocationGlobal. Time periodCurrent. Major taxa studiedLizards. MethodsWe compiled a dataset comprising extinction risk status, six intrinsic traits and seven extrinsic factors for 5256 lizard species. We carried out binomial distribution tests for 43 families and seven realms to check the non-randomness in species extinction risk and used phylogenetic linear regressions to identify the key factors that relate to the extinction proneness of lizards and species subgroups. Based on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) threat assessment, we identified major threats for global lizards and for major families and regions. ResultsWe found strong evidence of taxonomic and geographical non-randomness in the extinction risk of lizards. Geographical range size, human footprint and density, insular endemism, temperature and precipitation seasonality, and body size were key predictors of extinction risk, and the first three factors were also important across families and realms. Moreover, newly described species were more likely to have a restricted range size and a higher extinction risk. Globally, the most detrimental threat was habitat destruction, while overexploitation, species invasion and climate change varied widely in importance among species groups. Main conclusionsOverall, we highlight the detrimental influences of range restriction, climate variability and anthropogenic threats to species persistence. We suggest that lizards are potentially at high risk of extinction owing to widespread human disturbance and that species with extinction-prone traits require conservation prioritization. Moreover, lizards of different families and regions require different management strategies because of variation in extinction-risk correlates and threats.

AB The authors incorporate mechanistic information about lizard physiological responses to heat into predictions of trait variation across time and space, finding that the range of functional traits is more constrained in locations where the local climate strongly selects for thermal performance.
   A major challenge in ecology and evolution is to disentangle the mechanisms driving broad-scale variation in biological traits such as body size, colour, thermal physiology traits and behaviour. Climate has long been thought to drive trait evolution and abiotic filtering of trait variation in ectotherms because their thermal performance and fitness are closely related to environmental conditions. However, previous studies investigating climatic variables associated with trait variation have lacked a mechanistic description of the underpinning processes. Here, we use a mechanistic model to predict how climate affects thermal performance of ectotherms and thereby the direction and strength of the effect of selection on different functional traits. We show that climate drives macro-evolutionary patterns in body size, cold tolerance and preferred body temperatures among lizards, and that trait variation is more constrained in regions where selection is predicted to be stronger. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for observations on how climate drives trait variation in ectotherms through its effect on thermal performance. By connecting physical, physiological and macro-evolutionary principles, the model and results provide an integrative, mechanistic framework for predicting organismal responses to present climates and climate change.

AB The unsaturated karst represents a transitional zone connecting the land surface to the water table of the underlying saturated zone through percolating water and small perched aquifers. It constitutes a significant groundwater reservoir and hosts a high biodiversity of specialized and endemic species. Whereas investigating this ecotone can shed light on the invertebrate diversity of the whole karst system, ecological studies in the unsaturated karst have been hampered by access, mapping, and sampling challenges. We studied the unsaturated zone of 52 caves in the Lessinian Massif (NE-Italy), which is dominated by carbonate rocks interspersed with spot areas composed mainly of igneous rocks. Our aim was to understand which ecological and historical factors may have shaped the distribution of the groundwater crustacean copepods at a regional spatial scale in the Lessinian unsaturated karst. We collected 33 species belonging to the orders Harpacticoida and Cyclopoida. Species richness estimators and related species accumulation curves suggest an exhaustive sampling effort. A hydrologic analysis performed in a Geographic Information System environment divided the study area in three distinct drainage basins: Eastern Lessini, Lessinian Core, and Western Lessini. Regression analyses indicated that richness of non-stygobitic copepods (i.e., surface-water species which exploit groundwater for different purposes) was mainly driven by inter-basin differences. Richness of stygobitic copepods (i.e., obligate groundwater dwellers) was instead strongly related to lithological features and responded negatively to surface thermal variability. Next, we used a kernel density estimation to spatially explore diversity patterns in the area. The highest density of stygobitic harpacticoids was identified in the Eastern Lessinian basin, which is lithologically more heterogeneous and surrounded by practically non-aquiferous igneous rocks that may limit dispersal. Conversely, the Western Lessinian basin hosted a high density of stygobitic cyclopoid species. This spatial pattern suggests different colonization pathways for the two taxa, with a strong effect of igneous rocks in hampering dispersal of most harpacticoids. Lithological barriers seemingly did not affect non-stygobitic copepods, which were found across the whole area. Altogether, these results emphasize the key role played by the interaction of hydrological features, climate, and lithology in determining different copepod biodiversity patterns in the unsaturated karst.

AB Spatially extended patterns and multistability of possible different states are common in many ecosystems, and their combination has an important impact on their dynamical behaviors. One potential combination involves tristability between a patterned state and two different uniform states. Using a simplified version of the Gilad-Meron model for dryland ecosystems, we study the organization, in bifurcation terms, of the localized structures arising in tristable regimes. These states are generally related to the concept of wave front locking and appear in the form of spots and gaps of vegetation. We find that the coexistence of localized spots and gaps, within tristable configurations, yields the appearance of hybrid states. We also study the emergence of spatiotemporal localized states consisting of a portion of a periodic pattern embedded in a uniform Hopf-like oscillatory background in a subcritical Turing-Hopf dynamical regime.

AB Simple Summary Many invertebrates interact and are associated with plants in nature. However, despite their abundance and ecological importance, our knowledge of spiders and their associations with plants is limited. Here, we review what we currently know about spider-plant interactions and associations, with a focus on web-building spiders. This includes an overview of the most prominent interactions non-web-building and web-building spiders have with plants, followed by examples of the specific web-building spider-plant associations we know of, where especially the Acacia-Eustala association observed in Panama is interesting. We also review the plausible mechanisms for host plant location and finally present some ideas for future research. Spiders are ubiquitous generalist predators playing an important role in regulating insect populations in many ecosystems. Traditionally they have not been thought to have strong influences on, or interactions with plants. However, this is slowly changing as several species of cursorial spiders have been reported engaging in either herbivory or inhabiting only one, or a handful of related plant species. In this review paper, we focus on web-building spiders on which very little information is available. We only find well-documented evidence from studies of host plant specificity in orb spiders in the genus Eustala, which are associated with specific species of swollen thorn acacias. We review what little is known of this group in the context of spider-plant interactions generally, and focus on how these interactions are established and maintained while providing suggestions on how spiders may locate and identify specific species of plants. Finally, we suggest ideas for future fruitful research aimed at understanding how web-building spiders find and utilise specific plant hosts.

AB Missing observations in trait datasets pose an obstacle for analyses in myriad biological disciplines. Considering the mixed results of imputation, the wide variety of available methods, and the varied structure of real trait datasets, a framework for selecting a suitable imputation method is advantageous. We invoked a real data-driven simulation strategy to select an imputation method for a given mixed-type (categorical, count, continuous) target dataset. Candidate methods included mean/mode imputation, k-nearest neighbour, random forests, and multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE). Using a trait dataset of squamates (lizards and amphisbaenians; order: Squamata) as a target dataset, a complete-case dataset consisting of species with nearly complete information was formed for the imputation method selection. Missing data were induced by removing values from this dataset under different missingness mechanisms: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). For each method, combinations with and without phylogenetic information from single gene (nuclear and mitochondrial) or multigene trees were used to impute the missing values for five numerical and two categorical traits. The performances of the methods were evaluated under each missing mechanism by determining the mean squared error and proportion falsely classified rates for numerical and categorical traits, respectively. A random forest method supplemented with a nuclear-derived phylogeny resulted in the lowest error rates for the majority of traits, and this method was used to impute missing values in the original dataset. Data with imputed values better reflected the characteristics and distributions of the original data compared to complete-case data. However, caution should be taken when imputing trait data as phylogeny did not always improve performance for every trait and in every scenario. Ultimately, these results support the use of a real data-driven simulation strategy for selecting a suitable imputation method for a given mixed-type trait dataset.
   Author summaryThe issue of missing data is problematic in trait datasets as the missingness pattern may not be entirely random. Whether data are missing may depend on other known observations in the dataset, or on the value of the missing data points themselves. When only complete cases are used in an analysis, derived results may be biased. Imputation is an alternative to complete-case analysis and entails filling in the missing values using information provided by other trait values present in the dataset. Including phylogenetic information in the imputation process can improve the accuracy of imputed values, though results are dependent on the amount and pattern of missingness. Most previous evaluations of imputation methods for trait datasets are limited to numerical simulated data, with categorical traits not considered. Given a particular dataset, we propose the use of a real data-driven simulation strategy to select an imputation method. We evaluated the accuracies of four different imputation methods, with and without phylogeny information, and under different simulated missingness patterns using an example reptile trait dataset. Results indicated that data imputed using the best-performing method better reflected the original dataset characteristics compared to complete-case data. As imputation performance varies depending on the properties of a given dataset, a real data-driven simulation strategy can be used to provide guidance on best imputation practices.

AB As a traditional Chinese medicine, rhubarb is used to treat several diseases such as severe acute pancreatitis, sepsis and chronic renal failure. However, few studies focused on the authentication of germplasm for the Rheum palmatum complex, and no studies have been conducted to elucidate the evolutionary history of the R. palmatum complex using plastome datasets. Hence, we aim to develop the potential molecular markers to identify the elite germplasms of rhubarb and explore the divergence and biogeographic history of the R. palmatum complex based on the newly sequenced chloroplast genome datasets. Chloroplast genomes of thirty-five the R. palmatum complex germplasms were sequenced, and the length ranged from 160,858 to 161,204 bp. The structure, gene content and gene order were highly conserved across all genomes. Eight InDels and sixty-one SNPs loci could be used to authenticate the high-quality germplasms of rhubarb in specific areas. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all rhubarb germplasms were clustered in the same clade with high bootstrap support values and Bayesian posterior probabilities. According to the molecular dating result, the intraspecific divergence of the complex occurred in the Quaternary, which might be affected by climatic fluctuation. The biogeography reconstruction indicated that the ancestor of the R. palmatum complex might originate from the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains or/and Bashan-Qinling Mountains, and then spread to surrounding areas. Several useful molecular markers were developed to identify rhubarb germplasms, and our study will provide further understanding on speciation, divergence and biogeography of the R. palmatum complex.

AB IntroductionPlants confined to island-like habitats are hypothesised to possess a suite of functional traits that promote on-spot persistence and recruitment, but this may come at the cost of broad-based colonising potential. Ecological functions that define this island syndrome are expected to generate a characteristic genetic signature. Here we examine genetic structuring in the orchid Phalaenopsis pulcherrima, a specialist lithophyte of tropical Asian inselbergs, both at the scale of individual outcrops and across much of its range in Indochina and on Hainan Island, to infer patterns of gene flow in the context of an exploration of island syndrome traits. MethodsWe sampled 323 individuals occurring in 20 populations on 15 widely scattered inselbergs, and quantified genetic diversity, isolation-by-distance and genetic structuring using 14 microsatellite markers. To incorporate a temporal dimension, we inferred historical demography and estimated direction of gene flow using Bayesian approaches. ResultsWe uncovered high genotypic diversity, high heterozygosity and low rates of inbreeding, as well as strong evidence for the occurrence of two genetic clusters, one comprising the populations of Hainan Island and the other those of mainland Indochina. Connectivity was greater within, rather than between the two clusters, with the former unequivocally supported as ancestral. DiscussionDespite a strong capacity for on-spot persistence conferred by clonality, incomplete self-sterility and an ability to utilize multiple magnet species for pollination, our data reveal that P. pulcherrima also possesses traits that promote landscape-scale gene flow, including deceptive pollination and wind-borne seed dispersal, generating an ecological profile that neither fully conforms to, nor fully contradicts, a putative island syndrome. A terrestrial matrix is shown to be significantly more permeable than open water, with the direction of historic gene flow indicating that island populations can serve as refugia for postglacial colonisation of continental landmasses by effective dispersers.

AB Subterranean environments on Earth serve as an analog for the study of microbes on other planets, which has become an active area of research. Although it might sound contradictory that photosynthetic cyanobacteria thrive in extreme low light environments, they are frequent inhabitants of caves on Earth. Throughout the phylum these cyanobacteria have developed unique adaptations that cannot only be used for biotechnological processes but also have implications for astrobiology. They can, for example, both accommodate for the low light conditions by producing specific pigments that allow photosynthesis in near-infrared (IR) radiation/far-red light, and they can synthesize bioplastic compounds and calcium carbonate sheaths which represent valuable resources during human colonization of other planets or rock bodies. This article will highlight the potential benefits of cave-inhabiting cyanobacteria and will present a suitable bioreactor technique for the utilization of these special microbes during future space missions.

AB Nurse plant effects occur when benefactor perennials facilitate beneficiary plants below their canopies. Two poorly understood aspects of nurse plant ecology include whether facilitation strengthens as nurse plants mature and whether reestablishing perennials through ecological restoration at disturbed sites can trigger facilitation akin to in natural plant communities. We examined these uncertainties in a 12-year study by assessing plant communities below native perennials outplanted at disturbed sites and as compared with open interspaces and perennials in undisturbed sites in Joshua Tree National Park, Mojave Desert, USA. An overarching conclusion was that facilitation by outplants was intermittent. Results did not consistently support a hypothesis that facilitation strengthened as outplants matured, as the nuanced results hinged on beneficiary response metrics (cover or species richness), group of potential beneficiary species (e.g., native, non-native), and measurement year. There was, however, a general trend for beneficiary plant groups below outplants to shift through time. Non-native plant cover initially benefited when outplants were 1-9 years old, but this switched to native plants benefiting as outplants matured (9-12 years old). Facilitation was not strongest in dry years nor was nurse canopy cover usually strongly correlated with beneficiary metrics. An encouraging result for ecological restoration was that reestablishing native perennials appeared to disproportionately facilitate other native over non-native plants as restoration sites matured.

AB The current study intends to evaluate the many hazards affecting the spread of the significant fodder grass Lygeum spartum Loefl. ex. L. and its associated species in Egypt's Western Mediterranean Desert over the past 60 years (from 1958 to 2020); depending on the data of the previous literature and the current situation evaluation by recent field trips. It also aims to assess its ecosystem services. Sixty-nine stands were collected from previous studies and unpublished data, in addition to 30 stands (10 m2) were added including 5 field trips during the period from spring 2019 to spring 2020. Measurements were taken to create a classification of this vegetation and to determine the main threats that affect its distribution composition. There are 142 species associated with the distribution of the studied plant in 6 habitats. While only 107 species were recorded in the recent stands in 7 habitats. Vegetation groups (G1-G8) obtained from TWINSPAN classification indicating that G1 (wadis) is the most diverse group with a species richness 34.7 species per stand, while G6 (dune) has the highest species turnover (4.57) during the period of 1958 to 2014. But in recent stands; G5 (saline and non-saline depression) is the most diverse group (30.875), while G2 (dunes) has the highest species turnover (4.819). Medicinal plants are the most represented (79.86%), followed by grazing plants (72.9%). The most common service is sand stabili-zation (92% of total services), followed by windbreak (natural) (40%). Threatened species represent 92.4%; habitat loss is the most affected threat (95 species), followed by over-collecting and over-cutting (82 species). Twenty out of 99 stands (20.2% of the total stands) have been destroyed due to human activity. Continuous monitoring of remaining patches of Egypt's northwestern Mediterranean coast was required to save its natural flora from extinction.

AB Aim: Understanding cetacean species' distributions and population structure over space and time is necessary for effective conservation and management. Geographic differences in acoustic signals may provide a line of evidence for population-level discrimination in some cetacean species. We use acoustic recordings collected over broad spatial and temporal scales to investigate whether global variability in echolocation click peak frequency could elucidate population structure in Blainville's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris), a cryptic species well-studied acoustically.Location: North Pacific, Western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.Time period: 2004-2021.Major taxa studied: Blainville's beaked whale.Methods: Passive acoustic data were collected at 76 sites and 150 cumulative years of data were analysed to extract beaked whale echolocation clicks. Using an automated detector and subsequent weighted network clustering on spectral content and interclick interval of clicks, we determined the properties of a primary cluster of clicks with similar characteristics per site. These were compared within regions and across ocean basins and evaluated for suitability as population-level indicators.Results: Spectral averages obtained from primary clusters of echolocation clicks identified at each site were similar in overall shape but varied in peak frequency by up to 8 kHz. We identified a latitudinal cline, with higher peak frequencies occurring in lower latitudes.Main conclusions: It may be possible to acoustically delineate populations of Blainville's beaked whales. The documented negative correlation between signal peak frequency and latitude could relate to body size. Body size has been shown to influence signal frequency, with lower frequencies produced by larger animals, which are subsequently more common in higher latitudes for some species, although data are lacking to adequately investigate this for beaked whales. Prey size and depth may shape frequency content of echolocation signals, and larger prey items may occur in higher latitudes, resulting in lower signal frequencies of their predators.

AB Simple Summary: Wolves are known for their cooperative hunting behaviour, which has been thoroughly studied. On the contrary, little is known about lone wolves' hunting strategies. Between 2017 and 2019, we monitored a lone male wolf living in a Mediterranean coastal area. The wolf settled in a protected estate where both wild and domestic ungulates were available as potential prey. His predatory behaviour was recorded through a combination of camera trapping and active search for kill sites and prey carcasses. Features of kill sites were modelled to test for selection by the wolf. The main prey resulted to be fallow deer. The wolf avoided dense habitats to hunt and usually attacked his prey in open areas where the presence of fences could support him in constraining and successfully killing deer. The prey body condition, estimated as the percentage of fat content in the bone marrow of hind legs, was above the average of the population, suggesting a high efficacy for the lone wolf hunting strategy but also the adoption of a high-risk feeding strategy by deer.
   The aim of the study was to assess which kill site characteristics were selected by a lone wolf living in a protected Mediterranean coastal area near the city of Pisa, Italy, where both wild and domestic ungulates were available as potential prey. Between 2017 and 2019, we monitored the wolf's predatory behaviour through a combination of camera trapping and active search for kill sites and prey carcasses. The main prey found was the fallow deer (n = 82); only two wild boars and no domestic ungulates were found preyed upon. The features and habitat of kill sites were modelled to test for selection by the wolf. The habitat type of kill site was composed of meadows and pastures (89.3%), woods (7.3%), degraded coastal areas (1.9%), roads and rivers (1.1%), and marshes (0.5%). We calculated their distance from landscape features and ran a binomial generalised linear model to test the influence of such landscape variables. The distance of kill sites from landscape elements was significantly different from random control sites, and a positive selection for fences was found. In fact, the wolf pushed fallow deer towards a fence to constrain them and prevent them from escaping. We also analysed the body condition of predated fallow deer as a percentage of fat content in the bone marrow of the hind legs. Our results revealed the selection of the lone wolf for deer in good body condition. This is a possible outcome of the habitat selection shown by fallow deer in the study area, where fenced open pastures are the richest in trophic resources; therefore, our findings suggest a high efficacy for the lone wolf hunting strategy, but also the adoption of a high risk feeding strategy by deer. This study suggests that a lone predator can take advantage of human infrastructures to maximise its predatory effectiveness.

AB Eastern redcedar Juniperus virginiana is encroaching into new habitats, which will affect native ecosystems as this species competes with other plants for available resources, including water. We designed a greenhouse experiment to investigate changes in soil moisture content and rooting depths of two-year-old J. virginiana saplings growing with or without competition. We had four competition treatments: 1) none, 2) with a native tree (Quercus stellata), 3) with an invasive grass (Bromus inermis), and 4) with both Q. stellata and B. inermis. We measured soil moisture content over two years as well as root length, total biomass, relative water content, midday water potential, and mortality at the end of the experiment. When J. virginiana and B. inermis grew together, water depletion occurred at both 30-40 cm and 10-20 cm. Combined with root length results, we can infer that J. virginiana most likely took up water from the deeper layers whereas B. inermis used water from the top layers. We found a similar pattern of water depletion and uptake when J. virginiana grew with Q. stellata, indicating that J. virginiana took up water from the deeper layers and Q. stellata used water mostly from the top soil layers. When the three species grew together, we found root overlap between J. virginiana and Q. stellata. Despite the root overlap, our relative water content and water potential indicate that J. virginiana was not water stressed in any of the plant combinations. Regardless, J. virginiana saplings had less total biomass in treatments with B. inermis and we recorded a significantly higher mortality when J. virginiana grew with both competitors. Root overlap and partitioning can affect how J. virginiana perform and adapt to new competitors and can allow their co-existence with grasses and other woody species, which can facilitate J. virginiana encroachment into grasslands and woodlands. Our data also show that competition with both Q. stellata and B. inermis could limit establishment, regardless of water availability.

AB Animals capable of moving in different environments might face conflicting selection on morphology, thus posing trade-offs on the relationships between morphology and locomotor performance in each of these environments. Moreover, given the distinct ecological roles of the sexes, these relationships can be sexually dimorphic. In this article, I studied the relationships between morphological traits and locomotor performance in male and female semiaquatic Pleurodeles waltl newts in their aquatic and their terrestrial stages. Morphology was sexually dimorphic: males have proportionally longer limbs and tails, as well as a better body condition (only in the aquatic phase), whereas females were larger and had greater body mass in both phases. Nonetheless, these morphological differences did not translate into sexual divergence in locomotor performance in either stage. This finding suggests other functions for the morphological traits measured, among which only SVL showed a positive relationship with locomotor performance in both stages, whereas the effect of SMI was negative only in the terrestrial stage, and that of tail length was positive only in the aquatic stage. In any case, the morphological correlates of terrestrial and aquatic locomotion did not conflict, which suggests no trade-off between both locomotory modes in the newts studied.

AB The cost of reproduction is the core driver of life history evolution in animals. This paper demonstrates that the cumulative distance moved and the duration of movement of sexually immature abalones, Haliotis discus hannai, kept in various male and female groups, were significantly higher than those of sexually mature individuals, except when kept in mixed cultures of mature males and females. After mixed-culture, sexually mature males moved significantly further and for a longer duration than mature female abalones, and even more so than mature male abalones of any other group. Examination of the LC-MS metabolomics of mature males cultured with sexually mature females (AM) and those cultured with sexually immature females (JM) showed that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) acted as a differential metabolic biomarker. After 24-h uninterrupted sampling, the concentration of 5-HT and the expression levels of the 5-HT2 and 5-HT6 receptors in AM were significantly higher than those in JM. After further injection of 5-HT2 and 5-HT6 receptor antagonists, the concentrations of cAMP and PKA rose again, but the cumulative movement duration and distance of male abalones decreased significantly, showing that 5-HT was involved in the regulation of movement behavior of male abalones through the 5-HT2 and 5-HT6 receptor-activated cAMP-PKA pathways. The results demonstrated a significant increase in the movement endurance of mature male abalones cultured with mature females, providing a theoretical basis for understanding the adaptive life history strategies of abalones and suggesting ways to protect diverse benthic resources for abalones during the reproductive stage.

AB In this article, a novel coupled socio-environmental model is proposed and analysed using real data. The model is formulated with two interconnected subsystems: a human-environment model that describes the state of forest cover, human population, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration; and a socio-economic model that represents human behaviour as a dynamical variable. Human behaviour focuses on their opinion about forest conservation, which affects the harvesting rate per unit area. We examine the mathematical model analytically and numerically to gain insight into the dynamics of the coupled system. By plotting the basin of attractions, we show that when an initial abundance of forest cover is small, and there is a low fraction of conservationists, the system eventually stays at a higher density of forest cover and a higher fraction of conservationists. However, for intermediate to high values of initial forest cover, the system stays at a low forest cover and a low fraction of conservationists among people. With an increase in the economic cost, after a certain threshold, we observe that the number of cooperators increases despite the forest cover being very low. Further, the model is validated using yearly data on forest cover and atmospheric CO2 in the period 1990-2016. The fitting to the data is performed using a MATLAB optimization technique, and the quality of the fitting is quantified using accuracy metrics. Numerical simulations using estimated parameters show that increasing forest cover is essential in reducing the CO2 level in the atmosphere. From a policy-making point of view, it is important to increase the proportion of conservationists in the community, which will eventually result in increased forest cover and consequently decrease the burden of atmospheric CO2 concentration.

AB Pest resurgence is defined by a predictable increase in pests following declines resulting from the implementation of pest management practices. This phenomenon is notorious; familiar in biblical references to cyclical plagues of locust and discussions of pesticide treadmills, where pests resurge following the evolution of pesticide resistance. Targeted "silver-bullet" approaches, whether chemical, mechanical, biological, or genetic in nature, apply a reductionist lens toward the removal of a specific target pest, often ignoring ecological context, by application of said silver-bullet. In this review article, we cover how past and recent developments in theoretical ecology and complex systems dynamics provide a general and intuitive understanding of the classic problem of pest resurgence from a holistic perspective. We provide an illustrative example of a simple predator-prey model to demonstrate how complex interactions between predator control agents and their target pest prey can create alternative stable states, reproducing pest resurgence dynamics by locking systems in the outbreak stable state.

AB Critical transition can occur in many real-world systems. The ability to forecast the occurrence of transition is of major interest in a range of contexts. Various early warning signals (EWSs) have been developed to anticipate the coming critical transition or distinguish types of transition. However, no effective method allows to establish practical threshold indicating the condition when the critical transition is most likely to occur. Here, we intro-duce a powerful EWS, named dynamical eigenvalue (DEV), that is rooted in bifurcation theory of dynamical systems to estimate the dominant eigenvalue of the system. Theoretically, the absolute value of DEV approaches 1 when the system approaches bifurcation, while its position in the complex plane indicates the type of transi-tion. We demonstrate the efficacy of the DEV approach in model systems with known bifurcation types and also test the DEV approach on various critical transitions in real-world systems.

AB More than two million species have been described so far, but our knowledge on most taxa remains scarce or inexistent, and the available biodiversity data is often taxonomically, phylogenetically and spatially biased. Unevenness in research effort across species or regions can interact with data biases and compromise our ability to properly study and conserve biodiversity. Herein, we assess the influence of biological, conservation, geographic and socioeconomic correlates of reptile research effort globally and across six biogeographic realms. We combine bibliometric data from the Scopus database with trait-based approaches and provide research effort information for 10 531 reptile species, modelling it as a function of 10 putative correlates of species-level variation in research effort through negative binomial generalised mixed effect models. We show that reptile research effort is highly skewed toward certain taxa and regions, such as turtles, crocodiles, tuatara, viperids, pythons and some anguimorph lizards, as well as for temperate compared to tropical regions. Our findings indicate that greater research attention is directed towards large-sized and early described reptile species, particularly those whose geographic range overlap with biodiversity institutions. Although we demonstrate that biological and socioeconomic factors more strongly affect reptile research effort variation, geography and conservation-related factors also matter. Global patterns are mostly consistent, but variation across realms were observed and likely reflects differences in socioeconomic attributes as well as in the amount of species to be studied in each realm. Directing researchers and citizen scientists' attention toward understudied taxa will contribute to alleviate this biased biodiversity knowledge, although the sheer amount of species in tropical regions inevitably makes it a long-term solution. Performing comparative studies across species with similar levels of research attention could represent a more immediate and feasible alternative.

AB In the northern Adriatic Sea, rocky outcrops called "trezze" or "tegnue" are known as biodiversity hotspots. A total of 45 rocky outcrops were studied by using non-destructive photographic sampling during SCUBA diving. Ten invertebrate phyla with 196 taxa were recorded, 86% of which were determined at species level. Among them, 65% of the taxa were sessile, primarily represented by the phyla Porifera and Chordata. The aims of the study were: to characterize the species richness and composition of epifaunal invertebrates living on rocky outcrops; to test the efficiency of using the outcrop area as a predictor of epifauna richness, using the Arrhenius Species-Area Relationship (SAR) model; and to compare the expected richness resulting from the SAR model with the richness observed from the analysis of random photo-squares. Our results show that the SAR model describes the relationship between epibenthic species richness and outcrop size well and may have important practical applications for biodiversity estimations and nature conservation implications. It provides a useful tool, also in terms of economy and speed, to estimate the species richness of the benthic epifauna of the numerous outcrops that remain unsurveyed, based on their size.

AB Spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation are a ubiquitous feature of semi-arid ecosystems. On sloped terrain, vegetation patterns occur as stripes perpendicular to the contours. Field studies report contrasting long-term dynamics between different observation sites; some observe slow uphill migration of vegetation bands while some report stationary patterns. In this paper, we show that long-range seed dispersal provides a mechanism that enables the occurrence of both migrating and stationary patterns. We utilise a nonlocal PDE model in which seed dispersal is accounted for by a convolution term. The model represents vegetation patterns as periodic travelling waves and numerical continuation shows that both migrating and almost stationary patterns are stable if seed dispersal distances are sufficiently large. We use a perturbation theory approach to obtain analytical confirmation of the existence of almost stationary patterned solutions and provide a biological interpretation of the phenomenon.

AB In the last four decades, dugong (Dugong dugon) aggregations have been rarely reported from the geographically isolated, vast seascape of the Andaman Islands, India. The Indian Ocean tsu-nami of 2004, hunting, coastal development, and habitat loss are the major causes of this change in the social system of dugongs in the Andaman Islands. Our long-term monitoring study (2017 to 2022) reveals a changing trend in aggregating behaviour of dugongs. In an inclusive, collab-orative effort, we engaged multiple stakeholders using two approaches: (1) creating a spatially spread citizen science network targeting sea-faring agencies-the fishers, forest department, SCUBA divers, and defence bodies (Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard); and (2) conducting standard-ized questionnaire surveys (UNEP/CMS) with fishers. Our approach yielded reports of 63 herd sightings of dugongs from the Andaman archipel-ago. The fishers reported 73.01% of the sightings, followed by the defence bodies (20.63%), forest department (3.18%), and SCUBA divers (3.18%). Smaller herds in our study comprised three to six individuals, with a social structure of "adults only" and "adult-calf." The larger herds of seven to 13 individuals included an "adult-calf" combi-nation with a greater number of adults accompa-nying two to three calves. More than 95% of these herd occurrences were reported from sheltered, coastal waters with resource concentrations (large seagrass meadows). Further, we present novel dugong occurrence reports from data-deficient regions like the Jarawa Tribal Reserve and the North Sentinel Island, along with dugong occur-rences from Little Andaman, where the population was speculated to be locally extinct after the 2004 tsunami. These findings strongly advocate the involvement of multiple stakeholders as a cost-effective approach to monitoring the distribution and population of dugongs in larger seascapes like the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Moreover, such an approach would be critical for sensitizing the local stakeholders regarding the conservation and management of large marine mammals such as dugongs.

AB The coral reef ecosystem plays an important role as a provider of ecosystem services and has various economic benefits to the coastal community. However, the coral reefs ecosystem continues to degrade by 19% globally. This degradation caused some coastal and archipelagic countries have developed methods of calculating coral reef health index, including Indonesia. However, some literature shows that there is no common standard method for coral reef health index as the analysis depends on the data availability and the purpose of the study. Remote sensing technology that currently provides much open-source data is a potential method /tool to calculate the health index of coral reefs if the required parameters are met. This article review aims to identify remote sensing data used in the existing coral health indexes and then analyze the integration of all spatial data for coral reef health index calculation. Reference searches are sourced from the SCOPUS database combined with search engines Harzing and Mendeley. There are five coral reef health index calculation models from 25 references consisting of 19 publications and six reports out of 209 filtered references using keywords of Coral Reef Health Index. As a result, coral reef cover and algae are commonly used data obtained from remote sensing imagery. However, remote sensing technology cannot estimate other important parameters such as fish biomass. In addition, physical information of the waters, such as sea surface temperature (SST) and water clarity indicators (turbidity and diffused attenuation coefficient), are parameters contained in the five indexes that can be obtained from remote sensing data. In general, the literature review shows that coral reef health indicators (e.g. index or individual benthic cover) are significantly related to the various parameters affecting coral reef degradation such as algae cover, rubble cover, SST and river plump either as an individual or multivariate factors.

AB Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) live in coastal waters that have experienced con-siderable anthropogenic disturbances. Specifically, along the coasts of highly urbanized regions, avail-able habitats have decreased in both space and scale. This study used Maxent software to simulate the distribution of suitable habitats for S. chinen-sis during the dry and wet seasons in Xiamen Bay. We also aimed to identify key environmental fac-tors influencing habitat distribution, with the goal of using our results to analyze conservation gaps and propose adjustments. We found that during the dry season, S. chinensis were mainly distributed in the Western Harbor, Jiulong River Estuary, and the mouth of Tongan Bay. During the wet season, they were distributed in the south of Western Harbor, Jiulong River Estuary, and around the Wuyu and Dadeng-Xiaodeng Islands. Nekton density, chlo-rophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature, slope, and salinity are the primary factors affecting S. chinensis distribution in Xiamen Bay. To better protect the species, the existing Tongan Bay reserve should be expanded during dry seasons, and suit-able habitats in the Jiulong River Estuary should be turned into a seasonal protected region. Similarly, during wet seasons, the original Western Harbor portion of the reserve should increase to include the Jiulong River Estuary, northwest of the Wuyu Islands and south of the Dadeng-Xiaodeng Islands. In addition to this dynamic seasonal management of reserve size, we also recommend developing multiple-use protected areas and establishing a joint protection mechanism between local governments. In conclusion, our model offers important guidance on improving conservation measures of S. chinensis in Xiamen Bay.

AB Animals show a vast array of phenotypic traits in time and space. Such variation patterns have traditionally been described as ecogeographical rules; for example, the tendency of size and clutch size to increase with latitude (Bergmann's and Lack's rules, respectively). Despite considerable research into these variation patterns and their consequences for biodiversity and conservation, the processes behind trait variation remain controversial. Here, we show how food variability, largely set by climate and weather, can drive interspecific trait variation by determining individual energy input and allocation trade-offs. Using a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model, we simulated different food environments, as well as interspecific variability in the parameters for energy assimilation, mobilization and allocation to soma. We found that interspecific variability is greater when the resource is non-limiting in both constant and seasonal environments. Our findings further show that individuals can reach larger biomass and greater reproductive output in a seasonal environment than in a constant environment of equal average resource due to the peaks of food surplus. Our results agree with the classical patterns of interspecific trait variation and provide a mechanistic understanding that supports recent hypotheses which explain them: the resource and the eNPP (net primary production during the growing season) rules. Due to the current alterations to ecosystems and communities, disentangling the mechanisms of trait variation is increasingly important to understand and predict biodiversity dynamics under climate change, as well as to improve conservation strategies.
   Animal diversity is reflected not only in species numbers but can also include variability in size and fecundity, which the organism's environment can shape. Using a description of individual metabolism, we show how seasonal food availability can explain diversity in body size and reproduction.

AB Self-organized spatial patterns of vegetation are frequent in drylands and, because pattern shape correlates with water availability, they have been suggested as important indicators of ecosystem health. However, the mechanisms underlying pattern emergence remain unclear. Some theories hypothesize that patterns could result from a water-mediated scale-dependent feedback (SDF) whereby interactions favoring plant growth dominate at short distances and growth???inhibitory interactions dominate in the long range. However, we know little about how the presence of a focal plant affects the fitness of its neighbors as a function of the inter-individual distance, which is expected to be highly ecosystem-dependent. This lack of empirical knowledge and system dependency challenge the relevance of SDF as a unifying theory for vegetation pattern formation. Assuming that plant interactions are always inhibitory and only their intensity is scale-dependent, alternative theories also recover the typical vegetation patterns observed in nature. Importantly, although these alternative hypotheses lead to visually indistinguishable patterns, they predict contrasting desertification dynamics, which questions the potential use of vegetation patterns as ecosystem-state indicators. To help resolve this issue, we first review existing theories for vegetation self-organization and their conflicting predictions about desertification dynamics. Second, we discuss potential empirical tests via manipulative experiments to identify pattern-forming mechanisms and link them to specific desertification dynamics. A comprehensive view of models, the mechanisms they intend to capture, and experiments to test them in the field will help to better understand both how patterns emerge and improve predictions on the fate of the ecosystems where they form.

AB Rangelands are a key resource present all over the world and cover half of all emerged lands. They are even more important in drylands, where they cover 48% of the total area. Their intensification and the additional pressure added by climate change push these socio-ecological systems towards desertification. Over the last two decades, we have developed and applied System Dynamics (SD) models for the study of Mediterranean grasslands. In addition, we have designed procedures and analysis tools, such as global sensitivity analysis, stability analysis condition, or risk analysis, to detect the main drivers of these socio-ecological systems and provide indicators about their long-term sustainability. This paper reviews these works, their scientific background, and the most relevant conclusions, including purely technical and rangeland-related ones, as well as our experience as systemic modelers in a world driven by field specialists.

AB Geographical variation in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) can result from the combined effects of environmental and sexual selection. To understand the determinants of SSD across geographical landscapes, we tested for relationships between SSD and climatic variables in the widespread lizard Anolis carolinensis. To distinguish alternative hypotheses for observed patterns of variation in SSD, we also examined sex-specific patterns of body size evolution and asked whether SSD was associated with certain patterns of sexual shape dimorphism. We found strong evidence for Rensch's rule (an increase in male-biased SSD with average body size) in A. carolinensis and evidence for the reversed version of Bergmann's rule (an increase in body size towards warmer environments) in males. Across populations, SSD was positively related to temperature; however, female body size was not related to any climatic variable, suggesting that the latitudinal gradient of SSD might be driven by a gradient in the intensity of sexual selection acting on males. Sexual size dimorphism was positively correlated with sexual dimorphism in head shape and negatively correlated with limb length dimorphism, suggesting that sexual selection in males might drive the evolution of SSD and that differences in size and limb shape between sexes might represent alternative strategies to avoid competition for the same resources.

AB Reintroductions are powerful tools for tackling biodiversity loss, but the resulting populations can be intrinsically small and vulnerable. It is therefore critical to maximise the number of individuals that are available to contribute to recovery efforts. To address this, we investigated how demographic parameters from a reintroduced population can reveal threats to long-term persistence, inform thresholds for management interventions, and create targets for removing an endangered species from the IUCN Red List. We calculated capture-mark-recapture population estimates for eastern quolls (Dasyurus viverrinus) which had been reintroduced to a fenced reserve in the Australian Capital Territory. We then incorporated the resulting demographic parameters into population viability analyses (PVAs) to estimate probabilities of persistence under several scenarios, including supplementations and harvests (removal of individuals for translocation to other locations). After determining sustainable harvest rates, we then 'back-cast' the population size and occupancy area required to remove the species from the IUCN Red List within 10 years. Our demographic results indicated high mean apparent survival (90% & PLUSMN; 5), and PVAs revealed the probability of persistence over a 50-year time horizon was 50.5% with no interventions, 0% when the population was harvested of > 6 individuals, and 100% if harvests & LE; 54 juveniles were combined with an annual supplementation of ten maternal females (with & LE; 6 young each). Based on this model, a total harvest area of 413 km(2) and an occupancy area of 437 km(2) would be needed to recover the species within 10 years (i.e., 90 similar fenced reserves, not accounting for edge effects). Due to the inherent difficulty in securing large areas for species recovery, we see these ambitious targets as a call to create coordinated and collaborative sanctuary networks where species can be managed as a metapopulation across multiple sites. By taking advantage of a rapid life history and harvesting the 'doomed surplus', managers can achieve their stretch goals for species recovery in the long term.

AB Dinosaurs evolved a remarkable diversity of dietary adaptations throughout the Mesozoic, but the origins of different feeding modes are uncertain, especially the multiple origins of herbivory. Feeding habits of early di-nosaurs have mostly been inferred from qualitative comparisons of dental morphology with extant analogs. Here, we use biomechanical and morphometric methods to investigate the dental morphofunctional diversity of early dinosaurs in comparison with extant squamates and crocodylians and predict their diets using machine learning classification models. Early saurischians/theropods are consistently classified as carnivores. Sauropo-domorphs underwent a dietary shift from faunivory to herbivory, experimenting with diverse diets during the Triassic and Early Jurassic, and early ornithischians were likely omnivores. Obligate herbivory was a late evolu-tionary innovation in both clades. Carnivory is the most plausible ancestral diet of dinosaurs, but omnivory is equally likely under certain phylogenetic scenarios. This early dietary diversity was fundamental in the rise of dinosaurs to ecological dominance.

AB Cyanobacterial blooms in lakes frequently display high spatial heterogeneity, which may drive temporal changes in microbial community structure. Here we report on the spatial (horizontal and vertical) structure of the cyanobacteria community and of the co-occurring heterotroph microbial community during a major lake-wide bloom event at Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel). We sampled the upper water layer (0, 1 and 5 m depths) at five locations across the lake, spatially representing north, south, east, west and centre of the lake, on two dates during winter 2016 when the Microcystis biomass was high. We aimed to characterise the spatial distribution of the bloom and the associated microbiota, as well as testing the extent to which variation in the structure of the microbial community could be associated with Microcystis biomass. During the winter 2016 bloom, Microcystis biomass was spatially heterogeneous, but the Microcystis population structure was rather homogenous, dominated by a single genotype (ITS sequence variant). By contrast, the composition of the bacterial community, assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, was spatially heterogeneous, differing between depths, sampling locations and time. The largest difference in microbial community structure was between particle-associated (PA) and free-living (FL) fractions. The PA community was characterised by a relatively lower diversity, and dominated by Proteobacteria, whereas the FL community was significantly more diverse and dominated by members of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Variation in the microbial community was significantly correlated with geographical location and sampling depth. However, there was no clear relationship between the Microcystis biomass density (cells biovolume) and the structure of the microbial communities. These results suggest that the structure of the bacterial community is partly decoupled from Microcystis population density, and potentially more affected by other environmental factors such as temperature and/or physicochemical conditions. Our study highlights the importance of spatial information on bloom composition and intensity in clarifying the factors affecting the progression of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms and how this impacts their microbial counterparts.

AB Stone surface is a unique biological niche that may host a rich microbial diversity. The exploration of the biodiversity of the stone microbiome represents a major challenge and an opportunity to characterize new strains equipped with valuable biological activity. Here, we explored the diversity and adaptation strategies of total bacterial communities associated with Roman stone ruins in Tunisia by considering the effects of geo-climatic regions and stone geochemistry. Environmental 16S rRNA gene amplicon was performed on DNA extracted from stones samples collected in three different sampling sites in Tunisia, along an almost 400km aridity transect, encompassing Mediterranean, semiarid and arid climates. The library was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. The cultivable Actinobacteria were isolated from stones samples using the dilution plate technique. A total of 71 strains were isolated and identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Cultivable actinobacteria were further investigated to evaluate the adaptative strategies adopted to survive in/on stones. Amplicon sequencing showed that stone ruins bacterial communities were consistently dominated by Cyanobacteria, followed by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria along the aridity gradient. However, the relative abundance of the bacterial community components changed according to the geo-climatic origin. Stone geochemistry, particularly the availability of magnesium, chromium, and copper, also influenced the bacterial communities' diversity. Cultivable actinobacteria were further investigated to evaluate the adaptative strategies adopted to survive in/on stones. All the cultivated bacteria belonged to the Actinobacteria class, and the most abundant genera were Streptomyces, Kocuria and Arthrobacter. They were able to tolerate high temperatures (up to 45 degrees C) and salt accumulation, and they produced enzymes involved in nutrients' solubilization, such as phosphatase, amylase, protease, chitinase, and cellulase. Actinobacteria members also had an important role in the co-occurrence interactions among bacteria, favoring the community interactome and stabilization. Our findings provide new insights into actinobacteria's diversity, adaptation, and role within the microbiome associated with stone ruins.

AB AimBergmann's and Rapoport's rules are two ecogeographical patterns that predict an increase in species body size and range size, respectively, with increasing latitudes. Here, we evaluated whether using different geographical range estimates affects the assessment of Bergmann's and Rapoport's rules at the cross-species and assemblage levels in New World pit vipers. LocationNew World. TaxonNew World pit vipers (Crotalinae). MethodsWe estimated geographical ranges for 135 (i.e. approximate to 93%) Crotalinae species using ecological niche modelling (ENM) and expert maps and assessed alternative hypotheses that could account for Bergmann's and Rapoport's rules. We evaluated both rules using 'cross-species' (i.e. species as units of observation) and 'assemblage' (i.e. sites/grid cells as units of observation) approaches. We used phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analyses and generalized least squares (GLS) analyses to account for phylogenetic and spatial autocorrelation that could affect the evaluation of these rules at the cross-species and assemblage levels, respectively. ResultsExpert maps differed significantly from ENM ranges. The cross-species approach was robust to these different range estimates when Bergmann's and Rapoport's rules were evaluated. The assemblage analyses were more vulnerable to different range estimates, where contrasting results were observed in the assessment of Bergmann's rule but not in the evaluation of Rapoport's rule. Main ConclusionsDifferent geographical range estimates affected mainly the assessment of ecogeographical rules at the assemblage level, whereas the cross-species analyses were more robust. However, this increased susceptibility of the assemblage approach to different range estimates was only observed when evaluating Bergmann's rule. Thus, our findings suggest that ecogeographical rules can have different levels of sensitivity to different range estimates, which can especially affect the assemblage-level assessment of these ecogeographical patterns.

AB Microbial mats are vertically stratified communities of microorganisms characterized by pronounced physiochemical gradients allowing for high species diversity and a wide range of metabolic capabilities. High Throughput Sequencing has the potential to reveal the biodiversity and function of such ecosystems in the cycling of elements. The present study combines 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics on a hypersaline marsh in Tristomo bay (Karpathos, Greece). Samples were collected in July 2018 and November 2019 from microbial mats, deeper sediment, aggregates observed in the water overlying the sediment, as well as sediment samples with no apparent layering. Metagenomic samples' coassembly and binning revealed 250 bacterial and 39 archaeal metagenome-assembled genomes, with completeness estimates higher than 70% and contamination less than 5%. All MAGs had KEGG Orthology terms related to osmoadaptation, with the 'salt in' strategy ones being prominent. Halobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant taxa in the mats. Photosynthesis was most likely performed by purple sulphur and nonsulphur bacteria. All samples had the capacity for sulphate reduction, dissimilatory arsenic reduction, and conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Overall, both sequencing methodologies resulted in similar taxonomic compositions and revealed that the formation of the microbial mat in this marsh exhibits seasonal variation.
   This study investigates the taxa and the metabolic processes that potentially occur in a hypersaline marsh microbial mat showing the layered structure of microbial communities and the role of key-processes that support life in this extreme environment.

AB AimWhether intraspecific spatial patterns in body size are generalizable across species remains contentious, as well as the mechanisms underlying these patterns. Here we test several hypotheses explaining within-species body size variation in terrestrial vertebrates including the heat balance, seasonality, resource availability and water conservation hypotheses for ectotherms, and the heat conservation, heat dissipation, starvation resistance and resource availability hypotheses for endotherms. LocationGlobal. Time period1970-2016. Major taxa studiedAmphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. MethodsWe collected 235,905 body size records for 2,229 species (amphibians = 36; reptiles = 81; birds = 1,545; mammals = 567) and performed a phylogenetic meta-analysis of intraspecific correlations between body size and environmental variables. We further tested whether correlations differ between migratory and non-migratory bird and mammal species, and between thermoregulating and thermoconforming ectotherms. ResultsFor bird species, smaller intraspecific body size was associated with higher mean and maximum temperatures and lower resource seasonality. Size-environment relationships followed a similar pattern in resident and migratory birds, but the effect of resource availability on body size was slightly positive only for non-migratory birds. For mammals, we found that intraspecific body size was smaller with lower resource availability and seasonality, with this pattern being more evident in sedentary than migratory species. No clear size-environment relationships were found for reptiles and amphibians. Main conclusionsWithin-species body size variation across endotherms is explained by disparate underlying mechanisms for birds and mammals. Heat conservation (Bergmann's rule) and heat dissipation are the dominant processes explaining biogeographic intraspecific body size variation in birds, whereas in mammals, body size clines are mostly explained by the starvation resistance and resource availability hypotheses. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind species adaptations to the environment across their geographic distributions.

AB As part of a biological control program against rat (Rattus spp.) populations in oil palm plantations, Barn Owls (Tyto alba javanica) were translocated from Peninsular Malaysia and released in an oil palm plantation in Lahad Datu, Sabah, Malaysia, on the island of Borneo. We installed 16 nest boxes every 25 ha at the study site and monitored those nest boxes monthly from June 2014 to June 2018 to assess Barn Owl breeding parameters. We collected regurgitated pellets from nest boxes to analyze the prey of the owls. Average nest box occupancy rate throughout the entire study period was 66.7% (66.1). Nest box occupancy was lower in the first year of the study (average occupancy rate 23% 6 3.6) but increased significantly in the following years. We recorded 84 successful breeding attempts and a total of 555 eggs throughout the study period; 61% of eggs hatched and 60% of eggs produced young that successfully fledged. Clutch size per laying pair ranged from 1 to 9 (average +/- 5.6) and the brood size at fledging ranged from 1 to 7 (average +/- 4.0). Diet of the Barn Owls consisted of only small mammals; rodents made up 99% of analyzed pellets, and shrews accounted for 1%. There has been no previous record of Barn Owls naturally occurring in Borneo and this is the first breeding population successfully translocated and established.

AB Thin filamentous cyanobacteria isolated from three collection sites in the Republic of Korea were suggested as three new species belonging to the genus Plectolyngbya, mainly according to their molecular characteristics. The species of Plectolyngbya, including the type species of P. hodgsonii, were cryptic species that were difficult to distinguish morphologically from each other, and had appeared in ecologically diverse habitats. P. terrestris and P. koreana were subaerophytes collected from certain black spots and soils between stone walls in Seoul, Republic of Korea. In addition, hypersaline species collected from a saltern, P. salina, shared the same halophytic feature as the P. hodgsonii from the littoral zone of a coastal lake in the Antarctic. The 16S rRNA gene phylogeny supported the monophyly of Plectolyngbya with solid support, 99% Maximum Likelihood, 98% Neighbor-Joining bootstrap support values, and 1.0 Bayesian posterior probability. The ITS sequences of P. terrestris, P. koreana, and P. salina were unique in length and nucleotide composition, with different secondary structures of D1-D1MODIFIER LETTER PRIME and Box-B helices, compared with those of P. hodgsonii. These results demonstrate that the proposed new Plectolyngbya species were unique in their molecular traits. Therefore, we suggest them as new species belonging to the genus Plectolyngbya with the names P. terrestris sp. nov., P. koreana sp. nov., and P. salina sp. nov.

AB size is known to vary with temperature, and in the past decades has been shown to vary with anthropogenic climate change. Many species have exhibited size declines in conjunction with warming temperatures, but some groups, such as reptiles, remain under-studied. We tested whether body size changes of the Eastern Fence Lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) species complex across their U.S. range were related to temperature and precipitation over 115 y. We measured snout-vent length (SVL) of more than 600 adults collected from 1899-2014 and extracted mean annual temperature, temperature of the warmest quarter, total annual precipitation, and elevation for the latitude, longitude, and year of collection for each specimen. We found that over time, temperature increased while precipitation decreased at our sampled sites, and size of males and females increased. Size was predicted by a marginally significant interaction between temperature and precipitation, indicating that as temperatures warmed, individuals became larger in dry areas and smaller in wet areas, supporting the desiccation resistance hypothesis (larger in dry environments). Our data suggest that precipitation may be an overlooked factor influencing size, warranting further examination in other taxa.

AB Climate change threatens biodiversity in a range of ways, including changing animal body sizes. Despite numerous examples of size declines related to increasing temperatures, patterns of size change are not universal, suggesting that one or more primary mechanisms impacting size change are unknown. Precipitation is likely to influence the size different from and in conjunction with changes in temperature, yet tests of the interaction between these variables are rare. In this study, we show that a crossover interaction between temperature and precipitation impacts the body size of frogs as the climate warms. Using more than 3000 museum frog specimens from Borneo and climate records spanning more than 100 years, we found that frogs are larger in wet conditions than in dry conditions at cool temperatures, suggesting that resource availability determines body size at colder temperature. Conversely, frogs are larger in dry conditions than in wet conditions at warm temperatures, resulting in a crossover to desiccation resistance as the main determinant of body size as climates warm. Our results demonstrate that global warming can alter the impact of precipitation on life-history traits. We suggest that increased attention be paid to such interactive effects of climate variables, to identify complex mechanisms driving climate-induced size changes.

AB AimOur aim is to document the dimensions of current squamate reptile biodiversity in the Americas by integrating taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional data, and assessing how this may vary across phylogenetic scales. We also explore the potential underlying mechanisms that may be responsible for the observed geographical diversity patterns. LocationThe Americas. Time periodPresent. Major taxaSquamate reptiles. MethodsWe used published data on the distribution, phylogeny, and body size of squamate reptiles to document the current dimensions of their alpha diversity in the Americas. We overlapped species ranges to estimate taxonomic diversity (TD) and calculated phylogenetic diversity (PD) using mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (MPD), speciation rate (DivRate) and Faith's phylogenetic index (PD). We estimated functional diversity (FD) as trait dispersion in the multivariate space using body size and leg development data. We implemented a deconstructive macroecological approach to understand how spatial mismatches between the three facets of diversity vary across phylogenetic scales, and the potential eco-evolutionary mechanisms driving these patterns across space. ResultsWe found a strong latitudinal gradient of TD with a large accumulation in tropical regions. PD and FD patterns were largely similar likely due to the high phylogenetic signal in the traits used, and higher values tended to be concentrated in harsh and/or heterogeneous environments. We found differences between major clades within Squamata that display contrasting geographical patterns. Several regions across the continent shared the same spatial mismatches between dimensions across clades, suggesting that similar eco-evolutionary processes are shaping these regional reptile assemblages. However, we also found evidence that non-mutually exclusive processes can operate differently across clades. Main conclusionsThe deconstructive approach implemented here is based on a solid macroecological framework. We can extend this to other taxonomic groups to establish whether there are particularities about how different eco-evolutionary mechanisms shape biodiversity facets in a spatially explicit context.

AB The fairy circles of Namibia form a remarkable gap pattern in arid grassland along the Namib Desert. The origin of the fairy circles is subject to an ongoing debate. Solving the mystery of the fairy circles (FCs) requires the right timing in fieldwork after rainfall, as the newly appearing grasses complete their life cycle within only a few weeks. Here we followed the rains along the Namib between 2020 and 2022 and assessed the cause of the grass death within FCs at different time intervals after grass-triggering rainfall. To assess whether termite herbivory was the cause, we used grass excavations and observations on the roots and shoots. To test if edaphic differences may explain the grass death in FCs, we undertook infiltration measurements in 10 FC-hotspot regions. Finally, we used continuous soil-moisture measurements from the dry into the rainy seasons to examine how the newly emerging grasses affect the soil-water content in space and time. Generally, in study plots that received grass -triggering rainfall most recently, the roots of the dead grasses in FCs were in 100 % of the cases undamaged, root-shoot ratios were significantly greater, and the roots were as long or even longer as those of the surrounding matrix grasses outside of the FCs. This indicates that drought stress caused grasses in the FCs to invest resources into roots to reach the percolating water. The results also show that the cause of the grass death in fairy circles was not induced by termite herbivory. Also, we found no systematic differences in the rate of water infiltration between FCs and the matrix, hence the plant wilting cannot result from quicker percolation within FCs. However, the soil-moisture measurements indicate that the matrix grasses strongly depleted the upper soil water of the FCs after rainfall, which explains why most grasses cannot establish and quickly die in the FCs. The research shows that grass death in fairy circles occurs immediately after rainfall due to plant water stress but not due to termite activity. Our results conform with previous fieldwork, pattern analysis and theoretical modeling, suggesting that Namibia's fairy circles are a self-organized vegetation phenomenon induced by ecohydrological feedbacks.

ID COEXISTENCE; COMMUNITIES; STABILITY; TIME
AB Complex spatial systems can experience critical transitions or tippings on crossing a threshold value in their response to stochastic perturbations. While previous studies have well characterized the impact of white noise on tipping, the effect of correlated noise in spatial ecosystems remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the effect of both multiplicative and additive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) correlated noise on the occurrence of critical transitions in spatial ecosystems. We find that decreasing the noise correlation time of OU (exponentially correlated) noise aggravates the chance of critical transitions in spatiotemporal ecological systems. Our results hold good and are supported by the analysis of three well-studied spatial ecological models of varying nonlinearity. We also compute spatial early warning indicators (e.g., spatial variance, spatial skewness, and spatial correlation) to determine their reliability in anticipating tipping points with variations in noise correlation. The indicators of critical transitions exhibit mixed success in forewarning the occurrence of a tipping point, as indicated by the distribution of Kendall's rank correlation.

AB AimSpecies-level traits, such as body and range sizes, are important correlates of extinction risk. However, both are often related and are driven by environmental factors. Here, we elucidated links between environmental factors, body size, range size and susceptibility to extinction, across the whole order of rodents. LocationGlobal. Time periodCurrent. Major taxa studiedRodents (order Rodentia). MethodsWe compiled an unprecedentedly large database of rodent morphology, phylogeny, range size, conservation status, global climate and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), comprising >86% of all described species. Using phylogenetic regressions, we initially explored the environmental factors driving body size. Next, we modelled the relationship between body size and range size. From this relationship, we computed and mapped (at the assemblage level) an index of relative range size, corresponding to the deviation from the expected range size of each species, given its body size. Finally, we tested whether relative range was correlated with the risk of extinction of the species derived from an assessment by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. ResultsWe found that, contrary to the expectations of Bergmann's rule, the body size of rodents was mostly influenced by variation in NDVI (rather than latitude/temperature). Body size, in turn, imposed a constraint on species range size, as evidenced by a triangular relationship that was segmented at the lower bound. The relative species range size derived from this relationship highlighted four geographical regions where rodents with small relative range were concentrated globally. We demonstrated that lower relative range size was associated with increased risk of extinction. Main conclusionsSpecies that, given their body size, are distributed across ranges that are smaller than expected have elevated extinction risk. Therefore, investigating the relationships between environmental drivers, body size and range size might help to detect species that could become threatened in the near future.

AB 1. Freshwater cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms (cHABs) are a major threat to human and environmental health and are increasing globally in frequency and severity. To manage this threat in a timely manner, science must focus on in- creasing our ability to predict the growth and toxigenicity of specific taxa of cyanobacteria. 2. Recent molecular research has revealed striking genomic and metabolic diver- sity among the many morphologically indistinguishable sub-species and strains of cyanobacteria. Assemblage -level molecular metabolic capability surveys promise to improve our ability to predict cyanobacterial responses to environ- mental forcing, but many of these cutting-edge techniques are not widely available or cost-effective enough to be employed in routine monitoring programmes to support management decisions. Taxonomic ambiguity, cryptic functional specialisation, incongruence between genomic capability and phylogeny, and genomic flexibility impose severe challenges to our ability to ascribe autecologi- cal attributes at a level of taxonomic resolution that is attainable under current management strategies (i.e. Linnaean species). This lack of knowledge prohibits reliable predictions of species' responses to environmental stressors. 3. Cyanobacterial species comprise consortia of metabolically diverse, morpholog- ically indistinct strains that span a range of ecological specialisation. Under cur- rent, broadly applied taxonomic concepts, these species functionally embody a generalist ecological strategy- persisting and/or proliferating where other spe- cialised competitors are negatively impacted. 4. We postulate that within current management frameworks, characterising of cy- anobacterial species as competing generalists, as well as considering abundance trajectories of well-characterised, non-cyanobacterial specialist phytoplankton will generate more scalable, mechanistic, and management-relevant insight into increasing cHAB frequency and severity in suitable time frames. 5. Here we recommend that cHAB management considers the competitive frame-work of phytoplankton communities, including cyanobacteria, wherein diverse environmental changes lead to deterministic responses by readily identifiable, documented specialist taxa. Characterising these changes in community struc-ture will quantify the relative importance of altered stressors and resource avail-ability that can be exploited by metabolically flexible cyanobacteria.

AB As the area covered by human-modified environments grows, it is increasingly important to understand the responses of communities to the novel habitats created, especially for sensitive and threatened taxa. We aimed to improve understanding of the major evolutionary and ecological processes that shape the assemblage of amphibian and reptile communities to forest modifications. To this end, we compiled a global data set of amphibian and reptile surveys in natural, disturbed (burned, logged), and transformed (monocultures, polyspecific plantations) forest communities to assess the richness, phylogenetic diversity, and composition of those communities, as well as the morphological disparity among taxa between natural and modified forest habitats. Forest transformations led to a diversity reduction of 15.46% relative to the statistically nonsignificant effect of disturbances. Transformations also led to a community composition that was 39.4% dissimilar to that on natural forests, compared with 16.1% difference in disturbances. Modifications did not affect the morphological disparity of communities (p = 0.167 and 0.744), and we found little evidence of taxon-specific responses to anthropic impacts. Monocultures and polyspecific plantations detrimentally affected the conservation and ecological value of both amphibian and reptile communities and altered the evolutionary processes shaping these communities, whereas forests with lower impact disturbances might, to some extent, serve as reservoirs of species. Although different mechanisms might buffer the collapse of herpetological communities, preserving remaining natural forests is necessary for conserving communities in the face of future anthropic pressures.

AB Environmental and intrinsic factors interact to determine energy requirements in vertebrates. Glucocorticoid hormones (GCs) are key mediators of this interaction, as they fluctuate with energetic demands and regulate physiological and behavioral responses to environmental challenges. While a great body of research has focused on GC variation among individuals, the mechanisms driving GC variation across species and at broad spatial scales remain largely unexplored. Here, we adopted a macrophysiological approach to investigate the environmental factors and life-history traits driving variation in baseline GCs across lizard species. We tested three hypotheses: (1) If GCs increase with body temperature to meet higher metabolic demand, we expect an association between average baseline GCs and the mean species' body temperature in the field (GC-temperature dependence hypothesis); (2) If GCs mediate behavioral responses to avoid thermal extremes, we expect that individuals frequently exposed to extreme conditions exhibit higher baseline GC levels (Behavioral thermoregulation hypothesis); (3) If GCs increase to support higher energy demands in active foragers during their period of activity, we expect that active foraging species have higher baseline GCs than sit-and-wait foragers, and that GC levels increase in relation to the duration of daily activity windows (Activity hypothesis). We used biophysical models to calculate operative temperatures and the activity patterns of lizards in sun-exposed and shaded microenvironments. Then, we tested the association between baseline GCs, body temperature, operative temperatures, foraging mode, and activity windows across 37 lizard species, using data from HormoneBase. Our comparative analyses showed that variation in baseline GCs was primarily related to the mean field body temperature and foraging mode, with higher baseline GCs in active foragers with higher body temperatures. Our results suggest that body temperature and foraging mode drive GC variation through their effects on energy requirements across lizard species.

AB Dry-land ecosystems have become a matter of grave concern, due to the growing threat of land degradation and bioproductivity loss. Self-organized vegetation patterns are a remarkable characteristic of these ecosystems; apart from being visually captivating, patterns modulate the system response to increasing environmental stress. Empirical studies hinted that herbivory is one the key regulatory mechanisms behind pattern formation and overall ecosystem functioning. However, most of the mathematical models have taken a mean-field strategy to grazing; foraging has been considered to be independent of spatial distribution of vegetation. To this end, an extended version of the celebrated plant-water model due to Klausmeier has been taken as the base here. To encompass the effect of heterogeneous vegetation distribution on foraging intensity and subsequent impact on entire ecosystem, grazing is considered here to depend on spatially weighted average vegetation density instead of density at a particular point. Moreover, varying influence of vegetation at any location over gazing elsewhere is incorporated by choosing a suitable averaging function. A comprehensive analysis demonstrates that inclusion of spatial nonlocality alters the understanding of system dynamics significantly. The grazing ecosystem is found to be more resilient to increasing aridity than it was anticipated to be in earlier studies on nonlocal grazing. The system response to rising environmental pressure is also observed to vary depending on the grazer. Obtained results also suggest the possibility of multistability due to the history dependence of the system response. Overall, this work indicates that the spatial heterogeneity in grazing intensity has a decisive role to play in the functioning of water-limited ecosystems.

AB Carcasses resulting from natural mortalities are invaluable for use in scientific studies, provided species, sex, and age class are known. When such data are unavailable, identifying skeletal remains is necessary if one is to use the information contained within samples. Teeth are amongst the best preserved skeletal remains owing to the durability of enamel and dentine. Here, we tested whether external measurements of canines could be used to distinguish two partially sympatric species of Southern Ocean fur seals, the Antarctic Arctocephalus gazella and Sub-Antarctic A. tropicalis fur seals. We also investigated whether the external measurements of canines could be used to determine the age, sex, as well as island of origin of the animals. Eight morphological variables (crown length, root length, crown width, root width, crown thickness, root thickness, total canine length, and count of external surface annular ridges) were recorded from canines of 340 individuals of known species, sex, and island of origin. The count of external annular ridges provided a good estimate of age, which was confirmed by counting the growth layer groups of sectioned teeth, especially for older animals (> 9 years old). External canine measurements proved useful in distinguishing species, as well as sex within and between species, particularly in adult animals. Species were more difficult to distinguish in females than in males. The islands of origin could only be inferred in male Antarctic fur seals. This study indicates that fur seal teeth of unknown provenance, found either in breeding colonies or as vagrants, provide evidence on species, sex, and age of the animal, which increases the value of associated samples. It further highlights the importance of external measurements of skeletal remains such as canine teeth in separating closely related species.

AB Managing ecosystems to effectively preserve function and services requires reliable tools that can infer changes in the stability and dynamics of a system. Conceptually, functional diversity (FD) appears as a sensitive and viable monitoring metric stemming from suggestions that FD is a universally important measure of biodiversity and has a mechanistic influence on ecological processes. It is however unclear whether changes in FD consistently occur prior to state responses or vice versa, with no current work on the temporal relationship between FD and state to support a transition towards trait-based indicators. There is consequently a knowledge gap regarding when functioning changes relative to biodiversity change and where FD change falls in that sequence. We therefore examine the lagged relationship between planktonic FD and abundance-based metrics of system state (e.g. biomass) across five highly monitored lake communities using both correlation and cutting edge non-linear empirical dynamic modelling approaches. Overall, phytoplankton and zooplankton FD display synchrony with lake state but each lake is idiosyncratic in the strength of relationship. It is therefore unlikely that changes in plankton FD are identifiable before changes in more easily collected abundance metrics. These results highlight the power of empirical dynamic modelling in disentangling time lagged relationships in complex multivariate ecosystems, but suggest that FD cannot be generically viable as an early indicator. Individual lakes therefore require consideration of their specific context and any interpretation of FD across systems requires caution. However, FD still retains value as an alternative state measure or a trait representation of biodiversity when considered at the system level.

AB There are some critical thresholds in many complex dynamic systems. When a system approaches its critical threshold, the probability density distribution of the system might be changed. In view of this, we presented a new early warning indicator of an abrupt climate change based on the Box-Cox transformation, namely, the changing Box-Cox transformation parameter (BCTP). A significant increasing or decreasing trend in BCTP can always be found before the onset of an abrupt change in different folding models. Based on the Greenland paleotemperature data reconstructed through Greenland Ice Sheet Project II, we found that BCTP showed an increasing trend about 2800 years before the onset of Bolling-Allerod warming. The trends of BCTP are statistically significant at a significant level of of alpha = 0.05 for both artificial abrupt changes and Greenland paleotemperature. Compared with kurtosis coefficient and skewness coefficient, BCTP can present an effectively early warning in some cases of abrupt change where kurtosis coefficient or skewness coefficient showed a poor warning performance. In general, the variation magnitudes of BCTP are greater than that of kurtosis coefficient and skewness coefficient, and BCTP shows a better warning performance in most of cases. These results indicate that changing BCTP could be a good new indicator for warning upcoming abrupt changes.

AB Simple Summary This study was carried out to control the plant Sarcopoterium spinosum in canakkale, Turkey. As a result of grazing, the number of grasses and legumes decreased and the number of shrubs increased. The number of species increased due to shrub control measures but decreased remarkably with grazing. (1) Background: The effects of prickly burnet (Sarcopoterium spinosum) control measures (pulling out, burning and cutting) and grazing on the botanical composition, grazeable dry matter (GDM) yield and nutritional values of rangeland were investigated on Imbros Island (Turkey) in 2010-2013. (2) Methods: The rangeland was grazed by Imbros sheep during the last year of the experiment. About 0.15 ha of rangeland was allocated to each sheep and five sheep were placed in each plot. Grazing was continuous throughout the year. (3) Results: Shrub levels decreased by 50-60% due to pulling out, burning and cutting in the first year and herbaceous species increased. Forbs increased more in the pulled and burnt plots and grasses increased more in the cut plots. In the third year, the shrub level increased to 60-65% and herbaceous species decreased. The decrease in herbaceous species was observed mostly in forbs. Plant cover was mostly (58%) composed of annual species. Development decreased plant cover ratios, but this decrease ceased in the burnt plot in the third year. Grazing also reduced plant cover. Crude protein (CP), NDF, ADF and digestible dry matter (DDM) content did not vary significantly over the experimental period. CP and DDM increased, NDF decreased and ADF did not change in the development plots. Overall, significant differences were not observed in GDM yield and nutritional values due to development efforts (pulling out, burning and cutting). (4) Conclusions: However, cutting is difficult over stony and rough terrain and pulling out creates erosion on sloping surfaces. Therefore, burning is recommended over the entire rangeland and burning or pulling out is recommended over smooth terrain for the temporary control of S. spinosum.

AB Vegetation patterns with a variety of structures is amazing phenomena in arid or semi-arid areas, which can identify the evolution law of vegetation and are typical signals of ecosystem functions. Many achievements have been made in this respect, yet the mechanisms of uptake-diffusion feedback on the pattern structures of vegetation is not fully understood. To well reveal the influences of parameters perturbation on the pattern formation of vegetation, we give a comprehensive analysis on a vegetation-water model in the forms of reaction-diffusion equation which is posed by Zelnik et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci 112:12,327-12,331, 2015). We obtain the exact parameters range for stationary patterns and show the dynamical behaviors near the bifurcation point based on nonlinear analysis. It is found that the model has the properties of spot, labyrinth and gap patterns. Moreover, water diffusion rate prohibits the growth of vegetation while shading parameter promotes the increase of vegetation biomass. Our results show that gradual transitions from uniform state to gap pattern can occur for suitable value of parameters which may induce the emergence of desertification.

AB Edaphically unusual sites harbor a flora that is often unique in its taxonomic as well as functional composi-tion and contain many endemic species. While this edaphic endemism, edaphism, has been discussed previ-ously on various special soils, in this study we relate it for the first time to the floristic characteristics of so called "quartz islands", edaphically driven special habitats in South Africa, and their surroundings (matrix habitat). We sampled the vegetation and soil for 245 vegetation plots in the Knersvlakte Nature Reserve and examined 336 plant species with respect to their evolutionary (plant family, habitat specificity), bio-geographical (distributional range) as well as functional traits (life form, leaf succulence, flowering onset, dis-persal mode). Based on the floristic uniqueness of the quartz islands, we expect them to host a highly specialized and locally endemic flora with smaller life forms, pronounced leaf succulence (both indicative of resource-conservative economics) and distinct reproductive traits than their surroundings. We find that, compared to the matrix habitat, quartz islands have significantly higher salinity and lower soil pH, and show higher proportion of leaf-succulent species of smaller life forms -some of which are restricted to quartz islands and have different timing of flowering onset, while dispersal via zoochory is less important. Like other special soils, quartz islands harbor unique plant species, which are distinguished by distinct trait patterns. We conclude that the concept of edaphism can be applied to quartz islands.(c) 2022 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall in the Nama-Karoo is sporadic and a plant's ability to access and utilise available soil moisture will determine its ability to persist in the system and to successfully recruit. When summer rainfall in the Eastern Karoo increases, grassiness increases at the expense of shrub canopy cover. This may drive a transition from shrubland toward grassland. The effect of grass-shrub competition on shrub growth and phenology in the Eastern Karoo is not adequately explained by the root-niche separation hypothesis or the succession hypothesis. In an experiment, we measured shrub growth and phenology in the absence (clipping treatment) and presence (control treatment) of grass over the 2017/2018 rainfall season. Grass clipping changed grass species composition over this period, but grass clipping did not benefit shrubs. We found no competitive effect of grasses on shrubs. However, shrub canopy cover showed a strong linear response to soil moisture, as did canopy cover to temperature. Similarly, soil moisture and temperature were important for stem growth and shrub phenology. Patterns of shrub growth and phenology in response to summer and winter rainfall provide important insight for land managers for optimising production while enabling phenological processes that allow recruitment to take place.

AB One of the largest and least documented populations of dugongs (Dugong dugon) resides in the coastal waters of the United Arab Emirates, and waters surrounding Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Qatar. The archaeological record of dugongs in the Gulf Region is abundant, but little is known about their fossil record in the region. Here we report an isolated sirenian rib fragment from the Futaisi Member of the Fuwayrit Formation near the town of Al Ruwais, in northern Qatar. The Fuwayrit Formation is a marine Pleistocene deposit exposed onshore in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Based on the correlative dating of the basal Futaisi Member with other onshore platforms, the rib fragment is approximately 125 ka. We propose that this isolated rib (likely the first rib from the right side) belongs to Dugongidae, with strong similarities to extant Dugong. We cannot, however, eliminate the possibility that it belongs to an extinct taxon, especially given its similarities with other fossil dugongid material from both Qatar and elsewhere in the world. Aside from reflecting the presence of Gulf seagrass communities in the Pleistocene, this occurrence also suggests that different (and potentially multiple) lineages of sirenians inhabited the Gulf Region in the geologic past.

AB N-2-fixing heterocytous cyanobacteria are considered to play a minor role in sustaining coastal microbial mat communities developing under normal marine to hypersaline conditions. Here, we investigated microbial mats growing under different salinities from freshwater mats of Giblin River (Tasmania) to metahaline and hypersaline mats of Shark Bay (Western Australia). Analyses of genetic (rRNA and mRNA) and biological markers (heterocyte glycolipids) revealed an unexpectedly large diversity of heterocytous cyanobacteria in all the studied microbial mat communities. It was observed that the taxonomic distribution as well as abundance of cyanobacteria is strongly affected by salinity. Low salinity favoured the presence of heterocytous cyanobacteria in freshwater mats, while mats thriving in higher salinities mainly supported the growth unicellular and filamentous non-heterocytous genera. However, even though mRNA transcripts derived from heterocytous cyanobacteria were lower in Shark Bay (<6%) microbial mats, functional analyses revealed that these diazotrophs were transcribing a substantial proportion of the genes involved in biofilm formation and nitrogen fixation. Overall, our data reveal an unexpectedly high diversity of heterocytous cyanobacteria (e.g. Calothrix, Scytonema, Nodularia, Gloeotrichia, Stigonema, Fischerella and Chlorogloeopsis) that had yet to be described in metahaline and hypersaline microbial mats from Shark Bay and that they play a vital role in sustaining the ecosystem functioning of coastal-marine microbial mat systems.

AB Understanding what drives non-native species naturalization (the establishment of a self-sustainable population outside its native range) is a central question in invasion science. Plant capacity for long-distance dispersal (LDD) is likely to influence the spread and naturalization of non-native species differently according to their introduction pathways. These pathways include intentional introductions (for economic use, e.g. for agriculture), unintentional introductions (e.g. seed contaminants), plant dispersal via human infrastructures (e.g. roads) and plant spread from an adjacent region where the species was previously introduced. We tested the relationship between sets of LDD traits (syndromes) of 10 308 European plant species and their global naturalization incidence (i.e. whether a species has become naturalized or not) and extent (i.e. the number of regions where a species has become naturalized) using the most comprehensive database of naturalized plants worldwide (GloNAF). Diaspore traits allowed the identification of four traditional LDD syndromes, namely those with specializations for dispersal by: wind (anemochorous), animal ingestion (endozoochorous), attached to animals (epizoochorous) and sea currents (thalassochorous). These evolutionary specializations have been historically interpreted by biologists even though actual dispersal is not always related to diaspore syndromes. We found that while epizoochorous and thalassochorous traits are positively associated with global plant naturalization incidence, anemochorous and endozoochorous traits show a negative relationship. Species' residence time outside their native range, their economic use and presence of epizoochorous traits (such as hooks, hairs and adhesive substances) are positively associated with global naturalization extent. Furthermore, we found that plant economic use reduces the influence of LDD syndromes on the naturalization incidence of intentionally introduced plants. While the success of non-native plants is influenced by a broad array of species- and context-specific factors, LDD syndromes play an important role in this context depending on the economic use of plants.

AB Species differ in their biological susceptibility to extinction, but the set of traits determining susceptibility varies across taxa. It is yet unclear which patterns are common to all taxa, and which are taxon-specific, with conse-quences to conservation practice. In this study we analysed the generality of trait-based prediction of extinction risk across terrestrial (including freshwater) vertebrates, invertebrates and plants at a global scale. For each group, we selected five representative taxa and within each group we explored whether risk can be related to any of 10 potential predictors. We then synthesized outcomes across taxa using a meta-analytic approach. High habitat specificity was a consistent predictor across vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, being a universal predictor of risk. Slow life-history traits - large relative offspring size, low fecundity, long generation length -, and narrow altitudinal range were also found to be good predictors across most taxa, but their universality needs to be supported with additional data. Poor dispersal ability was a common predictor of extinction risk among invertebrate and plant taxa, but not consistently among vertebrates. The remaining traits (body size, micro -habitat verticality, trophic level, and diet breadth) were useful to predict extinction risk but only at lower tax-onomical levels. Our study shows that despite the idiosyncrasies among taxa, universal susceptibility to extinction exists and several traits might influence extinction risk for most taxa. Informing conservation prior-itization at lower taxonomic scales should however include taxon-specific trait-based predictors of extinction risk.

AB Drought has become a major threat to regional sustainable development in drylands. Ecological drought, emphasizing the process of drought impacts on ecosystems in coupled human-natural systems, has been posing large risks to the stability of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in drylands. Yet, the interconnected avenues via which ecological drought drives vegetation transition, ecological resilience and ecosystem services in GDEs with species-specific traits remain elusive, especially in arid endorheic basins. Here, we combine comprehensive field measurements derived from representative groundwater depth transects in Central Asia and simulations obtained from the stochastic eco-hydrological models and the Langevin approach, we find that two groundwater-dependent species, the salt-tolerant Haloxylon ammodendron and salt-sensitive Haloxylon persicum, exhibit contrasting water use strategies being driven by variations in eco-physiological traits and environmental regimes. Nonetheless, both the low-resilient H. ammodendron and high-resilient H. persicum vegetation tend to show bistable transition corresponding to vegetated and bare soils under drought stress with stochastic noises and time delays. Alarmingly, ecological drought is accelerating catastrophic transitions in both Haloxylon ecosystems induced by diminishing ecological flows, depleting soil moisture, and aggravating salinization, together with climate forcing. In particular, exacerbated drought stress reduces ecological resilience, enhances the likelihood of catastrophic shifts, and reduces ecosystem services of GDEs in arid endorheic basins. Our results highlight that ecological drought adaptation strategies must account for resilience maintenance by balancing water scarcity, water overuse, and water/soil quality to avoid accelerating regime shifts in dryland ecosystems.

AB The Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) ecosystem has undergone physical and biological changes over the past 25 years, including a shift from a dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense)-dominated system to one in which Cyanobacteria play a major role. The Saint Peter's fish, Sarotherodon galilaeus, the most valuable commercial fish in the lake, was a prime consumer of P. gatunense. Sarotherodon galilaeus has adapted to the ecosystem changes and the scarcity of its primary food source, affecting interactions with other fish in the lake, such as the stocked silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix. To examine the food habits of the two fish species following the changes in the lake, a total of 300 S. galilaeus and 150 H. molitrix individuals were randomly collected over a five-year period from various places and times in Lake Kinneret. The contents of their stomachs were identified and analyzed. Results showed that a major dietary shift from herbivory to omnivory has occurred since the 1970s in both S. galilaeus and H. molitrix, with H. molitrix now preying almost exclusively on zooplankton. As a result of the dietary changes, both species have had to compete with other fish species for the limited zooplankton resources present in the lake, as well as contending with Cyanobacterial blooms. These changes in the lake's food web require modifications in the management of the lake and its fisheries.

AB This study assessed the pollution effects of cement dust emission on the soil quality around Ewekoro, southwestern Nigeria. Composite soil samples were collected at six locations from the cement factory (0 km) to a distance of 3 km outside the factory; for two consecutive years. Soil samples were also taken from a distance of 22 km after the cement factory to serve as a control. A total of 42 soil samples were collected and subjected to laboratory assays using standard procedures. Samples were analyzed for pH, organic carbon, particle size, available phosphorus (AvP), alkalinity, exchangeable cations, and heavy metals. Data collected were subjected to simple descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS for Windows. Pollution effect was also evaluated for pollution index (PI), ecological risk index (ERI), Nemerov integrated pollution index (NIPI), and enrichment factor (EF). Results showed significantly higher levels of exchangeable cations, alkalinity, AvP, pH, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Fe in the vicinity of the cement factory than in the control site. The distribution of metals in soils around the cement factory followed the trend of Fe > Mn > Zn > Pb > Cr > Cu. The PI of metals in soil established high pollution levels for Pb and Zn. The NIPI values for Cu, Cr, and Fe showed low levels of pollution at the vicinity of the cement industry, while no pollution level was observed at the control site. NIPI revealed that Pb varied from low to moderate pollution levels across the sampling locations. The EF values of Zn and Pb were higher than 2.0, thereby suggesting emissions from anthropogenic activities, especially from the cement industry.

AB Body size is one of the most important traits of an organism. Among reptiles, both lizards and snakes show body size differences that span a similar six orders of magnitude variation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying body size variation in squamates remain obscure. Here, we performed comparative genomic analyses of 101 body-size-related genes from 28 reptilian genomes. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML) revealed that snakes showed higher evolutionary rates in body-size-related genes, and had an almost two-fold increase in the number of positively selected genes (similar to 20.3%) compared with lizards (similar to 8.9%). The high similarities in dN/dS values were obtained between the branches of large-bodied lizards and large-bodied snakes by Spearman correlation analysis. Combining the results from site model, branch-site model and clade model analyses, we found some key genes regulating the evolution of body size in squamates, such as COL10A1, GHR, NPC1, GALNS, CDKN2C, FBN1, and LCORL. Phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) indicated that AKT1, BMP1, IGF1, SOX5, SOX7 in lizards and BMP5, BMP7, GPC6, SH2B3, SOX17 in snakes were significantly correlated with body length and body mass. Furthermore, ecological factors had varying degrees of impact on body size and the evolutionary rate of body-size-related genes in squamates. Intriguingly, climate had little effect on body size of lizards and snakes, but the contribution of climate-related factors to the variation in evolutionary rate of body-size-related genes were relatively higher. Our study lays a foundation for a comprehensive understanding of genetic mechanisms of body size evolution in squamates during the process of adapting to terrestrial life.

AB Amphisbaena mertensii is a worm lizard species from South America. Because of its subterranean life-style, data on its biology are scarce. In this paper, we present the first record of A. mertensii as prey of a bird, the wood rail Aramides cajaneus. We also review the geographic range of this species, reporting it for 114 localities from west-central Brazil to northeastern Argentina. We update the range of precloacal pores in A. mertensii from 5-8 to 4-8, and report the largest individual of this species with a 458 mm snout-vent length.

AB The cement industry is prospering in the Middle East countries, especially in Egypt due to the presence of raw materials, as well as increasing population growth in the region and increasing cement demand. Without activating and applying the regulations and laws, which enforced by local government to ensure compliance with national and international standards upon this industry, the increase of cement factories and complementary units in the region may damage air quality and threaten the ecosystems. This paper deals with the monitoring of the ambient pollutants surrounding 21 cement factories during the 2017 year: carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3), and particulate matter (TSP, PM10, and PM2.5) emitted from the cement production processing. Air pollutants around the cement plants were determined using appropriate sampling techniques according to international standard methods. Results indicated that particulate matter concentrations were higher than all permissible guidelines for ambient air quality. Carbon monoxide concentrations of all sites were lower than permissible limits, while recorded gases concentrations (NO2, SO2, O-3) in some sites were comply with those limits. High concentrations of particulate matter at all sites could be attributed to the applied processes for cement production, such as raw materials mining, transportation, blending, quarrying, preparation, and stockpiles. Moreover, kilns operation, clinker cooling, and milling processes were responsible for gases and particulates emission operations. The results indicated also that exhaust emissions were attributed to the type of fuel used and coal is responsible for the production of most pollutants while natural gas produced the least amount of pollution. The use of clean fuel with ideal combustion techniques and the application of interlocking mechanisms to all processes are recommended for the cement manufacturers in Egypt to reduce adverse emissions to the environment.

AB Millepora, a hydrozoan coral, is a common component in modern tropical reefs throughout the world. In ecological and palaeoecological surveys, it is often grouped with scleractinian corals, which are the prevailing builders of coral reefs. On modern, current-exposed reefs in the Red Sea, Millepora can become the dominant coral. However, it is rarely found in fossil reefs and if present, its abundance is usually considerably lower than in modern reefs. The mismatch is often explained by a low preservation potential of the milleporid skeleton in the fossil record. We explore Millepora abundances in Pleistocene reefs of Egypt using 29 line transects (typically of 20 m length), and find its abundances to be comparable to that of adjacent modern reefs (between 0 and 18.8 +/- 8.5% per site). Comparisons between sites with and without Millepora suggest that site specific environmental characteristics determine the presence of Millepora in the fossil reef. We conclude that a lack of preservation of habitats preferred by Millepora instead of the preservation potential of the hydrozoan itself is the most plausible reason for the mismatch between modern and fossil abundances.

AB Moss-microbial biofilm is an important topic for the biodeterioration of sandstone heritages. However, the processes that biofilms colonize and erode sandstone heritages should be better defined. We divided mosses into three strata perpendicular to the sandstone face in the direction from the atmosphere to the sandstone surface (the upper layer, the middle layer, and the lower layer) to explore the mechanisms involved. The results showed that the bacteria in various layers of moss exhibited a distinct layered pattern of nutrient strategies. The bacteria in the upper layer were mostly photoautotrophic (e.g., Cyanobacteria, WPS-2, etc.) and methylotrophic bacteria (e.g., Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, Sphingomonas, etc.). The bacteria in the lower layer were primarily het-erotrophic as special Actinobacteria with the ability of weathering (e.g., Actinomycetospora, Nocardioides, etc.). Particularly, the potential acid condition in the lower layer would promote the growth of acidophilic bacteria (e. g., Acidipila, Acidiphilium, etc.) and acidophilic iron-reducing bacteria (e.g., Acidiphilium, Acidicaldus, etc.), which deteriorate the alkaline cement and ferric oxides. Furthermore, nucleotide sequences associated with the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, methanol utilization (methanol dehydrogenase), nitrogen fixation (nitrogenase), and ammonia oxidation (ammonia monooxygenase) were more prevalent in the upper layer of bacterial commu-nities. The nucleotide sequences related to the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, reduced acetyl-CoA pathway, decomposition of organic carbon (beta-1,4-glucosidase), and organic nitrogen (beta-N-acetyl glucosaminidase) were more abundant in the lower layer. Therefore, in addition to the damage to the moss itself, we should pay more attention to the microorganisms that live in symbiosis with it. Our study shows that the strategy of stratified colonization of microorganisms would supply the nutrients available for moss-microbial biofilm, the formation of which would in turn deteriorate sandstone heritages.

AB The average body size of human prey animals in archaeological sites is influenced by myriad environmental, physiological and anthropogenic variables. When combined with supporting evidence, body size has the potential to provide a proxy for several variables of fundamental interest to archaeologists including climatic change, food availability and hunting impacts, among other things. In the southern Levant changes in mountain gazelle (Gazelle gazelle) body size in the Late Pleistocene were initially interpreted as evidence for a climatic downturn, but the picture has become increasingly murky as data has grown. Here we reconsider trends in gazelle body size using an updated dataset from the Mediterranean zone that spans the Early Epipaleolithic to the Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period (ca. 24,000-9,500 cal BP). Our results reveal that gazelle were smallest in the Early and Middle Epipaleolithic (Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran), reached their largest size in the early Late Epipaleolithic (Early Natufian) and then shrunk slightly before stabilizing in size through the Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic. We see no evidence that sex ratio, or climatic factors influenced this trend. Instead, we explore the role of human impacts on gazelle populations and their habitats as they grew in earnest at the beginning of the Late Epipaleolithic when people first began to settle into more permanent communities. Initially, in the Early and Late Natufian, anthropogenic impacts related to more intensive hunting and the increased footprint of more permanent settlements on the landscape. This may have pushed gazelle numbers below what could be supported by the environment, thus increasing the amount of food available for each animal and hence average body size. Later, as humans began to cultivate plants, manage animals and establish permanent villages, avoidance of humans and livestock by gazelle, and greater stability in food and water availability provided by agriculture, may have similarly reduced gazelle population size and intraspecific competition, thus allowing individual animals to grow larger on average.

AB To effectively combat the biodiversity crisis, we need ambitious targets and reliable indicators to accu-rately track trends and measure conservation impact. In Canada, the Living Planet Index (LPI) has been adapted to produce a national indicator by both World Wildlife Fund-Canada (Canadian Living Planet Index; C-LPI) and Environment and Climate Change Canada (Canadian Species Index) to provide insight into the status of Canadian wildlife, by evaluating temporal trends in verte-brate population abundance. The indicator includes data for just over 50% of Canadian vertebrate species. To assess whether the current dataset is representative of the distribution of life history char-acteristics of Canadian wildlife, we analyzed the representation of species-specific biotic variables (i.e., body size, trophic level, lifespan) for vertebrates within the C-LPI compared to native vertebrates lacking LPI data. Generally, there was considerable overlap in the distribution of biotic variables for species in the C-LPI compared to native Canadian vertebrate species lacking LPI data. Nevertheless, some differences among distributions were found, driven in large part by discrepancy in the represen-tation of fishes-where the C-LPI included larger-bodied and longer-lived species. We provide rec-ommendations for targeted data collection and additional analyses to further strengthen the applicability, accuracy, and representativity of biodiversity indicators.

AB In the only salt evaporation pond retaining its natural setting of the historic Salina di Cervia (Italy), the northernmost salterns of the Mediterranean area, a number of potentially preservable textures derive from the interactions between photosynthetic mat producers and the sedimentary substrate. These morphologies occur at the beginning of the taphonomic processes when repeated emerged-submerged conditions take place. In these conditions the cohesive nature of the diatom- and cyanobacterial-derived mucilage favours the stabilization of otherwise ephemeral structures. Surface micromorphologies for which diatoms and cyanobacteria have played some active role when still living in the soft microlayer and down to the sediment-water interface, such as during the gliding motility, can overcome the surface layer of most intense mixing (i.e., the taphonomically active zone) and keep traces of them in the fossil record either as body fossils or as texture contributors. Tiny microbial-derived remnants, such as filaments and biofilm strands of halotolerant microorganisms, while fragile upon their formation, can therefore stabilize as biosignatures when combined with salt precipitation. Halophilic and halotolerant ecosystems are models for life in extreme environments (analogue sites) with similarity to those strongly suspected to occur and/or have occurred on Mars and on other planetary bodies. The study of hypersaline systems such as Salina di Cervia which harbour diverse and abundant microbial life, can be relevant for astrobiology since it allows the investigation of potential biosignatures and their preservation, and of further understand the range of conditions and the planetary processes sustaining potentially habitable systems.

AB Context. Leiopelma archeyi is a threatened New Zealand amphibian species translocated for conservation purposes. A disease outbreak triggered the translocation of 70 frogs to Pureora Forest in 2006 to establish a new wild population of L. archeyi. Ten years after, 60 more frogs were translocated to this site to enhance the genetic and demographic profile of L. archeyi in Pureora Forest. Here, we analysed 14 years of capture-recapture monitoring data collected for this translocated population. Aims. Our aim was to estimate population demographic parameters that allow us to assess the demographic performance of this translocated population. Methods. We used spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR; also called spatial capture-recapture) multi strata/session models to estimate population density and derive its rate of change over time. Key results. Here we show that the density of translocated Leiopelma archeyi in Pureora (central North Island, New Zealand) remains stable for most of the study period. After the release of 70 frogs in 2006, density varied from 0.02 frogs/m(2) in April 2007 to 0.06 frogs/m(2) in December 2014. After the second release of 60 frogs in 2016, density in Pureora of L. archeyi varied from 0.21 frogs/m(2) in November 2016 to 0.63 frogs/m(2) in November 2018. Conclusions. The study species is a long-lived k-selected species, therefore long-term monitoring (>20 years) is required to corroborate demographic indicators. Nevertheless, as the current density estimates are higher than the density estimated for this population after each release (April 2007 and November 2016), we suggest progress towards the establishment of a new wild population of L. archeyi in Pureora Forest.

AB Water residence time, which is affected by increasing water demands and climate change, plays a crucial role in lakes and reservoirs since it influences many natural physical and ecological processes that eventually impact the water quality of the waterbody. Thus, accurate quantification of the water residence time and its distribution is an important tool in lake management. In this study we present a novel approach for assessing the residence time in lakes and reservoirs. The approach is based on the Leslie matrix model that was originally developed for the analysis of age-structured biological population dynamics. In this approach the water in the lake is divided into different age classes each representing the time since the "parcel" of water entered the lake and provides an overall picture of the water age structure. The traditional approach for calculating residence times, which relies only on the lake volume and annual inflow or outflow volumes thereby disregarding any previous information, is very sensitive to large interannual variation. While the proposed approach produces the fraction and volume distribution curves of all age classes within the lake for each simulated timestep. Thus, in addition to mean residence time, the fraction of young water (FYW), quantifying the "young" fraction of water in the lake can be analyzed. The same is true for any other age class of water.
   The approach was applied to Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) historical data collected over 32 years (1987-2018) and for prediction of long-term time series based on several future scenarios (inflows and outflows). It offers a more accurate quantification of the mean residence time of water in a lake and can easily be adapted to other waterbodies. Comparison of simulation results may serve as basis for determining the lake's management policy, by controlling the inflows and outflows, that will affect both the mean residence time and the fraction of "young/old" age classes of water.

AB In a context of rapid global change, understanding how environmental stressors can impact phenotypic variation, and which phenotypic traits are predominantly affected can be particularly relevant. Indeed, potential phenotypic modifications could affect the functionality of traits from taxa that are in decline but that are keystone species in many ecosystems. In this study, we assessed the impact of environmental drivers and agricultural intensification on two crucial pollinator species: the honeybee (Apis mellifera) and the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris). Among eight countries representing four major European biogeographical regions [i.e., Boreal (Sweden and Estonia), Atlantic (Ireland and United Kingdom), Continental (Germany and Switzerland) and Mediterranean (Spain and Italy)] and two type of crops (i.e., apple orchards and oilseed rape) we assessed how landscape structure, latitude and pesticide management could impact their wing morphology. Two sampling sessions were conducted: the first one when the hives/nests were settled on the field (T0) and a second sampling session after the potential effect of agricultural intensification (T1). Using a dataset of more than 7238 wings, we measured the wing size, shape and asymmetry. We observed that, in several countries, a shift in most of the morphological traits occurred between T0 and T1. When focusing on the drivers of phenotypic variation in T1, the levels of significance for some potential drivers were sometimes high, while most of the variation remained unexplained. The latitude and, more rarely, grassland cover were found to partly explain the wing modifications. In light of these results, we conclude that phenotypic shifts can occur in a very short period, after encountering new field conditions. Further studies should be conducted to better understand which alternative drivers could explain morphological changes in the agro-ecosystem after crop exposition, as well as the potential consequences of these changes on foraging performance or pollination efficiency.

AB The scope of the present work has covered the area located at the east coast of Bahrain along the Askar coast associated with depth mostly < 10 m, extending for approximately 5Km. This coastal area is sub-jected to several sources of industrial and domestic pollution. The marine survey was conducted in May 2018 within an area of-5.27 km(2) covering the intertidal and subtidal zones. A drop-down video camera (DDV) was used within an equidistant station grid spaced by 300 m and entailed 69 stations. SCUBA diving was performed at eight locations representing different biotopes for qualitative and quan-titative analysis based on epi-benthic flora and fauna. Five biotopes were identified representing silty sand, silty sand with seagrass, mud, rock with sand veneer and macroalgae. A lack of conspicuous flora and fauna characterized most of the sites investigated. The seagrass habitat was found to be of less cover across the study area represented by patchy forms (<1%). The high concentration of alluvium discharged by the sand wash plant heavily impacted the water clarity, where fine particles were driven by currents during the ebb cycle toward the Askar coast. The DDV survey showed that most of the bottom layers are turbid and numerous dead bivalve shells of Pinctada sp. were observed. The current monitoring program needs to be rescheduled to cover further locations to minimize the vulnerability of traditional fisheries. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Large-carnivore populations have experienced significant declines in the past centuries in extended parts of the world. Habitat loss, fragmentation, and depletion of natural resources are some of the main causes of this decline. Consequently, behavioral flexibility, enabling the exploitation of anthropogenic food resources in highly disturbed human-dominated landscapes, is becoming critical for the survival of large carnivores. These behavioral changes increase the potential for human-large carnivore conflict and can further intensify carnivore persecution. Here, we examine how land cover types (representing a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance) alter the behavior of striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) in a human-dominated landscape in Israel, and whether differences in life history between males and females affect their reaction to such disturbances and consequently their level of exposure to humans. We used a Hidden Markov Model on GPS-tracking data for seven striped hyenas to segment individual-night trajectories into behavioral states (resting, searching, and traveling). We then used multinomial logistic regression to model hyenas' behavioral state as a function of the interaction between land cover and sex. Females traveled less than males both in terms of average distance traveled per hour, per night, and nightly net displacement. Most steps were classified as "searching" for females and as "traveling" for males. Female hyenas spent a higher proportion of time in human-dominated areas and a lower proportion in natural areas compared to males, and they were also more likely to be found close to settlements than males. Females changed their time allocation between natural and human-dominated areas, spending more time resting than traveling in natural areas but not in human-dominated ones; males spent more time searching than resting in human-dominated areas but were equally likely to rest or search in natural ones. The differences in life history between male and female hyenas may reflect different motivations for space use as a means to optimize fitness, which affects their exposure to humans and therefore their potential involvement in human-hyenas conflict.

AB Species adjust their behavior and life-history to adapt to local environmental conditions. Species with a broad ecological niche often show signatures of local adaptations to different environment, particularly in extreme ones. Here, we investigate local adaptation in different populations of the North African Sahara frog (Pelophylax saharicus) living in various environmental conditions that vary mostly in temperature, precipitation, and elevation by mean of common garden experiment aiming to estimate the growth rate under two predation treatments (absence or presence of non-lethal cues of dragonfly larvae). First, we found an elevational cline in the reproductive phenology where, from low to high elevation, the reproductive season shifts to later dates, whereas that in arid environment was later than all other populations. We suggest that geographic differences in temperature and rainfall (in arid areas) explain this phenological pattern. Second, hatching success was overall high but showed a slight decline across elevation. Third, growth rate was generally faster in low and intermediate elevation populations, but slower in high elevation and arid environment populations. Populations in low and intermediate elevation responded to predation by reducing growth rate and the size at metamorphosis, but no predatory responses were recorded in high elevation and arid environment populations. Our study shows some life history signatures of local adaptation of P. saharicus in Northeast Algeria, which does not go in line with recent genetic analysis showing low population differentiation in the region.

AB The South Sandwich Islands (SSI), a chain of volcanic islands in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, are home to two large notothenoid species: the Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides and the Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni. Both species support valuable fisheries throughout the Southern Ocean under management of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The SSI region, which is located south of the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, has a diverse and distinct biodiversity and it represents a range edge for the distribution of both toothfish species. In this paper we have updated and expanded previous biological analyses with recent data, explored the stock hypotheses and links of these species to other regions, and investigated the role of the SSI archipelago in the life cycles of both toothfish species, where they overlap in their distribution. We conclude that Patagonian toothfish around the SSI are linked to the adjacent South Georgia population, but have some unique characteristics, including faster growth and better somatic condition, possibly reflecting ???Bergmann???s rule??? which states that body size increases with decreasing temperature and increasing latitude. By comparison, the Antarctic toothfish at the SSI appear to be the northern extent of a larger stock connecting further south towards the Antarctic continent. Finally, we consider the relative importance of the SSI in the life cycle of both species, including in the context of climatic changes to this region.

AB Changes in composition of phytoplankton communities cause drastic changes in functioning of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we hypothesized that the shifts in composition of the phytoplankton community of Lake Kinneret induced notable shifts in the relationship between primary production and decomposition of organic matter in the lake ecosystem. To test this, we created an approach based on a statistical analysis of long-term dynamics of diversity indices and their relationships with potential perturbations: changes in lake water level, nutrient loads, and annual average epilimnetic temperature. Biodiversity of the algal community was estimated using Simpson's Diversity Index and community-weighted mean trait value (functional diversity index). Specific community respiration and photosynthesis assimilation number were considered as the functional traits characterizing the role of phytoplankton in cycling organic matter. The observed temporal trends in the diversity indices provided estimates of the shift in the biotic community from large, relatively faster aerobic decomposing and slower photosynthesizing producers towards slower aerobic decomposing and faster photosynthesizing producers. These trends were confirmed by the results of direct determination of community respiration and (indirectly) by the reduced microbial activity in the epilimnetic waters of the lake.

AB Life-history theory suggests that the optimal reproductive effort of an organism is affected by factors such as energy acquisition and predation risk. The observation that some organisms actively search for their prey and others ambush them creates the expectation of different energy needs and predation risk associated with each foraging behaviour, the so-called 'foraging-mode paradigm'. Although this paradigm has been around for decades, the empirical evidence consists of conflicting results derived from competing models based on different mechanisms. For instance, models within the foraging-mode paradigm suggest that widely foraging females have evolved low reproductive effort, because a heavy reproductive load decreases their ability to escape from predators. By contrast, a long-standing prediction of evolutionary theory indicates that organisms subject to high extrinsic mortality, should invest more in reproduction. Here, we present the first partial evidence that widely foraging species have evolved greater reproductive effort than have sit-and-wait species, which we attribute to a larger body size and greater mortality among mobile foragers. According to our findings, we propose a theoretical model that could explain the observed pattern in lizards, suggesting ways for evolutionary ecologists to test mechanistic hypotheses at the intraspecific level.

AB Background Diet is a key component of a species ecological niche and plays critical roles in guiding the trajectories of evolutionary change. Previous studies suggest that dietary evolution can influence the rates and patterns of species diversification, with omnivorous (animal and plant, 'generalist') diets slowing down diversification compared to more restricted ('specialist') herbivorous and carnivorous diets. This hypothesis, here termed the "dietary macroevolutionary sink" hypothesis (DMS), predicts that transitions to omnivorous diets occur at higher rates than into any specialist diet, and omnivores are expected to have the lowest diversification rates, causing an evolutionary sink into a single type of diet. However, evidence for the DMS hypothesis remains conflicting. Here, we present the first test of the DMS hypothesis in a lineage of ectothermic tetrapods-the prolific Liolaemidae lizard radiation from South America. Results Ancestral reconstructions suggest that the stem ancestor was probably insectivorous. The best supported trait model is a diet-dependent speciation rate, with independent extinction rates. Herbivory has the highest net diversification rate, omnivory ranks second, and insectivory has the lowest. The extinction rate is the same for all three diet types and is much lower than the speciation rates. The highest transition rate was from omnivory to insectivory, and the lowest transition rates were between insectivory and herbivory. Conclusions Our findings challenge the core prediction of the DMS hypothesis that generalist diets represent an 'evolutionary sink'. Interestingly, liolaemid lizards have rapidly and successfully proliferated across some of the world's coldest climates (at high elevations and latitudes), where species have evolved mixed arthropod-plant (omnivore) or predominantly herbivore diets. This longstanding observation is consistent with the higher net diversification rates found in both herbivory and omnivory. Collectively, just like the evolution of viviparity has been regarded as a 'key adaptation' during the liolaemid radiation across cold climates, our findings suggest that transitions from insectivory to herbivory (bridged by omnivory) are likely to have played a role as an additional key adaptation underlying the exceptional diversification of these reptiles across extreme climates.

AB Superfetation, the ability to carry several overlapping broods at different developmental stages, has evolved independently multiple times within the live-bearing fish family Poeciliidae. Even though superfetation is widespread among poeciliids, its evolutionary advantages remain unclear. Theory predicts that superfetation should increase polyandry by increasing the probability that temporally overlapping broods are fertilized by different fathers. Here, we test this key prediction in two poeciliid species that each carry two temporally overlapping broods: Poeciliopsis retropinna and P. turrubarensis. We collected 25 females per species from freshwater streams in South-Eastern Costa Rica and assessed multiple paternity by genotyping all their embryos (420 embryos for P. retropinna; 788 embryos for P. turrubarensis) using existing and newly developed microsatellite markers. We observed a high frequency of unique sires in the simultaneous, temporally overlapping broods in P. retropinna (in 56% of the pregnant females) and P. turrubarensis (79%). We found that the mean number of sires within females was higher than the number of sires within the separate broods (2.92 sires within mothers vs. 2.36 within separate broods in P. retropinna; and 3.40 vs 2.56 in P. turrubarensis). We further observed that there were significant differences in the proportion of offspring sired by each male in 42% of pregnant female P. retropinna and 65% of female P. turrubarensis; however, this significance applied to only 9% and 46% of the individual broods in P. retropinna and P. turrubarensis, respectively, suggesting that the unequal reproductive success of sires (i.e. reproductive skew) mostly originated from differences in paternal contribution between, rather than within broods. Together, these findings tentatively suggest that superfetation may promote polyandry and reproductive skew in live-bearing fishes.

AB Much of life-history theory rests on fundamental assumptions about constraints on the acquisition and allocation of energy to growth and reproduction. In general, the allocation of energy to reproduction depends on maternal size, which in turn depends on environmental factors experienced throughout the life of the mother. Here, we used phylogenetic path analyses to evaluate competing hypotheses about the environmental and maternal drivers of reproductive traits in lizards. In doing so, we discovered that precipitation, rather than temperature, has shaped the evolution of the life history. Specifically, environments with greater rainfall have enabled the evolution of larger maternal size. In turn, these larger mothers produce larger clutches of larger offspring. However, annual precipitation has a negative direct effect on offspring size, despite the positive indirect effect mediated by maternal size. Possibly, the evolution of offspring size was driven by the need to conserve water in dry environments, because small organisms are particularly sensitive to water loss. Since we found that body size variation among lizards is related to a combination of climatic factors, mainly precipitation and perhaps primary production, our study challenges previous generalizations (e.g., temperature-size rule and Bergmann's rule) and suggests alternative mechanisms underlying the evolution of body size.

AB Captive rearing is commonly used to support efforts to restore extirpated or diminished wild populations. Many rearing programs include antipredator training in an effort to reduce post-release mortality due to predation, but the value such training adds to restoration efforts is not fully understood. Analyses of antipredator training impacts often focus on changes in prey following training and not the actual effects when prey are exposed to predators. Studies also commonly assess prey traits instead of fitness. However, changes in prey following training may not translate to desired increase in fitness upon release for a self-sustaining population. To consider these relationships, we identified studies that analyzed changes in organisms following both training and lethal exposure to predators. Notably, we identified only 12 studies that analyzed outcomes in both training and lethal exposure settings and found the majority of measurements focused on traits. Although meta-analysis indicated that antipredator training changed prey traits and increased prey survival, relationships between changes in traits and fitness could not be assessed given the rarity of studies that included both outcomes. While these results support the general use of antipredator training, they also suggest that trait changes cannot be reliably used as proxies for fitness impacts. Future work should seek to more clearly measure impacts on fitness and determine when changes in traits can truly be used as a surrogate for training efficacy. These issues reflect recent concerns regarding research on non-consumptive effects and highlight potential avenues for future collaborative research on fear.

AB Aim An assessment method that can precisely represent human-vectored long-distance dispersals (HVLDD) is currently in need for the effective management of invasive species. Here, we focussed on HVLDD happening along roads and proposed a path-finding algorithm as a more precise dispersal assessment tool than the most widely used Euclidean distance method by using pine wilt disease (PWD) as a case study. Location Busan Metropolitan City, Republic of Korea. Methods A path-finding algorithm, which calculates distances by considering the spatial distribution of road networks, was tested for its effectiveness in estimating dispersal distances of HVLDD events. To this end, annual HVLDD cases were classified from entire PWD occurrence data from 2016 to 2019, and their dispersal distances were calculated using the path-finding algorithm and the Euclidean distance method. We constructed potential dispersal ranges based on the occurrence points in 2016, 2017 and 2018 using the respective year's mean dispersal distance for both methods, and their performances in accounting for each subsequent year's HVLDD cases were compared to determine which method calculated more precise distances. The information on which road class contributed more to dispersal occurrences and distances was analysed as well using the proposed algorithm. Results The potential dispersal ranges of the path-finding algorithm accounted for more future anthropogenic infection cases than the ones that used the Euclidean distance method, validating its higher functionality. It also revealed that most HVLDDs started and ended on small roads, and large roads constituted the majority of the total dispersal length. Main conclusions The path-finding algorithm has proven to be a more effective dispersal assessment method for HVLDD events. It can help design effective control strategies. Thus, we encourage using the path-finding algorithm for the dispersal assessment of invasive species that move along road networks, and for the development of more powerful HVLDD prediction models.

AB The hypersaline Dead Sea and its sediments are natural laboratories for studying extremophile microorganism habitat response to environmental change. In modern times, increased freshwater runoff to the lake surface waters resulted in stratification and dilution of the upper water column followed by microbial blooms. However, whether these events facilitated a microbial response in the deep lake and sediments is obscure. Here we investigate archived evidence of microbial processes and changing regional hydroclimate conditions by reconstructing deep Dead Sea chemical compositions from pore fluid major ion concentration and stable S, O, and C isotopes, together with lipid biomarkers preserved in the hypersaline deep Dead Sea ICDP-drilled core sediments dating to the early Holocene (ca. 10,000 years BP). Following a significant negative lake water balance resulting in salt layer deposits at the start of the Holocene, there was a general period of positive net water balance at 9500-8300 years BP. The pore fluid isotopic composition of sulfate exhibit evidence of intensified microbial sulfate reduction, where both delta 34S and delta 18O of sulfate show a sharp increase from estimated base values of 15.0 parts per thousand and 13.9 parts per thousand to 40.2 parts per thousand and 20.4 parts per thousand, respectively, and a delta 34S vs. delta 18O slope of 0.26. The presence of the n-C-17 alkane biomarker in the sediments suggests an increase of cyanobacteria or phytoplankton contribution to the bulk organic matter that reached the deepest parts of the Dead Sea. Although hydrologically disconnected, both the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea microbial ecosystems responded to increased freshwater runoff during the early Holocene, with the former depositing the organic-rich sapropel 1 layer due to anoxic water column conditions. In the Dead Sea prolonged positive net water balance facilitated primary production and algal blooms in the upper waters and intensified microbial sulfate reduction in the hypolimnion and/or at the sediment-brine interface.

AB Blood oxygen-carrying capacity is shaped both by the ambient oxygen availability as well as species-specific oxygen demand. Erythrocytes are a critical part of oxygen transport and both their size and shape can change in relation to species-specific life-history, behavioural or ecological conditions. Here, we test whether components of the environment (altitude), life history (reproductive mode, body temperature) and behaviour (diving, foraging mode) drive erythrocyte size variation in the Lepidosauria (lizards, snakes and rhynchocephalians). We collected data on erythrocyte size (area) and shape (L/W: elongation ratio) from Lepidosauria across the globe (N = 235 species). Our analyses show the importance of oxygen requirements as a driver of erythrocyte size. Smaller erythrocytes were associated with the need for faster delivery (active foragers, high-altitude species, warmer body temperatures), whereas species with greater oxygen demands (diving species, viviparous species) had larger erythrocytes. Erythrocyte size shows considerable cross-species variation, with a range of factors linked to the oxygen delivery requirements being major drivers of these differences. A key future aspect for study would include within-individual plasticity and how changing states, for example, pregnancy, perhaps alter the size and shape of erythrocytes in Lepidosaurs.

AB The Persian Gulf is positioned in the heart of the Middle East as one of the most critical water bodies. Indian Ocean humpback dolphins (Sousa plumbea) are distributed in nearshore waters and are therefore highly vulnerable to a variety of anthropogenic pressures. To our knowledge, there is a little information and data available about habitat use and abundance of this endangered species in Iranian waters. In the present study, baseline data about population size and site fidelity of Indian Ocean humpback dolphins in the Dayer-Nakhiloo Marine National Park in Northern Persian Gulf, Iran, has been explored for the first time. From March 2014 to December 2018, 127 boat-based surveys and 6436 km of survey effort were conducted. Overall, 127 groups of humpback dolphins were observed on 62% of the surveys. Humpback dolphin group size ranged from 1 to 14 individuals (mean 5.8 +/- SE 0.3). Abundance estimates were calculated and fitted with open population models. Thirty (95% CI 22-38) humpback dolphins were estimated to inhabit the study area. There was a lack of seasonality in the occurrence of humpback dolphins and strong site fidelity within the Dayer-Nakhiloo Marine National Park. Most of the identified individuals used the study zone regularly (79.5%), while a smaller number were present less often. The results of this study provide important baseline information about humpback dolphin ecology in an area subject to significant anthropogenic pressures which can help to take effective conservation and management measures.

AB Turn alternation (TA) is the tendency to turn in the opposite direction of an immediately preceding turn when moving forward, resulting in an overall linear trajectory. TA has been observed in many animals, and terrestrial isopods are considered model organisms for studying TA. Optimizing their fleeing speed and trajectory helps isopods efficiently escape from predatory threats. However, since reproduction induces morphological and physiological changes, individuals might adjust their trajectories depending on their altered mobility. In this study, we investigated the effect of reproduction-related factors on the frequency of TA, which enables linearity, in the common rough woodlouse Porcellio scaber. The results showed that breeding females enhanced their linearity more than nonbreeding females and males. Furthermore, females without access to a potential mate enhanced their linearity more than females and males with access to a potential mate and maintained a high linearity for approximately 40 days. In terrestrial isopods, continuous TA for linearity may be used to avoid reproductive failure because of lack of encounters with the potential mate or to compensate for low running ability due to physical or physiological loads. Conversely, individuals that do not need to worry about reproductive failures or individuals with small loads could perform the random turn that does not require learning or memory. This is the first study to show that the events involved in reproduction affect the linearity shown by continuous TA in terrestrial isopods.

AB Sirenians have a unique ecological function in coastal ecosystems, deserving special conservation attention. The West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) is globally classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN. In Brazil, where the species was intensively hunted in the past and currently faces several threats, it was classified as Endangered during the last national assessment published in 2014. Here, we generated information based on available data to assess the species extinction risk in Brazil using IUCN regional guidelines, applying all criteria, and choosing the highest category of risk. Abundance at the national level was projected considering the density estimated in Ceara and Rio Grande do Norte states and the Criterion B EOO (Extent of Occurrence) estimated in this study (34,899 km(2)) and resulted in 1,047 individuals (95% CI: 538-2,038). Six scenarios of annual mortality were inferred and suspected based on evidence. We adopted a simple discrete logistic growth model to project population reduction in the past and future (three generations - 69 years) in 18 scenarios. Among the 18 projected scenarios, four resulted in extinction, six in decline and eight in population growth. Considering the low abundance bound, all scenarios indicate a reduction larger than 80% in population size, classifying the species as 'Critically Endangered' based on A4de. Reduction in EOO and abundance in the past classify the species as 'Endangered' based onA2c. The suspected number of mature animals (607;95% CI: 312-1,182) and the projected decline higher than 20% in two generations also classify the species as 'Endangered' based on C1 and 'Vulnerable' under D1. Our results indicate that information can be generated to produce more accurate assessments based on available data. The species national extinction risk needs to be reassessed, and the National Action Plan effectiveness evaluated.

AB Large grazing mammals should negatively affect forage biomass of their food supply, but documentation is lacking in free ranging populations. Furthermore, complications from factors such as weather patterns and spatial heterogeneity might obscure grazing effects on the food supply. We examined influences of Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti (Merriam, 1897)) abundance and precipitation on forage biomass at two spatial scales; meadows that contained most of the food supply, and sectors nested in meadows. Spatial heterogeneity in forage biomass might also decline with increasing elk abundance. Elk abundance was estimated from population counts and varied 3.9-fold across the 15 years of study in northwestern California, USA. Each January, early in the growing season, we estimated forage biomass in the 50-ha meadow complex used by the elk population. Measures of palatable forage cover and height were taken in 270 1/4 m(2) plots dispersed throughout sectors. These measurements were then related to dried forage biomass. At both spatial scales, elk abundance was inversely, and precipitation was positively related to forage biomass. At the sector scale, analysis of a linear mixed effect model indicated heterogeneity. In some sectors both predictors were related to forage biomass and in other sectors they were not. Heterogeneity was not from uneven elk grazing as elk grazed sectors in proportion to forage biomass. The varied elk abundance-forage biomass relationships across sectors indicated that spatial heterogeneity declined with increasing elk abundance. Detecting relationships between free ranging ungulate populations and biomass of their food supply is not straightforward.

AB Objectives Geographic variation is an important feature among primates, but the mechanisms underlying it are not well understood. Macaques are geographically widespread and have been translocated to captive populations, providing a prime opportunity to evaluate changes in cranial form in response to a novel environment. Clinal variation was assessed among wild fascicularis-group macaques and compared to two translocated populations to explore the relative contributions of developmental plasticity and microevolutionary forces in producing geographic variation in cranial form. Materials and Methods Forty-five 3D coordinates over the cranium were taken on 380 wild macaques and 56 captive Macaca mulatta from Cayo Santiago, PR and Beaverton, OR. Geographic shape, represented by the singular warp scores from a two-block partial least squares analysis, and centroid size were regressed against latitude, mean annual temperature, and mean annual precipitation among wild macaques. The two captive populations were compared to wild M. mulatta to assess potential changes in cranial form. Results Size and geographic shape were highly correlated with latitude in wild macaques, but neither ecological variable was important across the entire cline. Precipitation was important for shape only outside the tropics. Translocated M. mulatta are significantly larger, but not different in shape, compared to wild M. mulatta. Discussion These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating cranial form is latitudinally variable among fascicularis-group macaques, but the potential drivers remain unclear. Size is highly plastic while geographic shape has evolved differentiation at interpopulation and interspecific levels. Variation in cranial morphology likely arises first in size, followed relatively rapidly by evolved modifications to shape.

AB Besides preventing deterioration, conservation also prevents the proliferation of pathogens that cause diseases in those who work in laboratories. This research aimed to evaluate the color of the bone marrow of chemically prepared dog corpses, seeking to determine whether long-term preservation maintains their original morphological aspect. Fifty cadavers of adult dogs were used. The control group (G0) consisted of fresh corpses; the others were fixed in curing salt solution (20% sodium chloride, 1% nitrite, and 1% sodium nitrate) (120 ml/Kg) and ethanol with 5% glycerin (120 ml/Kg). Cadavers were assessed at 30 days (G30), 60 days (G60), 90 days(G90), and 120 days (G120). In addition, two veterinary observers evaluated the long bones' bone marrow during a biomechanical compression test after a fracture. Qualitative bone marrow color variables were transformed into scores, in which 0=excellent (more vivid than fresh cadaver), 1=good (similar to G0), 2=poor (darker than G0), and 3 congruent to bad (rotten appearance, brownish). By Dunn's test, the bone marrow of the bones was better at 30 days when compared to G0 (G0>G30), G0 G60 and G0<90, and G0 provided a better bone marrow aspect between 30 to 60 days after fixation.

AB Context Identifying factors driving patterns of species communities in heterogenous human-dominated landscapes remains elusive despite extensive research. Biodiversity is thought to decrease with habitat modification, as sensitive species are lost. Conversely, diversity has also been shown increase at moderate levels of landscape modification where greater habitat heterogeneity supports a diverse suite of species. Objectives We explore patterns of avian diversity and abundance in heterogenous landscapes using a novel integration of multiple dimensional gradients of human-mediated modification. Methods We attempt to identify aspects of landscape heterogeneity driving patterns of avian diversity and abundance in agro-urban-rural systems. Specifically, we utilize an intuitive multi-dimensional gradient distinguishing between two axes of human-influence, variation in the built environment (hard-soft) and in agricultural development (green-brown). We use these as covariates in community N-mixture models to describe variation in species abundance and diversity. Results Avian richness was greatest in more heterogeneous regions of the landscape. Responses of individual species were variable, with sensitive species declining, while generalist species increased, leading to higher overall diversity in human-dominated regions. Conclusions Species abundance and diversity is maximized in more heterogeneous parts of landscape mosaics. By characterizing distinct axes of human influence that capture spectrum of land use, we can identify differential effects confounded in traditional landscape metrics. Critically, we demonstrate that multi-dimensional landscape gradients provide a more nuanced understanding of how patterns of biodiversity emerge. Acknowledging that biodiversity is not always negatively impacted by habitat modification offers encouraging insight to guide conservation and management in human-dominated landscapes.

AB The late Neogene megatooth shark, Otodus megalodon, is known mainly from its gigantic teeth and possibly reached 18-20 m in total length (TL). We re-examine the previously proposed body size trends and nursery areas of O. megalodon by confining the previously used samples to upper anterior teeth offering more reliable TL estimates, and by taking paleolatitudes and sea-surface temperatures into consideration. We demonstrate that individuals of O. megalodon are on average larger in cooler water than those in warmer water - a pattern attributable to Bergmann's rule showing a latitudinal body size gradient at least for the eastern Pacific late Miocene and the western Atlantic early Pliocene assemblages. While it is still possible that neonatal O. megalodon could have utilised nursery areas, the previously identified paleo-nursery areas based on body size may reflect temperature-dependent trends rather than the inferred reproductive strategy. Thus, the gigantism of O. megalodon in cooler waters was possibly further enhanced by its cooler environment. If so, the corollary of this study is that not all populations of O. megalodon likely grew to gigantic sizes equally, where the common notion that the species reached 18-20 m TL should be applied primarily to populations in cooler environments.

AB High levels of within-individual variation (WIV) in reiterative components in plants such as leaves, flowers, and fruits have been shown to increase individual fitness by multiple mechanisms including mediating interactions with natural enemies. This relationship between WIV and fitness has been studied almost exclusively in plant systems. While animals do not exhibit conspicuous reiterative components, they have traits that can vary at the individual level such as erythrocyte size. It is currently unknown if WIV in animals can influence individual fitness by mediating the outcome of interactions with natural enemies as it has been shown in plants. To address this issue, we tested for a relationship between WIV in erythrocyte size, hemoparasite infection status, and body condition (a proxy for fitness) in a Caribbean anole lizard. We quantified the coefficient of variation of adult erythrocytes size in $n = 95$ infected and $n = 107$ non-infected lizards. We found higher degrees of erythrocyte size variation in infected lizards than in non-infected individuals. However, we found no significant relationship between infection status or erythrocyte size variation, and lizard body condition. These results suggest that higher WIV in erythrocyte size in infected lizards is not necessarily adaptive but likely a consequence of the host response to infection. Many hemoparasites destroy their host cells as part of their life cycle. To compensate, the host lizard may respond by increasing production of erythrocytes resulting in higher WIV. Our results emphasize the need to better understand the role of within-animal variation as a neglected driver or consequence of ecological and evolutionary interactions.

AB Monospecific pine forests ar e widespread due to extensive afforestation efforts and natural colonization of abandoned croplands in the Mediterranean Basin . It was originally thought that pines would facilitate the natural colonization of native late-successional resprouter species (e.g., hardwoods), but these species can be compro-mised if competition with pines outweighs their facilitative effect on these hardwood species. Managing the density or canopy cover of these widespread pine forests can potentially provide some "optimum" balance be-tween facilitation and competition to maximize success in the introduction of late successional species while maintaining a tree stratum. We tested the response (survival and growth across 10 years) of six resprouter species covering a wide range of plant functional strategies, from drought-tolerant sclerophyllous shrubs and trees to malacophyllous drought-sensitive trees, across an experimental gradient of Aleppo pine canopy cover. Seedling performance varied according to the functional strategy, pine cover and time. High pine cover generally enhanced seedling survival , whereas moderate pine cover generally enhanced seedlin g growth, although this response was modulated by the functional strategy of the seedling species. Interactions between pines and seedlings were only detectable 2-3 years after plantation, increasing in intensity with time. The latter highlights the need of medium to long-term studies to evaluate plant-plant interactions in these water-limited environments with slow successional trajectories. Ou r results could be attributed to the shade tolerance of most of the intro-duced trees, combined with their low tolerance to the combination of high sunlight radiation and drought. We found an optimal pine cover of ca. 50% (equivalent to 300-400 trees/ha) in which both survival and growth of late successional species can be maximized, which help to select best locations for more efficient reforestation programs and set a threshold value to decide whether or not to perform tree thinning to enhance ecosystem diversity and, subsequently, resilience.

AB In this study, a North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR)-based climate dataset of wind and Pasquill stability class is developed for the North American Great Lakes region. Motivated by the need to update the limited wind and Pasquill stability class climatology previously incorporated into a livestock odour nuisance-mitigation application used in Michigan, this study is motivated more generally by the lack of a long-term climate dataset suitable for studies of atmospheric dispersion in the Great Lakes region. As a preliminary step, NARR 10-m wind speed, 10-m wind direction, and 2-m temperature are evaluated at eight weather stations in Michigan and northern Indiana, and the wind speed variable is subsequently bias-corrected. To derive a Pasquill stability class dataset from the NARR variables, an existing empirical relationship between Pasquill stability class and Richardson number is applied to a previously developed NARR-derived Richardson number dataset covering the period 1979-2008. Pasquill stability class frequency in NARR is subsequently evaluated using observations at two flux towers in Illinois. Although a tendency is noted for the NARR-derived Pasquill stability class dataset to underestimate the frequency of stable and unstable conditions, and overestimate the frequency of neutral conditions, the analysis shows that the 10-m wind speed bias-correction procedure yields a frequency distribution that is in better agreement with the observations than the non-bias-corrected dataset. Finally, an analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of livestock odour dispersion potential in Michigan is provided as an example application of the NARR-based wind and Pasquill stability class climate dataset.

AB Taxonomical and functional facets of diversity are crucial to understanding the effects of landscape trans-formation on species assemblages, although there is a lack of consensus on the degree of congruence between diversity indices across land-uses. We evaluated the effect of natural and anthropogenic land cover types on anurans in the Andean region of Colombia. Changes between land cover types were detected but no effect of climatic season on the structu r e of anuran assemblages. Species with larger body sizes showed a greater affinity for anthropogenic land cover types. We analyzed the functional facet of diversity (based on diet and morpho-logical traits) and discovered that the degree of congruence with taxonomic diversity metrics changed when comparing different land cover types. We evidenced a strong effect of the type of vegetation cover on the Hi l l numbers (from zero to third orders) for functional diversity but not for the other taxonomic diversity indices. Of a l l the diversity metrics evaluated, we found that Rao's quadratic entropy, functional dispersion, and average functional diversity were the most sensitive indices to land-use change. Surprisingly, the surrounding of houses, the land cover type with the greater degree of anthropogenic intervention had the higher values of functional diversity, suggesting broader types of species ' resource acquisition. These results suggest the importance of landscape mosaics in the conservation of different facets of anuran diversity. We also emphasize the importance of measuring anuran functional traits to understand more comprehensively the effects of landscape trans-formation at the assemblage level and to appropriately direct conservation and management actions.

AB Animals, humans, and organizations are known to adjust how (much) they explore complex environments that exceed their information processing capacity, rather than relentlessly search for the optimal action. The adjusted depth of exploration is supposed to depend on the aspiration level internal to the agent. This action selection tendency is known as satisficing. The Risk-sensitive Satisficing (RS) model implements satisficing in the reinforcement learning framework through conversion of action values into gains (or losses) relative to the aspiration level. The risk-sensitive evaluation of action values by RS has been shown to be effective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, first we analyze RS in comparison with UCB and Thompson sampling algorithms. We also show that RS shows differential risk-attitudes considering the risks. Then we propose the Softsatisficing policy that is a stochastic equivalent of RS and further analyze the exploratory behavior of risk-sensitive satisficing that RS and Softsatisficing implement. We emphasize that Softsatisficing has the potential of modeling risk-sensitive foraging and other decision-making behaviors by humans, animals, and organizations.

AB Determining how climate affects biotic interactions can improve understanding of drivers of context-dependence and inform predictions of how interactions may influence plants under future climates. In arid environments, the community-level impacts of seed predators may depend strongly on aridity; yet, long-term studies documenting impacts of granivores on plant communities over variable climate conditions remain scarce. We evaluated how rodent exclusion interacted with climate to influence grassland and shrubland forb communities and the community-scale distribution of seed mass over 15 years in the climatically variable northern Chihuahuan Desert. In this dynamic system, two seasonally distinct plant community phases occur annually, one in spring and the other during the summer monsoon. Rodent exclusion significantly altered the community composition of monsoon season plant communities in both grassland and shrubland, but did not affect spring plant composition. Rodents suppressed the abundance of larger-seeded forb species and promoted smaller-seeded species. As a consequence, rodent exclusion increased community seed mass (CWM) in monsoon forb communities, most strongly in grassland. The magnitude of impacts of rodents on seed mass varied substantially from year-to-year, tracking variation in climate. Specifically, rodent exclusion increased community mean seed mass the most in dry years (grassland) or in years following dry years (shrubland). Rodent exclusion had relatively weak effects on plant species diversity and richness. Our results indicate that climate interacts with the presence of rodents to structure not only the composition but also the traits of desert plant communities.

AB Island rule describes the graded trend of gigantism in small-bodied species to dwarfism in large-bodied species inhabiting islands, but causal explanations remain unresolved. We used geometric morphometrics to quantify cranial morphology of 544 meadow vole Microtus pennsylvanicus samples across 11 island and 3 mainland populations from the Outer Lands of New England (Atlantic) and the Alexander Archipelago of Alaska (Pacific). We compared the thermoregulation and endurance (TRE) and ecological release (ER) hypotheses using all-subsets linear models employing residual randomization permutation procedures (rrpp), and Akaike information criterion (AIC) for model selection. We decoupled direct and indirect effects of island variables on size using path analysis. We evaluated shape with principal components analysis (PCA) and Procrustes ANOVA on Procrustes shape coordinates, then assessed the impact of static allometry and TRE and ER variables on shape. Six Atlantic island populations exhibit significant signals of gigantism with the largest voles occurring on the smallest islands lacking predators. ER explains 63% of cranial size differences. Island area has a significant total effect on size by influencing the number of mammalian predators, resulting in a 0.011 increase in unit centroid size for a 100 km(2) decrease in island area. This corresponds to a predicted 0.9% change in size for every 100 km(2). Given static allometry, cranial shape does not respond to insularity independent of size. These results suggest that island rule is a latent evolutionary process whose manifestation depends on nuanced biogeographic and ecological contexts that have important conservation and taxonomic implications.

TI Predation of a Juvenile Iguana rhinolopha (Squamata: Iguanidae) by
   Basiliscus plumifrons (Squamata: Corytophanidae) in the Costa Rican
   Rainforest
SO CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Lizards play key roles in ecosystems where they are prey for a wide variety of predators, including snakes, other lizards, mammals, birds, and invertebrates. The Green Basilisk (Basiliscus plumifrons; Squamata: Iguania: Corytophanidae) and the Green Iguana (Iguana rhinolopha; Squamata: Iguania: Iguanidae) are two large lizards usually found sympatrically in the lowland humid forests of Central America, and show the same diurnal, arboreal habits; both species are found near bodies of water. Male Green Iguanas can reach two meters in length; females up to 1.4 m. This species possesses a notable crest of comb-like spines along the neck, back, and tail, and a greatly enlarged smooth scale on the side of the throat. It is green, particularly so the juvenile individuals, and they commonly develop darker wavy transverse dorsal crossbands. The Green Basilisk can exceed 0.9 m in total length, although females are shorter. The coloration is emerald green with strikingly yellow eyes and conspicuous crests are present on the head, dorsum, and tail. This species feeds mainly on insects and other arthropods, but it also consumes flowers and fruits and occasionally eats vertebrates such as small lizards. On July 11, 2022 at 09:36 h we observed an adult Green Basilisk preying on a young Green Iguana at Selva Verde Lodge, located in tropical wet forest in northern Costa Rica. Herein, we present the details of this event in the context of lizard predatory encounters.

ID VOLTAGE COLLAPSE; SYSTEMS
AB Detecting critical transitions before they occur is challenging, especially for complex dynamical systems. While some early-warning indicators have been suggested to capture the phenomenon of slowing down in the system's response near critical transitions, their applicability to real systems is yet limited. In this paper, we propose the concept of predictability based on machine learning methods, which leads to an alternative early-warning indicator. The predictability metric takes a black-box approach and assesses the impact of uncertainties itself in identifying abrupt transitions in time series. We have applied the proposed metric to the time series generated from different systems, including an ecological model and an electric power system. We show that the predictability changes noticeably before critical transitions occur, while other general indicators such as variance and autocorrelation fail to make any notable signals.

AB Lagoa Salgada is a coastal hypersaline water body located in the north of Rio de Janeiro State and recognized by the presence of stromatolites. Cyanobacteria are the main primary producers of these structures in coastal hypersaline lagoons. The aim of the study was to identify the cyanobacteria present in Lagoa Salgada through metagenomics. The genetic material obtained from a water sample collected in June 2019 was submitted to sequencing by the shotgun method. The metagenomic data were analyzed using the MetaWrap version 1.3 pipeline to identify cyanobacteria and biological processes. The genus Synechococcus showed greater abundance, corresponding to 64.3% of the identified cyanobacteria, followed by Synechocystis (23.6%), Geminocystis (2%), and Calothrix (1.8%). The most abundant species were Synechococcus sp. RS9909 (46.7%), Synechocystis sp. PCC 6714 (16.4%), Synechococcus sp. WH 8101 (9.2%), Synechocystis sp. CACIAM 05 (4.3%). Thirty-three biological processes associated with genes present in the sample were identified. The Lagoa Salgada has a wide diversity of cyanobacteria in its aquatic ecosystem that is still little explored, justifying the need for protection and preservation of this lagoon environment.

AB Animals corpses in teaching and research institutions could be sources of infection for students and teachers when applied for dissection and surgical practice. This research aimed to evaluate cats' corpses' conservation using a new anatomic technique and vacuum package for seven days, aiming surgical practicing. A 150 mL/kg of alcohol with 5% glycerin and 120 mL/kg of a 20% sodium chloride, 1% nitrite, and 1% sodium nitrate solution was injected on corpses sealed in vacuum packages and put on 0 to 4 degrees C. Skin and jejunum were collected on day 0 (fresh samples/control), and traction analysis was performed for seven consecutive days. On the last day, the liquid in the plastic bags was microbiologically analyzed. There was no statistical difference between control and conservation moments (D1 and D2) in maximal rupture force of the skin, and jejunum was similar to control in D2, D4, and D6. The microbial population did not exceed 6.0x10(4)CFU/mL in total aerobics and 4.8x10(4)CFU/mL in total anaerobes. Biomechanics was not significantly affected, and the microbiological count was low during conservation, demonstrating the possible effectiveness of this anatomical technique for surgery training.

AB This study, which included examination of the distribution and life history and a stock assessment of the flathead lobster (Thenus orientalis), is the first of its kind in the waters of Saudi Arabia in the Arabian Gulf, also known as the Persian Gulf. The flathead lobster is widely distributed in this region, although it is more abundant in the central and northern Arabian Gulf. Carapace lengths at 50% and 95% maturity are 59 and 65 mm for females and 58 and 71 mm for males. The fecundity of 4 berried females ranged from 26,000 to 76,000 eggs per spawning, and the fertilization rate exceeded 97%. Length-frequency data were consistent with just 2 cohorts, indicating that this species has a short life span and high growth coefficient (K=0.846 year(-1)). Large fishing boats (called dhows) accounted for more than 98% of the total landings. Estimates of natural mortality rates from use of generalized depletion models have high statistical precision and a magnitude compatible with short life history. In addition, abundance levels estimated with the depletion model are sufficient to support a sustainable small-scale fishery either as bycatch of shrimp trawlers or as a resource targeted with specialized gear. A targeted fishery for flathead lobster could be set during the off months of the shrimp trawl fishery (February-July), reducing interference with the reproduction cycle.

AB Aim Species adapt differently to contrasting environments, such as open habitats with sparse vegetation and forested habitats with dense forest cover. We investigated colonization patterns in the open and forested environments in the diagonal of open formations and surrounding rain forests (i.e. Amazonia and Atlantic Forest) in Brazil, tested whether the diversification rates were affected by the environmental conditions and identified traits that enabled species to persist in those environments. Location South America, Brazil. Taxon Squamata, Lizards. Methods We used phylogenetic information and the current distribution of species in open and forested habitats to estimate ancestral ranges and identify range shifts relative to the current habitats. To evaluate whether these environments influenced species diversification, we tested 12 models using a Hidden Geographic State Speciation and Extinction analysis. Finally, we combined phylogenetic relatedness and species traits in a machine learning framework to identify the traits permitting adaptation in those contrasting environments. Results We identified 41 total transitions between open and forested habitats, of which 80% were from the forested habitats to the open habitats. Widely distributed species had higher speciation, turnover, extinction, and extinction fraction rates than species in forested or open habitats, but had also the lower net diversification rate. Mean body temperature, microhabitat, female snout-vent length and diet were identified as putative traits that enabled adaptation to different environments, and phylogenetic relatedness was an important predictor of species occurrence. Main conclusions Transitions from forested to open habitats are most common, highlighting the importance of habitat shift in current patterns of biodiversity. The combination of phylogenetic reconstruction of ancestral distributions and the machine learning framework enables us to integrate organismal trait data, environmental data and evolutionary history in a manner that could be applied on a global scale.

AB How will organisms cope when forced into warmer-than-preferred thermal environments? This is a key question facing our ability to monitor and manage biota as average annual temperatures increase, and is of particular concern for range-limited terrestrial species unable to track their preferred climatic envelope. Being ectothermic, desiccation prone, and often spatially restricted, island-inhabiting tropical amphibians exemplify this scenario. Pre-Anthropocene case studies of how insular amphibian populations responded to the enforced occupation of warmer-than-ancestral habitats may add a valuable, but currently lacking, perspective. We studied a population of frogs from the Seychelles endemic family Sooglossidae which, due to historic sea-level rise, have been forced to occupy a significantly warmer island (Praslin) than their ancestors and close living relatives. Evidence from thermal activity patterns, bioacoustics, body size distributions, and ancestral state estimations suggest that this population shifted its thermal niche in response to restricted opportunities for elevational dispersal. Relative to conspecifics, Praslin sooglossids also have divergent nuclear genotypes and call characters, a finding consistent with adaptation causing speciation in a novel thermal environment. Using an evolutionary perspective, our study reveals that some tropical amphibians have survived episodes of historic warming without the aid of dispersal and therefore may have the capacity to adapt to the currently warming climate. However, two otherwise co-distributed sooglossid species are absent from Praslin, and the deep evolutionary divergence between the frogs on Praslin and their closest extant relatives (similar to 8 million years) may have allowed for gradual thermal adaptation and speciation. Thus, local extinction is still a likely outcome for tropical frogs experiencing warming climates in the absence of dispersal corridors to thermal refugia.

AB Integration of ecological and evolutionary features has begun to understand the interplay of tumor heterogeneity, microenvironment, and metastatic potential. Developing a theoretical framework is intrinsic to deciphering tumors' tremendous spatial and longitudinal genetic variation patterns in patients. Here, we propose that tumors can be considered evolutionary island-like ecosystems, that is, isolated systems that undergo evolutionary and spatiotemporal dynamic processes that shape tumor microenvironments and drive the migration of cancer cells. We examine attributes of insular systems and causes of insularity, such as physical distance and connectivity. These properties modulate migration rates of cancer cells through processes causing spatial and temporal isolation of the organs and tissues functioning as a supply of cancer cells for new colonizations. We discuss hypotheses, predictions, and limitations of tumors as islands analogy. We present emerging evidence of tumor insularity in different cancer types and discuss their relevance to the islands model. We suggest that the engagement of tumor insularity into conceptual and mathematical models holds promise to illuminate cancer evolution, tumor heterogeneity, and metastatic potential of cells.

AB In Southeast Asia, seagrass meadows are under threat through coastal development and increased pollution, but remain understudied. The dugong is a marine herbivore that is dependent on the availability of seagrass as a primary food source. In this study, we assess the patterns of co-occurrence between dugongs and seagrass. We hypothesize that the changing spatial patterns of dugong feeding are positively correlated to the seasonal variation in distribution and abundance of mixed species in subtidal tropical seagrass meadows. We documented seagrass cover and dugong feeding trails in the Sibu Archipelago meadow in Johor, Malaysia, across the monsoon seasons of 2016-2017 using an underwater towed video method. Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics were used to quantify the degree of clustering in feeding trails, feeding patch size, and to identify feeding hotspots and coldspots. This site has the single largest subtidal meadow in Peninsular Malaysia known to date, measuring 12.88 km2. The study captured a reduction in seagrass extent and coverage during the study. Feeding trail occurrence averaged three per image throughout the seasons, with the maximum number being 14 trails per image. Dugongs fed in a spatially clustered manner leaving two distinct feeding trail patterns: (1) a dispersed pattern when seagrass cover was high or low (76-100% and 0-25%) that resulted in larger patch sizes, and (2) a concentrated pattern in moderate seagrass cover (26-75%) that resulted in smaller patch size. Feeding hotspots and coldspots had significantly different seagrass cover, suggesting that dugongs foraged strategically within the meadow. Our results demonstrate that seagrass cover played a significant role in driving dugong feeding patterns and in creating feeding hotspots and coldspots in tropical subtidal meadows.

AB Crete with its complex geomorphological history is the island with the highest number of endemism observed in animal and plant taxa throughout the Aegean archipelago. While other groups of organisms within Crete are well-studied, the freshwater gastropod fauna still remains poorly investigated. Bythinella and Pseudamnicola, are 2 genera of freshwater springsnails, both present on the island, inhabiting springs and other freshwater habitats. Here, we conduct a comprehensive study on the distribution of the different genetic lineages of the 2 gastropod genera in order to assess the mode of their differentiation on the island and infer the actual number of species present in the island. Towards these aims, sequence data from the mitochondrial gene were used and analyzed within a phylogenetic framework. For Bythinella, our results strongly support at least 5 delineated Bythinella spp. inhabiting Crete, which correspond to the already described species from previous studies with the addition of a new one. Bythinella analyses reveal an old time-frame of differentiation with vicariant phenomena being more likely the main drivers shaping the present-day distribution of the genus' genetic lineages. For Pseudamnicola, our data indicate the presence of at least 2 delineated Pseudamnicola spp. with a differentiation more consistent to an isolation-by-distance pattern of a relatively recent origin. Dispersion processes followed by isolation of the populations and/or recent speciation, seem to be the underlying process for the current distribution of Pseudamnicola lineages.

AB Aim Geographic range size varies greatly across species. Climate, along with aspects of a species' biology, may influence its spatial extent. We investigate intrinsic and extrinsic predictors of range size in Australian skinks. We predicted that larger body size, longer limbs, and larger clutch sizes would be associated with larger ranges, and that ranges would be larger in colder, more arid, and more seasonal climates. Location Mainland Australia. Taxon Skinks (Scincidae). Methods We test for climatic and geographic correlates of range size of Australian skink species (417 of 462 described species), as well as investigate the effects of body size and clutch size (259 species). We compare detailed morphological measurements of 1,324 specimens across nine pairs of widespread and narrow-ranged congeneric species to investigate the roles of intrinsic (body size, clutch size, morphology) and extrinsic (mean temperature and precipitation) factors in determining range size. Results In the broader analysis, large range sizes were associated with the presence of fully developed limbs, low precipitation seasonality, high temperatures, and high precipitation. Ranges of species traversing the Great Dividing Range are larger by an order of magnitude than those east of the range, with western ranges being intermediate. Affinity to specific biomes explained less variation than climatic variables. For the nine species pairs, wide-ranging species share similar morphologies and clutch sizes with overlapping narrow-ranging congeners, but generally inhabit more arid regions. Main conclusions We found several extrinsic, but few intrinsic, factors were correlated with range size. The narrow mesic belts in Australia compared with the extensive expanse of arid and semi-arid regions may explain why desert species have larger ranges. This interpretation agrees with the notion that the size of the domain, here a climatic domain rather than a physical one, may exert strong influence on species' range sizes.

AB Aim Pleistocene erratic boulders are rocks that were relocated by glaciers during the Ice Ages. When their geology differs from the geology of the landscape that surrounds them, erratic boulders form habitat islands for regionally rare, edaphically specialised, rock-dwelling cryptogams (bryophytes, ferns and lichens). Such boulders constitute terrestrial model systems for exploring island biogeographic predictions and the effect of environmental variables on species diversity and community composition, which we studied in order to provide basic knowledge of the ecology, with relevance for the conservation, of these unusual island systems. Location Siliceous erratic boulders in the calcareous Swiss Plateau and Jura Mountains. Methods For 160 erratic boulders we recorded all bryophyte species and a diverse set of environmental variables. For all species and for specialist species (acidophile rock-dwellers) separately, we analysed species-area relationships and nestedness, and explored relationships between environmental variables, species diversity and community composition. Results We found 138 bryophyte species, 19 of which were specialists of erratic boulders. A steeper species-area curve for boulder specialists than for total species richness underlined the island properties of boulders for specialist species. Large boulders were more likely to harbour numerous boulder specialists and communities on small boulders were nested within the communities present on large boulders. However, at the landscape level small boulders contributed more specialist species than a few large boulders of the same surface area. Erratic boulders near settlements were less likely to harbour boulder specialists. Boulders in open land harboured different and more specialist species than boulders in forests. Conclusions Large undisturbed erratic boulders in open land harbour rare bryophyte communities with a large number of specialist species. Conservation should thus prioritise this type of boulders. Furthermore, conserving large boulders is logistically easier, and they may function as flagships for small boulders that also contribute to the biodiversity within landscapes.

AB In this paper, we study the coexistence of an extended Klausmeier model with cross-diffusion and nonlocal sustained grazing. First, we analyze a saddle-node bifurcation of spatially homogeneous system. Second, we focus on the reaction-diffusion system with nonlocal sustained grazing. Our main result is that nonlocal terms promote linear stability, and the system may produce pattern under the influences of self-diffusion and cross-diffusion. Moreover, both the grazing parameter and rainfall rate can induce transitions among bare soil state, vegetation pattern state and homogeneous vegetation state. Finally, we address the nonlocal reaction-diffusion system as a bifurcation problem, and analyze the existence and stability of bifurcation solutions. Furthermore, numerical simulations have been illustrated to verify our theoretical findings. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Squaliobarbus curriculus, commonly known as red-eye fish, is widely distributed in East Asia. It is one of the important aquatic germplasm resource and economic species in the Pearl River. To give suggestions for better protection and management, we investigated its life history and conducted elasticity analyses. Samples (n = 451) were collected between 2016 and 2017 from the western Pearl River estuary. There were no significant differences between the length-weight relationships of females and males (W = 0.00001SL(3.121)). The von Bertalanffy growth function was L-t = 553.2 [1 - e(-0.111(t+1.009))]. The estimated length at 50% sexual maturity for females was 209.6 and 200.0 mm for males, both at 3 years of age. Oocyte size-frequency distribution suggested batch spawning. Fecundity ranged between 9,407 and 175,086 eggs per fish (mean = 51,040, or 143.9 eggs/g of fish weight). To better understand the ecological phenotypic plasticity of S. curriculus we conducted meta-analyses on all available life history data for this species. Our results showed that the standard lengths at ages 2 and 3 in the estuary were significantly smaller than in the upper reaches of the Pearl River basin, and there were also obvious differences in fecundity and oocyte size. For more, the standard lengths at ages 2 and 3 were correlated negatively with latitude. Elasticity analysis showed that juveniles' (aged 1-3) survival had the largest contribution to the population growth rate, which suggests that management efforts should focus on the early life stages

AB Aim Latitudinal gradients in life-history traits are apparent in many taxa and are expected to be strong for ectotherms that have temperature-driven constraints on performance and fitness. The strength of these gradients, however, should also be affected by diet. Because diet type (carnivory, omnivory, herbivory) influences accessibility to nutrition and assimilation efficiency, we aim to study how diet affects latitudinal gradients in lifetime reproductive output and the underlying life-history traits in ectotherms. Location Global. Time period Recent. Major taxa studied Lizards (Reptilia, Squamata, Sauria). Methods We used empirical (352 species) and phylogenetically imputed data (563 species) to analyse the interactive effects of latitude and diet on life-history traits (longevity, age at maturity, reproductive life span, hatchling mass, clutch/brood size, clutch/brood frequency, female mass) and lifetime reproductive output of lizards. Results Lifetime reproductive output does not significantly differ in lizards across diet types, and only carnivores exhibit a small increase at higher latitudes. Diet type, however, influences latitudinal patterns of individual life-history traits. Carnivores exhibit a shift towards 'slower-paced' life histories at higher latitudes for most traits (increased longevity, age at maturity, reproductive life span, and decreased clutch frequency). By contrast, herbivores either display 'faster-paced' life histories (reduction in reproductive life span, hatchling mass, female mass) or no change (clutch frequency, clutch size, age at maturity) at higher latitudes. Omnivores exhibit intermediate and muted latitudinal patterns. Main conclusions We suggest that the nutritional challenges of herbivory, compounded by thermal constraints at higher latitudes, may explain differences in life-history characteristics of herbivorous ectotherms. Intermediate patterns exhibited by omnivores highlight how flexibility in diet can buffer environmental challenges at higher latitudes. Our results indicate that lizards with different diet types display various trends in their life histories across latitudes, which eventually balance out to result in similar reproductive outputs throughout their lifetime, with little benefits to carnivory.

AB Background The causes of geographic variation of body size in ectotherms have generally been attributed to environmental variables. Research in amphibians has favored mechanisms that involve water availability as an explanation for the geographic variation of body size. However, there are few studies at intraspecific level on amphibians that inhabit desert or semi-desert environments, where hydric restrictions are stronger. Here, we describe and inquire as to the causes of the geographic variation of body size in the semi-desert toad Rhinella atacamensis, a terrestrial anuran that is distributed over 750 km along a latitudinal aridity gradient from the southern extreme of the Atacama Desert to the Mediterranean region of central Chile. We measured the snout-vent length of 315 adults from 11 representative localities of the entire distribution of the species. Then, using an information-theoretic approach, we evaluate whether the data support eight ecogeographic hypotheses proposed in literature. Results Rhinella atacamensis exhibits a gradual pattern of decrease in adult body size towards the north of its distribution, where the climate is more arid, which conforms to a Bergmann's cline. The best model showed that the data support the mean annual precipitation as predictor of body size, favoring the converse water availability hypothesis. Conclusions Most studies in amphibians show that adult size increases in arid environments, but we found a converse pattern to expected according to the hydric constraints imposed by this type of environment. The evidence in R. atacamensis favors the converse water availability hypothesis, whose mechanism proposes that the foraging activity determined by the precipitation gradient has produced the clinal pattern of body size variation. The variation of this trait could also be affected by the decreasing productivity that exists towards the north of the species distribution. In addition, we found evidence that both pattern and mechanism are independent of sex. Lastly, we suggest that behavioral traits, such as nocturnal habits, might also play an important role determining this differential response to aridity. Therefore, the support for the converse water availability hypothesis found in this study shows that amphibians can respond in different ways to water restrictions imposed by arid environments.

AB Phytoplankton abundance can be affected both by physicochemical factors such as nutrients, temperature or light availability (bottom-up control), and by the abundance of predators (top-down control). Phytoplankton research in the Arabian Gulf has so far focused on bottom-up control of the phytoplankton community, this study was the first to include top-down control as well. High abundances of the three diatom genera Chaetoceros, Guinardia and Bacteriastrum were observed locally during summer. Other important phytoplankton genera observed in this study included the cyanobacteria Trichodesmium and Nostoc, the diatom Leptocylindrus, and the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum. Whereas Trichodesmium was characteristic for the main body of the Arabian Gulf, from Khafji to Dhahran, Nostoc, Leptocylindrus and Prorocentrum characterized the phytoplankton community in the southern waters, the Gulf of Salwa and Half Moon Bay. This is a high salinity environment that is separated from the main body of the Arabian Gulf by a shallow sill. Here, we observed a seasonal change in the phytoplankton community, with a dominance of Nostoc and Leptocylindrus during summer, followed by a dominance of Prorocentrum during winter. Chaetoceros and Bacteriastrum showed significant correlation with the abundance of copepod Oithona brevicornis and the ghost shrimp Belzebub hanseni. Nostoc, Leptocylindrus and Prorocentrum all showed significant correlation with salinity and the concentration of total suspended solids. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Species diversity-productivity relationship is often, but not always, scale dependent. We hypothesize that the arrangement of environmental heterogeneity along a rainfall gradient, as a surrogate for productivity, determines whether scale dependence of beetle diversity at our sandy sites exists. We chose seven geographically distant landscapes (360 kms from south to north) within a mean annual rainfall range of 30-585mm, each having six clusters of five uniformly distributed pitfall traps (within a range of 0.24 km(2)). Vegetation and physical variables were measured within each landscape and its clusters to characterize both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. We used species diversity of each cluster and the accumulative species diversity in a landscape as local and regional diversity, respectively. Between-clusters dissimilarity in diversity reflected the turnover of species within a landscape. We used environmental measures in each cluster and at the entire landscape to indicate local and regional heterogeneity, respectively, and changes between transects to characterize the within-landscape dissimilarity in heterogeneity. Beetle diversity and productivity showed a unimodal pattern at both spatial scales, with a peak at intermediate productivity of ca. 300 mm. Envirorunental heterogeneity increased with productivity both at the local and at the landscape scales, but within-landscape dissimilarity in heterogeneity did not change with productivity. Between-clusters dissimilarity in diversity was higher at intermediate productivity, explaining the unimodal pattern at the landscape scale. We suggest that the scale independence in our study results from the equal distribution of environmental heterogeneity within a landscape. We propose that the exploration of the diversity-productivity relationship across scales should consider the way heterogeneity is distributed along the productivity gradient.

AB Mutualisms involve cooperation, but also frequently involve conflict. Plant-pollinator mutualisms are no exception. To facilitate animal pollination, flowering plants often offer pollen (their male gametes) as a food reward. Since plants benefit by maximizing pollen export to conspecific flowers, we might expect plants to cheat on pollen rewards. In intersexual floral mimicry, rewarding pollen-bearing male flowers (models) are mimicked by rewardless female flowers (mimics) on the same plant. Pollinators should therefore learn to avoid the unrewarding mimics. Plants might impede such learning by producing phenotypically variable flowers that cause bees to generalize among models and mimics during learning. In this laboratory study, we used partially artificial flowers (artificial petals, live reproductive parts) modeled after Begonia odorata to test whether variation in the size of rewarding male flowers (models) and unrewarding female flowers (mimics) affected how quickly bees learned both to recognize models and to reject mimics. Live unrewarding female flowers have 33% longer petals and have 31% greater surface area than live rewarding male flowers, which bees should easily discriminate. Yet while bees rapidly learned to reduce foraging effort on mimics, learning was not significantly affected by the degree to which flower size varied. Additionally, we found scant evidence that this was a result of bees altering response speed to maintain decision accuracy. Our study failed to provide evidence that flower size variation in intersexual floral mimicry systems exploits pollinator cognition, though we cannot rule out that other floral traits that are variable may be important. Furthermore, we propose that contrary to expectation, phenotypic variability in a Batesian mimicry system may not necessarily have significant effects on whether receivers effectively learn to discriminate models and mimics.

AB Evolutionary trends (ETs) are traditionally defined as substantial changes in the state of traits through time produced by a persistent condition of directional evolution. ETs might also include directional responses to ecological, climatic or biological gradients and represent the primary evolutionary pattern at high taxonomic levels and over long-time scales. The absence of a well-supported operative definition of ETs blurred the definition of conceptual differences between ETs and other key concepts in evolution such as convergence, parallel evolution, and divergence. Also, it prevented the formulation of modern guidelines for studying ETs and evolutionary dynamics related to them. In phenotypic evolution, the theory of morphodynamics states that the interplay between evolutionary factors such as phylogeny, evo-devo constraints, environment, and biological function determines morphological evolution. After introducing a new operative definition, here we provide a morphodynamics-based framework for studying phenotypic ETs, discussing how understanding the impact of these factors on ETs improves the explanation of links between biological patterns and processes underpinning directional evolution. We envisage that adopting a quantitative, pattern-based, and multifactorial approach will pave the way to new potential applications for this field of evolutionary biology. In this framework, by exploiting the catalysing effect of climate change on evolution, research on ETs induced by global change might represent an ideal arena for validating hypotheses about the predictability of evolution.

AB Sustainable development goals imply proper landscape management, a challenging task in human-dominated environments, where the identification of key habitats is often necessary to achieve the conservation of multispecies communities or threatened taxa. We studied the avian composition of 9 habitats in Tota Lake, a highly diverse Andean wetland affected by human activities. We evaluated the richness, abundance, dominance, and bird diversity, and used a species-habitat network approach to assess some emerging properties of the landscape and to identify key habitats for conservation. We observed 116 bird species, with a low diversity index (Shannon = 2.2) due to the dominance of gregarious species. The landscape showed a substantial sensitivity to disturbances due to habitat loss. Natural habitats were more important than human-related habitats, except for the wooded pastures used for low-scale grazing, which are among the most important coverages. This habitat represented a good example of sustainable land use. In contrast, the croplands and touristic beach were notoriously unsustainable in terms of wildlife conservation. Among the natural habitats, the most important was the marshes that presented the higher richness, abundance, importance for the landscape network, and was the most used by birds of conservation concern. Natural forest habitats, despite being reduced and fragmented, were more important to birds than the extensive forest of introduced exotic vegetation, probably due to the evolutionary history of the birds with the native vegetation.

AB Economic development and land use/land cover (LULC) changes are deeply connected. Egypt has started the National Road Project to add 7000 km new roads to the 23.500 km existing network. The present study aimed at assessing anthropogenic impacts of the establishment and development of one of the newly developed arterial roads (Wadi Al-Natroun Al-Alamin road) on the LULC of surrounding region in relation to climate change during the period from 1986 to 2019. Using RS (remote sensing) techniques and four satellite images from 1986, 1999, 2011, and 2019, five classes were identified (vegetation, urban, water, agriculturally affected soils, and bare soils). The study area was divided based on different human activities into six areas of interest (AOIs). Results showed that massive changes have occurred during the 33-year period along the six AOIs and the five identified classes. Four climatic variables (annual mean temperature, maximum temperature of the warmest month, annual precipitation, precipitation of the wettest month) have been used to investigate climatic conditions of the study area in 1986 and 2018 and link it to the continuous development in the study area. Results showed an average increase of 2 degrees C in annual temperature and maximum temperature of the hottest month. In contrary, a significant decrease in the annual precipitation and precipitation of the wettest month has been documented. Statistical analysis results showed significant correlations between climatic conditions and economic development along the study area. Climate change and human development stress on both natural and artificial ecosystems of the study area have been discussed, and recommended measures for sustainable development and natural resources perseveration have been provided.

AB Optimal foraging models predict that individual animals will optimize net energy gain by intensifying forage activity and/or reducing forage energy cost. Then, the free distribution model predicts an animal's distribution in a patchy landscape will match the distribution of the resources. If not modified by other factors, such patterns may be expected to be particularly explicit in variable and extreme, forage-limited, and patchy environments, notably alpine and Arctic environments during winter. The large ungulate wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) surviving in such environments is used as a model during the forage-limited winter season. The largest wild reindeer area in Western Europe (Hardangervidda, 8130 km(2)) is actively managed to sustain 10,000-12,000 wild reindeer. Since 2001, 104 different individuals have been GPS-tracked at 3-hr intervals. In winter, mountain reindeer may either choose to seek out and forage in patchy snow-free habitats, typically on top of wind-blown ridges, or use energy-demanding digging through the snow to reach ground forage (cratering). We use late April satellite data from Landsat 5 and 8 (30 x 30 m), airborne laser scanning subsampling (processed to 1 x 1 m grid), and topographic information (1 m resolution) derived from digital aerial photographs (0.25 x 0.25 m resolution) to delineate snow-free patches, constituting less than 694 km(2). By overlaying recorded wild reindeer GPS positions winters 2001-2017 (188,942 positions), we document a strong positive selection for snow-free patches, which were used about four times more frequently than expected from a "random walk" model. On a daily basis, the preference for snow-free areas was slightly stronger in the evenings. In the sustainable management of wild mountain reindeer, the area of snow-free patches is an important predictor of winter forage availability and important winter source areas. It may be derived from remote sensing data.

AB Context The importance of justice is increasingly recognized in environmental policy making. Research on environmental justice offers an important perspective on landscape transformations, both natural and social. Objectives This paper asks how current work on environmental justice might contribute to the development of socio-environmental knowledge of the biophysical landscape. The paper explores the relations between environmental justice thinking and the production of a distinctively capitalist landscape. Methods The paper builds on a review of environmental justice and landscape literature and, for the empirical part, on archival studies and secondary sources. Results The paper shows that there remains a disjunction between landscape studies and the environmental justice literature. It provides a theoretically informed approach of bringing together environmental justice scholarship with the transformations of a contested and distinctively capitalist landscape. By studying changes in woodlands and wetlands on the island of Gotland, Sweden, it uncovers a process of the production of landscape that elicits "deep" historical geographies of environmental justice. The massive exploitation of wetlands and forests shows how an approach encompassing environmental justice in conjunction with forms of resource exploitation and conservation can help grasp changes in the landscape.

AB Flowers in the Antidaphne genus are among the smallest in family Santalaceae. We traced the development and morphology of flowers in A. viscoidea and compared them with those in other members of the family. Both staminate and carpellate inflorescences proliferate through collateral and serial buds, and become dimorphic when fully elongated. The former are short racemes with a terete axes and a protective, cup-like distalmost bract; the latter are spikes with flattened, furrowed and longer axes with a leafy, non-protective bract. The staminate flowers (traditionally described as apetalous) initiate from transversely flattened primordia, from which 3-5 stamens initiate opposite to variously reduced petals in an abaxial-to- adaxial direction. A massive, intrastaminal, lobed nectariferous disc, likely gynoecium-derived, is formed, with the lobes alternate to the stamens. The carpellate flowers initiate from radially symmetric primordia; they also possess three or four perianth organs. Floral monosymmetry of staminate flowers is likely due to mechanical constraint rather than to floral reduction. Our data support the current phylogenetic relationship between Antidaphne and the neotropical genera Eubrachion and Lepidoceras, all having unisexual flowers, lacking trichomes between the petals and stamens, sessile stigmas, and baccate fruits. The nectariferous disc is likely apomorphic for Santalaceae.

AB Physiological traits are key determinants of species success in any given environment. Competing metabolic demands can influence success by limiting the available scope for aerobically-demanding activities, including reproduction and dispersal. The present study investigated whether the aerobic performance of Gambusia holbrooki, one of the most invasive species in the world, was affected by the embryonic demands of pregnancy and whether these demands were compounded in a hypoxic environment. To quantify these effects, we measured the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and critical swimming speed (U-crit) of wild-caught adult mosquitofish in saturated oxygen conditions, and following chronic exposure to hypoxic or hyperoxic water. Contrary to expectations, the RMR and U-crit of gravid females was equal to that of non-gravid females and males, once the significant effects of body mass on these traits was accounted for. Whilst the exposure studies demonstrated that RMR changes subject to oxygen availability, overall aerobic performance does not. These findings suggest that mosquitofish metabolism is adapted for continued reproductive function and dispersal in low oxygen environments, which are essential for establishing and replenishment of populations. The ability of this species to tolerate hypoxia may confer a competitive advantage relative to native species, especially in disturbed lentic environments where prolonged periods of hypoxia are more common. Given their live-bearing mode of reproduction and resilience to the metabolic demands of reproduction, even in low oxygen conditions, we suggest that the physiology of female mosquitofish is a significant contributor to the invasion success and persistence of the species.

ID FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; SPECIALIZATION
AB Ecometric modelling assesses how the functional morphology of ecogeographic communities relates to environmental variables. This improves understanding of how the interaction between organism and environment can result in morphological adaptation. This technique has mainly been used to model paleoenvironments, but has the capacity to aid conservation by quantifying how communities are structured through space and time. Here we test the relationship between limb proportions and the habitat ecology of South American non-human primates. There is a significant but weak fit between limb proportions and habitat, consistent with the environment exerting weak selective pressure on limb proportions. In contrast, body size and phylogeny are strongly correlated with IMI. Together, these findings suggest that habitat was a selection pressure that shaped how New World monkeys' limb proportions evolved but this selection pressure was secondary to that of body size. Research into these functional relationships is important not only to improve scientific understanding of their evolutionary pathways but also in order to aid their protection by informing conservation practices. Ensuring these species have the capacity to move with their niche is an immediate concern, as they face mounting pressure due to deforestation of the Amazon basin.

AB Jargon is the specialised vocabulary of any science: it allows the creation of new terms to define concepts and it removes ambiguity from scientific communication. Yet, it may also hinder understanding for a broader audience. Given that the Journal of Limnology has jargon in its title, we here investigate the impact of the term 'limnology' on the way limnologists work, publish their research, and attract the interest of other scientists. We do so by comparing scientometric features of papers published from 1965 to 2020 that used the term 'limnology' against papers on similar topics but that used the term 'lake ecology' or 'hydrobiology', and to the marine counterpart of papers that used the term 'oceanography'. We found that papers using the term limnology score worse than those of the other topics in terms of both publication output and scientific impact. Limnologists may need to use other terms in addition to 'limnology' to reach a broader scientific audience.

ID VEGETATION; CLIMATE; AREA
AB EGYPT is in the arid belt, with a semi-arid Mediterranean coast. Characteristic maritime oolitic sand dunes stretch parallel to the sea from Alexandria westward to Mersa Matruh. This habitat has a highly specialized floristic composition that never grows southward. Recently, the oolitic sand dune habitats have become threatened by urbanization expansion and global climate change, inducing a notable decline in floristic composition and species richness. The present study aimed to assess the flora land vegetation of the oolitic sand dunes along the Mediterranean coast in Egypt. The floristic composition in the surveyed area included a total of 116 psammophyte species (91 genera belonging to 27 families), with annuals comprising 47.4% and perennials comprising 40.5%. Chronological analysis revealed the dominance of the Mediterranean elements, with either mono-, bi- or pluri-regional chorotypes accounting for 64.7% of the total number of species. According to canonical correspondence analysis, the relationship between the prevailing species composition and soil variables revealed that CaCO3 and organic carbon positively affected, whereas sand and clay fractions and chloride ions negatively affected, the species distribution. The deterioration of oolitic habitats due to the construction of resorts and urbanization has led to a severe decline in the vegetation and flora of the area; this expansion must be stopped.

DE Human ecosystem; sustainable symbiotic; public space; urban space;

AB In the last few years, the concept of the Human Ecosystem has been mentioned a lot frequently in Urban Environments related to social and natural ecosystems. The organization of public spaces cannot help but affect the relationships between human and natural ecology, economy, and culture. Perhaps the human activities have compromised the ecosystem so those relationships can be easily broken down. But it can also be enriched or recovered from failures by establishing Symbiotic Relationships between natural, economic, and cultural elements in urban ecosystems. The research presents theoretical issues of Human Ecosystems in public space organization and specific applications in the case of Hanoi historical inner-city areas. It focuses on discussing theories of the structure and morphology of Human Ecosystems, the human behavior, the relationship between community behaviors, natural environment, and architecture of public spaces, to organize, enrich, and balance the service ecosystem of public spaces. These features are considered vital by the author in contributing to the preservation of natural resources, urban architectural heritage, creating architectural spaces and planning of public spaces towards ecological and green urban development.

AB The urban landscape and the image of the city by which the observers judge about a city remain as the mental image of a city in the mind of a man The urban landscape is capable of depicting the historical events of urban society. The favorable urban landscape has always been different from different people's perspectives and the use of different approaches to summarize the perspectives of people in a practical and correct way has always been a concern of researchers in this field. This study attempted to explain the ideas and perspectives of the target population (including university professors, experts, consulting engineers, and urban managers) using the differential semantics technique. In so doing, a qualitative research design was used to explore the features of an appropriate urban landscape for the city of Tehran through differential semantics. The questionnaire was designed based on three main dimensions: evaluative, power, and activity, which were measured on a seven-point differential semantics scale. The participants were asked to select the images which are closest to the urban landscape of Tehran. Results showed that two pictures were selected as the ideal landscape of Tehran in the future.

SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATION CULTURE AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
DE Zuckerman's sensation-seeking theory; problem behavior theory;
   cyberbullying; online risk; university students
AB Aim. The purpose of this article is to analyse risky behaviours undertaken by university students on the Internet.
   Theory. The concepts of "risk" and "risky behaviour" are known and often discussed in science. Krzysztof Ostaszewski (2005) defines risky behaviours as actions that contradict social norms and legal order, which at the same time pose a threat to a person's health and development. The catalogue of risky behaviours is very diverse and - more importantly - open. With the development of civilisation, new forms appear. Examples include risky behaviours on the Internet.
   Methodology and research results. The study population sample consisted of 241 university students. The research was conducted using an online survey questionnaire. The respondents admitted to taking risks in the virtual world. A large percentage of respondents admit to sharing private information on social networks (almost 70%). Nearly 75% of respondents ignore communications about potential threats to websites, putting themselves at risk of losing sensitive data. Moreover, 65.1% of students admit to downloading content from illegal sources. Other risky behaviours undertaken by students on the Internet include Internet addiction and online activities, aggression on the Internet, sexual and/or erotic behaviour in cyberspace. The paper also presents the answers to open-ended questions, which refer to threats on the Internet as perceived by the students. The answers given most often referred to: addiction to new technologies, loss/theft of private data, vulnerability to false/unverified information available on the Internet.
   Cognitive value. Online risk-taking is a global problem. The phenomenon should be further theoretically considered and analysed in a pedagogical practice.

AB Craniometric variability of the common shrew has been studied on 613 skulls of young (first summer of life) individuals from ten localities in the northeastern part of European Russia, i.e., Komi Republic and Nenets Autonomous Okrug. We have compared 16 skull traits. The impact of various factors on cranial variability of the species is discussed. We found significant interpopulation variability in the skull size. The morphological distances (Mahalanobis distances) between samples within a race were often greater than those between samples of different races. Several skull traits were found specific to some races. Both latitude and elevation were shown to affect the interpopulation variability significantly. A decrease in the size of skulls was revealed towards the north versus an increase with altitude. Estimation of the contribution of a certain factor was complicated by the joint effect of various factors in various combinations.

AB As the human population grows and wildlife habitat is lost, managers are increasingly reliant on hands-on management strategies such as translocation. Without much evidence suggesting success, moving a species or population from one location to another has been controversial for some taxa, especially for wildlife in urban areas. Here, in an ad hoc translocation of Terrapene carolina carolina (Eastern Box Turtle) in Washington, DC, we describe movements of 10 translocated turtles from 2011 to 2014, with 4 settling into apparent short-term home ranges and 6 requiring repeated relocation. Our study population was small, but results suggested that home-range establishment may occur with repositioning individuals post-release. Translocations should not proceed without sufficient investment from managers to carry out long-term monitoring of released individuals.

AB The aim of this paper is to introduce the Israel National Culture Collection of Algae (INCCA) http://kinneret.ocean.org.il/INCCA.aspx. INCCA was set up at the Kinneret Limnological Laboratory, Israel Oceanographic & Limnological Research, to document, isolate and preserve the microalgae biodiversity of Israel, for future scientific, industrial and educational purposes. At present the collection contains 103 strains, mainly from the Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Charophyta divisions. Each isolated culture was first identified by microscopy and later submitted to DNA barcoding using rbcL and the rRNA SSU-ITS as markers. The unialgal (xenic) cultures are maintained on agar plates or in liquid media, at constant illumination and temperature. We present our isolation, purification and characterization procedures, together with a listing of our current holdings. The distinctiveness of INCCA among other culture collections is that it is the first collection of microalgae in Israel and its adjacent Middle Eastern countries. Furthermore, since most isolates are from Lake Kinneret they are accompanied by environmental data derived from >50 years of monitoring on Lake Kinneret. Examples of the research conducted on several of our strains supports the scientific importance of this collection. By transforming INCCA into a formal internationally accredited collection, that will expand to include species of microalgae from all types of environments in Israel, we would like to provide a home for preserving microalgal biodiversity in this Middle-East country.

AB James H. Brown's "Mammals on mountaintops: nonequilibrium insular biogeography," published in 1971 inThe American Naturalist, documented distributional patterns of small mammal species in the mountaintop islands of the Great Basin, USA. Distributional patterns suggested that this island-like system was not in equilibrium and represented some of the first evidence contradicting the seminalTheory of Island Biogeography. Brown's findings suggested that ecological and historical mechanisms were integral to community assembly and maintenance in island-like systems, broadening the focus of research related to biogeographical patterns in islands. The work further highlighted the importance of species traits on distributional patterns. Here, I review the paper and its contributions.

AB The craniometric variability of Common shrews was studied using 613 skulls of young (first summer of life) individuals from ten localities in the northeastern part of European Russia, i.e. Komi Republic and Nenets Autonomus District. We compared 16 skull characters, with an expected impact of various factors on cranial variability being discussed. We found significant interpopulation variability in skull size. The morphological distances (measured as Mahalanobis distances) between samples within a race were often greater than those between samples of different races. Several skull traits were found specific to some races. Both latitude and elevation were shown to significantly affect the interpopulation variability. Size decrease in skulls was revealed towards the north, vs. an increase with altitude. Estimating the contribution of a certain factor was complicated by a joint effect of various factors in various combinations.

AB It is well known that body size variation can be related to genetic and environmental factors and that this variation may occur among species, and among and within populations. Scinax fuscomarginatus is a widely distributed Neotropical anuran that occurs in open areas of several South American ecoregions, exposed to different climatic conditions and showing high levels of body size variation. We tested if this variation in body size is related to phylogeny or to any climatic condition to which populations are subjected. We measured the snout-vent length (SVL) of 285 individuals of S. fuscomarginatus from 37 populations, covering virtually all the known geographic distribution of the species. We constructed a phylogenetic tree under Bayesian inference based on mtDNA sequences to test for the existence of phylogenetic signal in body size variation and performed a multiple linear regression to examine the relationship between body size and environmental variables. Although S. fuscomarginatus shows a deep genetic structure, body size variation was randomly distributed across the phylogeny, indicating no phylogenetic signal. On the other hand, we found evidence that support some influence of climatic conditions in body size variation, being the precipitation seasonality and the temperature seasonality the most important variables. Our results are in accordance with the water conservation hypothesis, which predicts an increase in body size towards drier regions assuming that lower surface-to-volume ratio of larger bodies minimizes water loss by evaporation.

ID RESTORATION
AB Over time, the building materials used in colonial constructions have undergone various physical, mechanical deterioration and biological degradation. These alterations may be due to human action or due to lack of maintenance on one hand, and inappropriate extensions to the entire original structure on the other hand. Natural risks (earthquakes), climatic hazards (rain, snow, wind, etc.) and the high humidity levels that characterize coastal areas also contribute to the deterioration of these buildings and threaten their sustainability. Cut stone presents specific pathologies due to physical, chemical and biological aggression; all these alterations affect the stone material, requiring its replacement, repair or reconstruction if necessary. This study aims to examine how the rehabilitation of the cut stone facades of Souk-Ahras City Hall can be a contribution to the preservation of a colonial heritage with undeniable values. While it is true that the diagnosis is inevitable before any intervention, it depends on a thorough knowledge of the different pathologies and disorders that threaten the construction. Therefore, the pathologies likely to affect cut stone constructions were first examined, followed by the various interventions to address them.

AB Grassland is one of the important natural ecosystems in the world, which not only play an important ecological role, but is also the main source for livestock production. Because of overgrazing in many of these lands, degradation is extending, which is an overall key issue in China. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which is often called the "roof of the world", is known for its high altitude, low temperature and oxygen content, strong ultraviolet radiation and for its short-term grass growing season. This makes it a vulnerable system, while once damaged, it is very hard to recover. Therefore, it is essential to sustain the eco-function of this alpine grassland system. Reasonable grassland management practice is important for maintaining a sustainable healthy ecosystem. As overgrazing is one of the main causes for degradation of grassland, the proper management should take it account the balance between livestock and vegetation components, and it is essential to select an appropriate stocking rate strategy. Optimal production from pastures is gained only when animal needs and the productive capacity of the pasture are balanced. Stocking rate is usually defined as the number of animals per unit area for a given time period, but is affected by a series of factors, such as animal breeds, animal size and weight, animal performance, animal physiological state, climate environment, resources, grass growing rate and biomass and grass grazing tolerance. Therefore, it is challenging to select the optimal stocking rate, and as so it restricts the planning of reasonable grassland management strategies. In addition, forage biomass and its nutritive quality are dynamic and there is no constant stocking rate that is best for all situations. With the fast development of innovative technology and knowledge, models make possible the attempt to determine proper stocking rates and grazing strategies, while taking in account the balance between livestock and vegetation. But most models are complex while using highly detailed simulations input of many parameters, including grassland, climate, forage, animal physiology and weight, cost and policy, which restrict their use and extension. And so, most farmers are not skilled to use these complicated models in practice. The grassland grazing management model, which was developed by an Israeli researcher, Prof. Imnauel Noy-Meir, is simple, which focusing only two basic processes that determine biomass dynamics, including plant growth and animal consumption of herbage, with a second fundamental management tool, grazing deferment at the start of the green season. The two basic factors are adjusted to be conformed to herbage mass to obtain optimum animal production. This current paper tested Noy-Meir's model in a yak grazing system of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The parameters in Noy-Meir's model in this paper were adjusted, based on published and empirical data from the Qinghai-Tibetan yak grazing system in order to analyze the feasibility of using this model for helpful decision making for improving grazing management strategies in alpine grassland in China. The outcome shows that Noy-Meir's model is easier and helpful for planning grazing practices in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau grassland. In order to improve the precision of Noy-Meir's model, the parameters still need better adjustment based on the specific pasture conditions.

AB Effective spatial management planning for sedentary fishery resources requires accurate spatial distribution mapping of a focal stock including both fished and associated unfished populations. This study focuses on (sub-) adult razor clams (Men gordonis), with shell lengths >= 25 mm, in Sasebo Bay and Omura Bay, northwestern Kyushu, Japan. They are commercially harvested, but little is known about their spatial distribution pattern. The objective was to estimate the spatial distribution and configuration of clam beds existing within an area of ca. 12 km(2). For this, clam and sediment sampling by scuba-equipped divers, acoustic bathymetric surveys using a recreational-grade fish finder (single-beam acoustic) system, and presence-absence modelling using generalized linear models were performed. For the collected clams, catch per unit effort (CPUE; number of clams collected/ h) was calculated and used as a proxy for clam individual density. The results showed that the presence-absence variation in the spatial distribution of (sub-)adult clams was associated with the bottom sediment type. (Sub-) adult clams occurred frequently in the sediments with higher gravel (particles with diameters a 2 mm, mainly shell fragments) and lower mud (diameters < 0.063 mm) contents than the sediments of the absence sites. Acoustic signals of the fish finder system were backscattered more intensely from gravel-sand beds (i.e., typical of the presence sites) than from muddy sand beds (i.e., absence sites). Using the relationships among the presence-absence variation of (sub-)adult clams, sediment type, and backscatter strength, spatial distribution of clams was predicted with high accuracy. The presence probability of (sub-)adults (= x; continuous values from 0 to 1) predicted from the results was significantly regressed on CPUE ( = y) [i.e., y = exp ( -0.7984 + 4.9350x) - 0.051. Using this relationship, a map for the relative abundance of (sub-)adult clams was obtained. This map depicted several clam beds including both exploited and unexploited ones. The latter beds virtually conform to no-take zones in the razor clam fishery.

AB A suite of oil samples from Niger Delta oil fields were examined for compositional distribution of methylhopane. The samples were obtained from wellhead of oil wells and stored in sample bottles. The oil samples were fractionated and the saturate fraction was subjected to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The methylhopanes in the oils were identified, their abundance delineated, and are of potential use for oil characterization. The mass chromatograms of m/z 205 were extracted and the peaks identified using GC-MS library, literature, and mass spectra form the library. 2 alpha-Methylhopanes and 3 beta-methylhopanes were identified in Nigerian Niger Delta oils. North Sea and Venezuelan Boscan oil were also examined. Generally, the Nigerian oils showed higher abundance of 2 alpha-methylhopanes and lower abundance 3 beta-methylhopanes compared to the Boscan and North Sea oils. The plot of C-30 hopane/C-30 2 alpha-methylhopane and C-30 hopane/C-30 3 beta-methylhopane for all the oils showed the discrimination of the oils into Niger Delta, North Sea, and Venezuelan Boscan oil. The ratio of C-30 hopanes/methylhopanes can be applied as a correlation tool.

AB BackgroundConsumers should show strong spatial preferences when foraging in environments where food availability is highly heterogeneous and predictable. Postdispersal granivores face this scenario in most arid areas, where soil seed bank abundance and composition associates persistently with vegetation structure at small scales (decimetres to metres). Those environmental features should be exploited as useful pre-harvest information, at least to avoid patches predicted to be poor. However, we did not find the expected spatial association in the algarrobal of the central Monte desert by observing foraging seed-eating birds, a field technique influenced by how much they exploit visitedpatches. In this work we tested if the first stage of foraging by granivorous birds (patch visit, encounter or exploration) is positively associated with environmental indicators of patch quality by recording the removal of single seeds from 300 scattered experimental devices during seasonal trials. Spatial selectivity was analysed by comparing the structural characteristics of used vs. available microhabitats, and evaluated against bottom-up and top-down hypotheses based on our previous knowledge on local seed bank abundance, composition and dynamics. Their foraging activity was also explored for spatialautocorrelation and environmental correlates at bigger scales.ResultsPostdispersal granivorous birds were less selective in their use of foraging space than expected if microhabitat appearance were providing them relevant information to guide their search for profitable foraging patches. No microhabitat type, as defined by their vegetation structureand soil cover, remained safe from bird exploration. Analyses at bigger temporal and spatial scales proved more important to describe heterogeneity in seed removal.ConclusionsCloseness to tall trees, probably related to bird territoriality and reproduction or to their perception of predation risk, seemed to determine a first level of habitat selection, constraining explorable space. Then, microhabitat openness (rather than seed abundance) exerted some positive influence on which patches were more frequently visited among those accessible. Selective patterns by birds at small scales were closer to our predictions of a top-down spatial effect, with seed consumptioncreating or strengthening (and not responding to) the spatial pattern and dynamics of the seed bank.

AB Rangeland is a key resource and is widely distributed around the world, occupying half of the emerged lands. They are even more important in dry areas, such as the Mediterranean basin, where they occupy 40% of its surface area. The threat of climate change and its intensification have increased the pressure on resources whose sustainability is in doubt. The development of tools to understand and evaluate the complex relationships established in these territories between man and nature are key to their conservation. Systems Dynamics models and diverse methodologies -such as the development of early warning indicators-have been devised to contribute to this challenge.
   These types of tools are essential to anticipate unsustainability problems and detect the main degradation factors, guiding the type of actions that must be implemented to follow a sustainable path. This article shows its scientific basis and presents some of the most relevant results.

AB Detailed information on life history and ecology is essential for successful conservation and management. However, we have relatively little detailed data on the life history and ecology of most small lizard species, relative to other vertebrates, especially those that have undergone recent taxonomic changes. We studied the ecology of the elegant snake-eyed skink (Cryptoblepharus pulcher), a lizard that occurs on trees, fences, walls, and rock outcroppings in eastern Australia that spans temperate to tropical environments. In our temperate-zone study population living in natural habitat, individuals are active year-round, and gravid females were found during the months of September through December. Sexual maturity is reached in 12 months, lifespan is at least three years, and clutch size is typically two eggs. In laboratory incubation experiments, larger eggs were more likely to hatch. Low incubation temperatures (averaging 23 +/- 7.5 degrees C versus high temperatures averaging 26 +/- 7.5 degrees C) increased incubation duration significantly (range 56-72 days versus 40-51 days) and reduced the body size of hatchlings significantly (17.8 mm versus 18.7 mm snout-vent length). Skinks sheltered beneath small rocks that were not shared simultaneously with predatory snakes, and that reached average temperatures that were up to 3 degrees C warmer during the day than unused rocks. Preferred microhabitats include substrates of rock or soil, and the largest rocks were occasionally shared by up to four individuals of all body size/sex combinations (5.8% of observations were shared, 30.2% of individual rocks were shared). Our study expands upon knowledge of the widespread genus Cryptoblepharus by providing detailed life history and ecological information on C. pulcher that can serve as a baseline for future studies.

AB The Long-tailed Reed Finch Donacospiza albifrons of south-central South America is patchily distributed in a variety of open habitats, usually near water. I present a detailed study of morphological variation based on 141 specimens, describing its plumage sequence and presenting notes on its molt and breeding. The Long-tailed Reed Finch shows no sexual dichromatism, but males average longer-winged than females. The species shows three distinct age-related plumages, which are redescribed here. It also shows marked individual variation in plumage and size, also showing marked plumage variation due to feather wear. Geographic variation is also marked, with birds from dry grasslands in northern highlands typically being larger, paler, and less streaked than birds from wet grasslands in southern lowlands, but there at some exceptions to this geographic pattern. I conclude that there is no solid basis for splitting the species into two or more taxa, and suggest considering the Long-tailed Reed Finch as a single, highly polymorphic species.

AB The aim of this study was to quantify the secondary production of a benthic rotifer species, Philodina roseola grown in the laboratory. The variations in body size of this rotifer and its reproduction were individually determined for nine individual replicates. The measurements of linear dimensions (total length, width, and diameter) of the entire body or individual body parts were performed soon after birth and tracked throughout the individual life cycle. The biomass (mu g DW/ind) was estimated by calculating body biovolume, which was determined by using the most suitable equations for the closest geometric shapes of different body parts. The individual production in body growth (Pg) and the reproductive production (Pr) were determined. The average length of the adult rotifer body (429.96 +/- 28.12 mu m) was about twice larger than the average size of neonates (198.77 +/- 25.88 mu m). The increase of biomass dry weight at different stages of development occurred at the same proportion; the biomass of an individual neonate (0.0104 +/- 0.0014) was around half that of the juvenile (0.0254 +/- 0.0029), and the biomass during adulthood (0.0508 +/- 0.0071) was approximately twice that of the biomass juvenile. The results related to the body's production were obtained by computing the biomass value related to the mean body growth of the species (0.0425 +/- 0.0172 mu g DW/ind). The production regarding the increase in body mass between neonatals and juveniles was the highest, corresponding to 1.3 times the increase that occurred when the individual passed from juvenile to adult stages. The reproductive output was much higher (in average 5.8 times) than the body production, and that corresponded to 84.68 +/- 3.65% of the total production value of Philodina roseola.

Healing and structural development or regeneration was started within 1-6 months depending on the species and the pattern of excision of the coralla. Mushroom coral showed a tendency to regain its morphological symmetry through regeneration. Mouth took active part for the regeneration by organizing repair mechanism from the central direction while new mouth was formed in the absence of parental mouth for the survival of any part of coral fragments as well as with the existing one.

AB The ability to cope with combinations of stresses is crucial for the establishment and development of young plants and determines processes of population dynamics. Seedlings and saplings of Mediterranean woody species in woody ecosystems often experience both drought and shade stresses. Our study aims at understanding the effect of the combined stresses of drought and shade on young sapling survival and development. We tested three alternative hypotheses: (1) Drought decreases plant performance in shade. (2) The impact of drought is lessened in shade or shade may even ameliorate plant performance under drought. (3) Plant response to shade is independent of plant response to water availability. The first and second hypotheses imply an interaction between drought and shade, while the third implies an orthogonal impact of drought and shade. We also ask what are the functional morphological traits that are involved in tolerating shade and drought stresses. We tested the hypotheses and questions focusing on Sarcopoterium spinosum as a model species in a fully factorial container experiment with three shading levels and two levels of water availability. The results demonstrate that moderate shading (50%) ameliorates seedling performance (measured by final biomass) under dry conditions. In contrast, when water was available, shading had a monotonic negative effect on seedling performance. Conversely, shade and drought had an independent effect on biomass partitioning and under drought allocation to roots increased, while under shade allocation to leaves increased. The dry conditions did not cause a reduction in shade tolerance, and both shade avoidance and tolerance morphology were evidenced under moderate (50%) and deep (70%) shading (stem elongation, increased leaf area). Deep rooting - a drought-avoidance trait - was similar in high and low water availability. Our overall results support the hypothesis that shade ameliorates drought stress. Moreover, S. spinosum demonstrates that woody species inhabiting water-limited ecosystems may have a repertoire of traits that allows simultaneous tolerance to both drought and shade.

AB Rotifers play an important role in biogeochemical cycles and organic productivity of freshwater ecosystems due to their high metabolic rates. Information on filter feeding, their main process of energy acquisition, are relevant and still scarce for tropical regions. The rotifers of the class Bdelloidea feed by filtration or scraping consuming small food items, such as bacteria, algae, yeasts or particulate organic matter. We know little of their role in the trophic dynamics in the habitats they occupy and so the aim of this study was to quantify laboratory filtration and ingestion rates of the rotifer Philodina roseola, fed with Raphidocelis subcapitata. The experiment consisted of 10 adult exposure treatment at five concentrations approximately in the range between 104 and 107 cells mL(-1), at the temperature of 25 +/- 1 degrees C. The experiments lasted one hour and initial and final concentrations of the algal suspensions were determined by counting the number of cells in a Neubauer chamber. There were no significant differences between the initial and final concentrations of cells in the control group indicating that algal growth did not occur. Philodina roseola filtration rates varied between 0.09 and 0.25 mL ind(-1) h(-1). Given that filtration is the main process of energy acquisition by Philodina roseola, as well as for most other rotifers, and that it comprises important issues related to trophic dynamics of aquatic ecosystems, additional experimental information is especially important and need to be extended to other types of food and combinations of experimental conditions.

AB Foragers may vary in their memories regarding the location and expected quality of resources. This difference in memory often corresponds to whether a forager either simultaneously encounters or sequentially encounters its food. To test for the effects of information, I examined the foraging patterns of calliope hummingbirds consuming different concentrations of sucrose that were marked or unmarked. I also examined the effects of uncertainty associated with alternative food sources by altering the mean and variance in sucrose concentration in marked and unmarked feeders. I found that hummingbirds feeding from marked feeders were more selective when Rich (= high sucrose items) and Poor (= low sucrose items) resources occurred in distinct, pure patches as opposed to patches containing a mixture of Rich and Poor items. When resource types were intermixed, hummingbirds feeding on marked feeders were selective as a continuous function, and foragers feeding on unmarked feeders were selective as a nonlinear function, of the relative values of different resources. Only one prediction of foraging on marked feeders was not supported, namely when Poor-quality items were located near Rich items, calliope hummingbirds did not show a greater preference for Poor items than when Poor items were far from Rich items. This last-mentioned result may indicate that the travel distance between Rich and Poor items was too short to warrant differentiating between Rich and Poor feeders. Hummingbirds preferred marked feeders when the mean sucrose concentration was greater or equal to that of unmarked feeders, but preferred unmarked feeders when mean sucrose concentration was lower in marked feeders. There was a significant positive correlation between visits to marked feeders and the coefficient of variation of unmarked feeders. These results indicate that when all things are equal, calliope hummingbirds prefer to forage where most information is available about resource quality.

AB The industrial heritage in any landscape is represented by objects and other traces left by industry and associated human activities, which do not serve the present industry and inhabitants in the same way as they did before. Spatial concentrations of objects of such heritage form post-industrial landscapes (PILs). The paper deals with the procedures for PIL identification on a national level, classification of PILs and their initial assessment for management. Publicly accessible data sources on man-made land forms, land use, brownfields, mined sites, contaminated sites, industrial architectural heritage, etc. were used with GIS technology. The outline, area, content and topic description are essential for decision making about PIL futures. The generic classes of PILs were assessed from the viewpoint of their possible impact on human lives and activities. Preliminary PIL management proposals were developed.

AB In order to test for co-evolution of reproductive life history with body form, cluster analysis applied to nine skeletal measurements was used to identify three distinctive body types within the avian order Charadriiformes: a "sandpiper" type, a "gull/plover" type, and an "auk" type. Both in conventional analyses and in phylogenetically independent contrasts, the sandpiper body type was associated with increased values of a mass-adjusted measure of clutch volume and with decreased adult survival. A hypothesis that would explain the results is that increased reproductive effort characterizes charadriiform species with morphological features such as long bills and legs that render them vulnerable to predation, consistent with the hypothesis that reproductive effort represents a trade-off between current and future reproductive opportunities.

AB The paper studies the economy and ecology of sheep farming at the farm level in a Nordic context, with a crucial distinction between the outdoors grazing season and the winter indoors feeding season, and where climate conditions fix the length of the grazing season. Two different categories of animals, ewes (adult females) and lambs, and one plant species are included in our ecological model. The farmer is assumed to maximize present-value profit where the revenue is made up income from meat and wool production. We find that livestock cycles may represent an optimal management policy. We also show that in a possible steady state with a constant number of animals and constant vegetation quantity, slaughtering either only lambs or only ewes is optimal.

AB Variations in the quality or quantity of a food source determines if an animal takes the risk of spending energy searching for or eating it. Hummingbirds have been traditionally catalogued as risk-averse foragers. However, the inclusion of more than 2 options in a foraging set for risk-sensitive experiments has resulted in the observation that some hummingbird species preferred intermediate risk even if they had been risk-averse in a traditional binary risk experiment. These contrasting results suggest an effect of having multiple foraging options that had been ignored due to the design of previous risk experiments. Here, we studied the influence of varying reward volume (Experiment 1) or sugar concentration (Experiment 2) on choice behavior of white-eared hummingbirds, Hylocharis leucotis, by recording their visits to feed from a sucrose solution located in 4 artificial floral arrays associated with constant, low, medium, and high variance. In both experiments, each of the vertical arrays was evaluated in a training stage and a test stage. The birds visited all the arrays without discriminating among them, and thus were indifferent to variations in the volume or sugar concentration of reward. Thus, there was no influence of variance of nectar volume and sugar concentration on the choice behavior of the birds, ruling out the possibility that white-eared hummingbirds are risk sensitive under these conditions of 4 foraging alternatives.

AB The study provides an analysis of the strengths; weaknesses; opportunities and threats (SWOT) of the scientific researches carried out in the field of marine environment and fisheries in the Kingdom of Bahrain from 1960s until 2011. Internationally recognized databases such as SCOPUS, E-village, Science Direct, Google were used and 82 articles were collected. A recent bibliography of fisheries issued by the Bahrain Centre for Studies and Research included 328 research titles but only 40 were published in refereed scientific journals and therefore were added. Overall, a total of 122 articles which were published in peer-reviewed journals covered a diverse topics and included Fisheries and Fisheries' Management (18 articles, 14.8%); Ecology of selected habitats (29 articles or 23.8%); Biology of fishes, oysters, crabs, sea urchins, mollusk and shrimps (20 articles or 16.4%); Mari-culture technology, management and fish feed (9 articles or 7.4%); Pollution monitoring in biota, sediment and water including bacteriological studies (45 articles, 36.9%) and Recreation as a management resource (1 article or 0.8%). Pollution received the highest proportion of research interests followed by Ecology and Fisheries. Despite the amount of efforts that were made, gaps in our knowledge. of the marine environment and marine organisms of Bahrain remain wide. There is a need for more research in this field of studies. If more data gathered in a collaborated manner on a regular basis, it would be an invaluable management resource for both fisheries and the wellbeing of the marine environment in Bahrain.

AB We implemented the 1-D lake ecosystem model DYRESM-CAEDYM (DYCD) to the subtropical meso-eutrophic Lake Kinneret, in order to determine an acceptable management policy based on sustainability criteria. The sustainability criteria were defined based on the Lake Kinneret system of water quality indices (WQI) and composite water quality index (CWQI) developed for the lake. The CWQI was evaluated by number of parameters that are monitored routinely at the lake and provide an overall picture of many of the ecosystem processes.
   Both the WQI and CWQI were applied in conjunction with output from 10 yr model scenarios, which included a wide range of nutrient loads and lake levels. In both cases, the scenarios covered a range wider than that historically observed in the lake. The scenarios included both simple cases of changes to one of the management forcing variables (e. g. lake level) and more complex cases that modified multiple forcing variables in tandem. We used the hydroecological model DYCD and ran it at WLs ranging between -209 to -218 m under varying nutrient loads, 0.56 to 56.6 gNm-(2)y(-1) and 0.039 to 3.9 gPm-(2)y(-1).
   For levels ranging between -209 to -213.4m simulation results allowed us to assess the direct relationships between nutrient loads and CWQI. The graphical solution of these relationships represents a "polygon" of permissible ranges and critical values of nutrient loads allowing conservation of the lake WQ at each WL. We used the combination of the model scenario results and the quantified WQ output to define a 3D (TN, TP and water level) space of acceptable management measures. The space defines the magnitude of management measures that can be performed on the lake ecosystem while sustaining the ecosystem.
   The results suggest a wider than expected range of management measures that can be used in the lake ecosystem, but the reaction of the ecosystem to the measures is not linear. As a result, reducing management measures does not always lead to improved sustainability.
   This approach is unique, and the first example of implementation of a management tool that integrates nutrient loads and WL through a WQ system. This approach could be implemented in other lakes around the world that suffer from deterioration in water quality as a result of changes in water level and nutrients loads.
   The application of a process based model, such as DYCD, has provided a means for examining the impact of external forcing on the lake ecosystem, beyond the observed historical conditions, and over extended periods of time. Our study demonstrates the major advantage associated with the use of process based ecosystem models as a tool for research and management.

AB While overgrazing is widely recognized as one of the primary drivers of desertification, unlike other environmental problems, many countries have not taken basic measures to address it. After considering the sociological and biological dynamics associated with the phenomenon, the article reviews polices designed to reach sustainable levels of grazing that have been adopted in several countries. Establishing and implementing 'stocking limits' which ensure that land's carrying capacity is not exceeded have proven to be highly effective. The article reviews how such limits are set and responds to critics of such policies, arguing that in countries with pastoral populations, command and control provisions to limit grazing should be a critical component of national efforts to protect the commons.

AB A modified type of species size-frequency distribution or "taxonomic size spectrum" (TSS) was applied to analyze phytoplankton structural change under environmental impacts, using Lake Kinneret as a monitoring database. While the 'traditional' TSS (TTSS) describes the distribution of the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) number into size classes, the frequency-weighted TSS (FTSS) distributes the frequency of occurrence of OTUs in water samples, accounting for the water mass occupancy by algal species, i.e., the time-spatial structure of the Studied assemblage. FTSS consistency was proven for two dramatically different monitoring periods, where the "extreme" period (1996-1999) was characterized by pronounced deformations of the established patterns of phytoplankton annual succession for the "stable" period (1982-1985). Quantitative similarity estimates for the phytoplankton assemblage taxonomic time-spatial structure were produced by cluster analysis. Specific changes in the FTSS fine structure were evident and helpful for diagnostics, being more pronounced during the extreme years. The descriptors providing quantitative similarity comparisons for the aquatic assemblage structure. while not requiring deep taxonomic knowledge, may be helpful for take managers and environmental agencies.

AB Forests cover 57% (11500 km(2)) of Slovenia and have primarily been preserved in higher and steeper locations less suitable for agriculture, where their protection significance has been even higher. Floodplain forests on the other hand have been under severe pressure since times of the first settlement and they have been severely affected by heavy cutting of pedunculate oak and extensive regulation of watercourses over the past hundred years. In the last decades land consolidation and drainage of fields to increase crop productivity or to reclaim wetlands for cultivation have decreased structural diversity in land use. As a consequence, vitality and natural regeneration of those forests have decreased where pedunculate oak in particular is showing most severe decline.
   A spatial model was used to assess the depth of the interior environment of forests and forest patches and to determine the agricultural landscapes, which have lost self-organising and regenerative properties. By using the spatial model and historical data we obtained from the forest areas and according to the data from the 18(th) century military reaps, we can conclude the forest areas to represent the cores of the primary floodplain forests in Slovenia. In the light of further preservation of key-tree species an experiment was carried out in two bigger pedunculate-oak forest patches where critical groundwater level for efficient regeneration was defined. Not only did water regime change, but also emissions, management errors from the past and consequences of a changed water table may also play an important role in future management perspective of Slovenian floodplain forests.

   stress
SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE evolutionary strategy response; environment stress
ID HABITAT; DYNAMICS
AB Two revised drafts about a simple evolution trade-off function studied by Mitchell (Mitchell, 2000) were put up first. Considering the complex of the environment, or the nonlinear interaction of the environment and species, we put up two new cost functions: c( u, z) = c(0) + c(1) u + k(z + az(2))/u, u > 0; c(u,z) = c(0) + c(1) u + kz(d)/u, u > 0, d > 0.
   In the first case, if the environment is adverse to species (a > 0), the region of low-stress which is more suitable for the intolerant species is very small, and at the same environment stress z, the tolerant species will pay the more cost than it will paid in the normal environment. However the tolerant species will pay more cost but low strategies in the environment of a < 0 than that it win paid in the environment of a = 0 or a > 0.
   In the second case, the results showed that the greater the stress of the environment is, or the more complex the environment is, the lower cost the intolerant species will pay in the region of z < 1. In order to exist or to evolve from an environment of high-stress, the organisms must possess a higher u, or a better means of mitigating of the stress of environment. Meanwhile in the region d > 1, when d decrease, the intolerant species will pays more lower cost of exploiting a habitat in the low-stress environment while the tolerant one will pays more lower cost in the high-stress environment. This means that scale d describes the selection character of the species system in the evolution process, the smaller the d (d < 1) is, the better the selection or the mitigation the system will possesses.

AB Most staff in CSIRO Wildlife and Ecology are drawn to the smells, the tastes, the sights and the very feel of nature, and commenced their careers because of that commitment to nature. This chapter traces the evolution of the discipline of ecology from Charles Elton's Presidential address to the British Ecology Society in January 1949 to the present day. Five primary themes are discussed: predicting where species are, population ecology including the theories of island biogeography and predator-prey and plant-herbivore dynamics, biological diversity and species richness, community and ecosystem dynamics including equilibrium, stability and resilience theory, and finally applied ecology leading to development of the concept of complex adaptive systems. The integrative nature of ecology places the discipline in a dominant position to address the issue of sustainability and the planning and managing of ecosystems.

   SEDIMENTS
AB Life in the presence of high salt concentrations is compatible with life in the absence of oxygen. Halophilic and halotolerant anaerobic prokaryotes are found both in the archaeal and in the bacterial domain, and they display a great metabolic diversity. Many of the representatives of the Halobacteriales (Archaea), which are generally considered aerobes, have the potential of anaerobic growth. Some can use alternative electron accepters such as nitrate, fumarate, dimethylsulfoxide or trimethylamine-N-oxide Halobacterium salinarum can also grow fermentatively on L-arginine, and bacteriorhodopsin-containing cells may even grow anaerobically, energized by light. Obligatory anaerobic halophilic methanogenic Archaea also exist. The bacterial domain contains many anaerobic halophiles, including sulfate reducers. There is also a group of specialized obligatory anaerobic Bacteria, phylogenetically clustering in the low G-I-C branch of the Firmicutes. Most representatives of this group (order Haloanaerobiales, families Haloanaerobiaceae and Halobacteroidaceae) are fermentative, using a variety of carbohydrates and amino acids. One species combines the potential for anaerobic growth at high salt concentrations with a preference for high temperatures. Others are homoacetogens; Acetohalobium arabaticum can grow anaerobically as a chemolithotroph, producing acetate from hydrogen and CO2. The Haloanaerobiales accumulate high concentrations of K+ and Cl- in their cytoplasm, thereby showing a strategy of salt adaptation similar to that used by the Halobactariales Recently a new representative of the Haloanaerobiales was isolated from bottom sediments of the Dead Sea (strain DSSe1), which grows anaerobically by oxidation of glycerol to acetate and CO2 while reducing selenate to selenite and elementary selenium. Other electron accepters supporting anaerobic growth of this strain are nitrate and trimethylamine-N-oxide. The versatility of life at high salt concentrations with respect to the variety of substrates used, the types of dissimilatory metabolism, and the diversity of potential electron accepters has important implications for the potential for life in hostile environments lacking oxygen and high in salt, implications that may also be relevant to astrobiology.
