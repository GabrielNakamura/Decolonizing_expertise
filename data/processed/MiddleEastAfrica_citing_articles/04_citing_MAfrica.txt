AB The turbidity of lakes is generally considered to be a smooth function of their nutrient status. However, recent results suggest that over a range of nutrient concentrations, shallow lakes can have two alternative equilibria: a clear state dominated by aquatic vegetation, and a turbid state characterized by high algal biomass. This bi-stability has important implications for the possibilities of restoring eutrophied shallow lakes. Nutrient reduction alone may have little impact on water clarity, but an ecosystem disturbance like foodweb manipulation can bring the lake back to a stable clear state. We discuss the reasons why alternative equilibria are theoretically expected in shallow lakes, review evidence from the field and evaluate recent applications of this insight in lake management.

AB Deer have expanded their range and increased dramatically in abundance worldwide in recent decades. They inflict major economic losses in forestry, agriculture, and transportation and contribute to the transmission of several animal and human diseases. Their impact on natural ecosystems is also dramatic but less quantified. By foraging selectively, deer affect the growth and survival of many herb, shrub, and tree species, modifying patterns of relative abundance and vegetation dynamics. Cascading effects on other species extend to insects, birds, and other mammals. In forests, sustained overbrowsing reduces plant cover and diversity, alters nutrient and carbon cycling, and redirects succession to shift future overstory composition. Many of these simplified alternative states appear to be stable and difficult to reverse. Given the influence of deer on other organisms and natural processes, ecologists should actively participate in efforts to understand, monitor, and reduce the impact of deer on ecosystems.

AB There is increasing interest in developing better predictive tools and a broader conceptual framework to guide the restoration of degraded land. Traditionally, restoration efforts have focused on re-establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions, relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However, strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional-based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization, loss of native species pools, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions and/or invasion by exotics, and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify, prioritize and address these constraints.

AB The removal of cell-bound water through air drying and the addition of water to air-dried cells are forces that have played a pivotal role in the evolution of the prokatyotes. In bacterial cells that have been subjected to air drying, the evaporation of free cytoplasmic water (V-f) can be instantaneous, and an equilibrium between cell-bound water (V-b) and the environmental water (vapor) potential (Psi(wv)) may be achieved rapidly. In the air-dried state some bacteria survive only for seconds whereas others can tolerate desiccation for thousands, perhaps millions, of years. The desiccated (anhydrobiotic) cell is characterized by its singular lack of water-with contents as low as 0.02 g of H2O g (dry weight)(-1). At these levels the monolayer coverage by water of macromolecules, including DNA and proteins, is disturbed. As a consequence the mechanisms that confer desiccation tolerance upon air-dried bacteria are markedly different from those, such as the mechanism of preferential exclusion of compatible solutes, that preserve the integrity of salt-, osmotically, and freeze-thaw-stressed cells. Desiccation tolerance reflects a complex array of interactions at the structural, physiological, and molecular levels. Many of the mechanisms remain cryptic, but it is clear. that they involve interactions, such as those between proteins and co-solvents, that derive from the unique properties of the wafer molecule. A water replacement hypothesis accounts for how the nonreducing disaccharides trehalose and sucrose preserve the integrity of membranes and proteins Nevertheless, we have virtually pro insight into the state of the cytoplasm of an air-dried cell. There is no evidence for any obvious adaptations of proteins that can counter the effects of air drying or for the occurrence of any proteins that provide a direct and a tangible contribution to cell stability. Among the prokaryotes that can exist as anhydrobiotic cells, the cyanobacteria have a marked capacity to do so. One form, Nostoc commune, encompasses a number of the features that appear to be critical to the withstanding of a long-term water deficit, including the elaboration of a conspicuous extracellular glycan, synthesis of abundant UV-absorbing pigments, and maintenance of protein stability and structural integrity There are indications of a growing technology for air-dried cells and enzymes. Paradoxically, desiccation tolerance of bacteria has virtually been ignored for the past quarter century. The present review considers what is known, and what is not known, about desiccation, a phenomenon that impinges upon every facet of the distributions and activities of prokaryotic cells.

AB The future of humanity depends on whether or not we have a vision to guide our transition toward sustainability, on scales ranging from local landscapes to the planet as a whole. Sustainability science is at the core of this vision, and landscapes and regions represent a pivotal scale domain. The main objectives of this paper are: (1) to elucidate key definitions and concepts of sustainability, including the Brundtland definition, the triple bottom line, weak and strong sustainability, resilience, human well-being, and ecosystem services; (2) to examine key definitions and concepts of landscape sustainability, including those derived from general concepts and those developed for specific landscapes; and (3) to propose a framework for developing a science of landscape sustainability. Landscape sustainability is defined as the capacity of a landscape to consistently provide long-term, landscape-specific ecosystem services essential for maintaining and improving human well-being. Fundamentally, well-being is a journey, not a destination. Landscape sustainability science is a place-based, use-inspired science of understanding and improving the dynamic relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being in changing landscapes under uncertainties arising from internal feedbacks and external disturbances. While landscape sustainability science emphasizes place-based research on landscape and regional scales, significant between landscape interactions and hierarchical linkages to both finer and broader scales (or externalities) must not be ignored. To advance landscape sustainability science, spatially explicit methods are essential, especially experimental approaches that take advantage of designed landscapes and multi-scaled simulation models that couple the dynamics of landscape services (ecosystem services provided by multiple landscape elements in combination as emergent properties) and human well-being.

TI Alternative stable states in ecology
SO FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Review
ID THRESHOLDS; RESILIENCE; STABILITY; SYSTEMS
AB The idea that alternative stable states may exist in communities has been a recurring theme in ecology since the late 1960s, and is now experiencing a resurgence of interest. Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental "drivers". We review the theory behind alternative stable states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ. We discuss the concepts of resilience and hysteresis, and the role of stochasticity within the two formulations. In spite of differences in the two perspectives, the same type of experimental evidence is required to demonstrate the existence of alternative stable states.

AB This paper considers key issues in plant invasion ecology, where findings published since 1990 have significantly improved our understanding of many aspects of invasions. The review focuses on vascular plants invading natural and semi-natural ecosystems, and on fundamental ecological issues relating to species invasiveness and community invasibility. Three big questions addressed by the SCOPE programme in the 1980s (which species invade; which habitats are invaded; and how can we manage invasions?) still underpin most work in invasion ecology. Some organizing and unifying themes in the field are organism-focused and relate to species invasiveness (the tens rule; the concept of residence time; taxonomic patterns and Darwin's naturalization hypothesis; issues of phenotypic plasticity and rapid evolutionary change, including evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis; the role of long-distance dispersal). Others are ecosystem-centred and deal with determinants of the invasibility of communities, habitats and regions (levels of invasion, invasibility and propagule pressure; the biotic resistance hypothesis and the links between diversity and invasibility; synergisms, mutualisms, and invasional meltdown). Some theories have taken an overarching approach to plant invasions by integrating the concepts of species invasiveness and community invasibility (a theory of seed plant invasiveness; fluctuating resources theory of invasibility). Concepts, hypotheses and theories reviewed here can be linked to the naturalization-invasion continuum concept, which relates invasion processes with a sequence of environmental and biotic barriers that an introduced species must negotiate to become casual, naturalized and invasive. New research tools and improved research links between invasion ecology and succession ecology, community ecology, conservation biology and weed science, respectively, have strengthened the conceptual pillars of invasion ecology.

AB with recent increases in the numbers of species reintroduction projects and reintroduction-related publications, there is now a recognizable field of reintroduction biology. Nevertheless, research thus far has been fragmented and ad hoc, rather than an organized attempt to gain reliable knowledge to improve reintroduction success. We reviewed 454 recent (1990-2005) peer-reviewed papers dealing with wildlife reintroductions from 101 journals. Most research has been retrospective, either opportunistic evaluations of techniques or general project summaries, and most inference is gained from post hoc interpretation of monitoring results on a species-by-species basis. Documentation of reintroduction outcomes has improved, however, and the derivation of more general principles via meta-analyses is expected to increase. The fragmentation of the reintroduction literature remains an obstacle. There is scope to improve reintroduction biology by greater application of the hypothetico-deductive method, particularly through the use of modeling approaches and well-designed experiments. Examples of fruitful approaches in reintroduction research include experimental studies to improve outcomes from the release of captive-bred animals, use of simulation modeling to identify factors affecting the viability of reintroduced populations, and the application of spatially explicit models to plan for and evaluate reintroductions. We recommend that researchers contemplating future reintroductions carefully determine a priori the specific goals, overall ecological purpose, and inherent technical and biological limitations of a given reintroduction and that evaluation processes incorporate both experimental and modeling approaches. We suggest that the best progress will be made when multidisciplinary teams of resource managers and scientists work in close collaboration and when results from comparative analyses, experiments, and modeling are combined within and among studies.

AB Coral reef bleaching, the whitening of diverse invertebrate taxa, results from the loss of symbiotic zooxanthellae and/or a reduction in photosynthetic pigment concentrations in zooxanthellae residing within the gastrodermal tissues of host animals. Of particular concern are the consequences of bleaching of large numbers of reef-building scleractinian corals and hydrocorals. Published records of coral reef bleaching events from 1870 to the present suggest that the frequency (60 major events from 1979 to 1990), scale (co-occurrence in many coral reef regions and often over the bathymetric depth range of corals) and severity (> 95% mortality in some areas) of recent bleaching disturbances are unprecedented in the scientific literature. The causes of small scale, isolated bleaching events can often be explained by particular stressors (e.g., temperature, salinity, light, sedimentation, aerial exposure and pollutants), but attempts to explain large scale bleaching events in terms of possible global change (e.g., greenhouse warming, increased UV radiation flux, deteriorating ecosystem health, or some combination of the above) have not been convincing. Attempts to relate the severity and extent of large scale coral reef bleaching events to particular causes have been hampered by a lack of (a) standardized methods to assess bleaching and (b) continuous, long-term data bases of environmental conditions over the periods of interest. An effort must be made to understand the impact of bleaching on the remainder of the reef community and the long-term effects on competition, predation, symbioses, bioerosion and substrate condition, all factors that can influence coral recruitment and reef recovery. If projected rates of sea warming are realized by mid to late AD 2000, i.e. a 2-degrees-C increase in high latitude coral seas, the upper thermal tolerance limits of many reef-building corals could be exceeded. Present evidence suggests that many corals would be unable to adapt physiologically or genetically to such marked and rapid temperature in creases.

AB Humans and climate affect ecosystems and their services(1), which may involve continuous and discontinuous transitions from one stable state to another(2). Discontinuous transitions are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic changes of ecosystems identified(1). For terrestrial ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent transitions(3,4). Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach. In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton model, we show that local positive interactions among plants can explain such power-law distributions. Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field data revealed consistent deviations from power laws. Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in the model. When grazing was further increased in the model, we found that these deviations always and only occurred close to transition to desert, independent of the type of transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover. Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be a warning signal for the onset of desertification.

AB A recently documented correlate of anthropogenic climate change involves reductions in body size, the nature and scale of the pattern leading to suggestions of a third universal response to climate warming. Because body size affects thermoregulation and energetics, changing body size has implications for resilience in the face of climate change. A review of recent studies shows heterogeneity in the magnitude and direction of size responses, exposing a need for large-scale phylogenetically controlled comparative analyses of temporal size change. Integrative analyses of museum data combined with new theoretical models of size-dependent thermoregulatory and metabolic responses will increase both understanding of the underlying mechanisms and physiological consequences of size shifts and, therefore, the ability to predict the sensitivities of species to climate change.

AB In this review, we highlight new insights into the conceptualization of the vulnerability of social-environmental systems and identify critical points of convergence of what otherwise might be characterized as disparate fields of research. We argue that a diversity of approaches to studying vulnerability is necessary in order to address the full complexity of the concept and that the approaches are in large part complementary. An emerging consensus on the issues of critical importance to vulnerability reduction-including concerns of equity and social justice-and growing synergy among conceptual frameworks promise even greater relevancy and utility for decision makers in the near future. We synthesize the current literature with an outline of core assessment components and key questions to guide the trajectory of future research.

AB The criteria of restoration success should be clearly established to evaluate restoration projects. Recently, the Society of Ecological Restoration International (SER) has produced a Primer that includes ecosystem attributes that should be considered when evaluating restoration success. To determine how restoration success has been evaluated in restoration projects, we reviewed articles published in Restoration Ecology (Vols. 1[1]-11[4]). Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) what measures of ecosystem attributes are assessed and (2) how are these measures used to determine restoration success. No study has measured all the SER Primer attributes, but most studies did include at least one measure in each of three general categories of the ecosystem attributes: diversity, vegetation structure, and ecological processes. Most of the reviewed studies are using multiple measures to evaluate restoration success, but we would encourage future projects to include: (1) at least two variables within each of the three ecosystem attributes that clearly related to ecosystem functioning and (2) at least two reference sites to capture the variation that exist in ecosystems.

AB Human impacts on the world's oceans have been substantial, leading to concerns about the extinction of marine taxa. We have compiled 133 local, regional and global extinctions of marine populations. There is typically a 53-year lag between the last sighting of an organism and the reported date of the extinction at whatever scale this has occurred. Most disappearances (80%) were detected using indirect historical comparative methods, which suggests that marine extinctions may have been underestimated because of low-detection power. Exploitation caused most marine losses at various scales (55%), followed closely by habitat loss (37%), while the remainder were linked to invasive species, climate change, pollution and disease. Several perceptions concerning the vulnerability of marine organisms appear to be too general and insufficiently conservative. Marine species cannot be considered less vulnerable on the basis of biological attributes such as high fecundity or large-scale dispersal characteristics. For commercially exploited species, it is often argued that economic extinction of exploited populations will occur before biological extinction, but this is not the case for non-target species caught in multispecies fisheries or species with high commercial value, especially if this value increases as species become rare. The perceived high potential for recovery, high variability and low extinction vulnerability of fish populations have been invoked to avoid listing commercial species of fishes under international threat criteria. However, we need to learn more about recovery, which may be hampered by negative population growth at small population sizes (Allee effect or depensation) or ecosystem shifts, as well as about spatial dynamics and connectivity of subpopulations before we can truly understand the nature of responses to severe depletions. The evidence suggests that fish populations do not fluctuate more than those of mammals, birds and butterflies, and that fishes may exhibit vulnerability similar to mammals, birds and butterflies. There is an urgent need for improved methods of detecting marine extinctions at various spatial scales, and for predicting the vulnerability of species.

AB Grazing distribution patterns of large herbivores are affected by abiotic factors such as slope and distance to water and by biotic factors such as forage quantity and quality, Abiotic factors are the primary determinants of large-scale distribution patterns and act as constraints within which mechanisms involving biotic factors operate, Usually there is a proportional relationship between the time large herbivores spend in a plant community and the available quantity and quality of forage, This grazing pattern may result from decisions made by animals at different spatial and temporal scales, Foraging velocity decreases and intake rate increases in areas of abundant palatable forage, These non-cognitive mechanisms that occur at smaller spatial scales (bites, feeding stations, small patches) could result in observed grazing patterns, However, large herbivores also appear to select areas (patches and feeding sites) to graze, Optimal foraging models and other models assume animals use ''rules of thumb'' to decide where to forage, A cognitive mechanism assumes animals use spatial memory in their foraging decisions. With such abilities, large herbivores could return to nutrient-rich sites more frequently than to nutrient-poor sites, Empirical studies indicate that large herbivores have accurate spatial memories and have the ability to use spatial memory to improve foraging efficiency, Body size and perceptual abilities can constrain the choices animals can make during foraging, A conceptual model was developed to demonstrate how cognitive foraging mechanisms could work within constraints imposed by abiotic factors, Preliminary predictions of the model correspond to observed grazing patterns, Recognizing that large herbivores may use previous experiences to decide where to forage may be useful in developing new techniques to modify grazing patterns, Grazing distribution patterns appear to result from decisions and processes made at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.

AB Determining how climate change will affect global ecology and ecosystem services is one of the next important frontiers in environmental science. Many species already exhibit smaller sizes as a result of climate change and many others are likely to shrink in response to continued climate change, following fundamental ecological and metabolic rules. This could negatively impact both crop plants and protein sources such as fish that are important for human nutrition. Furthermore, heterogeneity in response is likely to upset ecosystem balances. We discuss future research directions to better understand the trend and help ameliorate the trophic cascades and loss of biodiversity that will probably result from continued decreases in organism size.

AB Ungulates can profoundly alter the structure and composition of forest communities via both direct and indirect mechanisms. Individual plant species often respond in a unique way to the direct effect of herbivory as a function of their sensitivity to browse damage, ungulate food preferences, and the density of ungulates present. Sustained browsing pressure can limit the regeneration of favored and susceptible woody plants and eliminate populations of favored or susceptible herbaceous plants. These losses, in turn, give rise to indirect effects via trophic cascades or physical habitat modification. These indirect effects affect many other plant and animal populations. In the mixed conifer-hardwood forests around the Great Lakes in North America, widespread habitat modification and the extirpation of native predators and other ungulates have acted to boost populations of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to historically high densities. Such densities have curtailed regeneration of several important conifers (e.g. Tsuga canadensis and Thuja occidentalis) as evidenced by demographic analysis. Deer also appear to limit regeneration of Quercus and Betula in many areas. Impacts on understory herbs are harder to assess, but baseline data from 50 years ago indicate that these communities are changing in a pattern that implicates deer: grasses, sedges, and some ferns are increasing while overall herb diversity is declining. Thus, deer are playing a keystone role in these communities. We are currently assessing an additional set of questions, including: How best can we measure and represent ungulate impacts? At which densities do deer threaten forest diversity? How do impacts depend on initial plant and ungulate densities? Which species emerge as 'winners' or 'losers' in heavily-browsed landscapes? What characteristics or traits make a species susceptible to ungulate herbivory? How do ungulates affect patterns of diversity and relative abundance in ecological communities? What are the pathways by which ungulates exert indirect effects on species? and How significant are indirect effects? (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Biological invasions are caused by human-mediated extra-range dispersal and, unlike natural extra-range dispersal, are often the result of multiple introductions from multiple sources to multiple locations. The processes and opportunities that result in propagulles moving from one area to another can be used more broadly to differentiate all types of extra-range dispersal. By examining key properties of dispersal pathways (notably propagule pressure, genetic diversity and the potential for simultaneous movement of coevolved species), the establishment and evolutionary trajectories of extra-range dispersal can be better understood. Moreover, elucidation of the mechanistic properties of dispersal pathways is crucial for scientists and managers who wish to assist, minimise or prevent future movements of organisms.

AB Multiscale patterns of spatial and temporal variation in density and population structure were used to evaluate the generality of a three-trophic-level cascade among sea otters (Enhydra lutris), invertebrate herbivores, and macroalgae in Alaska. The paradigm holds that where sea otters occur herbivores are rare and plants are abundant, whereas when sea otters are absent herbivores are relatively common and plants are rare. Spatial patterns were based on 20 randomly placed quadrats at 153 randomly selected sites distributed among five locations with and four locations without sea otters. Both sea urchin and kelp abundance differed significantly among locations with vs. without sea otters in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska. There was little (Aleutian Islands) or no (southeast Alaska) overlap between sites with and without sea otters, in plots of kelp density against urchin biomass. Despite intersite variation in the abundance of kelps and herbivores, these analyses demonstrate that sea otter predation has a predictable and broadly generalizable influence on the structure of Alaskan kelp forests. The percent cover of algal turf and suspension feeder assemblages also differed significantly (although less dramatically) between locations with and without sea otters.
   Temporal variation in community structure was assessed over periods of from 3 to 15 yr at sites in the Aleutian Islands and southeast Alaska where sea otters were 1) continuously present, 2) continuously absent, or 3) becoming reestablished because of natural range expansion. Kelp and sea urchin abundance remained largely unchanged at most sites where sea otters were continuously present or absent, the one exception being at Torch Bay (southeast Alaska), where kelp abundance varied significantly through time and urchin abundance varied significantly among sites because of episodic and patchy disturbances. In contrast, kelp and sea urchin abundances changed significantly, and in the expected directions, at sites that were being recolonized by sea otters. Sea urchin biomass declined by 50% in the Aleutian Islands and by nearly 100% in southeast Alaska following the spread of sea otters into previously unoccupied habitats. In response to these different rates and magnitudes of urchin reduction by sea otter predation, increases in kelp abundance were abrupt and highly significant in southeast Alaska but much smaller and slower over similar time periods in the Aleutian Islands.
   The different kelp colonization rates between southeast Alaska and the Aleutian Islands appear to be caused by large-scale differences in echinoid recruitment coupled with size-selective predation by sea otters for larger urchins. The length of urchin jaws (correlated with test diameter, r(2) = 0.968) in sea otter seats indicates that sea urchins <15-20 mm test diameter are rarely eaten by foraging sea otters. Sea urchin populations in the Aleutian Islands included high densities of small individuals (<20 mm test diameter) at all sites and during all years sampled, whereas in southeast Alaska similarly sized urchins were absent from most populations during most years. Small (<30-35 mm test diameter) tetracycline-marked urchins in the Aleutian Islands grew at a maximum rate of approximate to 10 mm/yr; thus the population must have significant recruitment annually, or at least every several years. In contrast, echinoid recruitment in southeast Alaska was more episodic, with marry years to perhaps decades separating significant events. Our findings help explain regional differences in recovery rates of kelp forests following recolonization by sea otters.

AB Observations over a 30-yr period revealed a considerable degree of natural variation in the abundance of corals on Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. Cover ranged from <0.1% to >80%, with a similar large range in colony density, at several temporal and spatial scales. Much of this variation was due to the type, intensity, and spatial scale of disturbances that occurred. Coral assemblages usually recovered from acute disturbances, both on Heron Island and on other Indo-Pacific reefs. In contrast, corals did not recover from chronic disturbances of either natural or human origins, or from gradual declines. Recovery was slower after acute disturbances that altered the physical environment than after disturbances that simply killed or damaged corals. The space and time scales of declines and recoveries in abundance were much smaller on the wave-exposed side of the reef than on the side protected from storms. Recruitment rates were reduced by preemption of space by corals or macroalgae, and by storms that altered the substratum. Thus, the dynamics of abundance in this coral community can be largely understood through the variation in types and scales of disturbances that occurred, and the processes that took place where disturbances were rare.

AB The study of positive species interactions is a rapidly evolving field in ecology. Despite decades of research, controversy has emerged as to whether positive and negative interactions predictably shift with increasing environmental stress as hypothesised by the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH). Here, we provide a synthesis of 727 tests of the SGH in plant communities across the globe to examine its generality across a variety of ecological factors. Our results show that plant interactions change with stress through an outright shift to facilitation (survival) or a reduction in competition (growth and reproduction). In a limited number of cases, plant interactions do not respond to stress, but they never shift towards competition with stress. These findings are consistent across stress types, plant growth forms, life histories, origins (invasive vs. native), climates, ecosystems and methodologies, though the magnitude of the shifts towards facilitation with stress is dependent on these factors. We suggest that future studies should employ standardised definitions and protocols to test the SGH, take a multi-factorial approach that considers variables such as plant traits in addition to stress, and apply the SGH to better understand how species and communities will respond to environmental change.

AB We analyzed published rates of extracellular release (ER) of organic carbon to determine the primary constraints on this process and its importance to bacteria. From 16 studies we extracted observations of ER, particulate primary production (PP), and phytoplankton biomass. In a regression model based on 225 observations, PP explained 69% of the variance in ER. From this model we estimate the average percent extracellular release (PER) to be 13% of total fixation. The slope of this relationship does not support the hypothesis that the PER declines with increasing productivity. Differences exist between marine and freshwater systems. In lakes, ER increases nonlinearly with productivity, resulting in very low PER in very eutrophic systems. In coastal marine and estuarine systems, ER increases linearly with productivity and the PER does not vary systematically. ER is not primarily related to phytoplankton biomass as predicted by passive diffusion models. Instead, ER appears to be constrained by the total availability of photosynthates. By comparing our model to an existing model of bacterial production and assuming a 50% growth efficiency, we estimate that ER amounts to less than half the C required for bacterial growth in most pelagic systems.

AB There is an apparent gap between the prominence of present theoretical frameworks involving ecological thresholds and regime shifts, and the paucity of efforts to conduct simple tests and quantitative inferences on the actual appearance of such phenomena in ecological data. A wide range of statistical methods and analytical techniques are now available that render these questions tractable, some of them even dating back half a century. Yet, their application has been sparse and confined within a narrow subset of cases of ecological regime shifts. Our objective is to raise awareness on the range of techniques available, and to their principles and limitations, to promote a more operational approach to the identification of ecological thresholds and regime shifts.

AB Savanna ecosystems are characterized by the co-occurrence of trees and grasses. In this paper, we argue that the balance between trees and grasses is, to a large extent,determined by the indirect interactive effects of herbivory and fire. These effects are based on the positive feedback between fuel load (grass biomass) and fire intensity. An increase in the level of grazing leads to reduced fuel, load, which makes fire less intense and, thus, less damaging to trees and, consequently, results in an increase in woody vegetation. The system then switches from a state with trees and grasses to a state with solely trees. Similarly, browsers may enhance the effect of fire on trees because they reduce woody biomass, thus indirectly stimulating grass growth. This consequent increase in fuel load results in more intense fire and increased decline of biomass. The system then switches from a state with solely trees to a state with trees and grasses. We maintain that the interaction between fire and herbivory provides a mechanistic explanation for observed discontinuous changes in woody and grass biomass. This is an alternative for the soil degradation mechanism, in which there is a positive feedback between the amount of grass biomass and the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil. The soil degradation mechanism predicts no discontinuous changes, such as bush encroachment, on sandy soils. Such changes, however, are frequently observed. Therefore, the interactive effects of fire and herbivory provide a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of discontinuous changes in savanna ecosystems.

AB Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called 'early warning signals', and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.

AB We present a handy mechanistic functional response model that realistically incorporates handling (i.e., attacking and eating) and digesting prey. We briefly review current functional response theory and thereby demonstrate that such a model has been lacking so far. In our model, we treat digestion as a background process that does not prevent further foraging activities (i.e., searching and handling). Instead, we let the hunger level determine the probability that the predator searches for new prey. Additionally, our model takes into account time wasted through unsuccessful attacks. Since a main assumption of our model is that the predator's hunger is in a steady state, we term it the steady-state satiation (SSS) equation.
   The SSS equation yields a new formula for the asymptotic maximum predation rate (i.e., asymptotic maximum number of prey eaten per unit time, for prey density approaching infinity). According to this formula, maximum predation rate is determined not by the sum of the time spent for handling and digesting prey, but solely by the larger of these two terms. As a consequence, predators can be categorized into two types: handling-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by handling time) and digestion-limited predators (where maximum predation rate is limited by digestion time). We give examples of both predator types. Based on available data, we suggest that most predators are digestion limited.
   The SSS equation is a conceptual mechanistic model. Two possible applications of this model are that (1) it can be used to calculate the effects of changing predator or prey characteristics (e.g., defenses) on predation rate and (2) optimal foraging models based on the SSS equation are testable alternatives to other approaches. This may improve optimal foraging theory, since one of its major problems has been the lack of alternative models.

AB This review examines the substantial changes that have taken place in marine habitats and resources of the Gulf over the past decade. The habitats are especially interesting because of the naturally high levels of temperature and salinity stress they experience, which is important in a changing world climate. However, the extent of all natural habitats is changing and their condition deteriorating because of the rapid development of the region and, in some cases from severe, episodic warming episodes.
   Major impacts come from numerous industrial, infrastructure-based, and residential and tourism development activities, which together combine, synergistically in some cases, to cause the observed deterioration in most benthic habitats. Substantial sea bottom dredging for material and its deposition in shallow water to extend land or to form a basis for huge developments, directly removes large areas of shallow, productive habitat, though in some cases the most important effect is the accompanying sedimentation or changes to water flows and conditions. The large scale of the activities compared to the relatively shallow and small size of the water body is a particularly important issue.
   Important from the perspective of controlling damaging effects is the limited cross-border collaboration and even intra-country collaboration among government agencies and large projects. Along with the accumulative nature of impacts that occur, even where each project receives environmental assessment or attention, each is treated more or less alone, rarely in combination. However, their combination in such a small, biologically interacting sea exacerbates the overall deterioration. Very few similar areas exist which face such a high concentration of disturbance, and the prognosis for the Gulf continuing to provide abundant natural resources is poor.

AB The dynamics of invasive species may depend on their abilities to compete for resources and exploit disturbances relative to the abilities of native species. We test this hypothesis and explore its implications for the restoration of native ecosystems in one of the most dramatic ecological invasions worldwide, the replacement of native perennial grasses by exotic annual grasses and forbs in 9.2 million hectares of California grasslands. The long-term persistence of these exotic annuals has been thought to imply that the exotics are superior competitors. However, seed-addition experiments in a southern California grassland revealed that native perennial species, which had lower requirements for deep soil water, soil nitrate, and light, were strong competitors, and they markedly depressed the abundance and fecundity of exotic annuals after overcoming recruitment limitations. Native species reinvaded exotic grasslands across experimentally imposed nitrogen, water, and disturbance gradients. Thus, exotic annuals are not superior competitors but rather may dominate because of prior disturbance and the low dispersal abilities and extreme current rarity of native perennials. If our results prove to be general, it may be feasible to restore native California grassland flora to at least parts of its former range.

AB Human activities are the main current driver of global change. From hunter-gatherers through to Neolithic societies-and particularly in contemporary industrialised countries-humans have (voluntarily or involuntarily) provided other animals with food, often with a high spatio-temporal predictability. Nowadays, as much as 30-40% of all food produced in Earth is wasted. We argue here that predictable anthropogenic food subsidies (PAFS) provided historically by humans to animals has shaped many communities and ecosystems as we see them nowadays. PAFS improve individual fitness triggering population increases of opportunistic species, which may affect communities, food webs and ecosystems by altering processes such as competition, predator-prey interactions and nutrient transfer between biotopes and ecosystems. We also show that PAFS decrease temporal population variability, increase resilience of opportunistic species and reduce community diversity. Recent environmental policies, such as the regulation of dumps or the ban of fishing discards, constitute natural experiments that should improve our understanding of the role of food supply in a range of ecological and evolutionary processes at the ecosystem level. Comparison of subsidised and non-subsidised ecosystems can help predict changes in diversity and the related ecosystem services that have suffered the impact of other global change agents.

AB A review of published literature on the sensitivity of corals to turbidity and sedimentation is presented, with an emphasis on the effects of dredging. The risks and severity of impact from dredging (and other sediment disturbances) on corals are primarily related to the intensity, duration and frequency of exposure to increased turbidity and sedimentation. The sensitivity of a coral reef to dredging impacts and its ability to recover depend on the antecedent ecological conditions of the reef, its resilience and the ambient conditions normally experienced. Effects of sediment stress have so far been investigated in 89 coral species (similar to 10% of all known reef-building corals). Results of these investigations have provided a generic understanding of tolerance levels, response mechanisms, adaptations and threshold levels of corals to the effects of natural and anthropogenic sediment disturbances. Coral polyps undergo stress from high suspended-sediment concentrations and the subsequent effects on light attenuation which affect their algal symbionts. Minimum light requirements of corals range from <1% to as much as 60% of surface irradiance. Reported tolerance limits of coral reef systems for chronic suspended-sediment concentrations range from <10 mg L-1 in pristine offshore reef areas to >100 mg L-1 in marginal nearshore reefs. Some individual coral species can tolerate short-term exposure (days) to suspended-sediment concentrations as high as 1000 mg L-1 while others show mortality after exposure (weeks) to concentrations as low as 30 mg L-1. The duration that corals can survive high turbidities ranges from several days (sensitive species) to at least 5-6 weeks (tolerant species). Increased sedimentation can cause smothering and burial of coral polyps, shading, tissue necrosis and population explosions of bacteria in coral mucus. Fine sediments tend to have greater effects on corals than coarse sediments. Turbidity and sedimentation also reduce the recruitment, survival and settlement of coral larvae. Maximum sedimentation rates that can be tolerated by different corals range from <10 mg cm(-2) d(-1) to >400 mg cm(-2) d(-1). The durations that corals can survive high sedimentation rates range from <24 h for sensitive species to a few weeks (>4 weeks of high sedimentation or >14 days complete burial) for very tolerant species. Hypotheses to explain substantial differences in sensitivity between different coral species include the growth form of coral colonies and the size of the coral polyp or calyx. The validity of these hypotheses was tested on the basis of 77 published studies on the effects of turbidity and sedimentation on 89 coral species. The results of this analysis reveal a significant relationship of coral sensitivity to turbidity and sedimentation with growth form, but not with calyx size. Some of the variation in sensitivities reported in the literature may have been caused by differences in the type and particle size of sediments applied in experiments. The ability of many corals (in varying degrees) to actively reject sediment through polyp inflation, mucus production, ciliary and tentacular action (at considerable energetic cost), as well as intraspecific morphological variation and the mobility of free-living mushroom corals, further contribute to the observed differences.
   Given the wide range of sensitivity levels among coral species and in baseline water quality conditions among reefs, meaningful criteria to limit the extent and turbidity of dredging plumes and their effects on corals will always require site-specific evaluations, taking into account the species assemblage present at the site and the natural variability of local background turbidity and sedimentation.

AB We experimented on how illumination, habitat structure, and three different species of owls affected the foraging behavior of Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum, two gerbil species that coexist on sand dune habitats in the Negev Desert, Israel. We also tested how illumination and habitat structure affected rates of predation by owls on the two gerbil species. In a large aviary, we manipulated presence and absence of owls, owl species, presence and absence of illumination, and shrub cover. In response to the presence of owls or to increased illumination, gerbils foraged less, shifted foraging activity to the bush microhabitat, and quit patches at a higher giving-up density of resources. In accord with moonlight avoidance, both gerbil species suffered higher predation rates under illumination than in the absence of illumination. In addition, G. pyramidum distinguished among owl species, as indicated by changes in patch use and habitat selection. Habitat structure also affected foraging behavior and rates of predation. Gerbils foraged less in the open than in the bush microhabitat, foraged less when there was no cover present, and foraged less in the bush microhabitat when patches were encumbered by entangling branches. In accord with avoidance of open areas, both gerbil species suffered higher rates of predation when shrub cover was 0% than when shrub cover was 10%. With 0% cover, G. allenbyi suffered higher predation rates than G. pyramidum, but with 10% cover, rates of owl predation did not differ between gerbil species. Rates of owl predation on the two species corresponded to their natural patterns of macro- and microhabitat partitioning; relative to G. allenbyi, G. pyramidum predominates on open sand dunes and biases its behavior toward the open microhabitat. The results suggest that predation interacts with resource competition to determine the distribution and habitat separation of G. allenbyi and G. pyramidum.

AB Growing recognition of the importance of long-distance dispersal (LDD) of plant seeds for various ecological and evolutionary processes has led to an upsurge of research into the mechanisms underlying LDD. We summarize these findings by formulating six generalizations stating that LDD is generally more common in open terrestrial landscapes, and is typically driven by large and migratory animals, extreme meteorological phenomena, ocean currents and human transportation, each transporting a variety of seed morphologies. LDD is often associated with unusual behavior of the standard vector inferred from plant dispersal morphology, or mediated by nonstandard vectors. To advance our understanding of LDD, we advocate a vector-based research approach that identifies the significant LDD vectors and quantifies how environmental conditions modify their actions.

AB Cities may represent one of the most challenging environments for carnivorous mammals. For example, cities have a dearth of vegetation and other natural resources, coupled with increased habitat fragmentation and an abundance of roads as well as altered climate (e.g. temperature, light, rainfall and water runoff). It is therefore intriguing that several carnivore species have become established in cities across the globe. Medium-sized carnivores such as the red fox, coyote, Eurasian badger and raccoon not only survive in cities but also have managed to exploit anthropogenic food sources and shelter to their significant advantage, achieving higher population densities than are found under natural conditions. In addition, although they may not live permanently within cities, even large carnivores such as bears, wolves and hyaenas derive significant benefit from living adjacent to urbanized areas. In this review, we examine the history of urban adaptation by mammalian carnivores, explore where they are living, what they eat, what kills them and the behavioural consequences of living in urban areas. We review the biology of urban carnivores, exploring traits such as body size and dietary flexibility. Finally, we consider the consequences of having populations of carnivores in urbanized areas, both for humans and for these charismatic mammals. In conclusion, in a time of massive environmental change across the globe, the continuing encroachment of urbanization upon wilderness areas is substantially reducing the availability of natural habitats for many species; therefore, understanding the biology of any taxon that is able to adapt to and exploit anthropogenically disturbed systems must aid us in both controlling and developing suitable conservation measures for the future of such species.

AB Ecological character displacement, mostly seen as increased differences of size in sympatry between closely-related or similar species, is a focal hypothesis assuming that species too similar to one another could not coexist without diverging, owing to interspecific competition. Thus, ecological character displacement and community-wide character displacement (overdispersion in size of potential competitors within ecological guilds) were at the heart of the debate regarding the role of competition in structuring ecological communities. The debate has focused on the evidence presented in earlier studies and generated a new generation of rigorous, critical studies of communities. Character displacement research in the past two decades provides sound statistical support for the hypothesis in a wide variety of taxa, albeit with a phylogenetically skewed representation. A growing number of studies are strongly based in functional morphology, and some also demonstrate actual morphologically related resource partitioning. Phylogenetic models and experimental work have added to the scope and depth of earlier research, as have theoretical studies. However, many challenging ecological and evolutionary issues, regarding both selective forces (at the inter- and intraspecific level) and resultant patterns, remain to be addressed. Ecological character displacement and community-wide character displacement are here to stay as the focus of much exciting research.

AB Reintroduction of native species has become increasingly important in conservation worldwide for recovery of rare species and restoration purposes. However, few studies have reported the outcome of reintroduction efforts in plant species. Using data from the literature combined with a questionnaire survey, this paper analyses 249 plant species reintroductions worldwide by assessing the methods used and the results obtained from these reintroduction experiments. The objectives were: (1) to examine how successful plant species reintroductions have been so far in establishing or significantly augmenting viable, self-sustaining populations in nature; (2) to determine the conditions under which we might expect plant species reintroductions to be most successful; (3) to make the results of this survey available for future plant reintroduction trials. Results indicate that survival, flowering and fruiting rates of reintroduced plants are generally quite low (on average 52%, 19% and 16%, respectively). Furthermore, our results show a success rate decline in individual experiments with time. Survival rates reported in the literature are also much higher (78% on average) than those mentioned by survey participants (33% on average). We identified various parameters that positively influence plant reintroduction outcomes, e.g., working in protected sites, using seedlings, increasing the number of reintroduced individuals, mixing material from diverse populations, using transplants from stable source populations, site preparation or management effort and knowledge of the genetic variation of the target species. This study also revealed shortcomings of common experimental designs that greatly limit the interpretation of plant reintroduction studies: (1) insufficient monitoring following reintroduction (usually ceasing after 4 years); (2) inadequate documentation, which is especially acute for reintroductions that are regarded as failures; (3) lack of understanding of the underlying reasons for decline in existing plant populations; (4) overly optimistic evaluation of success based on short-term results; and (5) poorly defined success criteria for reintroduction projects. We therefore conclude that the value of plant reintroductions as a conservation tool could be improved by: (1) an increased focus on species biology; (2) using a higher number of transplants (preferring seedlings rather than seeds); (3) taking better account of seed production and recruitment when assessing the success of reintroductions; (4) a consistent long-term monitoring after reintroduction.

AB This article examines the statistical determinants of risk preference. In a meta-analysis of animal risk preference (foraging birds and insects), the coefficient of variation (CV), a measure of risk per unit of return, predicts choices far better than outcome variance, the risk measure of normative models. In a meta-analysis of human risk preference, the superiority of the CV over variance in predicting risk taking is not as strong. Two experiments show that people's risk sensitivity becomes strongly proportional to the CV when they learn about choice alternatives like other animals, by experiential sampling over time. Experience-based choices differ from choices when outcomes and probabilities are numerically described. Zipf's law as an ecological regularity and Weber's law as a psychological regularity may give rise to the CV as a measure of risk.

AB Multiple stable states occur when more than one type of community can stably persist in a single environmental regime. Simple theoretical analyses predict multiple stable states for (1) single species dynamics via the Allee effect, (2) two-species competitive interactions characterized by unstable coexistence, (3) some predator-prey interactions, and (4) some systems combining predation and competition. Potential examples of transitions between stable states on reefs include the failure of Diadema antillarum and Acropora cervicornis to recover following catastrophic mortality, and the replacement of microalgal turf by unpalatable macroalgae after rapid increase in the amount of substratum available for colonization by algae. Subtidal marine ecosystems in general, and reefs in particular, have several attributes which favor the existence of multiple stable states. Studies of transitions between states often need to rely upon poorly controlled, unreplicated natural ''experiments,'' as transitions typically require pulses of disturbance over very large spatial scales. The stability of a state must often be inferred from analyses of the dynamics of participants at that state, as generation times and the potential for further extrinsic disturbance preclude the use of persistence as an indicator of stability. The potential for multiple stable states strongly influences our interpretation of variability in space and time and our ability to predict reef responses to natural and man-made environmental change.

AB Mangrove communities are recognized as highly productive ecosystems that provide large quantities of organic matter to adjacent coastal waters in the form of detritus and live animals (fish, shellfish). The detritus serves as a nutrient source and is the base of an extensive food web in which organisms of commercial importance take part. In addition, mangrove ecosystems serve as shelter, feeding, and breeding zones for crustaceans, mollusks, fish of commercial importance, and resident and migratory birds. Although mangroves in the United States are protected, the systematic destruction of these ecosystems elsewhere is increasing. Deforestation of mangrove communities is thought to be one of the major reasons for the decrease in the coastal fisheries of many tropical and subtropical countries. There is evidence to propose a close microbe-nutrient-plant relationship that functions as a mechanism to recycle and conserve nutrients in the mangrove ecosystem. The highly productive and diverse microbial community living in tropical and subtropical mangrove eco-systems continuously transforms nutrients from dead mangrove vegetation into sources of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients that can be used by the plants. In turn, plant-root exudates serve as a food source for the microorgranisms living in the ecosystem with other plant material serving similarly for larger organisms like crabs. This overview summarizes the current state of knowledge of microbial transformations of nutrients in mangrove ecosystems and illustrates the important contributions these microorganisms make to the productivity of the ecosystems. To conserve the mangrove ecosystems, which are essential for the sustainable maintenance of coastal fisheries, maintenance and restoration of the microbial communities should be undertaken. Inoculation of mangrove seedlings with plant-growth-promoting bacteria may help revegetate degraded areas and create reconstructed mangrove ecosystems.

AB Understanding which drivers and barriers exist in the development of a circular economy (CE) is a relevant and timely endeavour. The aim of this paper is to contribute to this debate by analysing evidence regarding the different factors helping and hampering the development of a CE. Specifically, this paper focuses on the eco-innovation (EI) pathway towards a CE, and tries to coordinate available but fragmented findings regarding how "transformative innovation" can foster this transition while removing obstacles to sustainability. Drawing upon a new corpus of both academic and non-academic literature, this work offers a framework for analysis, as well as an evidence-based survey of the challenges, for a green structural change of the economy. We argue that the combination of the innovation systems' view with the more recent "transformation turn" in innovation studies may provide an appropriate perspective for understanding the transition to a CE. Ultimately, the paper aims to capitalise on these insights to contribute to the design of policy guidelines and organisational strategies.

AB The dynamics of arid and semiarid grazing systems are prone to the effects of highly variable rainfall, with droughts causing frequent episodic mortality in herbivore populations. This has led to the suggestion that they are nonequilibrium systems, in which animal impacts on plants are strongly attenuated or absent. We examine the utility and appropriateness of nonequilibrium concepts for understanding ecosystem processes in African rangeland, attempt to distinguish disequilibrium from nonequilibrium, and argue that such concepts do not justify the view that herbivory has little impact in climatically variable systems. We present evidence for an alternative view of African rangeland function. We argue that, despite the apparent lack of equilibrium, animal numbers are regulated in a density-dependent manner by the limited forage available in key resource areas, which are utilized in the dry season. This model asserts that strong equilibrial fords exist over a limited part of the system, with the animal population being virtually uncoupled from resources elsewhere in the system. Spatially and temporally, the whole system is heterogeneous in the strength of the forces tending to equilibrium, these diminishing with distance from watering and key resource areas and during the wet season. We argue that wet-season range is more heavily utilized by animal populations sustained by key resource areas than would apply in the absence of key resources, and that uncoupling of the animal population from vegetation carries an increased risk of degradation. Droughts may impose intense and localized defoliation on vegetation, and this may result in altered species composition, reduced rain-use efficiency, soil erosion, and loss of productive potential. Rather than ignoring degradation, policy-makers and ecologists should seek to identify the characteristics of grazing systems that predispose some systems toward degradation, while others appear to be resistant. Development policies should focus on the spatial heterogeneity in susceptibility to grazing impacts and on preserving the productive capacity of key resource areas.

AB Research studies aimed at integrating socio-economic and geo-bio-physical factors are increasingly being used in order to improve our understanding of the causes and effects of land-use change and to support sustainable landscape development. In line with such approaches, the study reported in this paper addresses land-use change and its drivers in the peripheral area of the Pyrenees National Park (PNP), France. The focus is land-use change on private farmland currently utilised by the farmers. The method relies on a Geographic Information System (GIS), including a digital terrain model, a digital cadastre map and a farm survey addressing current and past land use. For every parcel of land, data on current land-use practices and land-use histories since 1950 were collected during interviews with the farmers. An increase in land-use intensity occurred on some of the parcels in the late 1980s and 1990s, in contrast with the global processes of abandonment or extensification since the early 1960s. This intensification process appears to be related not only to the application of agri-environmental policies but also to specific local factors, in particular to the building of an access road to the highest part of the village. The respective roles of bio-physical factors (slope and elevation) and farm socio-economic factors (farmland spatial pattern, land-tenure system) on land-use change at parcel level have also been investigated. The impact of slope and elevation on land-use type appears overall to have been greater in 2003 than in 1950. However, these factors impact differently according to the types of landscape unit: they are not determining factors in the units remote from the village, but they do have an important role in the units close to the village. The distances of the parcels from the farmstead and their access facilities appear to be the two major farm-related factors in the local context. These results confirm the important role of land-management units' spatial arrangement in land-use dynamics and landscape change, as has already been found in other regions. They are seen as a valuable addition to studies aimed at supporting sustainable management of traditional mountain landscapes for multifunctional purposes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A large number of studies have presented empirical arguments for the existence of alternative stable states (ASS) in a wide range of ecological systems. However, most of these studies have used non-manipulative, indirect methods, which findings remain open for alternative explanations. Here, we review the direct evidence for ASS resulting from manipulation experiments. We distinguish four conclusive experimental approaches which test for predictions made by the hysteresis effect: (1) discontinuity in the response to an environmental driving parameter, (2) lack of recovery potential after a perturbation, (3) divergence due to different initial conditions and (4) random divergence. Based on an extensive literature search we found 35 corresponding experiments. We assessed the ecological stability of the reported contrasting states using the minimum turnover of individuals in terms of life span and classified the studies according to 4 categories: (1) experimental system, (2) habitat type, (3) involved organisms and (4) theoretical framework. 13 experiments have directly demonstrated the existence of alternative stable states while 8 showed the absence of ASS in other cases. 14 experiments did not fulfil the requirements of a conclusive test, mostly because they applied a too short time scale. We found a bias towards laboratory experiments compared to field experiments in demonstrating bistability. There was no clear pattern of the distribution of ASS over categories. The absence of ASS in 38% of the tested systems indicates that ASS are just one possibility of how ecological systems can behave. The relevance of the concept of ASS for natural systems is discussed, in particular under consideration of the observed laboratory bias, perturbation frequency and variable environments. It is argued, that even for a permanently transient system, alternative attractors may still be of relevance.

AB New studies are showing that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has major implications for the functioning of different ecosystems, ranging from deserts to tropical rain forests. ENSO-induced pulses of enhanced plant productivity can cascade upward through the food web invoking unforeseen feedbacks, and can cause open dryland ecosystems to shift to permanent woodlands. These insights suggest that the predicted change in extreme climatic events resulting from global warming could profoundly alter biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in many regions of the world. Our increasing ability to predict El Nino effects can be used to enhance management strategies for the restoration of degraded ecosystems.

AB The outcome of many high-order processes in ecology depends on the way in which the abundance and distribution of plants affect the eating rate of mammalian herbivores. However, simple, mechanistic models describing the operation of the functional response of these animals have failed to emerge. We offer new models describing the effects of spatial and morphological characteristics of plants on the intake rate of plant tissue by mammalian herbivores feeding within plant patches. We structure our models to respond to three patterns of plant availability: (1) spatially dispersed, apparent plants; (2) spatially dispersed, nonapparent plants; and (3) spatially concentrated plants. We depart from the traditional representations of predator functional response in assuming that searching for food and processing it can overlap in time. Our models illustrate that several distinct mechanisms can account for Type II functional responses frequently seen in herbivores. We show how differences among these mechanisms can explain anomalies in the empirical literature on regulation of intake rate of mammalian herbivores including divergence in functional responses between grazers and browsers, linear functional response curves, and curves showing zero slope throughout the domain of food availability.

AB Two independent models concerning the effects of grazing on vegetation have gained wide acceptance in the last decade: Westoby et al.'s state- and- transition (ST) model, and Milchunas et al.'s generalized model of the effects of grazing on plant community structure and diversity (MSL model). These two prevailing models, as they stand, are conceptually divergent. The MSL model implicitly assumes that, at a given site, for each grazing intensity there is a single equilibrium situation with a single diversity value. The S-T model suggests that rangeland dynamics include irreversible transitions and alternative equilibria. Here we propose a modification of the original MSL model, to encompass a wider range of real situations and to place it within the context of the S-T model. The-four extreme cases proposed in the original MSL model are revisited, taking into account that (1) the "moisture" gradient can be generalized as a "productivity" gradient; (2) the selective pressure of herbivores on systems with long history of grazing has fluctuated over time, allowing the development of different pools of species adapted to low or high grazing intensities; and (3) systems with long evolutionary history of grazing. have developed resilience mechanisms that allow reversible shifts in floristic composition with changes in grazing intensities. The grazing intensity vs. diversity curves thus postulated for systems with a long evolutionary history of grazing are similar to those proposed by the original MSL model because resilience mechanisms allow for reversible changes associated with grazing intensity. In contrast, the curves postulated for systems with short evolutionary history. of grazing include different alternative branches, indicating irreversible transitions, because resilience mechanisms to grazing were not fully developed. By incorporating these modifications, the divergence between the original MSL and S-T models can be resolved. A set of published examples from real systems is presented and compared with the predictions of the modified model. The modified MSL model is applicable to a wider range of real situations than the MSL model in its original formulation.

AB The size of the basin of attraction in ecosystems with alternative stable states is often referred to as "ecological resilience." Ecosystems with a low ecological resilience may easily be tipped into an alternative basin of attraction by a stochastic event. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to measure ecological resilience in practice. Here we show that the rate of recovery from small perturbations ( sometimes called "engineering resilience") is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience. Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as "critical slowing down." We demonstrate the robust occurrence of critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical slowing down could also indicate other critical transitions, such as a stable system becoming oscillatory, the robustness of the phenomenon makes it a promising indicator of loss of resilience and the risk of upcoming regime shifts in a system.

AB Oysters are ecosystem engineers that create biogenic reef habitat important to estuarine biodiversity, benthic-pelagic coupling, and fishery production, Prevailing explanations for the dramatic decline of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) during the last century overlook ecosystem complexity by ignoring interactions among multiple environmental disturbances. To explain oyster loss, we tested whether (1) mortality of oysters on natural oyster reefs varies with water depth (3 m vs. 6 m), (2) harvesting by oyster dredges reduces the height of oyster reefs, and (3) bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia and reduction in reef height through fishery disturbance interact to enhance mortality of oysters in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, USA. The percentage of oysters found dead (mean +/- 1 SD) during a survey of natural reefs in May 1993 was significantly greater at 6-m (92 +/- 10%) than at 3-m (28 +/- 9%) water depth. Less than one season's worth of oyster dredging reduced the height of restored oyster reefs by similar to 30%. During stratification of the water column in summer, oxygen depletion near the seafloor at 6 m caused mass mortality of oysters, other invertebrates, and fishes on short, deep experimental reefs, while oysters and other reef associates elevated into the surface layer by sufficient reef height or by location in shallow water survived. Highly mobile blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) abandoned burrows located in hypoxic/anoxic bottom waters but remained alive in shallow water, Our results indicate that interaction of reef habitat degradation (height reduction) through fishery disturbance and extended bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia caused the pattern of oyster mortality observed on natural reefs and influences the abundance and distribution of fish and invertebrate species that utilize this temperate reef habitat. Interactions among environmental disturbances imply a need for the integrative approaches of ecosystem management to restore and sustain estuarine habitat.

DT Article
ID MANAGEMENT; COMPLEXITY
AB Ecologists have long recognized that some species, by virtue of the key roles they play in the overall structure and functioning of an ecosystem, are essential to its integrity; these are known as keystone species. Similarly, in human cultures everywhere, there are plants and animals that form the contextual underpinnings of a culture, as reflected in their fundamental roles in diet, as materials, or in medicine. In addition, these species often feature prominently in the language, ceremonies, and narratives of native peoples and can be considered cultural icons. Without these "cultural keystone species," the societies they support would be completely different. An obvious example is western red-cedar (Thuja plicata) for Northwest Coast cultures of North America. Often prominent elements of local ecosystems, cultural keystone species may be used and harvested in large quantities and intensively managed for quality and productivity. Given that biological conservation and ecological restoration embody human cultures as crucial components, one approach that may improve success in overall conservation or restoration efforts is to recognize and focus on cultural keystone species. In this paper, we explore the concept of cultural keystone species, describe similarities to and differences from ecological keystone species, present examples from First Nations cultures of British Columbia, and discuss the application of this concept in ecological restoration and conservation initiatives.

AB One of the most obvious features on the foredunes and strands of coasts and lakes is recurrent burial in sand. Burial levels vary in different coastal sand dune systems and influence the physical and biotic microenvironment of the plant and soil. Foredune plants along coasts possess numerous adaptations to withstand burial. Studies show that below a certain threshold level of burial, the growth of all foredune plant species is stimulated probably because of multiple factors, namely improved soil resources, increase in soil volume, reactive plant growth, and enhanced mycorrhizal activity. However, as the level of burial increases, the positive response starts to decline until it becomes a negative value. For example, burial may reduce seed germination, seedling emergence, survival, and growth of seedlings and adult plants. At the community level, burial acts as a filter and selectively eliminates susceptible species, reduces the relative abundance of less tolerant species, and increases the abundance of tolerant and sand-dependent species. However, if sand deposition continues unabated, even the sand-dependent species are eliminated and a bare area is created. The emergence of a plant from a burial deposit primarily depends on the energy reserves in its storage organs and the speed, depth, and frequency of burial. Upon burial the plants shift resources from the belowground to the aboveground parts. Different plants show varied morphological responses to sand accretion. For example, the culms of grasses emerge by an increase in the number of nodes per culm and the elongation of internodes. Similarly, the emergent trunks and woody branches of tolerant trees and shrubs produce new buds and suckers at a higher level on the stem. In response to burial, the coastal sand dune species produce shootborne roots close Co the new soil surface probably because of decreased oxygen levels.

AB Captive breeding programs are increasingly being initiated to prevent the imminent extinction of endangered species and/or populations. But how well can they conserve genetic diversity and fitness, or re-establish self-sustaining populations in the wild? A review of these complex questions and related issues in salmonid fishes reveals several insights and uncertainties. Most programs can maintain genetic diversity within populations over several generations, but available research suggests the loss of fitness in captivity can be rapid, its magnitude probably increasing with the duration in captivity. Over the long-term, there is likely tremendous variation between (i) programs in their capacity to maintain genetic diversity and fitness, and (ii) species or even intraspecific life-history types in both the severity and manner of fitness-costs accrued. Encouragingly, many new theoretical and methodological approaches now exist for current and future programs to potentially reduce these effects. Nevertheless, an unavoidable trade-off exists between conserving genetic diversity and fitness in certain instances, such as when captive-bred individuals are temporarily released into the wild. Owing to several confounding factors, there is also currently little evidence that captive-bred lines of salmonids can or cannot be reintroduced as self-sustaining populations. Most notably, the root causes of salmonid declines have not been mitigated where captive breeding programs exist. Little research has also addressed under what conditions an increase in population abundance due to captive-rearing might offset fitness reductions induced in captivity. Finally, more empirical investigation is needed to evaluate the genetic/fitness benefits and risks associated with (i) maintaining captive broodstocks as either single or multiple populations within one or more facilities, (ii) utilizing cryopreservation or surrogate broodstock technologies, and (iii) adopting other alternatives to captive-rearing such as translocations to new habitats. Management recommendations surrounding these issues are proposed, with the aim of facilitating meta-analyses and more general principles or guidelines for captive-breeding. These include the need for the following: (i) captive monitoring to involve, a priori, greater application of hypothesis testing through the use of well-designed experiments and (ii) improved documentation of procedures adopted by specific programs for reducing the loss of genetic diversity and fitness.

AB Patterns of ecotypic variation constitute some of the few 'rules' known to modern biology. Here, we examine several well-known ecogeographical rules, especially those pertaining to body size in contemporary, historical and fossil taxa. We review the evidence showing that rules of geographical variation in response to variation in the local environment can also apply to morphological changes through time in response to climate change. These rules hold at various time scales, ranging from contemporary to geological time scales. Patterns of body size variation in response to climate change at the individual species level may also be detected at the community level. The patterns underlying ecotypic variation are complex and highly context-dependent, reducing the 'predictive-power' of ecogeographical rules. This is especially true when considering the increasing impact of human activities on the environment. Nonetheless, ecogeographical rules may help interpret the likely influences of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems. Global climate change has already influenced the body size of several contemporary species, and will likely have an even greater impact on animal communities in the future. For this reason, we highlight and emphasise the importance of museum specimens and the continued need for documenting the earth's biological diversity.

AB According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released in September 2014, unprecedented changes in temperature and precipitation patterns have been recorded globally in recent decades and further change is predicted to occur in the near future, mainly as the result of human activity. In particular, projections show that the Mediterranean climate zone will be markedly affected with significant implications for lake water levels and salinity. This may be exacerbated by increased demands for irrigation water. Based on long-term data from seven lakes and reservoirs covering a geographical gradient of 52A degrees of latitudes and a literature review, we discuss how changes in water level and salinity related to climate change and water abstraction affect the ecosystem structure, function, biodiversity and ecological state of lakes and reservoirs. We discuss mitigation measures to counteract the negative effects on ecological status that are likely to result from changes in climate and water abstraction practices. Finally, we highlight research required to improve knowledge of the impacts of anthropogenically induced changes on lake water level and consequent changes in salinity.

AB The objectives of this study were to determine responses by red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and its primary consumers to nutrient enrichment, to determine if nutrient limitation is responsible for the dwarf plant form of red mangrove, and to evaluate four competing hypotheses for the relation of nutrient status and invertebrate herbivory. In a factorial-designed experiment, I fertilized 48 dwarf trees along gradients of tidal elevation and water depth at Twin Gays, an intertidal mangrove island in Belize, Central America, and measured plant growth responses and herbivory for 2 yr. At the end of year-2, I compared biomass accumulation and analyzed plant tissue for chemical and structural composition. Dwarf red mangrove trees on this tidal island responded quickly and grew vigorously when treated with P and NPK fertilizers. Leaf number, leaf area, branching, shoot length, and aerial root production increased dramatically over 2 yr. N-fertilized trees grew very slowly and their responses were not different from Control trees. N-fertilized and Control trees changed little over 2 yr. Some responses to phosphorus-containing fertilizers vary by water depth and tidal elevation, but physicochemical factors do not explain the differences in growth responses. I conclude that phosphorus availability is a major factor limiting red mangrove growth at my study site in the interior of Twin Gays. Herbivory by two specialized, endophytic insect species (Ecdytolopha sp., which feeds in apical buds, and Marmara sp., which mines stem periderm) increased in P- and NPK-fertilized trees compared to N-fertilized and Control trees. Twice as many apical buds were damaged or destroyed and the frequency of mines increased by 6-8 fold. However, fertilization had no effect on feeding rates and standing damage by a leaf-feeding guild of generalist herbivores or on the frequency of shoots killed by stem borers. Herbivory by the two specialists was not related to C:N ratios, but it was inversely related to concentrations of phenolic compounds. Neither nutrient ratios nor concentrations of phenolics affected rates of herbivory by the generalist folivores. Although sclerophylly of red mangrove leaves decreased in P- and NPK-fertilized trees but not in N-fertilized and Control trees, there was no relationship between leaf toughness and herbivory by generalist folivores. These data suggest that sclerophylly in oligotrophic ecosystems may be an adaptive mechanism related to nutrient conservation, and that it is associated with red mangrove survival in phosphorus-deficient soil rather than an adaptation to herbivory.

AB Empirical evidence for large-scale abrupt changes in ecosystems such as lakes and vegetation of semi-arid regions is growing. Such changes, called regime shifts, can lead to degradation of ecological services. We study simple ecological models that show a catastrophic transition as a control parameter is varied and propose a novel early warning signal that exploits two ubiquitous features of ecological systems: nonlinearity and large external fluctuations. Either reduced resilience or increased external fluctuations can tip ecosystems to an alternative stable state. It is shown that changes in asymmetry in the distribution of time series data, quantified by changing skewness, is a model-independent and reliable early warning signal for both routes to regime shifts. Furthermore, using model simulations that mimic field measurements and a simple analysis of real data from abrupt climate change in the Sahara, we study the feasibility of skewness calculations using data available from routine monitoring.

   DOGS; POPULATION; COMMUNITY; PREDATION; DYNAMICS; ASPEN
AB The rarity or absence of highly interactive species leaves a functional void that can trigger linked changes leading to degraded or simplified ecosystems. A preliminary analysis indicates a relatively high frequency of such interactive species among endangered mammals. Rapid environmental change is likely to increase the interactivity of some species and reduce that of others over relatively short intervals. The current implementation of environmental policies and laws, such as the U. S. Endangered Species Act, generally ignores interspecific effects; recovery goals are autecological, short term, and numerically and spatially minimalistic. Moreover, by failing to account for interspecific interactions, recovery objectives are becoming indefensible in light of increasing knowledge from community ecology. Using the sea otter (Enhydra lutris) and wolf (Canis lupus) as examples, we argue that conservation plans should call for recovery or repatriation of such interactive species at ecologically effective densities in as many places as are currently realistic. It will be prudent and beneficial to estimate ecologically effective densities where there is disagreement among experts and interested parties about the desirability of restoring an interactive species to a particular region and to a particular density.

AB In size-structured populations, interactions are strongly dependent on size-specific foraging and anti-predator capacities of the organism. Conflicting size-specific selection pressures over the ontogeny often have different effects on different species leading to asymmetries in competitive and predator-prey interactions. Habitat complexity is likely to affect such asymmetric interactions due to species/size-specific competitive abilities in different habitats and due to the fact that habitat structural complexity may act differently as a prey refuge for different species. We experimentally analyzed the impact of a piscivorous predator (adult perch, Perca fluviatilis) on performance of juvenile perch and roach (rutilus rutilus) at different levels of structural complexity (no structure, structure forming a partial refuge, and structure forming a complete refuge) in enclosures in an experimental pond. We measured predator diet and growth, prey fish habitat use, survival, diet and growth, and prey resource levels in different habitats.
   Prey fish (perch and roach) were found in the diet of piscivorous perch in no refuge and partial refuge treatments. Growth rate of the piscivorous perch decreased with increased refuge efficiency. Juvenile perch increased their proportional use of the structurally complex refuges in the presence of piscivorous perch and the survival increased with increased refuge efficiency (from partial to complete refuge). The diet of juvenile perch changed from predominantly cyclopoid copepods in the absence of predators to predominantly macroinvertebrates in the presence of predators. There was no effect of predator-induced habitat restriction on growth of juvenile perch. Roach survival also increased with increased refuge efficiency in the presence of predators, and roach survival in the refuge treatments did not differ from each other or from the treatments with predators absent. Predator-induced habitat restriction in roach was associated with a decreased growth of roach.
   Our results suggest that, compared to juvenile roach, juvenile perch may compensate more for lost foraging opportunity in the open water via increased exploitation of structure-associated prey in refuges. As a result, predator-induced habitat shifts by juvenile perch and roach may alter competitive interactions between the species. On the other hand, structural complexity may form an almost complete refuge for juvenile roach from predators and thereby affect the predator-prey relationships between piscivorous perch and juvenile perch and roach to the advantage of juvenile roach. The demonstrated effects of structural complexity on competitive and predator-prey interactions between perch and roach can be related to the two species' distributions in lakes with different degrees of structural complexity.

AB Invasion by mats of free-floating plants is among the most important threats to the functioning and biodiversity of freshwater ecosystems ranging from temperate ponds and ditches to tropical lakes. Dark, anoxic conditions under thick floating-plant cover leave little opportunity for animal or plant life, and they can have large negative impacts on fisheries and navigation in tropical lakes. Here, we demonstrate that floating-plant dominance can be a self-stabilizing ecosystem state, which may explain its notorious persistence in many situations. Our results, based on experiments, field data, and models, represent evidence for alternative domains of attraction in ecosystems. An implication of our findings is that nutrient enrichment reduces the resilience of freshwater systems against a shift to floating-plant dominance. On the other hand, our results also suggest that a single drastic harvest of floating plants can induce a permanent shift to an alternative state dominated by rooted, submerged growth forms.

AB We critically review and classify models of single-species population dynamics subject to the demographic Allee effect with emphasis on non-spatial, deterministic approach. Inclusion of spatial movement and stochastic phenomena does not substantially change the behaviour; stochasticity only "blurs" step-like character of the Allee effect into a sigmoidal form. The outcome of all non-spatial, deterministic models is either unconditional extinction, extinction-survival scenario (ES), or unconditional survival. Three major model classes are recognized: (1) one-dimensional heuristic models, (2) one-dimensional models with mating probability and fixed sex ratio, and (3) two-sex models with variable adult sex ratio. Each class is characterized by the shape of extinction boundary which separates extinction from survival in the ES scenario. The latter two classes may give better predictions of extinction thresholds than heuristic models but require specific information and are data intensive. In one-dimensional models with fixed sex ratio, population cannot survive if density/number of males decreases below some threshold while there is no such restriction on females. Individual-based models seem to be most capable of explaining mechanisms leading to the Allee effect. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Predation is heterogeneously distributed across space and time, and is presumed to represent a major source of evolutionary diversification. In fishes, fast-starts-sudden, high-energy swimming bursts-are often important in avoiding capture during a predator strike. Thus, in the presence of predators, we might expect evolution of morphological features that facilitate increased fast-start speed. We tested this hypothesis using populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) that differed in level of predation by piscivorous fish. Body morphology of G. affinis males, females, and juveniles diverged in a consistent manner between predatory environments. Fish collected from predator populations exhibited a larger caudal region, smaller head, more elongate body, and a posterior, ventral position of the eye relative to fish from predator-free populations. Divergence in body shape largely matched a priori predictions based on biomechanical principles, and was evident across space (multiple populations) and time (multiple years). We measured maximum burst-swimming speed for male mosquitofish and found that individuals from predator populations produced faster bursts than fish from predator-free populations (about 20% faster). Biomechanical models of fish swimming and intrapopulation morphology-speed correlations suggested that body shape differences were largely responsible for enhanced locomotor performance in fish from predator populations. Morphological differences also persisted in offspring raised in a common laboratory environment, suggesting a heritable component to the observed morphological divergence. Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that divergent selection between predator regimes has produced the observed phenotypic differences among populations of G. affinis. Based on biomechanical principles and recent findings in other species, it appears that the general ecomorphological model described in this paper will apply for many aquatic taxa, and provide insight into the role of predators in shaping the body form of prey organisms.

AB 1. Rangeland ecologists have been debating the validity of two current paradigms for the evaluation of vegetation dynamics on rangelands. This debate frequently contrasts the conventional model of continuous and reversible vegetation dynamics (range model) with a more contemporary model that can accommodate discontinuous and non-reversible vegetation change (state-and-transition model).
   2. The range and the state-and-transition models are conceptually related to the equilibrium and non-equilibrium paradigms within ecology, respectively. The methodological dichotomy that has developed between the range and the state-and-transition models has fostered the perception that these two ecological paradigms are mutually exclusive. We challenge this perception and contend that both methodologies and their corresponding paradigms are non-exclusive.
   3. Equilibrium and non-equilibrium ecosystems are not distinguished on the basis of unique processes or functions, but rather by the evaluation of system dynamics at various temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, ecosystems may express both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. This confirms early interpretations that ecosystems are distributed along a continuum from equilibrium to non-equilibrium states.
   4. Although both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics occur in numerous ecosystems, the empirical evidence is frequently confounded by (i) uncertainty regarding the appropriate evidence necessary to distinguish between paradigms; (ii) disproportionate responses among vegetation attributes to climate and grazing; (iii) comparisons among systems with varying degrees of managerial involvement; and (iv) the evaluation of vegetation dynamics at various spatial and temporal scales.
   5. Synthesis and applications . This critique supports the conclusion that a paradigm shift has not taken place in rangeland ecology, but rather, the debate has forced a more comprehensive interpretation of vegetation dynamics along the entirety of the equilibrium-non-equilibrium continuum. Therefore, the rangeland debate should be redirected from the dichotomy between paradigms to one of paradigm integration.

AB Corridors are commonly used to connect fragments of wildlife habitat, yet the identification of conservation corridors typically neglects processes of habitat selection and movement for target organisms. corridor designs often are based on binary patterns of habitat, suitability. New technologies and analytical tools make it possible to better integrate landscape patterns with behavioral processes. We show how resource selection functions can be used to describe habitat suitability with continuous and multivariable metrics and review methods by which animal movement can be quantified, analyzed, and modeled. 1,We then show how the processes of habitat selection and movement can be integrated with landscape features using least-cost paths, graph theory, and step selection functions. These tools offer new ways to design, implement, and study corridors as landscape linkages more objectively and holistically.

AB Many arid grasslands around the world are affected by woody plant encroachment and by the replacement of a relatively continuous grass cover with shrub patches bordered by bare soil. This shift in plant community composition is often abrupt in space and time, suggesting that it is likely sustained by positive feedbacks between vegetation and environmental conditions (e.g. resource availability) or disturbance regime (e.g. fire or freeze). These feedbacks amplify the effects of drivers of shrub encroachment, i.e. of conditions favouring a shift from grass to shrub dominance (e.g. overgrazing, climate change). Here, we review some major drivers and feedbacks and identify the basic stages in the transition from grassland to shrubland. We discuss some possible scenarios of interactions between drivers and feedbacks that could explain the transition from a stage to the next and the potential irreversibility of the shift from grass to shrub dominance. We introduce a simplistic modelling framework that can integrate the various drivers to explain the emergence of bistability for shrub-encroached grassland systems. Published 2011.

AB Life-history theory predicts that an individual should reduce its reproductive efforts by laying a smaller clutch size when high risk of nest predation reduces the value of current reproduction. Evidence in favour of this 'nest predation hypothesis', however, is scarce and based largely on correlative analyses. Here, we manipulated perceived risk of nest predation in the Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus using playback involving a mixture of calls by corvid nest predators in the vicinity of nest sites. In response to being exposed to this acoustic cue simulating increased risk of nest predation, the jays chose a nest site offering more protective covering and reduced clutch size. This is the first experimental demonstration of clutch size adjustment and nest site selection as a result of phenotypic plasticity in an open nesting passerine reflecting a facultative response to the perceived risk of nest predation.

AB 1. Lake Takern and Lake Krankesjon, two moderately eutrophic, shallow lakes in southern Sweden, have during the past few decades shifted several times between a clear-water state with abundant submerged vegetation and a turbid state with high phytoplankton densities.
   2. Between 1985 and 1991, Lake Takern was in a clear state, whereas Lake Krankesjon shifted from a turbid to a clear state. During this shift, the area covered by submerged macrophytes expanded, followed by an increase in water transparency, plant-associated macroinvertebrates, and piscivorous fish. Nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton biomass and abundance of planktonic cladocerans decreased.
   3. In both lakes, water level fluctuations were the most common factor causing shifts, affecting submerged macrophytes either through changes in light availability or through catastrophic events such as dry-out or mechanical damage by ice movement.
   4. Our data give further support for the existence of two alternative stable states in shallow lakes maintained by self-stabilizing feedback mechanisms.

AB Water levels of lakes fluctuate naturally in response to climatic and hydrological forcing. Human over-exploitation of water resources leads to increased annual and interannual fluctuations of water levels, at times far beyond natural amplitudes and/or at altered time schedules. Climate change models predict increased occurrence of extreme events (flooding, extended droughts), which will further magnify the seasonal and multiannual amplitude of water level fluctuations in lakes. A relatively wide literature base already exists for shallow lakes, demonstrating that excessive water level fluctuations impair ecosystem functioning, ultimately leading to shifts between clear-water and turbid states. Evidence is gradually building in the published literature demonstrating that deep (stratified) freshwater lakes also respond adversely to excessive water level fluctuations. Analysis of existing data suggests that at moderate disturbance levels littoral habitats are affected, and hence their biota is also impacted. At further disturbance levels, ecosystem destabilization symptoms are observed, including weakening of keystone species, proliferation of nuisance and invasive species, loss of biodiversity, and increased internal nutrient loading. Ultimately, eutrophication symptoms are manifested, especially large and more frequent cyanobacterial blooms, without increased external nutrient loading. Examples from a range of subtropic and temperate freshwater lakes and reservoirs demonstrate that both top-down and bottom-up processes promote those symptoms. The response of aquatic ecosystems, particularly deep lakes, to water level fluctuations is an under-studied field of crucial importance to the management of water resources, where limnologists have a leading role to play in the near future.

AB It has long been recognized that alternative vegetation states may occur in terrestrial grazing systems. This phenomenon may be of great importance as small environmental fluctuations may lead to relatively sudden and irreversible jumps between vegetation states. Early theoretical studies emphasized saturation of herbivore feeding to explain multiple stable states and catastrophic behaviour. Recent studies on semi-arid grasslands and arctic salt marshes, however, relate catastrophic events In these systems to plant-soil interactions.

AB Vicariance biogeography emerged several decades ago from the fusion of cladistics and plate tectonics, and quickly came to dominate historical biogeography. The field has since been largely constrained by the notion that only processes of vicariance and not dispersal offer testable patterns and refutable hypotheses, dispersal being a random process essentially adding only noise to a vicariant system. A consequence of this thinking seems to have been a focus on the biogeography of continents and continental islands, considering the biogeography of oceanic islands less worthy of scientific attention because, being dependent on stochastic dispersal, it was uninteresting. However, the importance of dispersal is increasingly being recognized, and here we stress its fundamental role in the generation of biodiversity on oceanic islands that have been created in situ, never connected to larger land masses. Historical dispersal patterns resulting in modern distributions, once considered unknowable, are now being revealed in many plant and animal taxa, in large part through the analysis of polymorphic molecular markers. We emphasize the profound evolutionary insights that oceanic island biodiversity has provided, and the fact that, although small in area, oceanic islands harbour disproportionately high biodiversity and numbers of endemic taxa. We further stress the importance of continuing research on mechanisms generating oceanic island biodiversity, especially detection of general, non-random patterns of dispersal, and hence the need to acknowledge oceanic dispersal as significant and worthy of research.

AB Translocations are important tools in the field of conservation. Despite increased use over the last few decades, the appropriateness of translocations for amphibians and reptiles has been debated widely over the past 20 years. To provide a comprehensive evaluation of the suitability of amphibians and reptiles for translocation, we reviewed the results of amphibian and reptile translocation projects published between 1991 and 2006. The success rate of amphibian and reptile translocations reported over this period was twice that reported in an earlier review in 1991. Success and failure rates were independent of the taxonomic class (Amphibia or Reptilia) released. Reptile translocations driven by human-wildlife conflict mitigation had a higher failure rate than those motivated by conservation, and more recent projects of reptile translocations had unknown outcomes. The outcomes of amphibian translocations were significantly related to the number of animals released, with projects releasing over 1000 individuals being most successful. The most common reported causes of translocation failure were homing and migration of introduced individuals out of release sites and poor habitat. The increased success of amphibian and reptile translocations reviewed in this study compared with the 1991 review is encouraging for future conservation projects. Nevertheless, more preparation, monitoring, reporting of results, and experimental testing of techniques and reintroduction questions need to occur to improve translocations of amphibians and reptiles as a whole.

AB The empirical study of natural selection reveals that adaptations often involve trade-offs between competing functions. Because natural selection acts on whole organisms rather than isolated traits, adaptive evolution may be constrained by the interaction between traits that are functionally integrated. Yet, few attempts have been made to characterize how and when such constraints are manifested or whether they limit the adaptive divergence of populations. Here we examine the consequences of adaptive life-history evolution on locomotor performance in the live-bearing guppy. In response to increased predation from piscivorous fish, Trinidadian guppies evolve an increased allocation of resources toward reproduction. These populations are also under strong selection for rapid fast-start swimming performance to evade predators. Because embryo development increases a female's wet mass as she approaches parturition, an increased investment in reproductive allocation should impede fast-start performance. We find evidence for adaptive but constrained evolution of fast-start swimming performance in laboratory trials conducted on second-generation lab-reared fish. Female guppies from high-predation localities attain a faster acceleration and velocity and travel a greater distance during fast-start swimming trials. However, velocity and distance traveled decline more rapidly over the course of pregnancy in these same females, thus reducing the magnitude of divergence in swimming performance between high- and low-predation populations. This functional trade-off between reproduction and swimming performance reveals how different aspects of the phenotype are integrated and highlights the complexity of adaptation at the whole-organism level.

AB Models that explain the discontinuous behaviour of semi-arid grazing systems usually emphasize herbivore feeding characteristics or plant competition as possible mechanisms. Field studies indicate, however, that plant-soil relations could be more important. We show by means of a graphical model that the interactions between water infiltration or nutrient retention and plant density potentially give rise to the existence of alternate stable vegetation states and threshold effects in semi-arid grazing systems, even without the effect of a non-linear herbivore functional response or plant competition. These interactions may trigger a positive feedback between reduced plant density and reduced resource availability, and lead to a collapse of the system. The model results are in line with well-documented observations of spatial and temporal patterns such as two-phase mosaics and stably degraded grasslands.

AB Avoidance and tolerance are the two means by which plants cope with herbivores. Avoidances internal to the plant, Such as morphology, chemical repellants, thorns, etc., have received considerable attention in the plant-herbivore literature, but relatively little consideration has been given to avoidances external to the plant. We develop a conceptual framework of external plant avoidances of herbivory based on foraging selection impedances (associational avoidances), behavioral impedances (indirect avoidances), and physical impedances (refuges) organized along axes of efficiency, degree of protection, and necessity of tolerance characteristics. Associational avoidances are uncommon for terrestrial mammalian herbivores compared to plant-insect or marine situations. Indirect avoidances mediated through herbivore territoriality, predator avoidance, and other behaviors independent of foraging decisions are probably common in nature. but few have been formally documented. Biotic and geologic refuges providing a physical impedance are the only avoidances shown to have implications for plant biodiversity. This is particularly true for geologic refuges, where there is not a tradeoff between competition and the refuge effect. Small geologic refuges (rock outcrops, cliffs, etc.) are more likely to also positively or negatively alter associated plant microenvironments than large geologic refuges (mesas, islands, etc.). In a survey. 86% of small refuge studies reported positive effects on plant diversity compared to 50% for large refuges. Geologic refuges in more productive environments were more important in protecting diversity than refuges in less productive, semiarid environments. and the effects of protection were greater in communities with short compared to long evolutionary histories of grazing. Other characteristics of refuges such as extent across the landscape and the manner they alter or ameliorate the environment, as well as characteristics of the herbivore such as small or large, generalist or specialist may also determine the effectiveness of refuges, but there are too few Studies to assess these factors.

AB It is not clear whether Bergmann's rule, larger size within species in cooler areas, holds for any group of ectotherms. Data are presented and used to test whether amphibians show body-size patterns that follow Bergmann's rule. Available data with respect to latitude and elevation suggest that amphibians in general follow Bergmann's rule, with 23 of 34 species showing a larger body size at higher latitudes or elevations and an overall grand mean correlation coefficient of +0.35 for size with latitude or elevation. Salamanders show body-size patterns consistent with the overall trend, with 13 of 18 species having a larger body size at higher latitudes or elevations and a grand mean correlation coefficient of +0.42 for size with latitude or elevation. Anurans show a weaker trend towards concordance with Bergmann's rule with respect to latitude and elevation (10 of 16 species), but the grand mean correlation coefficient is significantly positive (+0.31). The relationship between body size and environmental temperature is less clear. Overall, amphibians show weak concordance with Bergmann's rule (9 of 16 species). The results of the only two studies of salamanders are consistent with Bergmann's rule; however, data for anurans show no trend (7 of 14 species in accordance). Thus, while salamanders appear to follow Bergmann's rule, any trends in anurans are tentative.

AB The possibility that different species assemblages may represent persistent alternative community states remains largely unexplored by experimental ecologists because of a variety of conceptual and experimental problems. We discuss some of the conceptual roadblocks to experimentation and propose several avenues for attacking the problem experimentally. We address the conceptual issues involved in (1) the blurring of the distinction between the processes that initiate the switch among alternative states and the positive-feedback processes that maintain those states, and (2) the role of spatial scale in initiating the switch.
   We suggest that the switch between alternative states requires, first, a disturbance that removes species involved in the positive feedbacks needed for maintenance and, second, the arrival of other individuals that initiate the switch to the alternative assemblage. The removal of the species that maintain the system must be large enough and over a long enough time to allow the arrival and establishment of members of the alternative assemblage, and so we hypothesize that the switch among alternative states is scale dependent.
   This scenario suggests that the switch among alternative states can be investigated experimentally through the manipulation of the scale of the disturbance and of the arrival of members of the alternative state. Small-scale disturbances should consistently fail to initiate a switch, while larger-scale events should initiate a switch at least part of the time. We also note that in some cases the scale of disturbance and/or the arrival of recruits cannot be manipulated or controlled and suggest that several approaches other than factorial experiments with ANOVA, such as spatial autocorrelation methods, may be useful.
   We illustrate the potential and the difficulties of various approaches by discussing two systems in eastern North America that may contain alternative states. Mosaics of mussel beds and algal beds occupy rocky coasts from New England northward, and patchworks of forests and heathlands occur in eastern Canada and in the Appalachian highlands. While the study of alternative states in the marine system can be approached experimentally, the scale of disturbance required to switch forests to heathlands is too large for experimentation and must rely on the use of other approaches.

AB This review focuses on the success and survivorship of captive-born versus wild-caught carnivores used in reintroductions. Previous reviews have suggested that reintroduction projects using captive-born animals are less likely to be successful than projects translocating wild-caught animals. The purpose of this paper is to examine this statistically and investigate how captivity may affect the survival of reintroduced carnivores. We examined results published in previous reviews, and found evidence to support that reintroduction projects using wild-caught animals are significantly more likely to succeed than projects using captive-born animals. We further compiled our own review of 45 case studies in carnivore reintroduction projects (in 17 species across S families) to investigate survival rates rather than overall project 'success'. We found that (1) wild-caught carnivores are significantly more likely to survive than captive-born carnivores in reintroductions; (2) that humans were the direct cause of death in over 50% of all fatalities and (3) that reintroduced captive-born carnivores are particularly susceptible to starvation, unsuccessful predator/ competitor avoidance and disease.

AB We summarize the influences of harvester ants of the genus Pogonomyrmex on communities and ecosystems. Because of nest densities, the longevity of nests, and the amount of seed harvested and soil handled, harvester ants have significant direct and indirect effects on community structure and ecosystem functioning. Harvester ants change plant species composition and diversity near their nests. These changes result from differential seed predation by the ants, their actions as seed dispersers and competitors with other granivores, and the favorable soil conditions they create through their digging. Their nest building creates islands of increased nutrient density. In some areas, the effects of their activities may be so pervasive that plant community structure is strongly influenced. Ant removal studies, which would reveal their total impact, have generally not been done. Granivore removals have been conducted in North America where ants are of lesser importance than small mammals, in contrast to other areas (except Israel) where ants are dominant granivores. We review the influence of harvester ants on their competitors, predators, and nest associates, and catalog the factors that influence their foraging patterns and consequently their local distribution.

AB Soil moisture is the environmental variable synthesizing the effect of climate, soil, and vegetation on the dynamics of water-limited ecosystems. Unlike abiotic factors ( e. g., soil texture and rainfall regime), the control exerted by vegetation composition and structure on soil moisture variability remains poorly understood. A number of field studies in dryland landscapes have found higher soil water contents in vegetated soil patches than in adjacent bare soil, providing a convincing explanation for the observed preferential establishment of grasses and seedlings beneath tree canopies. Thus, because water is the limiting factor for vegetation in arid and semiarid ecosystems, a positive feedback could exist between soil moisture and woody vegetation dynamics. It is still unclear how the strength of such a feedback would change under different long-term rainfall regimes. To this end, we report some field observations from savanna ecosystems located along the south-north rainfall gradient in the Kalahari, where the presence of relatively uniform sandy soils limits the effects of covarying factors. The data available from our field study suggest that the contrast between the soil moisture in the canopy and intercanopy space increases ( with wetter soils under the canopy) with increasing levels of aridity. We hypothesize that this contrast may lead to a positive feedback and explore the implications of such a feedback in a minimalistic model. We found that when the feedback is relatively strong, the system may exhibit two stable states corresponding to conditions with and without tree canopy cover. In this case, even small changes in environmental variables may lead to rapid and largely irreversible shifts to a state with no tree canopy cover. Our data suggest that the tendency of the system to exhibit two ( alternative) stable states becomes stronger in the more arid regions. Thus, at the desert margins, vegetation is more likely to be prone to discontinuous and abrupt state changes.

AB Recent insights from habitat selection theory may help conservation managers encourage released animals to settle in appropriate habitats. By all measures, success rates for captive-release and translocation programs are low, and have shown few signs of improvement in recent years. We consider situations in which free-living dispersers prefer new habitats that contain stimuli comparable to those in their natal habitat, a phenomenon called natal habitat preference induction (NHPI). Theory predicts NHPI when dispersers experienced favorable conditions in their natal habitat, and have difficulty estimating the quality of unfamiliar habitats. NHPI is especially likely to occur when performance in a given habitat is enhanced if an animal developed in that same habitat type. Animals exhibiting NHPI are expected to rely on conspicuous cues that can be quickly and easily detected during search, and to prefer new habitats possessing cues that match those encountered in their natal habitat.
   A major obstacle to successful relocations is that newly released animals often reject the habitat near the release site and rapidly travel long distances away before settling. An NHPI perspective argues that long-distance movements away from release sites occur because releasees prefer to settle in familiar types of habitat, and reject novel areas lacking cues similar to those in their habitat of origin. Similarly, a preference by releasees for familiar cues may encourage them to seek out inappropriate, low quality habitats following release at a new location. We review evidence from a number of studies indicating that problems with habitat selection behavior compromise conservation efforts, and provide recommendations that may encourage animals to "feel more at home" in post-release habitats.

AB Although theory indicates that natural selection can facilitate speciation as a by-product, demonstrating ongoing speciation via this by-product mechanism in nature has proven difficult. We examined morphological, molecular, and behavioral data to investigate ecology's role in incipient speciation for a post-Pleistocene radiation of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) inhabiting blue holes. We show that adaptation to divergent predator regimes is driving ecological speciation as a by-product. Divergence in body shape, coupled with assortative mating for body shape, produces reproductive isolation that is twice as strong between populations inhabiting different predator regimes than between populations that evolved in similar ecological environments. Gathering analogous data on reproductive isolation at the interspecific level in the genus, we find that this mechanism of speciation may have been historically prevalent in Gambusia. These results suggest that speciation in nature can result as a by-product of divergence in ecologically important traits, producing interspecific patterns that persist long after speciation events have completed.

   GRAND-RAPIDS; TEMPERATURE
AB Massive seed consumption is typical in many deserts. The ''escape'' or ''protection'' strategies of seed dispersal are important, as they prevent massive seed consumption. The more extreme the desert, the more unpredictable the low amounts and distribution of the rains as well as the beginning and length of the season or seasons with rains. Seeds, which have the highest resistance to extreme environmental conditions, develop during germination into seedlings, which are the most sensitive. Therefore, germination of parts of the seed population at their respective proper times spreads the risk over time and is thus very important for plant survival, especially in those plants inhabiting the more extreme deserts.
   Each of the plant species studied was found to have its own survival strategies of seed dispersal and germination. At least two extreme seed-dispersal and -germination strategies have been observed: 1) the ''escape'' seed dispersal and ''opportunistic'' portioned seed-germination strategies, such as in Schismus arabicus and Spergularia diandra, and 2) the ''cautious'' portioned dispersal by rain of the protected seeds, such as in Asteriscus hierochunticus and portioned dispersal and rapid germination strategies such as in Blepharis spp.
   The fate of future generations, as far as the germinability of seeds of some species is concerned, depends on the influences of maternal and environmental factors when the seeds are still on the mother plant, mostly during the final stage of seed maturation, as in Trigonella arabica. It may even depend on the position of the caryopsis from which the mother plant originated, as in Aegilops geniculata.
   The dry post-maturation conditions and the environmental factors during seed wetting and germination may also affect the percentage of seed germination, as in Schismus arabicus.

AB Maximum (aerobic) metabolic rate (MMR) is defined here as the maximum rate of oxygen consumption ((M) over dotO(2max)) that a fish can achieve at a given temperature under any ecologically relevant circumstance. Different techniques exist for eliciting MMR of fishes, of which swim-flume respirometry (critical swimming speed tests and burst-swimming protocols) and exhaustive chases are the most common. Available data suggest that the most suitable method for eliciting MMR varies with species and ecotype, and depends on the propensity of the fish to sustain swimming for extended durations as well as its capacity to simultaneously exercise and digest food. MMR varies substantially (>10 fold) between species with different lifestyles (i.e. interspecific variation), and to a lesser extent (<three-fold) between individuals of the same species (i.e. intraspecific variation). MMR often changes allometrically with body size and is modulated by several environmental factors, including temperature and oxygen availability. Due to the significance of MMR in determining aerobic scope, interest in measuring this trait has spread across disciplines in attempts to predict effects of climate change on fish populations. Here, various techniques used to elicit and measure MMR in different fish species with contrasting lifestyles are outlined and the relevance of MMR to the ecology, fitness and climate change resilience of fishes is discussed.

AB The search for a universal statement of goals for ecological restoration continues to generate discussion and controversy. I discuss the diverse roots of restoration ecology, and show how the complex lineages within the field have led to diverse, and divergent, sets of goals. I then review the three major themes that currently are used to develop statements of goals: restoration of species, restoration of whole ecosystems or landscapes, and the restoration of ecosystem services, and point out both the advantages and the limitations and problems associated with each category. Finally, I suggest that restoration ecology would be better served by recognizing that the diversity of conditions requiring restoration demands much flexibility in goal setting, and that restorationists should seek to develop guidelines for defining the sets of conditions under which different kinds of goals are appropriate. I further suggest that goals would be more easily and more appropriately set if restorationists would set forth at the outset the true scope and limitations of what is possible in a given project.

AB There is mounting evidence of species redistribution as climate warms. Yet, our knowledge of the coupling between species range shifts and isotherm shifts remains limited. Here, we introduce BioShifts-a global geo-database of 30,534 range shifts. Despite a spatial imbalance towards the most developed regions of the Northern Hemisphere and a taxonomic bias towards the most charismatic animals and plants of the planet, data show that marine species are better at tracking isotherm shifts, and move towards the pole six times faster than terrestrial species. More specifically, we find that marine species closely track shifting isotherms in warm and relatively undisturbed waters (for example, the Central Pacific Basin) or in cold waters subject to high human pressures (for example, the North Sea). On land, human activities impede the capacity of terrestrial species to track isotherm shifts in latitude, with some species shifting in the opposite direction to isotherms. Along elevational gradients, species follow the direction of isotherm shifts but at a pace that is much slower than expected, especially in areas with warm climates. Our results suggest that terrestrial species are lagging behind shifting isotherms more than marine species, which is probably related to the interplay between the wider thermal safety margin of terrestrial versus marine species and the more constrained physical environment for dispersal in terrestrial versus marine habitats.
   Compiling a global geo-database of >30,000 range shifts, the authors show that marine species closely track shifting isotherms, whereas terrestrial species lag behind, probably due to wider thermal safety margins and movement constraints imposed by human activities.

AB Although alternative stable states are commonly found in simple models, it seems reasonable to assume that the response of real ecosystems to environmental change should often be smoothed by spatial heterogeneity and other stabilizing mechanisms. Here, we systematically explore the effect of spatial heterogeneity on regime shifts for three different models, which we run on a one-dimensional lattice with different spatial distributions of an environmental factor (e.g., soil fertility, water level). If dispersion between patches is negligible, the response to gradual change in some overall stressor (e.g., precipitation, nutrient load) is straightforward. Because of the environmental heterogeneity, each patch shifts to the other stable state at different values of the overall control variable. Therefore, the response of the ecosystem as a whole is gradual (i.e., the average of many asynchronous small shifts) instead of catastrophic. However, in response to a reverse change in the global stressor, the system always shows hysteresis, as each individual patch shifts back to the original state at a different value of the control parameter than the critical threshold for the forward shift. If dispersion between patches occurs, the response to change in the overall control parameter becomes dependent on the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity. If the environmental parameter is randomly distributed in space, the overall response tends to remain surprisingly catastrophic, and hysteresis is hardly reduced as compared to the homogeneous case. By contrast, in a smooth environmental gradient, the response of the overall system is gradual, and hysteresis is much smaller. In fact, hysteresis is largely reduced to the initial phases, in which none of the patches have shifted to the alternative state yet. As soon as the first patch shifts, a domino effect occurs, pushing over the neighboring patches. In conclusion, our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity may weaken the tendency for large-scale catastrophic regime shifts if dispersion is unimportant or if local environmental characteristics vary along a smooth gradient.

AB The concept of alternative stable states has long been a dominant framework for studying the influence of historical contingency in community assembly. This concept focuses on stable states, yet many real communities are kept in a transient state by disturbance, and the utility of predictions for stable states in explaining transient states remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects community assembly can differ greatly for stable versus transient states. Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also show that transient states can last for a long time relative to immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a conceptual shift of focus from alternative stable states to alternative transient states for understanding historical contingency in community assembly.

AB Generic early-warning signals such as increased autocorrelation and variance have been demonstrated in time-series of systems with alternative stable states approaching a critical transition. However, lag times for the detection of such leading indicators are typically long. Here, we show that increased spatial correlation may serve as a more powerful early-warning signal in systems consisting of many coupled units. We first show why from the universal phenomenon of critical slowing down, spatial correlation should be expected to increase in the vicinity of bifurcations. Subsequently, we explore the applicability of this idea in spatially explicit ecosystem models that can have alternative attractors. The analysis reveals that as a control parameter slowly pushes the system towards the threshold, spatial correlation between neighboring cells tends to increase well before the transition. We show that such increase in spatial correlation represents a better early-warning signal than indicators derived from time-series provided that there is sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity in the system.

AB The centre-periphery hypothesis' (CPH) is a long-standing postulate in ecology that states that genetic variation and demographic performance of a species decrease from the centre to the edge of its geographic range. This hypothesis is based on an assumed concordance between geographical peripherality and ecological marginality such that environmental conditions become harsher towards the limits of a species range. In this way, the CPH sets the stage for understanding the causes of distribution limits. To date, no study has examined conjointly the consistency of these postulates. In an extensive literature review we discuss the birth and development of the CPH and provide an assessment of the CPH by reviewing 248 empirical studies in the context of three main themes. First, a decrease in species occurrence towards their range limits was observed in 81% of studies, while only 51% demonstrated reduced abundance of individuals. A decline in genetic variation, increased differentiation among populations and higher rates of inbreeding were demonstrated by roughly one in two studies (47, 45 and 48%, respectively). However, demographic rates, size and population performance less often followed CPH expectations (20-30% of studies). We highlight the impact of important methodological, taxonomic, and biogeographical biases on such validation rates. Second, we found that geographic and ecological marginality gradients are not systematically concordant, which casts doubt on the reliability of a main assumption of the CPH. Finally, we attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of geographical, ecological and historical processes on the spatial distribution of genetic and demographic parameters. While ecological marginality gradients explain variation in species' demographic performance better than geographic gradients, contemporary and historical factors may contribute interactively to spatial patterns of genetic variation. We thereby propose a framework that integrates species' ecological niche characteristics together with current and past range structure to investigate spatial patterns of genetic and demographic variation across species ranges.

AB We introduce an analytical model, the Wald analytical long-distance dispersal (WALD) model, for estimating dispersal kernels of wind-dispersed seeds and their escape probability from the canopy. The model is based on simplifications to well-established three-dimensional Lagrangian stochastic approaches for turbulent scalar transport resulting in a two-parameterWald (or inverse Gaussian) distribution. Unlike commonly used phenomenological models, WALD's parameters can be estimated from the key factors affecting wind dispersal - wind statistics, seed release height, and seed terminal velocity - determined independently of dispersal data. WALD's asymptotic power-law tail has an exponent of -3/2, a limiting value verified by a meta-analysis for a wide variety of measured dispersal kernels and larger than the exponent of the bivariate Student t-test (2Dt). We tested WALD using three dispersal data sets on forest trees, heathland shrubs, and grassland forbs and compared WALD's performance with that of other analytical mechanistic models (revised versions of the tilted Gaussian Plume model and the advection-diffusion equation), revealing fairest agreement between WALD predictions and measurements. Analytical mechanistic models, such as WALD, combine the advantages of simplicity and mechanistic understanding and are valuable tools for modeling large-scale, long-term plant population dynamics.

AB Conifer regeneration failure in the presence of dense ericaceous cover resulting from the removal of canopy trees by forest harvesting observed in boreal and temperate forest has been attributed to allelopathy, competition, and soil nutrient imbalance. Ecosystem-level alleopathic effect has been argued as a cause for conifer regeneration failure by citing examples from a species-poor boreal forest in northern Sweden with ground vegetation dominated by crowberry (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Ericales) and New Zealand dairy pastures invaded by nodding or musk thistle (Carduus nutans). This article aims to explain the phenomenon of vegetation shift from conifer forest to ericaceous heath by extending the argument of ecosystem-level impact of ericaceous plants and linking the disturbance-mediated regeneration strategies of the dominant conifer species and the understory ericaceous species with the quality of seedbed substrate that influence the direction of secondary succession. It has been argued that fire severity plays a pivotal role in controlling seedbed quality and the regeneration mechanisms of conifers, which in turn determines the direction of post-disturbance succession. The post-fire-dominated ericaceous plants and their habitat-modifying effects have been explained from the point of view of keystone species concept and their role as ecosystem engineers. In the absence of high severity natural fires the canopy keystone species (conifer) fails to regenerate successfully mainly due to limitation of favorable seedbed.
   On the other hand, the understory ericaceous plants regenerate vigorously by vegetative methods from the belowground components that survived the fire. Forest harvesting by clearcutting or selective cutting also create similar vigorous vegetative regrowth of ericaceous plants, but conifer regeneration suffers from the lack of a suitable seedbed. Thus in the absence of successful conifer regeneration, the vigorously growing understory ericaceous plants become the new keystone species. The new keystone ericaceous species bring about a significant long-term habitat change by rapid accumulation of plyphenol-rich humus. Ericaceous phenolic compounds have been found to inhibit seed germination and seedling growth of conifers. By forming protein-phenol complexes they cause a further reduction of available nitrogen of the already nutrient-stressed habitat. A low pH condition in the presence of phenolic compounds causes the leaching of metallic ions and forms hard iron pans that impair soil water movement. The phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous humus are also inhibitory to many conifer ectomycorrhizae. On the other hand, ericaceous plants perpetuate in the community by their stress-tolerating strategies as well as their ability to acquire nutrients through ericoid mycorrhizae. Three mechanisms working at the ecosystem level can be suggested as the cause of vegetation shift from forest to ericaceous heath. These are (1) the absence of high severity natural fire and the limitation of suitable conifer seedbed in the presence of thick humus, (2) increased competition resulting from the rapid vegetative regeneration of understory ericaceous plants after forest canopy opening by harvesting or nonsevere fire, and (3) habitat degradation by phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous plants causing a soil nutrient imbalance and iron pan formation. Thus, a shift in keystone species from conifer to ericaceous plant in the post-disturbance habitat may induce a retrogressive succession due to ecosystem-level engineering effects of the new keystone species.
   Vegetation management in conifer-ericaceous communities depends on land management objectives. If the objective is to produce timber and other forest products then the control of ericaceous plants and site preparation is necessary after forest harvesting. Ploughing and liming followed by conifer planting and repeated N fertilization has been applied successfully to promote afforestation of Calluna heathlands in Britain. However, such practice has not been proven successful in the reforestation of Kalmia-dominated sites in eastern Canada. If, on the other hand, the land management objective is to maintain heathlands for herbivore production or conservation of cultural landscape, as in the case of certain Calluna-dominated heathland in Western Europe, then moderately hot prescribed burning is useful as a management tool.

AB Coral reefs, with their vast diversity of invertebrate, vertebrate and algal species, have undoubtedly been subjected to natural disturbance since their appearance millions of years ago. Anthropogenic disturbance has been a factor affecting reefs for a fraction of that time, yet in terms of overall impact, may be of greater concern. Data on habitat destruction, pesticide and heavy metal accumulation, nutrient loading,. sedimentation, runoff and related impacts of man's activities indicate that many coastal reefs are endangered by these processes through alterations in animal-algal symbioses, shifts in competitive interactions, direct mortality, reproductive failure, and insufficient recruitment. The death of corals critically affects reef communities, as corals provide an important trophic link as well as the main habitat structure. While natural disturbance is an important factor affecting reef interactions, species diversity and evolution, chronic anthropogenic disturbances combined with unsuitable environments for recovery, are of great concern. Physiological stress can be measured in corals in addition to outright mortality, allowing the impacts of specific disturbances to be assessed. Sufficient data for distinguishing real problems from temporal variability are becoming available, allowing scientists to focus on practical solutions to problems in coral reef management and preservation.

AB Alternative equilibria dominated by either submerged plants or phytoplankton have been described for communities in shallow lakes. A nutrient-mediated increase in periphyton (algae attached to plant surfaces) is often described as being responsible for the loss of plants from shallow lakes, yet this violates the stochastic assumptions of alternative equilibria. To determine if periphyton is capable of forcing a switch between these communities, the factors governing the success of aquatic plants were surveyed in 17 plant-dominated shallow lakes in Norfolk (United Kingdom) that varied in nutrient concentration and fish biomass. In these lakes, plant biomass was negatively related to the density of periphyton. However, the density of periphyton on the plants was correlated with the density of grazing invertebrates, not nutrient concentration. In turn, the biomass of fish determined the density of invertebrates. This cascade from fish to periphyton via invertebrates appeared to be evident even though plant-dominated lakes are heterogeneous and complex. Under conditions of plant dominance, periphyton appeared to have a stronger influence on plant growth than phytoplankton. Our data support a model where, within the range of nutrients where alternative equilibria are possible, fish are the prime determinants of community structure in shallow lakes, through a cascading effect of predation on grazing invertebrates influencing the biomass of periphyton and hence, plants. We suggest that the stochasticity required for alternative equilibria in shallow lake communities is often derived from the vagaries of fish colonization and reproduction.

AB 1. In a population with Allee effects a positive relationship exists between fitness and population size or density. Allee effects may result in extinction thresholds and are therefore crucial in conservation and management. It has been shown theoretically that Allee effects can be driven by predation; however, there are few empirical data. Previous empirical work on Allee effects has emphasized that taxa with life-history characteristics such as co-operative breeding may be prone to such effects. Because predation is a general ecological mechanism, Allee effects may be more widespread than previously thought.
   2. We used a series of simple heuristic models to develop a theoretical framework for understanding predation-driven Allee effects as a function of predator functional and aggregative responses.
   2. Predators can create an Allee effect if they have a type I (linear) or type II (saturating) functional response without a type III (sigmoid) aggregative response, or vice versa. In addition, predation must be the main driver of prey dynamics, and prey must have little spatial or temporal refuge from predation.
   4. We highlighted several, mainly unrecognized, examples of predation-driven Allee effects from the literature, the majority of which came from systems that had been perturbed by exploitation or introduced predators.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Allee effects can arise from a general ecological process under a variety of different combinations of functional and aggregative responses. Allee effects may thus be present in a broad spectrum of different taxa with different types of life history, not only those taxa, such as broadcast spawners and co-operative breeders, on which empirical work has focused thus far. Conservation biologists and managers working with heavily exploited or threatened populations, or attempting reintroductions, should be aware of the possibility of a threshold population size or density below which extinction is likely. These thresholds can occur regardless of species life history, if predation is a major source of mortality and spatial and temporal predation refuges are limited.

AB Mangrove islands in Belize are characterized by a unique switching from nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) limitation to tree growth from shoreline to interior. Fertilization has previously shown that Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) fringe trees (5-6 m tall) growing along the shoreline are N limited; dwarf trees (less than or equal to 1.5 m tall) in the forest interior are P limited; and transition trees (2-4 m tall) are co-limited by both N and P. Growth patterns paralleled a landward decrease in soil flushing by tides and an increase in bioavailable N, but P availability remained consistently low across the gradient. Stable isotopic composition was measured in R. mangle leaves to aid in explaining this nutrient switching pattern and growth variation. Along control transects, leaf delta(15)N decreased from +0.10parts per thousand (fringe) to -5.38parts per thousand (dwarf). The delta(15)N of N-fertilized trees also varied spatially, but the values were consistently more negative (by similar to3parts per thousand) compared to control trees. Spatial variation in 815 N values disappeared when the trees were fertilized with P and values averaged +0.12parts per thousand, similar to that in control fringe trees. Neither variation in source inputs nor microbial fractionation could fully account for the observed patterns in delta(15)N. The results instead suggest that the lower delta(15)N values in transition and dwarf control trees were due to plant fractionation as a consequence of slower growth and lower N demand. P fertilization increased N demand and decreased fractionation. Although leaf delta(13)C was unaffected by fertilization, values increased from fringe (-28.6parts per thousand) to transition (-27.9parts per thousand) to dwarf (-26.4parts per thousand) zones, indicating spatial variation in environmental stresses affecting stomatal conductance or carboxylation. The results thus suggest an interaction of external supply, internal demand, and plant ability to acquire nutrients under different hydro-edaphic conditions that vary across this tree-height gradient. The findings not only aid in understanding mangrove discrimination of nitrogen and carbon isotopes, but also have implications for identifying nutrient loading and other stress conditions in coastal systems dominated by mangroves.

AB Six coral reef locations between Miami and Key West were marked with stainless steel stakes and rephotographed periodically between 1984 and 1991. The monitored areas included two photostations in the Looe Key National Marine Sanctuary, two photostations in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary, and two photostations in the Biscayne National Park. Stations were monitored for species number, percent cover, and species diversity of the scleractinian and hydrozoan stony corals. Monitoring began in 1984 for photostations in the National Marine Sanctuaries and in 1989 for stations in the National Park.
   All six areas lost coral species between the initial survey year and 1991. Survey areas lost between one and four species; these losses constituted between 13% and 29% of their species richness. Five of the six areas lost live coral cover. Based upon photographs taken repeatedly at these locations, net losses ranged between 7.3% and 43.9%. In the one station showing an increase in coral cover, the increase was only for the canopy branches of Acropora palmata; understory branches of this same species lost surface area at the same rate as canopy branches gained area. For most of the common species, there was a reduction in the total number of living colonies in the community, and a diminution in the number of large, mature colonies. Throughout the study period, there was no recruitment to any of the photostations by any of the massive frame building coral species.
   Mortality of this magnitude is often associated with hurricane damage, but in this survey the losses occurred during a period without catastrophic storms. Sources of mortality identifiable in the photographs include (1) black band disease and (2) ''bleaching''; other potential sources of mortality are also considered. We conclude, for our survey areas, that loss rates of this magnitude cannot be sustained for protracted periods if the coral community is to persist in a configuration resembling historical coral reef community structure in the Florida Keys.

AB Above- and below-ground biomass values for 17 types of grassland communities in China as classified by the Chinese Grasslands Resources Survey were obtained from systematic replicated sampling at 78 sites and from published records from 146 sites. Most of the systematic samples were along a 5,000-km-long transect from Hailar, Inner Mongolia (49 degrees 15'N, 119 degrees 15'E), to Pulan, Tibet (30 degrees 15'N, 81 degrees 10'E). Above-ground biomass was separated into stem, leaf, flower and fruit, standing dead matter, and litter. Below-ground biomass was measured in 10-cm soil layers to a depth of 30 cm for herbs and to 50 cm for woody plants. Grassland type mean total biomass carbon densities ranged from 2.400 kg m(-2) for swamp to 0.149 kg m(-2) for alpine desert grasslands. Ratios of below- to above-ground carbon density varied widely from 0.99 for tropical tussock grassland to 52.28 for alpine meadow. Most below-ground biomass was in the 0-10 cm soil depth layer and there were large differences between grassland types in the proportions of living and dead matter and stem and leaf. Differences between grassland types in the amount and allocation of biomass showed patterns related to environments, especially aridity gradients. Comparisons of our estimates with other studies indicated that above-ground biomass, particularly forage-yield biomass, is a poor predictor of total vegetation carbon density. Our estimate for total carbon storage in the biomass of the grasslands of China was 3.32 Pg C, with 56.4% contained in the grasslands of the Tibet-Qinghai plateau and 17.9% in the northern temperate grasslands. The need for further standardized and systematic measurements of vegetation biomass to validate global carbon cycles is emphasised.

TI Predicting future distributions of mountain plants under climate change:

AB Many studies have investigated the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of plant species, but few have attempted to constrain projections through plant dispersal limitations. Instead, most studies published so far have simplified dispersal as either unlimited or null. However, depending on the dispersal capacity of a species, landscape fragmentation, and the rate of climatic change, these assumptions can lead to serious over- or underestimation of the future distribution of plant species.
   To quantify the discrepancies between simulations accounting for dispersal or not, we carried out projections of future distribution over the 21st century for 287 mountain plant species in a study area of the western Swiss Alps. For each species, simulations were run for four dispersal scenarios (unlimited dispersal, no dispersal, realistic dispersal, and realistic dispersal with long-distance dispersal events) and under four climate change scenarios.
   Although simulations accounting for realistic dispersal limitations did significantly differ from those considering dispersal as unlimited or null in terms of projected future distribution, the unlimited dispersal simplification did nevertheless provide good approximations for species extinctions under more moderate climate change scenarios. Overall, simulations accounting for dispersal limitations produced, for our mountainous study area, results that were significantly closer to unlimited dispersal than to no dispersal. Finally, analysis of the temporal pattern of species extinctions over the entire 21st century revealed that important species extinctions for our study area might not occur before the 2080-2100 period, due to the possibility of a large number of species shifting their distribution to higher elevation.

AB Studies from a wide variety of ecosystems indicate that primary producers may protect their environment against degrading processes such as erosion by water current or wind. Theoretical analyses showed that the dynamics of these systems are governed by positive feedback. We investigated the implications of a positive feedback between growth of benthic diatoms and erosion of silt in tidal flat systems. A simple mathematical model shows that alternate stable states may occur in systems with positive feedback between diatom growth and silt accumulation, particularly in sediments with intermediate bottom shear stress. High diatom cover, high silt content, and low levels of erosion characterize one state. The other state is dominated by erosion, and hence both diatom cover and silt content are low. In an experimental study, we tested the critical model assumption that the growth rate of diatoms increases with the silt content of the sediment. Net growth of diatoms was significantly higher on silt than on sandy sediment after nine days of incubation, supporting the premise that diatom-silt interactions are governed by positive feedback. Furthermore, we compared model predictions to data on the physical and biological properties of sediments of a tidal flat. In accordance with our model, the silt content of sediments with intermediate to high bottom shear stress showed a clear and significant bimodal distribution, which may reflect the existence of alternate stable states. At low bottom shear stress, silt content was better explained by a unimodal distribution, as was predicted by our model. Patterns in chlorophyll a content were less clear. Nevertheless, chlorophyll a content was best explained by a bimodal distribution at high bottom shear stress, and in two of the three periods at low bottom shear stress. Our study indicates that the positive feedback between enhanced production of diatoms and decreased erosion of sediment significantly affects the dynamics of intertidal flat systems.

AB Contrary to the theory of rational choice, adding an alternative to a set of available options often affects people's judgement of the preexisting options, Here, we show that honeybees (Apis mellifera) and gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis) are also influenced by the addition of an option to a choice set (i.e., by a change in local context). Like humans. our subjects violated basic properties of rational choice. Their relative preference between two original options changed with the introduction of a third, relatively unattractive option. Such context-dependent choice violates the constant-ratio rule. Our subjects increased their relative preference for the more similar of two alternatives, contrary to the similarity hypothesis. The jays also increased their absolute preference for the more similar of two alternatives. in violation of regularity. Thus. the principle of irrelevant alternatives, which assumes that preference between options does not depend on the presence or absence of other options. is violated not only by humans. but also by an invertebrate and a nonhuman vertebrate. These findings contradict the view that nonhuman animals should be immune to such psychological effects and that they should conform with normative accounts, such as rationality or optimal-foraging theory, because their decision-making processes are evolutionarily adaptive. We discuss the potential generality of context-dependent effects and suggest that such effects should be incorporated into decision-making models in behavioral ecology.

AB Ecosystems close to a critical threshold lose resilience, in the sense that perturbations can more easily push them into an alternative state. Recently, it has been proposed that such loss of resilience may be detected from elevated autocorrelation and variance in the fluctuations of the state of an ecosystem due to critical slowing down; the underlying generic phenomenon that occurs at critical thresholds. Here we explore the robustness of autocorrelation and variance as indicators of imminent critical transitions. We show both analytically and in simulations that variance may sometimes decrease close to a transition. This can happen when environmental factors fluctuate stochastically and the ecosystem becomes less sensitive to these factors near the threshold, or when critical slowing down reduces the ecosystem's capacity to follow high-frequency fluctuations in the environment. In addition, when available data is limited, variance can be systematically underestimated due to the prevalence of low frequencies close to a transition. By contrast, autocorrelation always increases toward critical transitions in our analyses. To exemplify this point, we provide cases of rising autocorrelation and increasing or decreasing variance in time series prior to past climate transitions.

AB Bergmann's rule states that individuals of a species/clade at higher altitudes or latitudes will be larger than those at lower ones. A systemic review of the known literature on inter- and intraspecific variation in insect size along latitudinal or altitudinal clines was done to see how often such clines appeared and whether they reflected classwide, species-specific, or experimentally biased tendencies. Nearly even numbers of studies showed Bergmann clines and converse-Bergmann clines, where insects get smaller as latitude/altitude increases. In fact, the majority of studies suggested no clines at all. Small ranges may have obscured certain clines, while giant ranges may have introduced artifacts. Researchers examining interspecific patterns found clines less frequently than those examining intraspecific patterns because of variation among species within the clades, which renders interspecific studies unhelpful. Bergmann's rule does not apply to hexapods with nearly the same consistency as it does to endothermic vertebrates. The validity of Bergmann's rule for any group and range of insects is highly idiosyncratic and partially depends on the study design. I conclude that studies of Bergmann's rule should focus within species and look at widespread but contiguous populations to account for all sources of variation while minimizing error.

AB Question: Why would individuals that inhabit the same environment choose to feed on different subsets of the available resources?
   Mathematical method: We outline a flexible model that combines phenotypic variation with optimal diet theory and population dynamics. We then apply this model to investigate the role of different types of trade-offs. phenotype diversity and level of competition in determining the degree of individual specialization.
   Key assumptions: The foragers in the model are omniscient and maximize energy intake per time unit.
   Conclusion: Numerical simulations match empirical observations that changes in population density can alter the degree of individual specialization. Forager density and phenotypic variation affected prey densities. which in turn affected forager diet breadth and fitness (energy income). We propose that this feedback can explain the empirical relationship between forager density and the degree of individual specialization in the forager population.

AB Ten reintroduction attempts were conducted in and around the Arid Recovery Reserve in northern South Australia between 1998 and 2008. Five locally-extinct mammal species and one reptile species were reintroduced into a fenced Reserve where cats, foxes and rabbits were excluded. Reintroductions of the nationally threatened greater stick-nest rat, burrowing bettong, greater bilby and western barred bandicoot were all considered successful based on short and medium-term success criteria. These criteria included continued survival after 8 years, increased distribution across the large Reserve and, most importantly, recovery after a drought event. The trial reintroductions of the numbat and woma python into the Reserve were unsuccessful due to predation by native avian and reptilian predators respectively. Outside the Reserve, where cats and foxes were present but controlled through poison baiting, reintroduction attempts of the greater bilby and burrowing bettong were unsuccessful. High mortality was attributed to cat and fox predation with dingoes also contributing to post-release mortality in bettongs. However, a reintroduction of burrowing bettongs into a fenced area with low rabbit and cat abundance has, to-date, met short-term and medium-term success criteria. Results suggest that the absence or severe restriction of exotic mammalian predators was the critical factor responsible for the success of the mammal reintroductions. Determining thresholds of predator activity below which successful reintroduction of threatened species can occur, are needed to improve the science of reintroduction biology in Australia.

AB Most arid ecosystems have suffered from severe overexploitation by excessive wood harvesting, overgrazing, and agriculture, resulting in depletion of vegetation biomass and soil erosion. These changes are often difficult to reverse due to positive feedbacks that tend to stabilize the new situation. In this paper, we briefly review evidence for the idea that different states in these ecosystems might represent alternative equilibria and present a graphic model that summarizes the implications for their response to changing environmental conditions. We show how, in the light of this theoretical framework, climatic oscillations such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) could be used in combination with grazer control to restore degraded arid ecosystems. We also present evidence that, depending on grazing pressure, ENSO episodes can trigger structural and long-lasting changes in these ecosystems.

AB This paper reviews empirical studies relating communities of coral-reef fishes to the characteristics of the underlying habitat, and the effects of habitat disturbance. Many contrasting patterns in the relationships between fish communities and coral cover, habitat heterogeneity or topographic complexity have been described, including strong effects of particular habitat characteristics (both positive and negative), as well as those finding weak or no relationships. In addition, a whole range of potential responses to different kinds of disturbance, including hurricane damage, crown-of-thorns (Acanthaster planci) outbreaks, and El Nino-associated coral and sea urchin die-offs, have been described. Few workers have attempted to test among alternative models about the importance of resource limitation or responses to disturbance, so critical hypotheses have not been tested. Potential generalizations may be obscured due to a number of problems faced when making comparisons among existing studies. These include the enormous variation in the magnitude of changes to habitats observed, restrictive assumptions about the form of relationships between fish and habitat variables, inadequate descriptions of habitat and fish community structure, a heavy reliance on 'natural', pseudoreplicated experiments and a plethora of different numerical and analytical techniques. We conclude that the search for generalizations would be facilitated by a greater attention to theory and clearer statements of the hypotheses being tested. Evaluation of the general importance of fish-habitat interactions must await the application of common observational and experimental methodologies to a wider range of fish taxa and locations.

AB Plants and microbes coexist or compete for survival and their cohesive interactions play a vital role in adapting to metalliferous environments, and can thus be explored to improve microbe-assisted phytoremediation. Plant root exudates are useful nutrient and energy sources for soil microorganisms, with whom they establish intricate communication systems. Some beneficial bacteria and fungi, acting as plant growth promoting microorganisms (PGPMs), may alleviate metal phytotoxicity and stimulate plant growth indirectly via the induction of defense mechanisms against phytopathogens, and/or directly through the solubilization of mineral nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, iron, etc.), production of plant growth promoting substances (e.g., phytohormones), and secretion of specific enzymes (e.g., 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase). PGPM can also change metal bioavailability in soil through various mechanisms such as acidification, precipitation, chelation, complexation, and redox reactions. This review presents the recent advances and applications made hitherto in understanding the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of plant microbe interactions and their role in the major processes involved in phytoremediation, such as heavy metal detoxification, mobilization, immobilization, transformation, transport, and distribution.

AB Historic land use practices have dramatically altered landscapes across all scales, homogenising them and restricting opportunities for humans and wildlife. The need for multifunctional landscapes which simultaneously provide food security, livelihood opportunities, maintenance of species and ecological functions, and fulfil cultural, aesthetic recreational needs is now recognised. Numerous theoretical and technical tools have been developed to understand different landscape elements, in particular the emerging research area of ecosystem services. A brief review of these tools not only shows considerable growth and opportunity, but also serves to highlight a lack of research integration and a lag in implementation. The effective implementation of sustainable multifunctional landscapes requires true transdisciplinary engagement. We suggest the use of learning organisations to bring together the multiple stakeholders necessary for multifunctional landscapes to take purchase.

AB Range expansion and increasing densities of large herbivores are held responsible for large-scale habitat degradation in a wide range of natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Herbivore-driven ecosystem changes frequently represent predictable transitions from one vegetation state to another. Whether such predictable changes justify the value judgement 'habitat degradation' may be debatable as this strongly depends on individual perspective.
   To further the debate on herbivore-driven habitat degradation, I apply the concept of alternative stable states to arctic tundra as a framework to capture predictable stepwise vegetation transitions in which the productivity and hence herbivore-carrying capacity increases with grazing pressure. Specifically, evidence is provided that large parts of the tundra biome can be in either of three relatively discrete vegetation states and that changes in reindeer/ caribou density are responsible for sudden, predictable but often reversible state transitions. From this, it appears that the relatively rapidly emerging vegetation changes do not necessarily equate to habitat degradation, but in many cases reflect predictable vegetation change. Acknowledgement of the existence of predictable state transitions in tundra ecosystems may help to evaluate the observed radical vegetation changes occurring throughout the reindeer/caribou range.

AB Discrete time single species models with overcompensating density dependence and an Allee effect due to predator satiation and mating limitation are investigated. The models exhibit four behaviors: persistence for all initial population densities, bistability in which a population persists for intermediate initial densities and otherwise goes extinct, extinction for all initial densities, and essential extinction in which "almost every" initial density leads to extinction. For fast-growing populations, these models show populations can persist at high levels of predation even though lower levels of predation lead to essential extinction. Alternatively, increasing the predator's handling time, the population's carrying capacity, or the likelihood of mating success may lead to essential extinction. In each of these cases, the mechanism behind these disappearances are chaotic dynamics driving populations below a critical threshold determined by the Allee effect. These disappearances are proceeded by chaotic transients that are proven to be approximately exponentially distributed in length and highly sensitive to initial population densities.

AB Aim Many studies have forecasted the possible impact of climate change on plant distributions using models based on ecological niche theory, but most of them have ignored dispersal-limitations, assuming dispersal to be either unlimited or null. Depending on the rate of climatic change, the landscape fragmentation and the dispersal capabilities of individual species, these assumptions are likely to prove inaccurate, leading to under-or overestimation of future species distributions and yielding large uncertainty between these two extremes. As a result, the concepts of 'potentially suitable' and 'potentially colonizable' habitat are expected to differ significantly. To quantify to what extent these two concepts can differ, we developed MIGCLIM, a model simulating plant dispersal under climate change and landscape fragmentation scenarios. MIGCLIM implements various parameters, such as dispersal distance, increase in reproductive potential over time, landscape fragmentation or long-distance dispersal.
   Location Western Swiss Alps.
   Methods Using our MIGCLIM model, several simulations were run for two virtual species by varying dispersal distance and other parameters. Each simulation covered the 100-year period 2001-2100 and three different IPCC-based temperature warming scenarios were considered.
   Results of dispersal-limited projections were compared with unlimited and no-dispersal projections. Results Our simulations indicate that: (1) using realistic parameter values, the future potential distributions generated using MIGCLIM can differ significantly (up to more than 95% difference in colonized surface) from those that ignore dispersal; (2) this divergence increases under more extreme climate warming scenarios and over longer time periods; and (3) the uncertainty associated with the warming scenario can be as large as the one related to dispersal parameters.
   Main conclusions Accounting for dispersal, even roughly, can importantly reduce uncertainty in projections of species distribution under climate change scenarios.

AB 1. Within the distribution area of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.), the maximum observed life span attained in a population varies from 30 to 132 years and the maximum shell length from 80 to 145 mm. For both life-history traits, the growth constant k is a major determinant. The growth constant describes the shape of the average individual growth curve, the lower its value, the slower is the asymptote approached. Maximum size and life span increase as the growth constant declines and the maximum age almost equals the time necessary to complete the growth pattern.
   2. With increasing latitude, from North Spain up to the polar circle, the growth constant declines, whereas age and size increase. This must be attributed to the close relationship between the growth constant and metabolism. As temperature decreases (towards the north), metabolic rate declines and the rate of growth decreases; the asymptote is approached slowly and this leads to a long life. Simultaneously, there is probably a shift in the anabolic-catabolic-balance increasing the asymptotic size and hence the maximum size.
   3. The growth constant and maximum life span also respond to the productivity of the habitat. There is a negative correlation between growth constant and eutrophication, and the maximum life span is reduced as the concentration of nitrate increases.
   4. Implications for Bergmann's rule and for the theory of ageing are discussed. It is concluded that this variability is a case of phenotypic plasticity with no adaptive value because: (i) plasticity must be attributed to unavoidable physiological responses; (ii) between populations the relationships between maximum life span, maximum size and reproductive output are positive, whereas trade-offs would be expected if variation in life-history tactics was the source of plasticity; and (iii) the demographic consequences of plasticity may be highly disadvantageous.

AB 1. Many classical models of ungulate foraging are premised on energy maximization, yet limited empirical evidence and untested currency assumptions make the choice of currency a non-trivial issue. The primary constraints on forage intake of ungulates are forage quality and availability. Using a model that incorporates these two constraints, we predicted the optimal biomass of forage patches for ungulate grazers using an energy maximizing vs, a time minimizing strategy.
   2. We tested these predictions on wood bison (Bison bison athabascae Rhoads) grazing naturally occurring sedge (Carex atherodes Spreng). The digestive constraint was determined by a series of ad libitum feeding trials using sedge at different stages of growth. Sedge digestibility declined with biomass. Ad libitum intake of sedge by bison declined with sedge digestibility and thus decreased with sedge biomass. On the other hand, short-term sedge intake rates of wood bison increased with biomass.
   3. Incorporation of these constraints resulted in the prediction that daily energy gain of bison should be maximized by grazing patches with a biomass of 10 g m(-2), whereas a bison could minimize daily foraging time needed to fulfil its energy requirement by cropping patches with a biomass of 279 g m(-2).
   4. To test these quantitative predictions, we used a staggered mowing regime to convert even-aged stands of sedge to a mosaic of patches varying in quality and quantity. Observations of bison grazing these mosaics indicated that patches of biomass below 120 g m(-2) were avoided, while patches of biomass 156 and 219 g m(-2) were highly preferred, with the greatest preference for the latter.
   5. These results indicate that bison were behaving as time minimizers rather than energy maximizers. Daily cropping times of free-ranging bison from the literature corroborate our results.

AB The existence of ecological discontinuities and thresholds has been recognised by ecological economics as a key feature to take into account in the study of environment-economy interactions. This paper reviews some theoretical developments and empirical studies dealing with ecological phenomena involving non-linear dynamics. The literature about this issue reveals that there is abundant evidence of discontinuities and threshold effects: as the consequence of human perturbations on ecological systems. However, due to the complexities involved, the predictive capacity of ecology is limited and large uncertainties still remain. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Atmospheric conditions strongly influence ecological systems, and tools that simplify the access and processing of atmospheric data can greatly facilitate ecological research.
   2. We have developed RNCEP, a package of functions in the open-source R language, to access, organise and visualise freely available atmospheric data from two long- term high- quality data sets with global coverage.
   3. These functions retrieve data, via the Internet, for either a desired spatiotemporal extent or interpolated to a point in space and time. The package also contains functions to temporally aggregate data, producing user- defined variables, and to visualise these data on a map.
   4. By making access to atmospheric data and integration with biological data easier and more flexible, we hope to facilitate and encourage the exploration of relationships between biological systems and atmospheric conditions.

AB Factors causing global degradation of coral reefs are examined briefly as a basis for predicting the likely consequences of increases in these factors. The earlier consensus was that widespread but localized damage from natural factors such as storms, and direct anthropogenic effects such as increased sedimentation, pollution and exploitation, posed the largest immediate threat to coral reefs. Now truly global factors associated with accelerating Global Climate Change are either damaging coral reefs or have the potential to inflict greater damage in the immediate future: e.g. increases in coral bleaching and mortality, and reductions in coral calcification due to changes in sea-water chemistry with increasing carbon dioxide concentrations. Rises in sea level will probably disrupt human communities and their cultures by making coral cays uninhabitable, whereas coral reefs will sustain minimal damage from the rise in sea level. The short-term (decades) prognosis is indeed grim, with major reductions almost certain in the extent and biodiversity of coral reefs, and severe disruptions to cultures and economies dependent on reef resources. The long-term (centuries to millennia) prognosis is more encouraging because coral reefs have remarkable resilience to severe disruption and will probably show this resilience in the future when climate changes either stabilize or reverse.

AB Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems on our planet. Scleractinian corals function as the primary reef ecosystem engineers, constructing the framework that serves as a habitat for all other coral reef-associated organisms. However, the coral's engineering role is particularly susceptible to global climate change. Ocean warming can cause extensive mass coral bleaching, which triggers dysfunction of major engineering processes. Sub-lethal bleaching results in the reduction of both primary productivity and coral calcification. This may lead to changes in the release of organic and inorganic products, thereby altering critical biogeochemical and recycling processes in reef ecosystems. Thermal stress-induced bleaching and subsequent coral mortality, along with ocean acidification, further lead to long-term shifts in benthic community structure, changes in topographic reef complexity, and the modification of reef functioning. Such shifts may cause negative feedback loops and further modification of coral-derived inorganic and organic products. This review emphasises the critical role of scleractinian corals as reef ecosystem engineers and highlights the control of corals over key reef ecosystem goods and services, including high biodiversity, coastal protection, fishing, and tourism. Thus, climate change by impeding coral ecosystem engineers will impair the ecosystem functioning of entire reefs.

ID FLORIDA; CALCIFICATION; COMMUNITIES
AB A series of cold fronts passing over the western Arabian Gulf from December 1988 to March 1989 produced the longest period of sustained low water temperatures ever recorded in a coral reef area.  Sea water temperatures recorded on two reefs during this period provide new estimates of lower thermal limits for reef coral survival.  Severe mortality of the corals Acropora pharaonis and Platygyra daedalea occurred at the northern site where minimum temperatures fell below 11.5-degrees-C on four consecutive days and mean daily temperatures were 13-degrees-C or less for more than 30 days.  However, Porites compressa, the principal reef-former in this area, and various faviid corals initially showed only sub-lethal effects and appeared normal after six months.  Corals were not damaged at the southern site, where minimum water temperature fell below 12.5-degrees-C for two consecutive days, but mean temperatures were 14-degrees-C or less for only 5 non-consecutive days.

AB Increasing populations of cervids in Europe and North America have made the issue of overgrazing relevant outside areas with domestic or semi-domestic herbivores. Overgrazing is defined depending on management objectives. I focus on challenges related to implementing a 'range ecologist' baseline, defining overgrazing as situations when 'forage species are not able to maintain themselves over time due to an excess of herbivory or related processes'. Herbivores may be naturally regulated at ecological carrying capacity (K) with no overgrazing, but overgrazing may occur below K. Rare, preferred plant species can decline in density due to a 'herbivore pit' created by generalist herbivores, without having much effect on K. The concept of overgrazing is almost meaningless unless the issue of spatial scale is considered, and the extent to which preferred plant species decline in coverage. Herbivore population instability increases with increased population growth rate, but overgrazing depends also on the tolerance to grazing of the forage used by a given herbivore, which is closely related to functional plant traits. Ecosystem factors such as soil quality and slope also affect the likelihood that overgrazing will occur. Currently we can only qualitatively identify some important factors to consider. A better understanding of the sequence of events happening to performance of both animals and plants over time when a herbivore population increases provides a very useful approach until tools are developed to measure overgrazing quantitatively. More detailed knowledge about grazing effects on biodiversity is necessary to implement a broader ecosystem perspective of overgrazing.

AB Predator facilitation occurs when prey face two or more predator species and cannot forage and be safe from both types of predators simultaneously: avoiding one predator necessarily leads to increased exposure to the other. Two species of coexisting gerbils (Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum) which coexist in sandy habitats in the Negev Desert, Israel may face such conflicting demands from vipers and owls. We tested this by subjecting the gerbils to the presence of snakes and owls in a factorial experiment carried out in a large aviary. We also manipulated illumination and microhabitat, two factors which affect the risk of predation. Gerbils responded to owls by reducing foraging activity, avoiding the open microhabitat, and exploiting resource patches less intensively. Also, G. pyramidum showed a significant light x snake x owl interaction indicative of predator facilitation: the gerbils avoided the open entirely when faced with lights and owls, but increased their exposure to owls if vipers were also present. The fangs of die snakes are driving the gerbils into the talons of the owls. Such facilitation may affect the foraging behavior, species interactions, and community structure of the gerbils.

AB Seed ecologists have often stated that they expect larger-seeded species to have lower survivorship through postdispersal seed predation than smaller-seeded species. Similar predictions can be made for the relationship between survivorship through predispersal seed predation and seed mass. In order to test these predictions, we gathered data regarding survivorship through 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed predators for 81 Australian species, and survivorship through. predispersal seed predation for 170 Australian species. These species came from an and environment, a subalpine environment, and a temperate coastal environment. We also gathered data from the published literature (global) on survivorship through postdispersal seed predation for 280 species and survivorship through predispersal seed predation for 174 species.
   We found a weak positive correlation between seed mass and the percentage of seeds remaining after 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed predators at two of three field sites in Australia, and no significant relationship across 280 species from the global literature, or at the remaining field site. There was no significant relationship between seed mass and survivorship through predispersal seed predation either cross-species or across phylogenetic divergences in any of the vegetation types, or in the compilation of data from the literature. Postdispersal seed removal was responsible for a greater percentage of seed loss in our field studies than was predispersal seed predation. On average, 83% of diaspores remained after 24 hours of exposure to postdispersal seed removers, whereas 87% of seeds survived all predispersal seed predation that occurred between seed formation and seed maturity. Mean seed survival was higher in the field studies than in the literature compilations, and species showing 100% survival were heavily underrepresented in the literature. These differences may be due to biases in species selection or publication bias. Seed defensive tissue mass increased isometrically with seed mass, but there was no significant relationship between the amount of defensive tissue per gram of seed reserve mass and survivorship through postdispersal seed predation.

AB Biotic homogenization, with its emphasis on invasions, extinctions, and convergence in taxonomic similarity, provides an important framework for investigating changes in biodiversity across scales. Through their selective foraging, large populations of white-tailed deer are altering population sizes, driving extirpations, and facilitating invasions of plants throughout the eastern United States. I hypothesize that deer can drive biotic homogenization in forest understory communities by shifting species composition to one dominated by grasses, sedges, and ferns (all wind-pollinated plants). I report the effects of 16 years of deer exclusion in a hemlock-northern hardwood stand in N Wisconsin using a block design. Species composition showed greater convergence in control plots than exclosure plots, indicating deer can drive biotic homogenization at the stand level. Total percent cover is nearly 4 times greater in exclosure plots. Percent cover by woody plants, broadleaf herbs, and ferns is 150, 63, and 20 times greater in exclosure plots, respectively, while cover by sedges and grasses is 3.8 and 2.2 times greater in control plots. Cover by species with showy, insect-pollinated flowers is 79 times greater in exclosures. Graminoid-dominated control plots represent a novel state not observed fifty years ago, and could reflect the emergence of a grazing lawn. The increase in graminoids at this study area and throughout the region could under some global change scenarios be an early stage of conversion from forest to savanna or wood pasture.

AB Invasion by exotic species is a major threat to global diversity. The,invasion of native perennial grasslands in California by annual species from the southern Mediterranean region is one of the most dramatic invasions worldwide. As a result of this invasion, native species are often restricted to low-fertility, marginal habitat. An understanding of the mechanisms that prevent the recolonization of the more fertile sites by native species is critical to determining the prospects for conservation and restoration of the native flora. We present the results of a five-year experiment in which we used seeding, burning, and mowing treatments to investigate the mechanisms that constrain native annuals to the marginal habitat of a Californian serpentine grassland. The abundance and richness of native species declined with increasing soil fertility, and there was no effect of burning or mowing on native abundance or richness in the absence of seeding. We found that native annual forbs were strongly seed limited; a single seeding increased abundance of native forbs even in the presence of high densities of exotic species, and this effect was generally discernable after four years. These results suggest that current levels of dominance by exotic species are not simply the result of direct competitive interactions, and that seeding of native species is necessary and may be sufficient to create viable populations of native annual species in areas that are currently dominated by exotic species.

AB Two distinct organizational states of kelp forest communities, foliose algal assemblages and deforested barren areas, typically display sharp discontinuities. Mechanisms responsible for maintaining these state differences were studied by manipulating various features of their boundary regions, Urchins in the barren areas had significantly smaller gonads than those in adjacent kelp stands, implying that food was a limiting resource for urchins in the barrens. The abundance of drift algae and living foliose algae varied abruptly across the boundary between kelp beds and barren areas. These observations raise the question of why urchins from barrens do not invade kelp stands to improve their fitness, By manipulating kelp and urchin densities at boundary regions and within kelp beds, we tested the hypothesis that kelp stands inhibit invasion of urchins. Urchins that were experimentally added to kelp beds persisted and reduced kelp abundance until winter storms either swept the urchins away or caused them to seek refuge within crevices. Urchins' invaded kelp bed margins when foliose algae were removed but were prevented from doing so when kelps were replaced with physical models. The sweeping motion of kelps over the seafloor apparently inhibits urchins from crossing the boundary between kelp stands and barren areas, thus maintaining these alternate stable states. Our findings Suggest that kelp stands are able to defend themselves from their most important herbivore, by combining their flexible morphology with the energy of wave-generated surge. The inhibitory influence of this interaction may be an important mechanism maintaining the patchwork mosaics of barren areas and kelp beds that characterize many kelp forest ecosystems.

AB Laboratory and field experiments were used to determine whether high (similar or equal to 100 mg l(-1)), low (similar or equal to 50 mg l(-1)) and control (similar or equal to 0 mg l(-1)) levels of suspended sediment affected fertilisation, larval survival, and larval settlement in the scleractinian coral Acropora digitifera (Dana, 1846). Both high- and low-sediment treatments significantly decreased fertilisation, but post-fertilisation embryonic development was not inhibited by suspended sediments. Larval survival and larval settlement were significantly reduced in high- and low-sediment treatments. No difference was found between high- and low-sediment treatments in any of the three post-spawning processes investigated, suggesting that they are susceptible to sediment concentrations which are not exceptionally high even under natural conditions (>50 mg l(-1)). The introduction of an additional stress in the form of high levels of suspended sediments coupled with naturally high variability in recruitment may have a considerable effect on the successful supply and settlement of coral larvae to a reef. Given that many coral communities are open reproductive systems, the consequences of disturbance events are not likely to be restricted to the impact area. Recruitment to a population may be reduced significantly in the presence of high levels of suspended sediments because of effects on larval survival and settlement. Recruitment of larvae to adjacent populations may also be affected due to a decreased fertilisation success and potential increases in mortality of larvae passing through the affected site.

AB A review of research on the effects of hurricanes on coral reefs suggests that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis may be applicable to shallow reef zones dominated by branching or foliaceous coral species that are especially susceptible to mechanical damage from storms. Diversity (H') increases because of an increase in evenness following destruction or removal of the species that was monopolizing the space. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis as presented by Connell focuses on changes in number of species, but should be expanded to include diversity (H') and evenness. It should also be modified to incorporate changes in living cover and the time elapsed since disturbances of varying intensities. This hypothesis predicts that when cover is high, diversity will be low. However, research on coral reefs does not consistently demonstrate an inverse correlation of coral diversity and coral cover. An increase in cover and decrease in diversity with depth would also be expected because deeper reef zones generally experience less disturbance. However, higher diversity (both H' and species richness) is often associated with deeper zones. The effects of hurricanes on coral reefs will depend on the temporal and spatial scales under consideration, the life history characteristics and morphology of the dominant species, the depth of the reef zone, the ecological history of the site, and the influence of any additional natural or human stresses.

AB To meet the challenges of the emerging information-rich society, landscape ecology must become a holistic problem-solving oriented science by joining the transdisciplinary scientific revolution with a paradigm shift from conventional reductionistic and mechanistic approaches to holistic and organismic approaches of wholeness, connectedness and ordered complexity. Its central holistic concept is the Total Human Ecosystem as the highest level of co-evolutionary complexity in the global ecological hierarchy, with solar energy powered biosphere and fossil energy powered technosphere landscapes as its concrete systems. Landscape ecology could contribute to their structural and functional integration into a coherent sustainable ecosphere and thereby to the establishment of a sustainable balance between attractive and productive biosphere landscapes and healthy and livable technosphere landscapes for this and future generation. By utilizing new insights in self-organization of autopioetic systems and their cross-catalytic networks in the Total Human Ecosystem for synergistic benefits of the people, their economy and landscapes, such holistic landscape ecology together with other mission-driven transdisciplinary environmental sciences could serve as a catalyst for the urgently needed post-industrial symbiosis between nature and human society. This would ensure also their further biological and cultural evolution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Marine ecosystems were among the first to provide potential examples of multiple stable states. However, remarkably few of these have been explored in detail, and none have been rigorously confirmed. This may be because differences between alternative states are too subtle to document in the context of regular disturbance, because one state is naturally far more likely to occur than any other, or because most environments naturally support only one type of stable community. It is also possible that the temporal and spatial criteria required to document alternate stable states rigorously may be too difficult to meet in most circumstances. Nevertheless, the possibility of alternative stable states has recently received renewed attention in the context of marine conservation biology. People may be widening the range of habitats in which alternate stable states are possible, or they may be shifting communities to new domains of attraction that rarely occur in the absence of massive anthropogenic perturbations. The ability of people now to alter ocean ecosystems on global scales may eliminate "edge effects" that might otherwise rescue perturbed communities. Ecosystems with alternate stable states are characterized by positive feedback mechanisms that stabilize transitions; even if return to original conditions is predicted (that is, the alternate states are not stable), the same mechanisms will retard recovery. This may explain in part why return to original conditions following anthropogenic disturbance is slower than expected. Slow recovery times and transitions to new states are both potentially costly to human societies. Thus, from a conservation perspective the indefinite persistence of an alternate state may be less important than the presence of feedback loops that slow recovery. Both possibilities reinforce the arguments for application of the precautionary principle in managing marine ecosystems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is a review of direct and indirect effects of elevated temperatures (greater than or equal to 25 degrees C) on freshwater zooplankton in temperate latitudes. Effects of temperature on aspects of behavior, individual growth, development and reproduction, and population dynamics are compared across zooplankton taxa. Thermal responses vary markedly among co-occurring species and among clones within parthenogenetic species. There is strong evidence that elevated temperature can produce a reduction in body size within zooplankton populations. Also, some zooplankton assemblages become increasingly dominated by smaller bodied forms under warm conditions. We hypothesize that certain cold-water zooplankton species show the greatest risk of local extinction during late summer heating events because of their dependence on thermal refugia, and their lack of diapausing or dispersal stages.
   Indirect effects of elevated temperature mediated by changes in the algal food supply or by altered interspecific interactions are also explored. Elevated temperature can change algal community structure and algal food quality, all of which can affect the outcome of zooplankton interspecific competition. Size-selective predation rates of planktivorous fish are also likely to increase with increasing temperature or when zooplankton are driven from the hypolimnion. The onset of fish feeding is also likely to begin earlier in the season thus reducing the time that large zooplankton are present during the ice-free season. Reductions in the size structure of zooplankton assemblages are likely to alter water clarity, nutrient regeneration and fish abundances.

AB In the mangrove of the Caete Estuary (North Brazil) a detailed sampling was carried out in order to gain insight into the dynamics of inorganic nutrients and organic matter in one of the world's largest mangroves and to identify the driving forces behind these processes. Throughout 36 tidal cycles in the course of one year, concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, POC, DON, PON) and dissolved inorganic nutrients (N, P, Si compounds) were determined in a mangrove tidal creek. Annual average concentrations (in muM) were DOC 360, POC 240, DON 20, PON 29, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) 11, silicate 170 and phosphate 2.4. Ammonium and nitrite were about 80 and 17% of DIN, respectively. Nutrient dynamics in the creek were significantly influenced by porewater input from the upper forest sediment layer. This led to characteristic tidal signatures of nutrient and organic matter concentrations with maximum values during low tide. Annual phosphate and DOC oscillations were caused mainly by tidally dependent variations of porewater input. Their concentrations in the creek were directly proportional to the hydraulic gradient between creek and sediment water table. Due to autotrophic activity, dissolved oxygen, pH and DOC were higher and DIN was lower during daytime than at night. Annual oscillations of DIN and DON could also be attributed to varying phytoplanktonic activity. Silicate and phosphate showed only weak response to aquatic photosynthesis with slightly lower concentrations during the day. Assuming equilibrated fluxes, nitrogen fixation in the forest could be estimated to be 2.3 mmol N m(-2) d(-1). Based on these findings, tidal range and porewater concentrations were identified as driving forces behind coastal outwelling of nutrients and organic matter from mangroves. Outwelling probably occurs only from mangroves where the nutrient concentration in porewater exceeds the demands of the benthic community and trees, caused by positive sedimentation balances and high nitrogen fixation rates, and only in macrotidal regions where porewater can flow in considerable amounts to the tidal creeks and the ocean.

AB Morphological relationships among sympatric animal species have often been seen as indirect evidence for competition. Many early ecomorphological studies revealed patterns that were taken as indicating character displacement and character release, driven by competition or lack thereof. These patterns may result from a coevolutionary morphological response or from species sorting according to size. Thus, the relationship between morphology and competition may be crucial for understanding both the morphological evolution of animals and the role of competition in structuring communities. Some earlier research perceived as indicating morphological relationships conditioned by interaction of species was conducted on mammals, particularly carnivores. Subsequent criticism in the ecological literature demonstrated that many of the perceived patterns could not be statistically confirmed, thus calling into question this line of evidence for competition. More recent ecological literature relies on strong statistical analyses and careful consideration both of guild composition and of which morphological traits should be examined. This literature, resting largely on mammals, includes several cases that suggest a coevolutionary morphological response to interspecific competition. These studies have focused on the trophic apparatus directly related to food procurement by mammals - the teeth. Island mammals often show striking morphological patterns, some of which have been interpreted as resulting from release from competition with mainland species that have not reached islands. However, few of these patterns were critically evaluated to demonstrate their support for the hypothesis of character release. Despite several decades of interest and research, many questions regarding competitively induced morphological patterns remain unresolved and require further research. Mammals are especially promising subjects for such research.

AB Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to account for the widespread occurrence of specialized behavior, especially with regard to food and host-related resource utilization. None of these hypotheses has been widely accepted, although most are recognized as being important for particular taxa or in certain circumstances. We discuss features of neural function as primary proximate mechanisms involved in resource specialization, which may underlie many of the other hypotheses. Diet and host breadth may be associated with the potential informational complexity of an organism's environment. The processing of complex information ultimately entails costs associated with decision time, relative efficiency of food or oviposition site-selection behavior, and concomitant exposure to potential mortality factors. Sensory focusing, through paying attention, experiential processes, or canalized sensory input decreases these costs. Increased efficiency of host finding, recognition, and discrimination can be expected as a result of a reduced probability of information overload. Such efficiencies should, in addition, decrease exposure to natural enemies.

AB The ability of bottom-dwelling marine epifauna to regenerate injured or lost body parts is critical to the survival of individuals from disturbances that inflict wounds. Numerous studies on marine sponges (Phlyum Porifera) and corals (of the orders Scleractinia and Alcyonacea) suggest that regeneration is limited by many intrinsic (individual-dependent) and extrinsic (environment-dependent) factors, and that other fife history processes may compete with regeneration for energetic and cellular resources. We review how intrinsic (size, age, morphology, genotype) and extrinsic (wound characteristics, water temperature, food availability, sedimentation, disturbance history, selection) factors limit regeneration in sponges and corals. We then review the evidence for impaired somatic growth and sexual reproduction, and altered outcomes of interactions (anti-predator defenses, competitive abilities, self- and non-self recognition abilities) with other organisms in regenerating sponges and corals. We demonstrate that smaller, older sponges and corals of decreasing morphological complexities tend to regenerate less well than others, and that regeneration can be modulated by genotype. Large wounds with small perimeters inflicted away from areas where resources are located tend to be regenerated less well than others, as are injuries inflicted when food is limited and when the animal has been previously or recently injured. We also demonstrate that regeneration strongly impairs somatic growth, reduces aspects of sexual reproduction, and decreases the ability for sponges and corals to defend themselves against predators, to compete, and to recognize conspecifics. Effects of limited regeneration and impaired life histories may manifest themselves in higher levels of biological assembly e.g., reduced accretion of epifaunal biomass, reduced recruitment and altered biotic associations, and thus affect marine community and ecosystem recovery from disturbances.

AB Phenotypes vary hierarchically among taxa and populations, among genotypes within populations, among individuals within genotypes, and also within individuals for repeatedly expressed, labile phenotypic traits. This hierarchy produces some fundamental challenges to clearly defining biological phenomena and constructing a consistent explanatory framework. We use a heuristic statistical model to explore two consequences of this hierarchy. First, although the variation existing among individuals within populations has long been of interest to evolutionary biologists, within-individual variation has been much less emphasized. Within-individual variance occurs when labile phenotypes (behaviour, physiology, and sometimes morphology) exhibit phenotypic plasticity or deviate from a norm-of-reaction within the same individual. A statistical partitioning of phenotypic variance leads us to explore an array of ideas about residual within-individual variation. We use this approach to draw attention to additional processes that may influence within-individual phenotypic variance, including interactions among environmental factors, ecological effects on the fitness consequences of plasticity, and various types of adaptive variance. Second, our framework for investigating variation in phenotypic variance reveals that interactions between levels of the hierarchy form the preconditions for the evolution of all types of plasticity, and we extend this idea to the residual level within individuals, where both adaptive plasticity in residuals and canalization-like processes (stability) can evolve. With the statistical tools now available to examine heterogeneous residual variance, an array of novel questions linking phenotype to environment can be usefully addressed.

AB Limiting the damage by non-indigenous species requires rapid determination of current and potential distributions and vectors of dispersal, and development of appropriate management measures. The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), a wood-boring beetle native to South-East Asia, was first reported in the Great Lakes region during summer 2002. The beetle poses an enormous threat to native ash (Fraxinus) species of North America, as untreated trees in infested areas of Ontario, Michigan and Ohio suffer high mortality. We demonstrate that the borer has spread in North America through a combination of diffusive range extension, associated with local flights, and by long-distance 'jump' dispersal associated with human movement of infested sapling or contaminated firewood. Probability of infestation was inversely related to distance from borer epicentres but positively related to the size of human population centres. At least 9 of 39 populations that were first reported in Michigan during 2004 cannot be accounted for by local diffusion, raising the possibility that other unidentified mechanisms may be contributing to the dispersal of the beetle. In the absence of quarantine, by 2005 all of Michigan's lower peninsula was contained within the boundaries of potential diffusive range expansion. Infested ash saplings also were introduced from Michigan to Maryland during 2003, and subsequently transplanted to five sites in Maryland and Virginia. Quarantine and eradication measures have had mixed results: in the south-central USA, the species appears on the brink of eradication, whereas its distribution has continued to spread during 2005 in the Great Lakes region despite extensive containment and quarantine measures. Quarantine success in the Great Lakes region is encumbered by multiple dispersal vectors, larger borer population sizes and by the more extensive geographical distribution that was achieved prior to implementation of control measures.

AB A common element of many perennial grasslands, defined as an extinction-prone perennial grass, is a palatable obligate seed reproducer, producing low numbers of larger diaspores that are poorly dispersed. Such a species can become locally extinct on a regional or landscape scale in grasslands that experience both a variable rainfall, in which drought is characteristic, and sustained heavy grazing. The changes in the temporal and spatial patterns of grazing in human-influenced systems has created the possibility of local extinction. Catastrophic mortality of established populations occurs as a consequence of droughts in combination with sustained grazing, which eventually leads to the elimination of the population. Elimination of the established population is more likely to occur in semiarid than moist areas because of the greater frequency and duration of droughts. The maintenance or reestablishment of the population depends on successful recruitment, but seedling mortality is high because of intraseasonal drought and trampling. The seed bank of an extinction-prone species is rapidly eliminated if the input of seed is curtailed. These species do not form persistent seed banks because the seeds have a limited (2-3 yr) intrinsic capacity for survival when in a state of induced or enforced dormancy. Innate dormancy lasts for only a few months. Therefore, the size of the seed bank is determined primarily by the annual input of seed. But even under favorable rainfall and light grazing. 100% of seed produced can be lost to predation. Seed production can fail from drought and from the direct consumption of inflorescences. An extinction-prone species is self-dispersed and therefore poorly dispersed. The rate and scale of incidental animal dispersal are unlikely to assist in the maintenance or reestablishment of a population because of the low probability of seedling survival. The decline of an extinction-prone species under heavy grazing is compounded by the concomitant competitive influences of invasive species and unpalatable species, which both benefit from heavy grazing. Irreversible changes in the physicochemical environment may also result in local extinction, but these processes are not mutually exclusive. The autogenic model of secondary succession is inadequate for these grasslands if the present concept of local extinction is upheld.

AB P>1. The earliest examples of alternative community states in the literature appear to be descriptions of natural vegetation said to both depend on and promote fire. Nonetheless, alternative community states determined by fire have rarely been documented at landscape scales and in natural vegetation. This is because spatial autocorrelation may confound analyses, experimental manipulations are difficult and a long-term perspective is needed to demonstrate that alternative community states can persist for multiple generations.
   2. We hypothesized that alternative community states occur in a largely forested landscape in the Klamath Mountains, north-western California, USA, where shrub-dominated sclerophyllous vegetation establishes after fire that is lethal to forests. Forests redevelop if succession is not arrested by fire. Our hypothesis would require that sclerophyll and forest vegetation states each be maintained by different self-reinforcing relationships with fire.
   3. To test this hypothesis, we examined pyrogenicity of forest and sclerophyll vegetation as a function of time since the previous fire, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Fire exclusion served as a de facto experimental treatment. Areas where fire had proceeded to occur served as controls.
   4. Our findings are consistent with the occurrence of alternative community states established and maintained by different self-reinforcing feedbacks with fire. Sclerophyll vegetation was more pyrogenic, especially where time-since-fire (TSF) was relatively short, a favourable relationship for this fire-dependent vegetation. Forests were much less pyrogenic, especially where TSF was long, favouring their maintenance. Fire exclusion therefore has led to afforestation and rapid retreat of fire-dependent vegetation.
   5. Synthesis: We have documented how different self-reinforcing combustion properties of forest and sclerophyll vegetation can naturally produce alternative states coexisting side-by-side in the same environment. Such fire-mediated alternative states may be underappreciated, in part, because they are difficult to demonstrate definitively. In addition, the dynamics they exhibit contrast with common perceptions that fire hazard increases deterministically with TSF in forests and shrublands. Addressing the impacts of fire exclusion will probably require a management shift to better allow fire to perform its ecological role in shaping landscape diversity and maintaining fire-dependent biota.

AB Ecosystems can undergo large-scale changes in their states, known as catastrophic regime shifts, leading to substantial losses to services they provide to humans. These shifts occur rapidly and are difficult to predict. Several early warning signals of such transitions have recently been developed using simple models. These studies typically ignore spatial interactions, and the signal provided by these indicators may be ambiguous. We employ a simple model of collapse of vegetation in one and two spatial dimensions and show, using analytic and numerical studies, that increases in spatial variance and changes in spatial skewness occur as one approaches the threshold of vegetation collapse. We identify a novel feature, an increasing spatial variance in conjunction with a peaking of spatial skewness, as an unambiguous indicator of an impending regime shift. Once a signal has been detected, we show that a quick management action reducing the grazing activity is needed to prevent the collapse of vegetated state. Our results show that the difficulties in obtaining the accurate estimates of indicators arising due to lack of long temporal data can be alleviated when high-resolution spatially extended data are available. These results are shown to hold true independent of various details of model or different spatial dispersal kernels such as Gaussian or heavily fat tailed. This study suggests that spatial data and monitoring multiple indicators of regime shifts can play a key role in making reliable predictions on ecosystem stability and resilience.

AB The measurement of plant dispersal is vital for understanding plant distribution and abundance at different scales. However, dispersal is difficult to measure and there is a lack of guidance for researchers new to the subject. In this paper we provide advice on methods for measuring dispersal in the field and approaches to experimental design. First, we encourage clear exposition of the aims of the dispersal study and the ultimate use to which the data will be put (e.g. local dynamics, invasion processes, etc). We outline the types of dispersal exhibited by plants and emphasise that many species are dispersed by multiple processes, which are not necessarily related to putative adaptations. Few studies properly address the full range of processes by which a species is dispersed. We review methods for measuring plant dispersal, summarising the type of dispersal measured and problems with each method. We then outline the major questions about effort to be considered in sampling protocols and present an optimisation algorithm for designing dispersal studies given a suite of options, and biological and resource constraints. We propose and demonstrate a simulation modelling approach to comparing the data quality obtained by alternative experimental designs. Integrating simulation models with pilot studies offers a rapid route to improved estimation methods. We then discuss functions commonly fit to dispersal data and recommend caution as none is a priori the best description of the dispersal process. Finally, we call for a better description and understanding of dispersal kernels by: a more rigorous approach to designing dispersal measurement; better targeting of dispersal studies to particular questions; and achieving a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying dispersal, so that we can move from descriptions of pattern to a grasp of process.

AB By offering pollen and/or nectar as a food resource, angiosperms exploit fewer visitors for pollen transport. Pollen thus acts not only as a means for transportation of male gametes, but also as a food reward for potential pollinators. Many findings provide compelling evidence that pollen acts, in addition, as a visual signal. The present contribution reviews several strategies that angiosperms have evolved to attract potential pollinators to the site of reward. We here consider evolutionary, ecological, sensory-physiological, and behavioural aspects of flower-pollinator interactions that are correlated with visual signals provided by pollen and pollen-producing organs, or imitations thereof.

AB Different kinds of experience during early life can play a significant role in the development of an animal's behavioural phenotype. In natural contexts, this influences behaviours from anti-predator responses to navigation abilities. By contrast, for animals reared in captive environments, the homogeneous nature of their experience tends to reduce behavioural flexibility. Studies with cage-reared rodents indicate that captivity often compromises neural development and neural plasticity. Such neural and behavioural deficits can be problematic if captive-bred animals are being reared with the intention of releasing them as part of a conservation strategy. Over the last decade, there has been growing interest in the use of environmental enrichment to promote behavioural flexibility in animals that are bred for release. Here, we describe the positive effects of environmental enrichment on neural plasticity and cognition in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Exposing fish to enriched conditions upregulated the forebrain expression of NeuroD1 mRNA and improved learning ability assessed in a spatial task. The addition of enrichment to the captive environment thus promotes neural and behavioural changes that are likely to promote behavioural flexibility and improve post-release survival.

AB Whole organism performance represents the integration of numerous physiological, morphological, and behavioral traits. How adaptive changes in performance evolve therefore requires an understanding of how selection acts on multiple integrated traits. Two approaches that lend themselves to studying the evolution of performance in natural populations are the use of quantitative genetics models for estimating the strength of selection acting on multiple quantitative traits and ecological genetic comparisons of populations exhibiting phenotypic differences correlated with environmental variation. In both cases, the ultimate goal is to understand how suites of traits and trade-offs between competing functions respond to natural selection. Here we consider how these two complimentary approaches can be applied to study the adaptive evolution of escape performance in fish. We first present an extension of Arnold's (1983) quantitative genetic approach that explicitly considers how trade-offs between different components of performance interact with the underlying genetics. We propose that such a model can reveal the conditions under which multiple selection pressures will cause adaptive change in traits that influence more than one component of fitness. We then review work on the Atlantic silversides and Trinidadian guppies as two case studies where an ecological genetics approach has been successfully applied to evaluate how the evolution of escape performance trades-off with other components of fitness. We conclude with the general lesson that whole organism performance is embedded in a complex phenotype, and that the net outcome of selection acting on different aspects of the organism will often result in a compromise among competing influences.

AB We review the evidence for multiple ecological states and the factors that create ecological resilience in coral reef ecosystems. There are natural differences among benthic communities along gradients of water temperature, light, nutrients, and organic matter associated with upwelling-downwelling and onshore-offshore systems. Along gradients from oligotrophy to eutrophy, plant-animal symbioses tend to decrease, and the abundance of algae and heterotrophic suspension feeders and the ratio of organic to inorganic carbon production tend to increase. Human influences such as fishing, increased organic matter and nutrients, sediments, warm water, and transportation of xenobiotics and diseases are common causes of a large number of recently reported ecological shifts. It is often the interaction of persistent and multiple synergistic disturbances that causes permanent ecological transitions, rather than the succession of individual short-term disturbances. For example, fishing can remove top-level predators, resulting in the ecological release of prey such as sea urchins and coral-eating invertebrates. When sea urchins are not common because of unsuitable habitat, recruitment limitations, and diseases, and when overfishing removes herbivorous fish, frondose brown algae can dominate. Terrigenous sediments carried onto reefs as a result of increased soil erosion largely promote the dominance of turf or articulated green algae. Elevated nutrients and organic matter can increase internal eroders of reef substratum and a mixture of filamentous algae. Local conservation actions that attempt to reduce fishing and terrestrial influences promote the high production of inorganic carbon that is necessary for reef growth. However, global climate change threatens to undermine such actions because of increased bleaching and mortality caused by warm-water anomalies, weakened coral skeletons caused by reduced aragonite availability in reef waters, and increased incidence of diseases in coral reef species. Consequently, many coral reefs, including those that are heavily managed, have experienced net losses in accumulated inorganic carbon in recent decades and appear likely to continue this trend in coming decades. Reefs urgently need to be managed with a view to strengthening their resilience to the increased frequency and intensity of these pressures. Ecological targets must include the restoration or maintenance of species diversity, keystone species, spatial heterogeneity, refugia, and connectivity. Achieving these goals will require unprecedented cooperative synergy between human organizations at all political levels, from intergovernmental to local.

AB Geographical and temporal variations in body size are common phenomena among organisms and may evolve within a few years. We argue that body size acts much like a barometer, fluctuating in parallel with changes in the relevant key predictor(s), and that geographical and temporal changes in body size are actually manifestations of the same drivers. Frequently, the principal predictors of body size are food availability during the period of growth and ambient temperature, which often affects food availability. Food availability depends on net primary productivity that, in turn, is determined by climate and weather (mainly temperature and precipitation), and these depend mainly on solar radiation and other solar activities. When the above predictors are related to latitude the changes have often been interpreted as conforming to Bergmann's rule, but in many cases such interpretations should be viewed with caution due to the interrelationships among various environmental predictors. Recent temporal changes in body size have often been related to global warming. However, in many cases the above key predictors are not related to either latitude and/or year, and it is the task of the researcher to determine which particular environmental predictor is the one that determines food availability and, in turn, body size. The chance of discerning a significant change in body size depends to a large extent on sample size (specimens/year). The most recent changes in body size are probably phenotypic, but there are some cases in which they are partly genetic.

AB Ecosystem responses to external changes can surprise us by their abruptness and irreversibility. Models have helped identifying indicators of impending catastrophic shifts, referred to as generic early warning signals'. These indicators are linked to a phenomenon known as critical slowing down' which describes the fact that the recovery rate of a system after a perturbation decreases when the system approaches a bifurcation such as the classical fold bifurcation associated to catastrophic shifts. However, contrary to what has sometimes been suggested in the literature, a decrease in recovery rate cannot be considered as specific to approaching catastrophic shifts. Here, we analyze the behavior of early warning signals based on critical slowing down in systems approaching a range of catastrophic and non-catastrophic situations. Our results show that slowing down generally happens in situations where a system is becoming increasingly sensitive to external perturbations, independently of whether the impeding change is catastrophic or not. These results highlight that indicators specific to catastrophic shifts are still lacking. More importantly, they also imply that in systems where we have no reason to expect catastrophic transitions, slowing down may still be used in a more general sense as a warning signal for a potential decrease in stability.

AB Ecosystems provide a wide range of services to society. Some forms of use affect the quality of the ecosystem, reducing its value for other users. This leads to a conflict of interest that is often settled through political processes, resulting in some form of regulation. We link theory on ecosystem response to theories from the socioeconomic branches of science to analyze the mechanisms behind two widespread problems associated with such political solutions. First, they often represent a compromise rather than an integrative solution. We demonstrate that, particularly in sensitive ecosystems, integrative solutions yield a higher average social utility and imply a higher ecosystem quality. Integrative solutions require insight into ecosystems responses to different forms of use and a complete overview of ecosystem services to society. Second, there is a systematic bias away from optimal shared use toward activities that are detrimental to ecosystem quality. This bias arises from the fact that utilities depending on ecosystem quality are often shared by large diffuse groups, whereas pollution and harvesting activities can usually be traced to relatively small and well-organized groups. Theory and data indicate that this type of concentrated group is systematically better at mustering political power than large groups, which find it difficult to realize collective action due to what is known in game theory as "free-rider problems. Our analysis suggests that the following three key ingredients are needed to correct the problems of bias and compromise: (a) clear insight into ecosystem dynamic responses to human use, (b) a broad inventory of credible measurements of ecosystem utilities, (c) avoidance of bias due to differences in the organizational power of groups of stakeholders. We argue that good ecosystem models, institutionalized ecosystem valuation, and innovative tax-setting schedules are essential to achieving a socially fair and sustainable use of ecosystems by societies. In addition, we highlight the fact that many environmental problems remain unresolved for a long time and briefly identify the social mechanisms responsible for this delay.

AB Similar to the increased number of studies on invasive plants and animals in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, many reports were recently published on the invasion of Nostocales (cyanobacteria) to freshwater environments worldwide. Invasion and proliferation of Nostocales in new habitats have the potential to significantly alter the structure of the native community and to modify ecosystem functioning. But most importantly, they influence the water quality due to a variety of toxic compounds that some species produce. Therefore a special attention was given to the invasion and persistence of toxic cyanobacteria in many aquatic ecosystems. Here we summarize the currently published records on the invasion of two Nostocales genera, Cylindrospermopsis and Aphanizomenon, to lakes and water reservoirs in subtropical and temperate zones. These invading species possess traits thought to be common to many invasive organisms: high growth rate, high resource utilization efficiency and overall superior competitive abilities over native species when local conditions vary. Assuming that dispersion routes of cyanobacteria have not been changed much in recent decades, their recent establishment and proliferation in new habitats indicate changes in the environment under which they can exploit their physiological advantage over the native phytoplankton population. In many cases, global warming was identified as the major driving force for the invasion of Nostocales. Due to this uncontrollable trend, invasive Nostocales species are expected to maintain their presence in new habitats and further expand to new environments. In other cases, regional changes in nutrient loads and in biotic conditions were attributed to the invasion events.

AB Mangrove forests cover large areas of tropical and subtropical coastlines. They provide a wide range of ecosystem services that includes carbon storage in above- and below ground biomass and in soils. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soil, or soil respiration is important in the global carbon budget and is sensitive to increasing global temperature. To understand the magnitude of mangrove soil respiration and the influence of forest structure and temperature on the variation in mangrove soil respiration I assessed soil respiration at eleven mangrove sites, ranging from latitude 27 degrees N to 37 degrees S. Mangrove soil respiration was similar to those observed for terrestrial forest soils. Soil respiration was correlated with leaf area index (LAI) and aboveground net primary production (litterfall), which should aid scaling up to regional and global estimates of soil respiration. Using a carbon balance model, total belowground carbon allocation (TBCA) per unit litterfall was similar in tall mangrove forests as observed in terrestrial forests, but in scrub mangrove forests TBCA per unit litter fall was greater than in terrestrial forests, suggesting mangroves allocate a large proportion of their fixed carbon below ground under unfavorable environmental conditions. The response of soil respiration to soil temperature was not a linear function of temperature. At temperatures below 26 degrees C Q10 of mangrove soil respiration was 2.6, similar to that reported for terrestrial forest soils. However in scrub forests soil respiration declined with increasing soil temperature, largely because of reduced canopy cover and enhanced activity of photosynthetic benthic microbial communities.

AB Landscape researchers and practitioners, using the lens of sustainability science, are breaking new ground about how people's behaviors and actions influence the structure, function, and change of designed landscapes in an urbanizing world. The phrase-the scientific basis of the design for landscape sustainability-is used to describe how sustainability science can contribute to translational landscape research and practice about the systemic relationships among landscape sustainability, people's contact with nature, and complex place-based problems. In the first section of this article, important definitions about the scientific basis of the design for landscape sustainability are reviewed including the six Es of landscape sustainability-environment, economic, equity, aesthetics, experience, and ethics. A conceptual framework about the six Es of landscape sustainability for designed landscapes is introduced. The interrelatedness, opportunities, contradictions, and limitations of the conceptual framework are discussed in relation to human health/security, ecosystem services, biodiversity, and resource management. The conceptual framework about the six Es of landscape sustainability for designed landscapes follows the tradition in which landscape researchers and practitioners synthesize emerging trends into conceptual frameworks for advancing basic and applied activities.

AB Cucurbitaceae contain c. 800 species in 130 genera and are among the economically most important families of plants. We inferred their phylogeny based on chloroplast DNA sequences from two genes, one intron, and two spacers (rbcL, matK, trnL, trnL-trnF, rpl20-rps12) obtained for 171 species in 123 genera. Molecular data weakly support the traditional subfamilies Cucurbitoideae (111 genera) and Nhandiroboideae (19 genera, 60 species), and recover most of the eleven tribes, but almost none of the subtribes. Indofevillea khasiana is sister to all other Cucurbitoideae, and the genera of Joliffieae plus a few Trichosantheae form a grade near the base of Cucurbitoideae. A newly discovered large clade consists of the ancestrally Asian genera Nothoalsomitra, Luffa, Gymnopetalum, Hocigsonia, Trichosanthes, and the New World tribe Sicyeae. Genera that are poly- or paraphyletic include Ampelosicyos, Cucumis, Ibervillea, Neoachmandra, Psiguria, Trichosanthes, and Xerosicyos. Flower characters, especially number of free styles, fusion of filaments and/or anthers, tendril type, and pollen size, exine, and aperture number correlate well with the chloroplast phylogeny, while petal and fruit characters as well as karyotype exhibit much evolutionary flexibility.

AB 1 Although, in nature, seed dispersal usually declines with distance from the source, seedling establishment patterns are highly variable. An increase in seed survival can lead to either hump-shaped (Janzen-Connell (J-C) pattern) or declining (Hubbell pattern) establishment with distance from seed source, but declining establishment can also be generated if survival decreases with distance (McCanny pattern). Pathogens and seed predators are considered to be major mortality agents structuring recruitment patterns, but it is unclear how well predation alone can explain variation in these patterns.
   2 We introduce a simple mechanistic model showing that distance and density-dependent seed predation can generate all of the observed recruitment patterns. Our approach provides the first mathematical reconstruction of conceptual models previously considered to be based on contrasting underlying mechanisms. Three easily measurable quantities (the proportion of seeds escaping predation at the source, and the mean distance from the source of dispersed seeds and of predators' activity) can be used to test for consistency with the J-C pattern. The association between recruitment patterns and plant (dispersal) and animal (predation) characteristics is robust with respect to parameter values and various functional forms.
   3 The model shows that the J-C pattern can occur only if the mean distance over which predators are active is lower than that over which seeds are dispersed, corresponding to a system with host-specific, or immobile, seed predators (often invertebrates) that are restricted to areas of high seed density near adult plants, and therefore selecting for longer dispersal distances of seeds.
   4 The Hubbell pattern is generated by the model when dispersal and predation distances are of equivalent magnitudes. The McCanny pattern emerges if more generalized, or more mobile, seed predators (often vertebrates) are attracted to the adult trees but also tend to forage farther away, thereby selecting for short dispersal distances that generate high densities needed to satiate seed predators.
   5 The model also predicts that the total number of seeds surviving predation is lowest at intermediate distances, suggesting that distance-dependent predation promotes either short or long dispersal distances, or both (dimorphism).

AB 1 We studied the growth of a submerged aquatic plant in relation to periphytic and planktonic algae over a range of nutrient and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) availabilities.
   2 In consecutive years two factorial experiments were conducted in 48 artificial ponds (each 3.14 m(3)), comprising four concentrations of DIC (1.5, 2.5, 3.5 or 4.5 mm) each crossed with three separate nutrient loadings (10 mug L P-1 and 0.2 mg L N, 50 mug L P-1 and 1 mg L N, or 200 mug L P-1 and 4 mg L N). The second experiment differed by the inclusion of fish in the ponds.
   3 In the first year DIC had no effect on plant growth, but nutrient loading did. Plants failed to grow in treatments where phytoplankton density was high (>100 mug L1). Where phytoplankton was low, high numbers of invertebrates colonized the ponds, and periphyton abundance on the plants was low. In the second year, where phytoplankton never achieved the densities of the previous year, there was a significant effect of DIC concentration on plant growth but not of nutrients. Invertebrate abundance was lower and periphyton on the plants correspondingly higher.
   4 In both years increased nutrient loading had no effect on the abundance of periphyton growing on the surface of the plants. Periphyton abundance was determined by the density of grazing invertebrates in the ponds.
   5 There was a negative relationship between periphyton density and final plant density, which became significantly less steep with increasing DIC, indicating that periphyton and plants were competing for carbon.
   6 DIC concentration has the potential to influence community structure in shallow lakes, altering competitive interactions between periphyton and plants and rendering low DIC lakes more prone to loss of plants when nutrient loading increases. However, the expression of this competition between periphyton and plants will depend on the density of grazing invertebrates present, which is itself influenced by the intensity of fish predation on those invertebrates.

AB Granivore-seed interactions involve a feedback between granivore seed selectivity and seed availability. We examined this feedback to determine how seed preferences by the western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, related to seed availability and, in turn, affected the soil seed pool. Preferences were estimated from natural diets as well as from experiments that controlled seed size, relative availability, and distance from ant nests.
   Seed availability to ants varied with season and over 2 yr. Colony activity and seed intake rates were correlated with seed availability. Seed preference by ants was correlated with the seasonal availability of preferred species, but not with unpreferred seeds. From the soil seed pool, ants preferentially harvested small, sound seeds. They removed 9-26% of the potentially viable seed pool each year, and as much as 100% of available preferred species. Seed densities were lower 2-7 m from nests, where foraging activity was concentrated, than 7-12 m from nests. In controlled preference experiments, P. occidentalis was unselective near nests, but preferred large seeds with higher assimilable energy content in trials 10 m from nests. A relatively low foraging activity > 7 m, however, suggests that this distance-dependent preference is rarely manifested in natural conditions and does not measurably affect soil seed dynamics.
   Our results point to the importance of studying diet choice in a natural context; preferences measured under experimental conditions may not correspond to natural diets. Such discrepancies in food preference measurements will affect predictions about how consumers influence the population dynamics of resource organisms.

AB Introduction of the benthivorous common carp (Cyprinus carpio) has been identified as one of the main causes of loss of biodiversity and water clarity in numerous shallow lakes and ponds worldwide. Recent observations in experimental fish ponds suggest that the effect of carp on the ecosystem is catastrophic in the sense that a substantial impact occurs only when a critical carp density is exceeded. In search for an explanation, we analyzed a simple model of the interaction between benthivorous fish and their invertebrate benthic prey, and of sediment resuspension resulting from fish feeding behavior. Our results suggest that benthic prey populations should be only moderately depressed until predator fish abundance grows to a critical biomass at which benthos collapses due to overexploitation. This drop in prey density is predicted to result in a sharp increase in water turbidity due to an increase in prey search activity of the fish. For less eutrophic and deeper lakes, where benthos productivity and hence benthivorous fish. carrying capacity are lower, water turbidity is predicted to be much less affected. The qualitative patterns are quite robust against assumptions on parameter values and correspond closely to the experimental results and data from lakes suggesting that the model may capture the essence of the mechanism causing a discontinuous effect of benthivorous fish on lake ecosystems.

AB Recently, conservation estate in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province has increased 10-fold resulting in large predators being increasingly reintroduced to restore ecological integrity and maximize tourism. We describe the reintroductions of large carnivores (>10 kg) that have occurred in the Eastern Cape and use various criteria to assess their success. Lion Panthera leo reintroduction has been highly successful with a population of 56 currently extant in the region and problems of overpopulation arising. The African wild dog Lycaon pictus population has increased to 24 from a founder population of 11. Preliminary results for spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta also indicate success. Wild populations of leopards Panthera pardus exist on several reserves and have been supplemented by translocated individuals, although deaths of known individuals have occurred and no estimate of reproduction is available. Cheetah Acinonyx jubatus reintroduction has also been less successful with 36 individuals reintroduced and 23 cubs being born but only 41 individuals surviving in 2005. Criteria for assessing the success of reintroductions of species that naturally occur in low densities, such as top predators, generally have limited value. Carrying capacity for large predators is unknown and continued monitoring and intensive management will be necessary in enclosed, and possibly all, conservation areas in the Eastern Cape to ensure conservation success.

AB According to classical exploitation theory, an increase of primary productivity should result in increased herbivore grazing pressure, thus maintaining a low plant standing crop, However, field data obtained from a salt marsh revealed a maximal grazing pressure by hares, rabbits, and geese at intermediate levels of plant standing crop. Grazing pressure was relatively low in the more productive parts. We argue that this pattern is due to a low foraging efficiency of these herbivores in dense vegetation. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we examine a plant-herbivore model where grazing becomes less efficient in dense vegetation, and analyze the behavior of this model along a gradient of primary productivity. In systems of intermediate productivity, the model predicts that a plant-herbivore system may have two stable states. In one state, the herbivore maintains a low standing crop. The other state is dominated by a dense vegetation unsuitable for herbivore grazing. In systems of high productivity, the herbivore is unable to keep plant growth in check and a dense vegetation develops. Thus, in line with our field data but in contrast to classical exploitation theory, our model does not predict ''top-down'' control in productive environments.

AB Microprofiles of O2 and NO3- were measured simultaneously in freshwater sediment with microsensors which were completely free from electrical interference because of coaxial designs. Depth profiles of nitrification (NO3- production) and denitrification (NO3- consumption) were subsequently determined by computer simulation of the measured microprofiles. The nitrifying bacterial community responded very quickly to changes in environmental conditions, and new steady-state microprofiles of O2 and NO3- were usually approached within a few hours after perturbation. Nitrification started quickly after introduction of O2 in previously anoxic layers, suggesting prolonged survival of the nitrifiers during anaerobiosis. Changes in the availability of O2 and NH4+ greatly affected the nitrification profile, and there was a high rate of coupled nitrification-denitrification under conditions in which nitrification occurred right above the oxic-anoxic interface. Addition of C2H2 rapidly removed the NO3- peaks, indicating that NO3- production was due mainly to autotrophic nitrification.

AB Recent theoretical studies have shown that spatial redistribution of surface water may explain the occurrence of patterns of alternating vegetated and degraded patches in semiarid grasslands. These results implied, however, that spatial redistribution processes cannot explain the collapse of production on coarser scales observed in these systems. We present a spatially explicit vegetation model to investigate possible mechanisms explaining irreversible vegetation collapse on coarse spatial scales. The model results indicate that the dynamics of vegetation on coarse scales are determined by the interaction of two spatial feedback processes. Loss of plant cover in a certain area results in increased availability of water in remaining vegetated patches through run-on of surface water, promoting within-patch plant production. Hence, spatial redistribution of surface water creates negative feedback between reduced plant cover and increased plant growth in remaining vegetation. Reduced plant cover, however, results in focusing of herbivore grazing in the remaining vegetation. Hence, redistribution of herbivores creates positive feedback between reduced plant cover and increased losses due to grazing in remaining vegetated patches, leading to collapse of the entire vegetation. This may explain irreversible vegetation shifts in semiarid grasslands on coarse spatial scales.

AB Bergmann's rule, which proposes a heat-balance explanation for the observed latitudinal gradient of increasing animal body size with increasing latitude, has dominated the study of geographic patterns in animal size since it was first proposed in 1847. Several critical reviews have determined that as many as half of the species examined do not fit the predictions of Bergmann's rule. We have proposed an alternative hypothesis for geographic variation in body size based on food availability, as regulated by the net primary production (NPP) of plants, specifically NPP during the growing season, or eNPP (ecologically and evolutionarily relevant NPP). Our hypothesis, "the eNPP rule," is independent of latitude and predicts both spatial and temporal variation in body size, as well as in total population biomass, population growth rates, individual health, and life history traits of animals, including humans, wherever eNPP varies across appropriate scales of space or time. In the context of a revised interpretation of the global patterns of NPP and eNPP, we predict contrasting latitudinal correlations with body size in three distinct latitudinal zones. The eNPP rule explains body-size patterns that are consistent with Bergmann's rule, as well as two distinct types of contradictions of Bergmann's rule: the lack of latitudinal patterns within the tropics, and the decline in body size above approximately 608 latitude. Both types of contradictions of Bergmann's rule are consistent with the eNPP rule, as are a wide range of other phenomena.

AB Resources are produced in pulses in many terrestrial environments, and have important effects on the population dynamics and assemblage structure of animals that consume them. Resource-pulsing is particularly dramatic in Australian desert environments owing to marked spatial and temporal variability in rainfall, and thus primary productivity. Here, we first review how Australia's desert mammals respond to fluctuations in resource production, and evaluate the merits of three currently accepted models (the ecological refuge, predator refuge and fire-mosaic models) as explanations of the observed dynamics. We then integrate elements of these models into a novel state-and-transition model and apply it to well-studied small mammal assemblages that inhabit the vast hummock grassland, or spinifex, landscapes of the continental inland. The model has four states that are defined by differences in species composition and abundance, and eight transitions or processes that prompt shifts from one state to another. Using this model as a template, we construct three further models to explain mammalian dynamics in cracking soil habitats of the Lake Eyre Basin, gibber plains of the Channel Country, and the chenopod shrublands of arid southern Australia. As non-equilibrium concepts that recognise the strongly intermittent nature of resource pulsing in arid Australia, state-and-transition models provide useful descriptors of both spatial and temporal patterns in mammal assemblages. The models should help managers to identify when and where to implement interventions to conserve native mammals, such as control burns, reduced grazing or predator management. The models also should improve understanding of the potential effects of future climate change on mammal assemblages in arid environments in general. We conclude by proposing several tests that could be used to refine the models and guide further research.

AB Predation plays an important role in ecological communities by affecting prey behavior such as foraging and by physical removal of individual prey. In regard to foraging, animals such as desert rodents often balance conflicting demands for food and safety. This has been studied in the field by indirectly manipulating predatory risk through the alteration of cues associated with increased risk such as cover or illumination. It has also been studied by directly manipulating the presence of predators in aviaries. Here, we report on experiments in which we directly manipulated actual predatory risk to desert rodents in the field. We conducted a series of experiments in the field using a trained barn owl (Tyto alba) to investigate how two species of coexisting gerbils (Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum) respond to various cues of predatory risk in their natural environment. The gerbils responded to risk of predation, in the form of owl flights and owl hunger calls, by reducing their activity in the risky plot relative to the control plot. The strongest response was to owl flights and the weakest to recorded hunger calls of owls. Furthermore, when risk of predation was relatively high, as in the case with barn owl flights, both gerbil species mostly limited their activity to the safer bush microhabitat. The response of the gerbils to risk of predation disappeared very quickly following removal of the treatment, and the gerbils returned to normal levels of activity within the same night. The gerbils did not respond to experimental cues (alarm clock), the presence of the investigators, the presence of a quiet owl, and recorded ''white noise''. Using trained barn owls, we were able to effectively manipulate actual risk of predation to gerbils in natural habitats and to quantify how gerbils alter their behavior in order to balance conflicting demands of food and safety. The method allows assessment of aspects of behavior, population interactions, and community characteristics involving predation in natural habitats.

AB Microbes belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria are prolific sources of antibiotics, clinically useful bioactive compounds and industrially important enzymes. The focus of the current review is on the diversity and potential applications of thermophilic and alkaliphilic actinobacteria, which are highly diverse in their taxonomy and morphology with a variety of adaptations for surviving and thriving in hostile environments. The specific metabolic pathways in these actinobacteria are activated for elaborating pharmaceutically, agriculturally, and biotechnologically relevant biomolecules/bioactive compounds, which find multifarious applications.

AB Recent years have seen a plethora of studies reporting that 'regime shifts' have occurred in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans during the last century. In many cases, the criteria used to distinguish a regime shift have not been explicitly stated. In other cases, a formal definition has been proposed and the data set assessed against it. Developing a universal quantitative definition for identifying and distinguishing between purported climatic and ecological regime shifts has proved problematic as many authors have developed criteria that seem unique to the system under study. Consequently, they throw little light on the drivers of ecological regime shifts. Criteria used to define regime shifts are reviewed and on the basis of evidence from purported regime shifts, common characteristics in the speed and amplitude of the changes and the duration of quasi-stable states are used to propose a more clearly defined set of criteria for defining climatic and ecological regime shifts. Causal drivers of regime shifts are explored using correlation analysis. Limitations of these methods are discussed.

AB We quantify the role of zooplankton in nutrient cycles in Lake Kinneret, Israel, using field data and a numerical model. A coupled ecological and hydrodynamic model (Dynamic Reservoir Model (DYRESM)-Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (CAEDYM)) was validated with an extensive field data set to simulate the seasonal dynamics of nutrients, three phytoplankton groups and three zooplankton groups. Parameterization of the model was conducted using field, experimental and literature studies. Sensitivity of simulated output was tested over the full parameter space and established that the most sensitive parameters were related to zooplankton grazing rates, temperature responses and food limitation. The simulated results predict that, on average, 51% of the carbon from phytoplankton photosynthesis is consumed by zooplankton. Excretion of dissolved nutrients by zooplankton accounts for 3-46 and 5-58% of phytoplankton uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen, respectively. Comparison of nutrient fluxes attributable to zooplankton with nutrient loads from inflows and release from bottom sediments shows that the relative contribution by zooplankton to inorganic nutrients in the photic zone varies seasonally in response to the annual hydrodynamic cycle of stratification and mixing. As a percent of total dissolved organic sources relative contributions by zooplankton excretion are highest (62%) during periods of stratification and when inflow nutrient loads are low, and lowest (2%) during the breakdown of stratification and when inflow loads are high. The results illustrate the potential of a lake ecosystem model to extract useful process information to complement field data collection and address questions related to the role of zooplankton in nutrient cycles.

AB Aim Climatic conditions exert a strong control on the geographic distribution of many woodland-to-grassland transition zones (or tree lines'). Because woody plants have, in general, a weaker cold tolerance than herbaceous vegetation, their altitudinal or latitudinal limits are strongly controlled by cold sensitivity. While temperature controls on the dynamics of woodlandgrassland ecotones are relatively well established, the ability of woody plants to modify their microclimate and to create habitat for seedling establishment and growth may involve a variety of processes that are still not completely understood. Here we investigate feedbacks between vegetation and microclimatic conditions in the proximity to woodlandgrassland ecotones. Location We concentrate on arctic and alpine tree lines, the transition between mangrove forests and salt marshes in coastal ecosystems, and the shift from shrubland to grassland along temperature gradients in arid landscapes. Methods We review the major abiotic and biotic mechanisms underlying the ability of woody plants to alter the nocturnal microclimate by increasing the temperatures they are exposed to. Results We find that in many arctic, alpine, desert and coastal landscapes the presence of trees or shrubs causes nocturnal warming thereby favouring the establishment and survival of woody plants. Main conclusion Because of this feedback, trees and shrubs may establish in areas that would be otherwise unsuitable for their survival. Thus, in grasslandwoodland transition zones both vegetation covers may be (alternative) stable states of the landscape, thereby affecting the way tree lines may migrate in response to regional and global climate change.

AB Episodic heat waves and an increase in pesticide use are widely cited as consequences of climatic warming. Recent studies show that these stressors often cause declines in the mean body size of zooplankton. Results from laboratory and field studies, as well as observations from both thermal- or toxicant-stressed natural systems, show (1) reductions in mean body size within stressed populations, or (2) changes in community composition that favor small-bodied over large-bodied species. During the past decade, it has become widely accepted that a shift in zooplankton body size can dramatically affect water clarity, rates of nutrient regeneration and fish abundances. Thus, climatic warming and associated change in pesticide use has the potential to cause striking change in the structure and functioning of temperate-zone lakes.

AB Aim Bergmann's rule, the tendency of body size within species in bird and mammal populations to be positively correlated with latitude, is among the best known biogeographical generalizations. The factors behind such clines, however, are not well understood. Here we use a large data base of 79 mammalian carnivore species to examine the factors affecting latitudinal size clines.
   Location Worldwide.
   Methods We measured the skulls and teeth of carnivores in natural history museums, and calculated the amount of variation in size explained by latitude, supplementing our measurements with published data. We examined the effects of a number of variables on the tendency to show latitudinal clines.
   Results We found that geographical range and latitudinal extent are strongly related to size clines. Minimum temperatures across the range, net primary productivity and habitat diversity also have some, albeit much less, influence.
   Main conclusions We suggest that species with large geographical ranges are likely to encounter significant heterogeneity in those factors that influence body size, and are thus likely to exhibit size clines. However, the key factors that determine body size may not always operate along a latitudinal (or other geographical) cline, but be spatially linked to patches in the species range. One such important factor is likely to be food availability, which we show is a strong predictor of size in the brown bear (Ursus arctos) but is not associated with a latitudinal cline. We argue that the spatial distribution of key resources within the species range constitutes a significant predictor of carnivore body size.

AB The notion of `community-wide character displacement' hypothesizes that locally co-existing sets of competing species should be less similar than expected when compared to random expectations from a broader regional species pool. Here I use a mechanistic approach to the niche concept to show how this expectation is dependent on the types of traits involved. I investigate how two different niche components, those that relate to species' requirements (or responses to environmental factors) versus those that relate to species' impacts (or effects on environmental factors), a?ect predictions about the similarity of locally co-existing species. In contrast with more conventional approaches that focus on species impacts, I focus on species responses to conclude that locally co-existing species should be more similar in such traits than expected on the basis of random assortment from a larger equilibrium regional biota. In addition, I explore the evolutionary implications of exceptions that might favour the co-existence of species with dissimilar traits (especially those that determine species' impacts on the environment) and conclude that these implications di?er when species compete for shared resources, interact via shared predators, or interact via both mechanisms. The analysis developed in this paper shows that the co-existence of species that are more similar than expected by chance is not incompatible with the notion of strongly interacting species in saturated local communities near equilibrium.

AB Climate change is expected to induce many ecological and evolutionary changes. Among these is the hypothesis that climate warming will cause a reduction in body size. This hypothesis stems from Bergmann's rule, a trend whereby species exhibit a smaller body size in warmer climates, and larger body size under colder conditions in endotherms. The mechanisms behind this rule are still debated, and it is not clear whether Bergmann's rule can be extended to predict the effects of climate change through time. We reviewed the primary literature for evidence (i) of a decrease in body size in response to climate warming, (ii) that changing body size is an adaptive response and (iii) that these responses are evolutionary or plastic. We found weak evidence for changes in body size through time as predicted by Bergmann's rule. Only three studies investigated the adaptive nature of these size decreases. Of these, none reported evidence of selection for smaller size or of a genetic basis for the size change, suggesting that size decreases could be due to nonadaptive plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions. More studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn about the underlying causes of these changes in body size in response to a warming climate.

AB The aim of this study is to explore the burning pattern of the catastrophic wildfires that occurred in Peloponnisos, southern Greece, in 2007. These fires caused the loss of 67 lives and were recognized as the most extreme natural disaster in the country's recent history. We compare the 2007 fires against fuel availability across the landscape in the light of a null model using Monte-Carlo randomization and against the fire pattern for the preceding period, 2000-2006. Additionally we applied a multi-response permutation-procedure test, a data-driven method free from assumptions about the underlying distribution. The study contributes to the ongoing debate over the relative importance of fuel versus weather in explaining large and intense wildfires. While the majority of the 2007 wildfires burned low-elevation fire-prone ecosystems, a part of them moved to non-fire-prone ecosystems, indicating a departure from the burning pattern of recent history. The CORINE land-cover categories most affected by fire included agricultural lands highly interspersed with large areas of natural vegetation followed by sclerophyllous vegetation, transitional woodland shrubs, complex cultivation patterns and olive groves. These reflect greater fuel accumulation through the encroachment of natural vegetation in abandoned fields as well as changing patterns of land-use. The rising proportions of humid and sub-humid areas burned are clearly related to weather patterns. The synergistic effect between fuel and weather helps explain the unusually large 2007 wildfires in Peloponnisos. This change may imply a climatically driven alteration of the established fire-regime promoted by fuel accumulation that portends major ecological consequences. The ecological disaster foreseen is justified by the lack of specific adaptations to cope with fire in non fire-prone plant communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the geological record, scleractinian-dominated "turbid-water" bioconstructions that accumulated under substantial terrigenous input, along with shallow neritic marls rich in well-preserved corals are common. These occurrences indicate that beyond some threshold, the ecologic and taphonomic effects of sedimentation prevail over the effects of nutrification. Field data and experiments on recent corals show that some taxa cope well with terrigenous turbidity and sedimentation, and acclimate to increased heterotrophy. Colonial corals resilient to sediment input commonly are massive to platy forms of high skeletal plasticity and with large polypars, to effectively reject sediment, or are branched species providing a very small sedimentation area cleaned by feeble currents, or small-polyped massive taxa that tolerate intermittent veneering by sediment. These corals may comprise "siltation assemblages" of recent turbid-water reefs and level-bottoms, in siliciclastic environments. Conversely, excess input of even low amounts of dissolved inorganic nutrients into clear waters adversely affects many coral species. Fossil turbid-water bioconstructions (TWB) were situated in inner shelf to shore zone settings or near storm wave base on shelves or ramps, did not stack into reef complexes, mostly show a cluster to segment fabric, are scarce in or devoid of frame pores with marine cement, and lacked a high carbonate slope. Relative to fossil "clear-water" buildups preserved in pure limestone successions, fossil TWB contain (moderately) diverse coral assemblages, with an increased proportion of sediment-resistant forms. Aside from coral behaviour that is elusive in fossils, the sediment resistance of corals was mainly determined by colony shape and polypar size, but small-polyped, sediment-tolerant corals became common since the Early Cretaceous. Late Jurassic to Cretaceous turbid-water coral assemblages are dominated by plocoid or thamnasterioid forms; corresponding Cainozoic assemblages consist mainly of cerioid and plocoid taxa. In fossil TWB, bioerosion and encrustation are similar or higher than in contemporaneous clear-water buildups. Under higher sediment input, accumulation of discrete TWB was quenched, and level-bottoms of both corals and soft-substrate biota formed. In the resulting "coral marls", depending on turbidity, sedimentation and substrate stability, the coral fauna consists largely of both solitary corals and (mainly) sediment-resistant pseudocolonial/colonial forms, or is dominated by solitary corals. Many corals show growth "anomalies" resulting from partial mortality due to episodic, rapid sedimentation and unstable substrate. In coral marl environments, because of terrigenous input, nutrient levels probably were elevated, yet macroboring and encrustation are very scarce. Beyond some threshold of terrigenous sediment input and accumulation, the ecologic and taphonomic effects of sedimentation and unstable substrate prevail over the effects of nutrient enrichment.
   During the Meso-Cainozoic evolution of scleractinians, increasing photoautotrophy and progressive invasion of oligotrophic environments is in contrast to a Late Cretaceous to Cainozoic increase in the relative number of reefs in marginal-marine/siliciclastic settings. This trend may be explained by second-order sea-level fall and shrinking of epicontinental carbonate seas and isolated platforms, driving corals to more narrow, attached shelves, and by a wider total trophic range in which distinct coral assemblages can thrive, as a result of coral evolution and diversification.

AB Organic materials across the palynologically defined Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary from five major terrestrial basins in the interior of the former Gondwana Supercontinent show large to very large (5parts per thousand-15parts per thousand) multiple negative spikes of delta(13)C, separated in places by sharp reversals of up to 20parts per thousand. Large oscillations of delta(13)C(org) between -36parts per thousand and -15parts per thousand from mean values of similar to24 +/- 2 in India, similar to26 +/- 2 in Madagascar, and similar to23 +/- 2 in South Africa occur before and after the P-T transition. The mean values are within the range of modern C3 plants (similar to-25parts per thousand). The negative delta(13)C(org) spikes of the terrestrial plant remains complement similar spikes of smaller amplitude recorded globally in marine carbonates across the P-T boundary. Sensitivity analyses of carbon fluxes in a coupled atmosphere-ocean system indicate that the sharp declines in terrestrial and marine delta(13)C can be explained by episodic release of methane from clathrates (similar to-60parts per thousand) either directly into the atmosphere or via the oceans, possibly during the disintegration of the southern continental shelf of Tethys. The rapid increases in delta(13)C may either signal aborted attempts of C4 plants (similar to-13parts per thousand) to establish themselves at the expense of C3 plants or, more likely, reflect a punctuated increase in C3 biomass production related to elevated atmospheric CO2. Detection of a gradual negative trend in the Upper Permian and a similar positive recovery in the Lower Triassic, separated by up to three large negative delta(13)C spikes across the P-T boundary in at least four terrestrial sections, caution against models of the end-Paleozoic biodiversity collapse and ensuing Mesozoic recovery based on a singular perturbation at the P-T boundary. Rather, these transitions may reflect multiple ecosystem stability states and abrupt responses during gradual forcing of a complex nonlinear system with thresholds.

AB Catastrophic regime shifts in complex natural systems may be averted through advanced detection. Recent work has provided a proof-of-principle that many systems approaching a catastrophic transition may be identified through the lens of early warning indicators such as rising variance or increased return times. Despite widespread appreciation of the difficulties and uncertainty involved in such forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize their expected error rates. Without the benefits of replicates, controls or hindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable different indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are to missing subtle warning signs. We propose a model-based approach to quantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and allow comparisons between different indicators. We show these error rates can be quite severe for common indicators even under favourable assumptions, and also illustrate how a model-based indicator can improve this performance. We demonstrate how the performance of an early warning indicator varies in different datasets, and suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more central part of early warning predictions.

AB Fires play an important role in determining the composition and structure of vegetation in semiarid ecosystems. The study of the interactions between fire and vegetation requires a stochastic approach because of the random and unpredictable nature of fire occurrences. To this end, this article develops a minimalist probabilistic framework to investigate the impact of intermittent fire occurrences on the temporal dynamics of vegetation. This framework is used to analyze the emergence of statistically stable conditions favorable to tree- grass coexistence in savannas. It is found that these conditions can be induced and stabilized by the stochastic fire regime. A decrease in fire frequency leads to bush encroachment, while more frequent and intense fires favor savanna- to- grassland conversions. The positive feedback between fires and vegetation can convert states of tree- grass coexistence in semiarid savannas into bistable conditions, with both woodland and grassland as possible, though mutually exclusive, stable states of the system.

AB Reintroduction programs are widespread but have low success rates, particularly when captive-bred animals are used. There are high financial costs, and important ethical concerns about animal welfare. We have explored the concept of utilizing a behavioural approach to assess the suitability of captive-bred animals for release. We compared the behaviours of wild-bred and captive-bred animals in identical novel environments, using bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus, as a model. The wild animals provided an adaptive baseline against which the behaviour of captive-bred individuals was compared. Although captive-bred voles displayed some wild-type behaviours - nest building and burrowing - despite lacking previous opportunities to do so, they were unable to utilize a key food resource and were less dominant. We suggest that a similar approach could be applied to species of conservation concern in order to rank available animals in terms of likely suitability for release. It could also help to identify characteristics that appear deficient in captive-bred animals, or to evaluate the impact of interventions such as environmental enrichment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

TI MECHANISMS OF SPECIES COEXISTENCE OF OPTIMAL FORAGERS - TEMPORAL

AB Mechanistic approaches to understanding species coexistence and community structure have recently proved highly successful. We apply this approach to a sand dune community containing two common species of gerbils, Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum. Previous work suggested that coexistence is based on temporal variability in seed resource density on a daily time scale and a tradeoff of foraging efficiency at high versus low resource abundances. We tested the predictions of this mechanism by quantifying rodent foraging activity and its timing during the night over 6 nights using sand tracking plots, sand tracking strips, and seed trays. We demonstrated temporal partitioning with all three methods. First, we demonstrated that resource patches are depleted gradually throughout the night, a necessary assumption for temporal partition to allow coexistence. Also, the first forage in a resource patch and the average forage for G. pyramidum is significantly earlier in the night than for G. allenbyi, and the last forage for G. allenbyi is significantly later than for G. pyramidum. Species differ in how the intensity of patch use changes during the night. G. pyramidum visits more patches earlier in the night than does G. allenbyi and its intensity of patch use based on sand tracking scores is also greater earlier is the night. Finally, the average resource patch (seed tray) visited by G. pyramidum is richer than that visited by G. allenbyi. These data demonstrate that G. pyramidum is profiting most from patches when resource densities are high, and it biases its foraging towards those times. We also demonstrated that resource patch giving-up densities for G. allenbyi are lower than for G. pyramidum, indicating that G. allenbyi is a more efficient forager at low resource abundances; it biases its foraging towards these times. The result is temporal partitioning. We note three tradeoffs which may underlie this mechanism of coexistence and discuss evidence for each.

AB This study investigated effects of eutrophication and sedimentation on juvenile abundance, juvenile mortality and community structure of scleractinian corals on fringing reefs on the west coast of Barbados, West Indies, in 1989. Juvenile abundance was lower on eutrophic/high-sediment reefs than less eutrophic/low-sediment reefs, but juvenile size was larger on the former. The larger size could result from size-selective mortality against smaller juveniles on the eutrophic reefs, from lower recruitment to the eutrophic reefs, or from faster growth on the eutrophic reefs. Juvenile mortality was higher on the eutrophic reefs than the less eutrophic reefs and may result from increased smothering of corals by algae and sediment. Algae were more abundant on the eutrophic reefs, probably in response to elevated nutrients and/or because grazers (Diadema antillarum; herbivorous fish) were less common on eutrophic reefs. Juvenile community structure on all reefs was dominated by Type 1 corals (high recruitment, high natural mortality), but Type 2 corals (low recruitment, low natural mortality) became more common in adult communities on the less eutrophic reefs. This transition in community structure did not occur on the eutrophic reefs, adult community structure continuing to be dominated by Type 1 corals. The fact that the pattern of relative abundance of species in the juvenile community is maintained in the adult community on the eutrophic reefs suggests that juvenile mortality rates of different species are similar on eutrophic reefs' and hence that differences in adult community structure between eutrophic and less eutrophic reefs may be largely explained by interspecific differences in juvenile mortality becoming smaller on eutrophic reefs.

AB A conceptual paradigm, the "Relative Dominance Model", provides the perspective to assess the interactive external forcing-mechanisms controlling phase shifts among the dominant benthic functional groups on tropical coral reefs [i.e., microalgal turfs and frondose macroalgae (often harmful) versus reef-building corals and calcareous coralline algae (mostly beneficial due to accretion of calcareous reef framework)]. Manipulative experiments, analyses of existing communities and bioassays tested hypotheses that the relative dominances of these functional groups are mediated by two principal controlling factors: nutrients (i.e., bottom-up control) and herbivory (i.e., top-down control). The results show that reduced nutrients alone do not preclude fleshy algal growth when herbivory is low, and high herbivory alone does not prevent fleshy algal growth when nutrients are elevated. However, reduced nutrients in combination with high herbivory virtually eliminate all forms of fleshy micro- and macro-algae. The findings reveal considerable complexity in that increases in bottom-up nutrient controls and their interactions stimulate harmful fleshy algal blooms (that can alter the abundance patterns among functional groups, even under intense herbivory); conversely, elevated nutrients inhibit the growth of ecologically beneficial reef-building corals. The results show even further complexity in that nutrients also act directly as either limiting factors (e.g., physiological stresses) or as stimulatory mechanisms (e.g., growth enhancing factors), as well as functioning indirectly by influencing competitive outcomes. Herbivory directly reduces fleshy-algal biomass, which indirectly (via competitive release) favors the expansion of grazer-resistant reef-building corals and coralline algae. Because of the sensitive nature of direct/indirect and stimulating/limiting interacting factors, coral reefs are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic reversal effects that decrease top-down controls and, concomitantly, increase bottom-up controls, dramatically altering ecosystem resiliencies.

AB We examined the foraging strategies of dorcas gazelles (Gazella dorcas) at different spatial scales. When in sand dunes in the Negev desert of Israel, the gazelles fed on a single plant species, the madonna lily (Pancratium sickenbergeri). In summer, when all live plant material is subterranean, the gazelles dug holes in the sand to remove the stem and bulb. After the winter rains, only the tips of the leaves that had emerged above ground were eaten. We examined search patterns and patch choice on a large scale using both null hypotheses generated by a random walk model and ''rules of thumb'' that may approximate an optimal foraging strategy. At a smaller scale, we examined the selection of parts of individual lilies, again making predictions about ''rules of thumb'' that the gazelles should use. Gazelle search paths deviated considerably from a random walk. Gazelles made shorter move lengths in areas of high plant density. Bouts of concentrated feeding in small areas were interspersed with long moves to new foraging areas, suggesting that these animals were repeatedly sampling their environment. Congruent with optimal foraging predictions, the gazelles selected plants with more and larger leaves than randomly available, and concentrated their foraging activity in areas of highest lily densities. In summer, gazelles altered the depth of digs in response to differences in sand compaction. There was a surprising negative correlation between the size of the plant and the amount eaten. This selection of small plants appears to be due to the increased probability of reaching the bulb, which contains most of the plant's volume. Summer foraging by gazelles had a negative impact on the lilies. There is strong selection on the lilies to grow to a sufficient depth that damage of the bulb by herbivory is minimized. Conversely, the gazelles must select plants with bulbs close to the surface to maximize energy intake and minimize the energy cost of digging.

AB Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a cyanobacterial species extensively studied for its toxicity, bloom formation and invasiveness potential, which have consequences to public and environmental health. Its current geographical distribution, spanning different climates, suggests that C. raciborskii has acquired the status of a cosmopolitan species. From phylogeography studies, a tropical origin for this species seems convincing, with different conjectural routes of expansion toward temperate climates. This expansion may be a result of the species physiological plasticity, or of the existence of different ecotypes with distinct environmental requirements. In particular, C. raciborskii is known to tolerate wide temperature and light regimes and presents diverse nutritional strategies. This cyanobacterium is also thought to have benefited from climate change conditions, regarding its invasiveness into temperate climates. Other factors, recently put forward, such as allelopathy, may also be important to its expansion. The effect of C. raciborskii in the invaded communities is still mostly unknown but may strongly disturb species diversity at different trophic levels. In this review we present an up-to-date account of the distribution, phylogeography, ecophysiology, as well some preliminary reports of the impact of C. raciborskii in different organisms.

AB The use of controlled grazing by large herbivores as a research and management tool in forest systems is reviewed, with particular focus on exclosure-based studies of plant-animal interactions within north-west Europe. Controlled grazing studies have revealed that large herbivores (wild and domestic) have a substantial influence on forest composition and dynamics. We review current knowledge and highlight the deficiencies and potentials for new research, in relation to specific areas identified as of key importance in forest dynamics. Few attempts have been made to assess critical thresholds of grazing intensity in relation to factors such as recruitment and maintenance of different tree species. Thus it is not possible to define appropriate grazing management techniques for specific aims, yet there is an urgent need for this type of knowledge, especially in countries with little remaining natural forest. Gradients of primary productivity have been shown to affect grazing choice and species responses to damage in non-forest vegetation, yet few studies have explored these effects within forest systems. More research on plant-herbivore and herbivore-herbivore interactions is required at a range of both plant and animal densities. The increasing awareness of biodiversity issues has also highlighted deficiencies in our knowledge of forest systems. We conclude that controlled grazing experiments have an important role to play in these key aspects of forest research, and that their potential has not yet been fully utilized.

AB Since the early 1960s increased soil erosion due to changing land-use practices in the Sabaki River catchment basin, has increased river-sediment discharge into coastal waters around Malindi, Kenya. Line transect surveys of shallow (<5 m at low tide) coral reef communities were conducted in 1985-1988 and 1992-1993 on a gradient of sediment influence in the Watamu (low influence) and Malindi (intermediate and high influence) National Marine Parks. Total algal cover increased between surveys only at the control (low sediment) reef, to levels comparable to the sediment influenced reefs. Within algal categories (turf, calcareous, fleshy and coralline) there were no consistent differences among treatment groups consistent with sediment influence. Soft coral and sponge cover were higher at increasing levels of sediment influence, though this trend is confounded by a parallel increase in water motion. Coral cover increased significantly over time at the intermediate reef, to levels comparable to the low and high-sediment influenced reefs. Generic richness, diversity and dominance of corals were broadly similar among all reefs except for higher dominance in the control reef. Positive correlation between differences in coral genus abundance and differences in mean coral colony sizes over time and among reefs suggests a suite of sediment-tolerant (Echinopora, Galaxea, Hydnophora, Millepora and Platygyra) and sediment-intolerant (Favia, Montipora and Pocillopora) genera. Acropora, Astreopora, Favites and Porites were intermediate between these groups. Reefs exposed to high sediment influence were dominated by sediment tolerant and intermediate coral genera during both surveys, while reefs exposed to low sediment influence were dominated by sediment-intolerant and intermediate genera. Overall, although there were changes in some of the parameters listed above, and in coral genus abundance patterns, no evidence for decreased diversity and ecological health of sediment-influenced reefs could be found for our set of community-level measurements of the shallow-water coral assemblage.

AB The need for scientifically based management of lakes, as key water resources, requires the establishment of quantitative relationships between in-lake processes responsible for water quality (WQ) and the intensity of major management measures (MM, e.g. nutrient loading). In this paper, we estimate the impact of potential changes in nutrient loading on the Lake Kinneret ecosystem. Following validation of the model against a comprehensive dataset, we applied an approach that goes beyond scenario testing by linking the lake ecosystem model DYRESM-CAEDYM with a set of ecosystem variables included in a pre-assessed system of water quality indices. The emergent properties of the ecosystem predicted from the model simulations were also compared with lake data as a form of indirect validation of the model. Model output, in good agreement with lake data, indicated differential effects of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient loading on concentrations, and major in-lake fluxes, of TN and TP, and dynamics and algal community structure. Both model output and lake data indicated a strong relationship between nitrogen loading and in-lake TN values. This relationship is not apparent for phosphorus and only a weak relationship exists between phosphorus loading and in-lake TP. The modeling results, expressed in terms of water quality, allowed establishment of critical/threshold values for the nutrient loads. Implementation of the ecological modeling supplemented with the quantified set of WQ indices allowed us to take a step towards establishment of the association between permissible ranges for water quality and major management measures, i.e. towards sustainable management.

AB Benthic communities were assessed and 22 environmental variables were monitored at seven leeward localities (L1-L7) in the Whitsunday Islands, Queensland, Australia. L1 was near the Proserpine and O'Connell river mouths and L7 similar to 80 km north of the river mouths. Distinct physico-chemical and biological gradients were evident. Sparse scleractinian coral communities, dominated by faviids, Montipora spp. and encrusting Porites colonies, were present at L1, L2 and L3, whereas diverse reef-building communities, dominated by Acropora spp., were more common at and beyond L4. The number of coral recruits (age <6 months) did not differ significantly among localities, suggesting that coral recruitment was near random and that the environment shapes the adult community from those recruits. The study demonstrates strong negative relationships between chlorophyll a and the following: percentage coral cover, coral species richness and coral abundance. The reef-building capacities of the coral communities and the extent of Holocene reef development were inconsistent at L2 and L3, which is interpreted as a sign of anthropogenic effects.

AB Coral heads of the genus Platigyra exposed to low concentrations of crude oil, copper sulfate, potassium phosphate, or dextrose were killed in periods of 5 to 10 days in aquarium studies. The chemicals stimulated the production of large quantities of mucus by the corals. In aquaria treated with antibiotics to prevent microbial growth, Platigyra survived the presence of these chemicals in the water, indicating a role of the microflora in the death of the corals. Evidence was obtained implicating predatory bacteria, Desulfovibrio and Beggiatoa, in the destruction of the stressed coral colonies.

AB The interaction of fast and slow processes is an integral parr of the sudden large shifts that sometimes occur in ecosystems. To study the effects of slow/fast variables on ecosystems, we used a range of examples from natural and exploited aquatic and terrestrial systems. So-called catastrophic bifurcations in the dynamics of the fast components are at the heart of such dramatic shifts. We discuss some of the most important bifurcations and show how they can be analyzed. Subsequently, we show how the interaction with slowly changing variables can be understood from graphs constructed in a simple way using the singular perturbation approach.

AB Simple models describing plant-herbivore interactions predict complex dynamics that depend on both herbivore density and plant abundance. The predictions of such models depend critically on the functional response of herbivores to forage availability, but few field studies have examined these responses or tested the hypothesis that alternate stable states can exist in plant-herbivore systems. We examined interactions between white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, and a dominant forb species, Laportea canadensis, in the understory of deciduous forests by measuring the functional response of deer to this forb and by conducting exclosure experiments under different deer and forb densities. Deer consumption of Laportea, measured at the scale of a forest stand, showed a Holling Type II functional response where the proportion of stems consumed has a steeply declining monotonic relationship to stem abundance. At high deer density, the deer-forb interaction, as measured by exclosure experiments, produced two alternate stable states that depended on initial forb abundance. Exclosure experiments also identified a lower deer density at which herbivory has no detectable effect on Laportea populations. This potential for a nonmonotonic relationship between plants and herbivores has direct implications for the conservation and restoration of plant species in systems where herbivores can be managed.

AB Marine bioconstructions are biodiversity-rich, three-dimensional biogenic structures, regulating key ecological functions of benthic ecosystems worldwide. Tropical coral reefs are outstanding for their beauty, diversity and complexity, but analogous types of bioconstructions are also present in temperate seas. The main bioconstructions in the Mediterranean Sea are represented by coralligenous formations, vermetid reefs, deep-sea cold-water corals, Lithophyllum byssoides trottoirs, coral banks formed by the shallow-water corals Cladocora caespitosa or Astroides calycularis, and sabellariid or serpulid worm reefs. Bioconstructions change the morphological and chemicophysical features of primary substrates and create new habitats for a large variety of organisms, playing pivotal roles in ecosystem functioning. In spite of their importance, Mediterranean bioconstructions have not received the same attention that tropical coral reefs have, and the knowledge of their biology, ecology and distribution is still fragmentary. All existing data about the spatial distribution of Italian bioconstructions have been collected, together with information about their growth patterns, dynamics and connectivity. The degradation of these habitats as a consequence of anthropogenic pressures (pollution, organic enrichment, fishery, coastal development, direct physical disturbance), climate change and the spread of invasive species was also investigated.
   The study of bioconstructions requires a holistic approach leading to a better understanding of their ecology and the application of more insightful management and conservation measures at basin scale, within ecologically coherent units based on connectivity: the cells of ecosystem functioning.

AB Spatial localization is a common feature of physical systems, occurring in both conservative and dissipative systems. This article reviews the theoretical foundations of our understanding of spatial localization in forced dissipative systems, from both a mathematical point of view and a physics perspective. It explains the origin of the large multiplicity of simultaneously stable spatially localized states present in a parameter region called the pinning region and its relation to the notion of homoclinic snaking. The localized states are described as bound states of fronts, and the notions of front pinning, self-pinning, and depinning are emphasized. Both one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems are discussed, and the reasons behind the differences in behavior between dissipative systems with conserved and nonconserved dynamics are explained. The insights gained are specific to forced dissipative systems and are illustrated here using examples drawn from fluid mechanics (convection and shear flows) and a simple model of crystallization.

AB 1. Understanding seed dispersal by wind and, in particular, long-distance dispersal (LDD) is needed for management of plant populations and communities, especially in response to changes in climate, land use and natural habitats. Numerical models designed to explore complex, nonlinear atmospheric processes are essential tools for understanding the fundamental mechanisms involved in seed dispersal. Yet, thus far, nearly all such models have not explicitly accounted for the spatial heterogeneity that is a typical feature of all ecosystems.
   2. The recently developed Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS)-based Forest Large Eddy Simulation (RAFLES) is used here to explore how within-stand canopy heterogeneity impacts LDD. RAFLES resolves microscale canopy heterogeneity such as small gaps and variable tree heights, and it simulates their impacts on turbulence inside and above the canopy in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). For that purpose, an Eulerian-Lagrangian module of seed dispersal is added to RAFLES to simulate seed trajectories.
   3. Particular attention is paid to the sensitivity of statistical attributes of the dispersal kernels (i.e. mean, mode, variance, tail) to key simplifications common to all seed dispersal models, such as horizontal homogeneity in the canopy and flow field, and the tight coupling between air parcel trajectories and seed trajectories (i.e. neglecting seed inertia). These attributes appear to be sensitive to various factors operating at scales ranging from the seed scale to the ABL scale.
   4. Simulations with RAFLES show that LDD is characterized by a dispersal kernel with a 'tail', asymptotically approaching a power law decay of -3/2 (mainly occurring for lighter seeds at high wind speeds). This is consistent with asymptotic predictions from analytical models. The wind speed threshold at which seed abscission occurs, set-up to be twice the standard deviation of the vertical wind speed, is shown to affect short-distance dispersal, but has no significant impact on LDD. Ignoring the effects of seed inertia on the seed trajectory calculations has a minor effect on short-distance dispersal and no effect on the probability of seed uplift. Thus, it has no significant impact on LDD.
   5. Synthesis. Tree-scale canopy heterogeneity affects the turbulence characteristics inside and above the canopy and, consequently, this affects dispersal kernel statistics. A key finding from this study is that ejection is enhanced above the shorter trees of the canopy. Seeds dispersed above shorter trees have a higher probability of experiencing LDD while their short-distance dispersal remains practically the same. At inter-annual time scales, such interactions could affect species composition.

AB The foraging of an insect society is a complex process involving large numbers of individuals collecting food from many different sources. Differential equation models have shown how quite simple communication mechanisms can produce complex and functional group-level foraging patterns. In this paper we review previous differential equation models for pheromone trails, honey bee dances and other methods of communication used during foraging. We develop a general framework for modelling social insect foraging systems that incorporates each of the previous models. This framework identifies the different behaviours that insects undertake while foraging, along with generalised rate functions that determine how the insects switch between behaviours. We describe how to tailor our framework to specific insect societies, by incorporating the details of specific behavioural mechanisms into appropriate expressions for rates of discovery of, recruitment to, and retirement from food sources. Our framework thus provides an experimental tool for improved understanding of the foraging behaviour of particular species, as well as a system for meaningful comparisons of foraging behaviour across species. We end this article by linking our framework to inclusive fitness theory. We demonstrate how understanding of the proximate mechanisms involved in social insect foraging ultimately furthers understanding, not only of how insect societies function, but also of how these mechanisms are used to optimise colony fitness and survival.

AB I address the selection of plants with different characteristics by herbivores of different body sizes by incorporating allometric relationships for herbivore foraging into optimal foraging models developed for herbivores. Herbivores may use two criteria in maximizing their nutritional intake when confronted with a range of food resources: a minimum digestibility and a minimum cropping rate. Minimum digestibility should depend on plant chemical characteristics and minimum cropping rate should depend on the density of plant items and their size (mass). If herbivores do select for these plant characteristics, then herbivores of different body sizes should select different ranges of these characteristics due to allometric relationships in digestive physiology, cropping ability and nutritional demands. This selectivity follows a regular pattern such that a herbivore of each body size can exclusively utilize some plants, while it must share other plants with herbivores of other body sizes. I empirically test this hypothesis of herbivore diet selectivity and the pattern of resource use that it produces in the held and experimentally. The findings have important implications for competition among herbivores and their population and community ecology. Furthermore, the results may have general applicability to other types of foragers, with general implications for how biodiversity is influenced.

AB Range condition assessment procedures that rely on field-collected botanical data face major problems in nonequilibrium rangelands, which are spatially variable and extensively grazed. These problems include the difficulty of interpreting changes in plant species composition and the logistics of obtaining representative data for large areas. Consideration of ecosystem behavior through time and in space shows that certain spatial and temporal patterns exist that may be used to isolate the impact of grazing from other processes. The patterns also make it possible to distinguish between temporary changes and those that are more long term. All relevant patterns may be expressed in terms of total plant cover and may be monitored from remote sensing satellites. It is therefore possible to derive a set of range condition indicators that may be measured and monitored from space. These indicators use trends in average vegetation cover with distance from water at the end of very wet periods, trends in cover variance with distance from water, and the magnitude of observed vegetation response at individual points in the landscape compared with that which is expected when vegetation recovers fully from grazing. It is also possible to use spatial variability in the rate of cover depletion after rainfall to infer relative differences in the amount of forage present. When used in combination, the methods offer a realistic alternative to field-based assessment and are capable of detecting many types of rangeland degradation. They are also considerably cheaper to use.

AB Grasslands are increasingly considered not only for their contribution to livestock production but also in their various functions with respect to the environment and the landscape. There is an accumulation of scientific evidence about the environmental functions of grasslands, such as their role in the conservation of biodiversity, in the regulation of physical and chemical fluxes in ecosystems, and the mitigation of pollution. Their role in the maintenance of landscapes of value is also important for reasons of landscape amenity and cultural heritage.
   To introduce the challenges these functions bring for grassland management to both science and practice, a description of the benefits currently expected from grasslands and their role in agn-environmental and landscape public policies is given. The current scientific understanding of grassland dynamics in relation to management is then briefly addressed. An analysis of the changes occurring in grassland management practice and research in reference to the whole farm and the landscape is then provided. The diversity of grasslands and their spatial arrangement within a farm and the landscape appear from this analysis as two emergent factors of major importance in the search for sustainable development of livestock farms and the environment. The practical consequences on both livestock farmer practice and the direction of animal production research are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The arid steppes north of the Sahara occupy an area of some 630,000 km(2), between the isohyets of 100 and 400 mm of mean annual rainfall (MAR), from the Red Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Physiognomically they may be subdivided into perennial grass, dwarf shrub, tall shrub, crassulescent, succulent and pulvinate (or tragacanthic) steppes. Floristically they include some 2630 species of vascular plants, with a 26% rate of endemism; endemism is distributed into an eastern center (130 species), a western center (365 species) and an overall steppic nucleus (165 species). The limits between the east, central and west centers are approximately the 19 degreesE and 0 degrees of Longitude, respectively; while the regional limits are the Atlantic Ocean to the West and the Red Sea and Suez Canal to the east.
   The main elements of phytochory, in species numbers, are: Mediterranean, 88%; Cosmopolitan, 5%; and Tropical, 4%. The Mediterranean element of phytochory includes: 26% Mediterranean taxa, sensu stricto; 40% Ibero-Maghribian; 11% Irano-Turanian; and 11% Mediterraneo-Saharo-Arabian.
   The archaic element of Austro-Pan-African xerophytic flora, the so-called Rand-Flora, mostly composed of Tropical and Mediterraneo-Saharo-Arabian species, represents some 350 species, i.e. 13%. The fauna includes 129 species of mammals, 133 species of resident birds, and 87 species of reptiles.
   Large mammals are mainly of Africo-Tropical and small mammals of Mediterranean kinships. Birds are predominantly Mediterranean, while reptiles are evenly balanced between Mediterranean and Tropical taxa. There are eastern, central and western centers of distribution of these three main groups, limited by approximately the same meridian borders as for the Flora, the 19 degreesE and 0 degrees of Longitude. The Oriental province specifically includes 15 species of mammals, nine species of birds and 129 species of reptiles; the western province, in turn, is characterized by eight species of mammals, 15 species of birds and four species of reptiles. For all groups the proportion of the Tropical element tends to grow southwards, with aridity and temperature. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB Manuscripts describing crop models are a common feature in crop science journals. Many of these papers offer important conceptual insights and advances in the understanding of crop science but some fail to offer the scientific innovation expected in a scientific publication. Even though manuscripts may describe modeling efforts of practical perspective with localized interest, they may not present an analysis of general, scientific interest. A difficult challenge for journal referees and editors is to make decisions on submitted manuscripts concerning their acceptability for journal publication. The discussion presented in this paper is intended to initiate a consideration of those traits expected of a manuscript describing a crop model. We suggest three criteria that should be met in a crop modeling paper to make it suitable for scientific publication: a clear statement of a scientific objective with a defined domain of relevance, a mechanistic framework, and an evaluation of the scientific innovation offered in the new model. We also discuss the use and abuse of three widely used modeling concepts: calibration, validation, and universality. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Genetic monitoring has rarely been used for wildlife translocations despite the potential benefits this approach offers, compared to traditional field-based methods. We applied genetic monitoring to the reintroduced brown bear population in northern Italy. From 2002 to 2008, 2781 hair and faecal samples collected noninvasively plus 12 samples obtained from captured or dead bears were used to follow the demographic and geographical expansion and changes in genetic composition. Individual genotypes were used to reconstruct the wild pedigree and revealed that the population increased rapidly, from nine founders to > 27 individuals in 2008 (lambda = 1.17-1.19). Spatial mapping of bear samples indicated that most bears were distributed in the region surrounding the translocation site; however, individual bears were found up to 163 km away. Genetic diversity in the population was high, with expected heterozygosity of 0.74-0.79 and allelic richness of 4.55-5.41. However, multi-year genetic monitoring data showed that mortality rates were elevated, immigration did not occur, one dominant male sired all cubs born from 2002 to 2005, genetic diversity declined, relatedness increased, inbreeding occurred, and the effective population size was extremely small (Ne = 3.03, ecological method). The comprehensive information collected through genetic monitoring is critical for implementing future conservation plans for the brown bear population in the Italian Alps. This study provides a model for other reintroduction programmes by demonstrating how genetic monitoring can be implemented to uncover aspects of the demography, ecology and genetics of small and reintroduced populations that will advance our understanding of the processes influencing their viability, evolution, and successful restoration.

AB We discuss the mechanisms leading to nutrient limitation in tropical marine systems, with particular emphasis on nitrogen cycling in Caribbean ecosystems. We then explore how accelerated nutrient cycling from human activities is affecting these systems.
   Both nitrogen and phosphorus exert substantial influence on biological productivity and structure of tropical marine ecosystems. Offshore planktonic communities are largely nitrogen limited while nearshore ecosystems are largely phosphorus limited. For phosphorus, the ability of sediment to adsorb and store phosphorus is probably greater for tropical carbonate sediments than for most nearshore sediments in temperate coastal systems. However, the ability of tropical carbonate sediments to take up phosphorus can become saturated as phosphorus loading from human sources increases. The nature of the sediment, the mixing rate between nutrient-laden runoff waters and nutrient-poor oceanic waters and the degree of interaction of these water masses with the sediment will probably control the dynamics of this transition.
   Nearshore tropical marine ecosystems function differently from their temperate counterparts where coupled nitrification/denitrification serves as an important mechanism for nitrogen depuration. In contrast, nearshore tropical ecosystems are more susceptible to nitrogen loading as depurative capacity of the microbial communities is limited by the fragility of the nitrification link. At the same time, accumulation of organic matter in nearshore carbonate sediments appears to impair their capacity for phosphorus immobilization. In the absence of depurative mechanisms for either phosphorus or nitrogen, limitation for both these nutrients is alleviated and continued nutrient loading fuels the proliferation of nuisance algae.

AB Seventy dugongs were fitted with satellite PTTs and/or GPS transmitters in sub-tropical and tropical waters of Queensland and the Northern Territory, Australia. Twenty-eight of the 70 dugongs were also fitted with time-depth recorders. The dugongs were tracked for periods ranging from 15 to 551 days and exhibited a large range of individualistic movement behaviours; 26 individuals were relatively sedentary (moving < 15 km) while 44 made large-scale movements (> 15 km) of up to 560 kin from their capture sites. Male and female animals, including cows with calves, exhibited large-scale movements (LSM; > 15 km). Body length of travelling dugongs ranged from 1.9 to 3 in. At least some of the movements were return movements to the capture location, suggesting that such movements were ranging rather than dispersal movements. LSMs included macro-scale regional movements (> 100 km) and meso-scale inter-patch local movements (15 to < 100 km) and were qualitatively different from tidally-driven micro-scale commuting movements between and within seagrass beds (< 15 km). The mean +/- S.E. macro-scale movement distance per individual was 243.8 +/- 35.4 km (N = 14 individuals that travelled > 100 km), with a mean S.E. travel time of 179.8 +/- 29.0 h. The mean S.E. meso-scale movement distance per individual was 49.7 +/- 3.3 kin (N = 28 individuals that made movements of 15100 km), with a mean S.E. travel time of 52.3 +/- 7.1 h. LSMs were rapid and apparently directed (mean S.E. travel speeds for GPS tagged animals; meso-scale movements = 1.3 +/- 0.11 km/h, min = 0.3, max = 3.0; macro-scale movements = 1.6 +/- 0.16 km/h, min = 0.8, max = 1.3). Tracked dugongs rarely travelled far from the coast (mean S.E. max distance = 12.8 +/- 1.3 krn). Dive profiles from the time-depth recorders suggest that dugongs make repeated deep dives while travelling rather than remaining at the surface, increasing their likelihood of capture in bottom set gill nets. Some animals caught in the high latitude limits of the dugongs' range on the Australian east coast in winter apparently undertook long distance movements in response to low water temperatures, similar to migrational movements by Florida manatees. Our findings that dugongs frequently undertake macro-scale movements have implications for management at a range of scales, and strengthen the aerial survey and genetic evidence for management and monitoring at ecological scales that cross jurisdictions.

AB 1. Seed predation of 12 fleshy-fruited species was recorded in experimental dishes under early successional forest in south-west Germany (four seasons 1992 and 1993) and in south England (summer 1995). On each occasion, 200 dishes were laid out, each containing five seeds of a given species. The mean time for three or more seeds to be removed was taken as a measure of granivore preferences. We tested correlations of these preferences with several physical and nutritional seed traits.

Live trapping and selectively accessible dishes indicated that rodents were the major granivores (Apodemus sylvaticus, Apodemus flavicollis, Clethrionomys glareolus); no predation by birds or insects was observed. The rank order of the rodents' seed preferences was consistent among sites, seasons and years, but mean predation differed between species, sites and seasons. Seed predation was highest in summer and lowest in winter. Possible implications of the seasonal pattern in predation risk are discussed.
   3. The preferences of rodents were significantly correlated with the species-specific viability of seeds (i.e. percentage of sound seed) in five of eight experiments and with the percentage of water in the embryo-plus-endosperm fraction (EEF) in four of eight experiments. Surprisingly, preferences were not correlated to seed mass, EEF mass or nitrogen concentration. Predation was lowest among toxic species (Berberis vulgaris, Euonymus europaeus, Sambucus nigra) and among species with woody endocarps (Cornus sanguinea, Crataegus spp.).

TI THE GROWTH OF COASTAL TOURISM IN THE RED-SEA - PRESENT AND
   FUTURE-EFFECTS ON CORAL-REEFS
SO AMBIO
LA English
DT Article
ID COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SEDIMENTATION; POLLUTION
AB Coral reefs provide a major impetus for tourist development throughout the tropics. Their increased popularity has led to extremely rapid growth of many resorts. Using the Red Sea as a case history we examine the impacts that expanding coastal tourism has had on coral reefs. Present development is restricted almost entirely to Egypt, Israel and Jordan. The short coastlines of the latter two countries mean that most of their reefs are already, or soon will be, affected by tourism (developed or used recreationally). Approximately 19% of Egypt's reefs are currently affected, but this figure is expected to rise to over 30% by the year 2000. However, the intensity of use of reefs is likely to increase much more during this period. Israel plans a further 43% increase in coastal tourism, Jordan 100% and Egypt a massive 11-fold expansion. Of the planned expansion in Egypt, 55% will occur around the established resorts of Hurghada and Sharm-el-Sheikh. Tourist development has already caused substantial damage to inshore reefs near Hurghada from infilling, sedimentation and over-fishing for marine curies. Elsewhere, new constructions are also beginning to modify reef habitats. Until now, damage to Sharm-el-Sheikh's reefs has been mainly caused by the direct effects of diving and snorkelling. Although, current levels of recreational use appear to be sustainable, the massive expansion planned throughout the region will place the long-term future of reefs in doubt. Unless the pace of tourist development in the northern Red Sea is significantly reduced soon the carrying capacity of coral reefs seems sure to be exceeded with widespread reef degradation the likely result.

AB Urbanisation exposes wildlife to new challenging conditions and environmental pressures. Some mammalian species have adapted to these novel environments, but it remains unclear which characteristics allow them to persist. To address this question, we identified 190 mammals regularly recorded in urban settlements worldwide, and used phylogenetic path analysis to test hypotheses regarding which behavioural, ecological and life history traits favour adaptation to urban environments for different mammalian groups. Our results show that all urban mammals produce larger litters; whereas other traits such as body size, behavioural plasticity and diet diversity were important for some but not all taxonomic groups. This variation highlights the idiosyncrasies of the urban adaptation process and likely reflects the diversity of ecological niches and roles mammals can play. Our study contributes towards a better understanding of mammal association to humans, which will ultimately allow the design of wildlife-friendly urban environments and contribute to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.

AB Phenotypic plasticity and microevolution are the two primary means by which organisms respond adaptively to local conditions. While these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, their relative magnitudes will influence both the rate of, and ability to sustain, phenotypic responses to climate change. We review accounts of recent phenotypic changes in wild mammal populations with the purpose of critically evaluating the following: (i) whether climate change has been identified as the causal mechanism producing the observed change; (ii) whether the change is adaptive; and (iii) the relative influences of evolution and/or phenotypic plasticity underlying the change. The available data for mammals are scant. We found twelve studies that report changes in phenology, body weight or litter size. In all cases, the observed response was primarily due to plasticity. Only one study (of advancing parturition dates in American red squirrels) provided convincing evidence of contemporary evolution. Subsequently, however, climate change has been shown to not be the causal mechanism underlying this shift. We also summarize studies that have shown evolutionary potential (i.e. the trait is heritable and/or under selection) in traits with putative associations with climate change and discuss future directions that need to be undertaken before a conclusive demonstration of plastic or evolutionary responses to climate change in wild mammals can be made.

AB The high diversity of mutualisms has probably limited the development of a general theory about their evolution and their stability. Here we review conflicts of interests occurring in the 13 known nursery pollination systems, where pollinators reproduce within the inflorescence they pollinate. We found three main conflicts of interest between mutualists that correspond to the following evolutionary questions: 1) Why do plants not kill their pollinators' larvae? 2) Why do pollinators visit deceptive flowers? and 3) Why do pollinators pollinate? We show that the reproductive system of the plant is strongly correlated not only with the set of conflicts of interests that actually occur but also with the proximal resolution of these conflicts. In many cases the evolutionary stability of nursery pollination mutualisms relies on the avoidance of intra-specific competition among pollinator larvae. This stabilizing factor could perhaps also explain the absence of overexploitation in other mutualisms.

AB Many prey modify behaviour in response to predation risk and this modification frequently leads to a foraging rate reduction. Although this reduction can have a clear direct negative effect on prey growth rate, theory predicts that a net positive effect can occur when the combined reduction in foraging by the entire population leads to a large increase in resource level. Here, I present experimental results that corroborate this counterintuitive prediction: the predation threat of 'nonlethal' caged larval dragonflies (Anax longipes) caused a net increase in small bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) growth. A (Anax longipes) caused a net increase in small bullfrog behavioural response (i.e. a reduction in activin, level and microhabitat usage) was likely to have negatively affected growth, but was offset by a Positive effect Oil growth from a large increase in resource levels (measured using a bioassay). Further, the positive Anax effect was dependent on nutrient level, illustrating the role of the resource response magnitude. Results of this study are discussed in the context of Studies in which Anax had the opposite (i.e. negative) effect on tadpole growth. Predator-induced modifications in prey behaviour can have large negative or positive effects on prey growth, the sign and magnitude of which are dependent On relative species density, and resource dynamics.

AB 1. After a period of heavy emphasis on negative interactions, such as predation and competition, the past two decades have seen an explosion of literature on the role of positive interactions in ecological communities. Such positive interactions can take many forms. One possibility is that amelioration of environmental stress by plants or sessile animals enhances growth, reproduction and survival of others, but many more intricate patterns exist.
   2. Importantly such positive interactions may contribute to creating a positive feedback. For instance, biomass can lead to improved environmental conditions causing better growth and therefore leading to more biomass. A positive feedback is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the emergence of alternative stable states at the community scale. However, the literature on positive interactions in plant and animal communities rarely addresses this connection.
   3. Here, we address this gap, asking the question of when positive interactions may lead to alternative stable states, and hence set the stage for catastrophic transitions at tipping points in ecosystems. We argue that, although there are a number of now classical examples in the literature for which positive interactions are clearly the main actors of positive feedback loops, more empirical and theoretical research scaling up from the individual-level interactions to the community and the ecosystem scale processes is needed to further understand under which conditions positive interactions can trigger positive feedback loops, and thereby alternative stable states.

AB Much of ecological research centers around discovering the underlying factors for species distribution; three such factors are of central importance: local environment, landscape features and dispersal. While all have been simplified in the past, the recent increase in metapopulation and metacommunity research makes being able to quantify dispersal all that much more necessary. In order to increase our knowledge about metacommunities in the "real word", it is clearly time to start thinking critically about whether and how the methods that are currently available for measuring dispersal within metapopulations can be adapted. The goal of this contribution is to present and argue the technical difficulties involved in measuring dispersal within metacommunities through: (1) discussing the merits and pitfalls of some potential direct (e.g., mark-recapture) and indirect methods (e.g., isolation measures, patchiness) for studying the effects of dispersal at the metapopulation and metacommunity level; (2) discuss the types of questions that can be tackled at the metacommunity level in light of methodological decisions; and (3) make the point that the technical difficulties of measuring dispersal for multiple species may leave us with little other options than using indirect methods to estimate dispersal in metacommunities.

AB Mangrove seedlings were treated with a mixture of two bacterial species, the slow-growing, N-2-fixing bacterium Phyllobacterium sp. and the fast-growing, phosphate-solubilizing bacterium Bacillus licheniformis, both isolated from the rhizosphere from black, white, and red mangroves of a semiarid zone. Nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization increased when the mixture was used compared to the effects observed when adding individual cultures, notwithstanding that there was no increase in bacterial multiplication under these conditions. Inoculation of black mangrove seedlings in artificial seawater showed the mixture performed somewhat better than inoculation of the individual bacterium; more leaves were developed and higher It levels of N-15 were incorporated into the leaves, although the total nitrogen level decreased. This study demonstrates that interactions between individual components of the rhizosphere of mangroves should be considered when evaluating these bacteria as Plant growth promoters.

AB Current scientific consensus is that inshore regions of the central and southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, are at risk of impacts from increased nutrient (as well as sediment and pesticide) loads delivered to Reef waters. Increases in the discharge of water quality contaminants to the Reef are largely a consequence of the expansion of agricultural practices in northern Queensland catchments following European settlement in the 1850s. In particular, the presence of elevated chlorophyll a and nutrient concentrations in many parts of the inshore Great Barrier Reef together with intense and extensive phytoplankton blooms following the discharge of nutrient-rich river flood waters suggest that the central and southern inshore area of the Great Barrier Reef is likely to be significantly impacted by elevated nutrient loads. The biological consequences of this are not fully quantified, but are likely to include changes in reef condition including hard and soft coral biodiversity, macroalgal abundance, hard coral cover and coral recruitment, as well as change in seagrass distribution and tissue nutrient status. Contemporary government policy is centered around promotion and funding of better catchment management practices to minimize the loss of catchment nutrients (both applied and natural) and the maintenance of a Reef wide water quality and ecosystem monitoring program. The monitoring program is designed to assess trends in uptake of management practice improvements and their associated impacts on water quality and ecosystem status over the next 10 years. A draft set of quantitative criteria to assess the eutrophication status of Great Barrier Reef waters is outlined for further discussion and refinement.

AB A strategy for global sensitivity analysis of a multi-parameter ecological model was developed and used for the hydrodynamic-ecological model (DYRESM-CAEDYM, DYnamic REservoir Simulation Model-Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model) applied to Lake Kinneret (Israel). Two different methods of sensitivity analysis, RPART (Recursive Partitioning And Regression Trees) and GLM (General Linear Model) were applied in order to screen a subset of significant parameters. All the parameters which were found significant by at least one of these methods were entered as input to a GBM (Generalized Boosted Modeling) analysis in order to provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of the model variables to these parameters. Although the GBM is a general and powerful machine learning algorithm, it has substantial computational costs in both storage requirements and CPU time. Employing the screening stage reduces this cost. The results of the analysis highlighted the role of particulate organic material in the lake ecosystem and its impact on the over all lake nutrient budget The GBM analysis established, for example, that parameters such as particulate organic material diameter and density were particularly important to the model outcomes. The results were further explored by lumping together output variables that are associated with sub-components of the ecosystem. The variable lumping approach suggested that the phytoplankton group is most sensitive to parameters associated with the dominant phytoplankton group, dinoflagellates, and with nanoplankton (Chlorophyta), supporting the view of Lake Kinneret as a bottom-up system. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of such procedures for extracting useful information for model calibration and guiding further data collection. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Twenty years have passed since Gould and Lewontin published their critique of 'the adaptationist program' - the tendency of some evolutionary biologists to assume, rather than demonstrate, the operation of natural selection. After the 'Spandrels paper', evolutionists were more careful about producing just-so stories based on selection, and paid more attention to a panoply of other processes. Then came reactions against the excesses of the anti-adaptationist movement, which ranged from a complete dismissal of Gould and Lewontin's contribution to a positive call to overcome the problems. We now have an excellent opportunity for finally affirming a more balanced and pluralistic approach to the study of evolutionary biology.

AB Reef coral communities in a non-reef setting on shallow, flat hardgrounds were quantitatively sampled in Dubai Emirate (UAE, Southern Arabian Gulf) before and after a coral mass mortality in 1996. The coral fauna consisted of 34 scleractinian species before and 27 after the event, which removed virtually all Acropora. No alcyonacea were recorded. Five community types were identified and characterized by the dominant species: (A) a sparse Porites lutea community in sandy areas, (B) a dense Acropora clathrata community in areas with little sand, (C) a faviid community in muddy areas, (D) a Siderastrea savignyana community in sandy areas, and (E) a Porites compressa community, which built a framework in sandy areas. These communities are comparable to those described from other areas of the Gulf, where a stable pattern of community differentiation appears to exist. The spatial distribution and dynamics of the coral communities appears to be strongly influenced by mass mortality events recurring every 15 to 20 y. A combination of extreme water temperatures and high sedimentation/turbidity appear to be the major cause of mortality.

AB Rotifers play an important role in many freshwater plankton communities. The populations are controlled from 'bottom-up' depending on different food quantities and qualities. As threshold food levels for rotifers are higher than for cladocerans they are often outcompeted when food concentrations are lowered by the clearance activity of cladocerans. Rotifers also are controlled from 'top-down' by predators, especially by copepods, by instars of Chaoborus and by predatory rotifers. Mechanical interference by daphnids is considered here as a special case of 'predation'. Different defense mechanisms are discussed. At the cost of higher food concentrations (high K-s-food levels) rotifers may exhibit high maximum growth rates (r(max)) and short times for their population development. This ability increases with rotifer body size. Within this taxonomic unity, therefore, different life history strategies have developed. These strategies may be characterized by the r(mas)/K-s-model presented.

AB This review synthesizes evidence that altered fire frequency drives discontinuous ecosystem transitions from mesic grasslands to shrublands or woodlands in the Central Great Plains, USA. Long-term fire manipulations reveal that grassland to shrubland transitions are triggered when fire-free intervals increase from 1-3years to 3-8years, and longer fire returns (10years or more) result in transitions to woodlands. Grazing and soil properties alter these fire thresholds. Grassland to shrubland transitions are abrupt and exhibit nonlinear relationships between driver and state variables. Transitions to shrublands and woodlands exhibit hysteresis, where reintroducing frequent fires does not reverse transitions in management-relevant time-scales (decades). Nonlinear transitions and hysteresis emerge because grasses generate positive feedbacks with fire that create strong demographic barriers for shrub and tree establishment. Fire-free intervals allow shrubs and trees to reach a size sufficient to survive fire, reproduce and disrupt the fire feedback loop through competition.Synthesis. Mesic grasslands, shrublands and woodlands constitute self-reinforcing states (alternative attractors) separated by critical fire frequency thresholds. Even without major shifts in climate, altered fire frequency can produce dramatic state changes, highlighting the importance of fire for predicting future ecosystem states. Local management should focus on prevention of unwanted transitions rather than post hoc restoration.

AB M.V. Lomolino and colleagues have recently reviewed the island rule in mammals and other vertebrates, claiming it is a general pattern. They have portrayed our recent analysis as weakly supporting the island rule, seeing weakness in our use of what they considered to be inadequate size indices (skulls and teeth, rather than mass or body length) and in our use of large islands. They argue that size evolution on islands points to a bauplan-specific fundamental size. We aim to test the generality of the rule and the adequacy of some of the data used to support it.
   Insular environments world-wide.
   We collate and analyse data on skull sizes of carnivores and body masses of mammals in general to see whether there is a graded trend from dwarfism in large species to gigantism in smaller ones.
   The island rule is not supported with either the carnivore or the mammal data sets. Island area does not influence size change.
   Our results suggest that data recently advanced in support of the island rule are inadequate and that the island rule is not a general pattern for all mammals.

   VARIABILITY; CRACHERODII
AB Traditional fisheries management in southern California has failed, in part because it is based on an assumption of an unvarying environment and is focused on size limits rather than insuring the persistence of aggregations of large fecund individuals. The combined effect of low frequency climatic variability and anthropogenic perturbations can have dramatic consequences for abalone in southern California. Abalone species are tightly linked to kelp forest ecosystems that, besides furnishing habitat, also provide the main food source for abalone. In southern California, kelp canopies are very sensitive to oceanographic climate because the kelp depend upon high nutrients in the water column. Oceanic warming, in turn, results in decreased nutrients in the surface water, and this is correlated with marked reductions in giant kelp biomass.
   Here we address the additive effects of ocean warming on two species of California abalone (the red abalone, Haliotis rufescens; and the green abalone, H.fulgens) by subjecting them to varied environmental conditions similar to cool, normal, and warm phases of the California current in the southern California Bight. Our experimental design simultaneously tested the synergistic effects of temperature and food quantity and quality on survivorship, growth, and reproduction. For red abalone, warm temperatures increased the onset of withering syndrome, a fatal abalone disease, and halted growth and reproduction. In contrast, green abalone survivorship, growth, and reproduction were relatively robust irrespective of temperature, while their growth and reproduction were most strongly influenced by food quantity. We found clear evidence suggesting that, combined with overfishing, California abalone populations are adversely affected by ecosystem responses to ocean warming: Coolwater red abalone suffer stronger consequences in warm water than do green abalone. Conservation, restoration, and recovery plans of remnant California abalone populations must consider these relationships when taking any action.

AB Seed dispersal is a critical but poorly understood life-history stage of plants. Here we use a genetic approach to describe seed dispersal patterns accurately in a natural population of the Neotropical tree species Jacaranda copaia ( Bignoniaceae). We used microsatellite genotypes from maternally derived tissue on the diaspore to identify which individual of all possible adult trees in the population was the true source of a given seed collected after it dispersed. Wind-dispersed seeds were captured in two different years in a large array of seed traps in an 84-ha mapped area of tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We were particularly interested in the proportion of seeds that traveled long distances and whether there was evidence for direct dispersal into gaps, which are required for successful recruitment of this pioneer tree species. Maximum likelihood procedures were used to fit single- and multiple-component dispersal kernels to the distance data. Mixture models, with separate distributions near and far, best fit the observed dispersal distances, albeit with considerable uncertainty in the tail. We discuss the results in light of different mechanisms responsible for separate distributions near the adult source and in the tail of the curve.

AB Flowers of different species that resemble each other are not necessarily mimics. For mimicry to be occurring, the similarity must be adaptive. Unfortunately, no case of floral mimicry has ever been fully verified and it is important that we move beyond these perceived similarities to testing whether they are truly adaptive. Here we explain the differences between Batesian and Mullerian floral mimicry, illustrate what should be done to test mimicry hypotheses, and discuss how interspecific pollen transfer influences the evolution of mimicry.

AB 1. Dispersal is a key individual-based process influencing many life-history attributes and scaling up to population-level properties (e.g. metapopulation connectivity). A persistent challenge in dispersal ecology has been the robust characterization of dispersal functions (kernels), a fundamental tool to predict how dispersal processes respond under global change scenarios. Particularly, the rightmost tail of these functions, that is the long-distance dispersal (LDD) events, are difficult to characterize empirically and to model in realistic ways.
   2. But, when is it a LDD event? In the specific case of plants, dispersal has three basic components: (i) a distinct (sessile) source, the maternal plant producing the fruits or the paternal tree acting as a source of pollen; (ii) a distance component between source and target locations; and (iii) a vector actually performing the movement entailing the dispersal event. Here, I discuss operative definitions of LDD based on their intrinsic properties: (i) events crossing geographic boundaries among stands; and (ii) events contributing to effective gene flow and propagule migration.
   3. Strict-sense long-distance dispersal involves movement both outside the stand geographic limits and outside the genetic neighbourhood area of individuals. Combinations of propagule movements within/outside these two spatial reference frames result in four distinct modes of LDD.
   4. Synthesis. I expect truncation of seed dispersal kernels to have multiple consequences on demography and genetics, following to the loss of key dispersal services in natural populations. Irrespective of neighbourhood sizes, loss of LDD events may result in more structured and less cohesive genetic pools, with increased isolation by distance extending over broader areas. Proper characterization of the LDD events helps to assess, for example, how the ongoing defaunation of large-bodied frugivores pervasively entails the loss of crucial LDD functions.

ID PROSPECT-THEORY; CHOICE
AB Animals; are predominantly risk prone toward reward delays and risk averse toward reward amounts. Humans in turn tend to be risk-seeking for losses and risk averse for gains. To explain the human results, Prospect Theory postulates a convex utility for losses and concave utility for gains. In contrast, Scalar Utility Theory (SUT) explains the animal data by postulating that the cognitive representation of outcomes follows Weber's Law, namely that the spread of the distribution of expected outcomes is proportional to its mean. SLIT also would explain human results if utility (even if it is linear on expected outcome) followed Weber's Law, We present an experiment that simulates losses and gains in a bird, the European Starling, to test the implication of SLIT that risk proneness/aversion should extend to any aversive/desirable dimension other than time and amount of reward. Losses and gains were simulated by offering choices of fixed vs. variable outcomes with lower or higher outcomes than what the birds expected. The subjects were significantly more risk prone for losses than for gains but, against expectations, they were not significantly risk averse toward gains. The results are thus, in part, consistent with Prospect Theory and SUIT and show that risk attitude in humans and birds may obey a common fundamental principle.

AB Recreational and other human activities degrade coral reefs worldwide to a point where efficient restoration techniques are needed. Here we tested several strategies for gardening denuded reefs. The gardening concept consists of in situ or ex situ mariculture of coral recruits, followed by their transplantation into degraded reef sites. In situ nurseries were established in Eilat's (Northern Red Sea) shallow waters, sheltering three types of coral materials taken from the branching species Stylophora pistillata (small colonies, branch fragments, and spat) that were monitored for up to two years. Pruning more than 10% of donor colonies' branches increased mortality, and surviving colonies displayed reduced reproductive activity. Maricultured isolated branches, however, exceeded donor colony life span and reproductive activity and added 0.5-45% skeletal mass per year. Forty-four percent of the small colonies survived after 1.5-year mariculture, revealing average yearly growth of 75 +/- 32%. Three months ex situ maintenance of coral spat (sexual recruits) prior to the in situ nursery phase increased survivorship. Within the next 1.5 years, they developed into colonies of 3-4 cm diameter. Nursery periods of 2 years, 45 years, and more than >5 years have been estimated for small colonies, spat, and isolated branches, respectively. These and other results, including the possible use of nubbins (minute fragments the size of a single or few polyps), are discussed, revealing benefits and drawbacks for each material. In situ coral mariculture is an improved practice to the common but potentially harmful protocol of direct coral transplantation. It is suggested that reef gardening may be used as a key management tool in conservation and restoration of denuded reef areas. The gardening concept may be applicable for coral reefs worldwide through site-specific considerations and the use of different local coral species.

AB Meta-analysis is a method ecologists may find useful for quantitatively reviewing and systematically examining results from a large number of studies on a subject for which there is conflicting evidence. I used meta-analysis to integrate results from 42 independent brood-enlargement studies and tested Lack's hypothesis that clutch size in birds has evolved toward that which produces the most surviving offspring. Cumulative evidence did not support Lack's hypothesis. Significantly (two-tailed P = .016) more fledglings were produced in enlarged broods than in normal-sized broods, indicating parents could raise more young than they had eggs. The standardized treatment effect of brood enlargement across all studies was a mean (+/-1 SE) increase of 0.55 (+/-0.22) standard deviations in the number of young produced. This result does not appear to bc affected by a publishing bias and is unlikely to be reversed by inclusion of additional studies. I also examined differences in methodology and species studied as possible confounding factors and explanations for conflicting results. Longer studies and species with altricial young were more likely to show food limitation. Latitude and date of study, degree of brood enlargement, validity of a study, and annual adult survival did not affect results.

AB Vegetation gap patterns in arid grasslands, such as the "fairy circles" of Namibia, are one of nature's greatest mysteries and subject to a lively debate on their origin. They are characterized by small-scale hexagonal ordering of circular bare-soil gaps that persists uniformly in the landscape scale to form a homogeneous distribution. Pattern-formation theory predicts that such highly ordered gap patterns should be found also in other water-limited systems across the globe, even if the mechanisms of their formation are different. Here we report that so far unknown fairy circles with the same spatial structure exist 10,000 km away from Namibia in the remote outback of Australia. Combining fieldwork, remote sensing, spatial pattern analysis, and process-based mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that these patterns emerge by self-organization, with no correlation with termite activity; the driving mechanism is a positive biomass-water feedback associated with water runoff and biomass-dependent infiltration rates. The remarkable match between the patterns of Australian and Namibian fairy circles and model results indicate that both patterns emerge from a nonuniform stationary instability, supporting a central universality principle of pattern-formation theory. Applied to the context of dryland vegetation, this principle predicts that different systems that go through the same instability type will show similar vegetation patterns even if the feedback mechanisms and resulting soil-water distributions are different, as we indeed found by comparing the Australian and the Namibian fairy-circle ecosystems. These results suggest that biomass-water feedbacks and resultant vegetation gap patterns are likely more common in remote drylands than is currently known.

AB We studied the response of the small mammal community ( rodents and shrews) to recent changes in agricultural systems of western French landscapes. Work was conducted on twelve sites representative of the diversity of farming systems in this region. The characteristics of small mammal assemblages in each site were assessed using Barn Owl (Tyto alba) pellet analysis. Relationships between small mammal data and landscape descriptors were performed through co-inertia analysis. Richness and specific composition of the small mammal community were not affected by the degree of cultivation but variations in species frequency could be observed. The prevalence of some species allowed us to distinguish threemain assemblages which were characteristic of low, medium, and high intensified landscapes. Status and life traits of these species showed that intensification of agriculture has negative effects on density of rare and habitat-specialist species while it favours habitat-generalist species, some of them being known to exhibit fluctuating density. The two main ways of agricultural intensification ( maize vs. other crops) did not show any significant relationships with species assemblages. Our results gave us the opportunity to suggest recommendations on agronomical and conservation problems that may arise from these changes of agriculture in western France.

AB It would be much easier to assess the effectiveness of different reintroduction methods, and so improve the success of reintroductions, if there was greater standardization in documentation of the methods and outcomes. We suggest a series of standards for documenting and monitoring the methods and outcomes associated with reintroduction projects for birds. Key suggestions are: documenting the planned release before it occurs, specifying the information required on each release, postrelease monitoring occurring at standard intervals of 1 and 5 years (and 10 for long-lived species), carrying out a population estimate unless impractical, distinguishing restocked and existing individuals when supplementing populations, and documenting the results. We suggest these principles would apply, largely unchanged, to other vertebrate classes. Similar methods could be adopted for invertebrates and plants with appropriate modification. We suggest that organizations publically state whether they will adopt these approaches when undertaking reintroductions. Similar standardization would be beneficial for a wide range of topics in environmental monitoring, ecological studies, and practical conservation.

ID EVOLUTION
AB In the southern part of Portugal, in the Alentejo region, land-use is dominated by an agro-silvo-pastoral system, the Montado, corresponding to specific cultural landscapes with high biological, scenic and recreational value. During recent decades, a combination of factors has led this system to change through intensification, extensification and land abandonment,. A new landscape mosaic is evolving on a regional scale, but it is still uncertain to what extent large patches of productive and open Montado will be maintained. Within the accompanying measures of the Common Agricultural Policy, part of the Portuguese agri-environmental support aims at preserving the traditional land-use systems and their resulting landscapes. The Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture is aware of the value of these landscapes and of the need to protect them, and greater support possibilities will be considered in the new agri-environmental package, within Agenda 2000. Although various groups are willing to preserve these landscapes, the measures implemented so far are unco-ordinated and do not assure landscape preservation in the long term. The solution may lie in the use of a holistic approach to consider and integrate the various aspects of these rural landscapes, together with the most effective use of the existing support.

AB Even during the current biodiversity crisis, reports on population collapses of highly abundant, non-harvested marine species were rare until very recently. This is starting to change, especially at the warm edge of species' distributions where populations are more vulnerable to stress. The Levant basin is the southeastern edge of distribution of most Mediterranean species. Coastal water conditions are naturally extreme, and are fast warming, making it a potential hotspot for species collapses. Using multiple data sources, I found strong evidence for major, sustained, population collapses of two urchins, one large predatory gastropod and a reef-building gastropod. Furthermore, of 59 molluscan species once-described in the taxonomic literature as common on Levant reefs, 38 were not found in the present-day surveys, and there was a total domination of non-indigenous species in molluscan assemblages. Temperature trends indicate an exceptional warming of the coastal waters in the past three decades. Though speculative at this stage, the fast rise in SST may have helped pushing these invertebrates beyond their physiological tolerance limits leading to population collapses and possible extirpations. If so, these collapses may indicate the initiation of a multi-species range contraction at the Mediterranean southeastern edge that may spread westward with additional warming.

   VIEWPOINT; RHODESIA; ECOLOGY; SAHEL; FIRE
AB There is an urgent need to develop a mechanistic understanding of how site-specific properties can lead to irreversible vegetation changes. We show, by means of a bifurcation analysis of two mathematical models, how site-specific properties determine the resilience of vegetation changes in semi-arid grazing systems. The models predict that if available soil water limits plant growth, the vegetation supported by sandy soils is generally resilient to herbivore impact and rainfall fluctuations, unlike the vegetation on clayey soils. This depends on the capacity of vegetation communities to improve the structural and water-holding capacities of the soil. In contrast, if plant growth is nutrient limited, vegetation on sandy soils is generally not resilient to herbivore impact and fluctuations in external nutrient input, unlike the vegetation supported by clayey soils. This is affected by the nutrient retention capacity of vegetation communities. We stress the applicability of the general theory provided by this model to the Sahel environment. The model predictions are consistent with field observations documented in the literature.

AB When more pollinator visits are required to remove pollen than are required to fertilize all of the ovules, male-functioning plants are expected under theory to allocate more resources to secondary floral structures and products. We found that for the gynodioecious shrub, Hebe stricta, there were no differences between the perfect-flowered ("male") morph and the male-sterile ("female") morph in many important aspects of their displays (number of flowering shoots, number of flowers per inflorescence, timing of floral opening, size of corolla), but the flowers on the male morph had significantly larger anthers that extended a greater distance out of the floral tube. Flowers on males produced over four times as much nectar, but the standing crop of nectar did not differ between the two sexual morphs in nature. Overall, pollinators preferred to visit flowers on male plants, but different species of pollinators responded differently to the two plant morphs. Finally, a pollen-addition experiment demonstrated that fruit set on the females was not significantly limited by pollen; hence, the fewer visits by pollinators to this morph seems sufficient to insure maximal fruit set given the resources available (satisfying Bateman's principle). We suggest that the greater number of visits to males is in response to their pollen production and to their greater nectar production, but that an ideal free distribution is set up in nature, which insures a sufficient number of visits to the females. These results, in combination with data on nectar production of cosexual and gynodioecious species drawn from the literature, support the conclusion that fitness through male function is enhanced by allocating more resources to attract pollinators than is needed for maximal fitness through female function.

AB We studied the pollination of Orchis boryi at five different locations on the Greek mainland. Orchis boryi is food deceptive and obligatorily insect pollinated. Primary pollinators were Apis mellifera and Bombus spp., which foraged on rewarding plant species nearby and visited O. boryi in between. To analyse floral colour similarity among rewarding plants and O. boryi as perceived by bees, a model of bee colour vision was employed. For each food plant an index was calculated that described the probability of a bee foraging on it to subsequently choose an orchid newer. This choice probability correlated to colour distance according to the model of bee colour vision, indicating that bees chose the deceptive orchid more frequently if they foraged on more similarly coloured species. At different sites different plant species served as models. Bees foraging on food plants from which a high choice rate to the orchid was observed visited the orchid less often after approaching it than other bees, which is likely to reflect avoidance learning. In general, the pollination syndrome appears to be a generalized form of Batesian mimicry, in which similarity to rewarding plants determines reproductive success. As expected by negative density-dependent selection, individual fruit set and pollinia export rate correlated negatively with orchid density, but were unaffected by food plant density, orchid frequency, individual variation of labellum colour, labellum size, or mouth width of the flowers.

AB Variation in skull size was investigated for three species of rats (kiore - Rattus exulans Peale; ship rat - R. rattus L.; Norway rat - R. norvegicus Berkenhout) which were introduced by humans to various islands in New Zealand and other Pacific islands. Data from seventy-one islands and 882 specimens are examined fur evidence of the effects of latitude, island size and interspecific competition among rats and the house mouse (Mus musculus L.) on skull size, using multiple regressions. For R. exulans, skull size increases with latitude as predicted by Bergmann's rule, but no such effect occurs for the other two rats. There was a positive relationship between island size and the number of species inhabiting it, and some species combinations were more likely to occur than others. For example, R. exulans and R. norvegicus were more likely to occur together, while R. rattus and R. exulans were rarely sympatric. R. exulans and R. rattus skull size was negatively correlated with the number of other rodents on the same island. Ii. exulans skull size increased on smaller islands in some island groups, perhaps because increased density and consequent increased intraspecific competition on smaller islands favours increased body size. This effect is more pronounced in tropical islands (Solomon islands), than in subtropical ones (Hawaiian islands) and less so in temperate New Zealand. Collectively the data demonstrate that rapid evolution of body size in predictable directions can follow within 150 years of the introduction of species to new receiving communities.

AB Predation risk can inflict profound effects on prey by influencing prey behavior and other traits. Prey are often subjected to a diversity of predators, which can exert differential predation pressures on prey life-history strategies. In birds, breeding adults and offspring (as eggs, nestlings, and fledglings) are susceptible to different types of predators, and life-history theory predicts that breeding birds can adjust to adult versus offspring predation risk differentially via allocation of breeding investment. Here, we experimentally tested for the effects of perceived adult versus offspring predation risk on breeding birds' reproductive strategy and performance. On study plots with nest boxes used by the cavity-nesting Eastern bluebird Sialia sialis, we manipulated vocal cues of 3 avian predators that preferentially prey on either bluebird adults, or offspring, or both. We found that 1) increased perception of predation risk by all predator treatments reduced bluebird parental investment in egg production and/or post-egg nesting performance, and 2) increased perception of adult and offspring predation risks affected bluebirds differentially, with bluebirds exhibiting shorter nestling rearing periods under offspring, but not adult, predation risk. Our results provide experimental evidence for the nonconsumptive effects of predation risk on avian breeding behavior that can influence demographic vital rates and highlight the mechanisms by which breeding birds can adjust reproductive strategies under different predation risk situations.

AB A major oil spill (8,000,000 liters; 50,000 barrels) occurred in Bahia Las Minas on the Caribbean coast of Panama in April 1986, and oil slicks from the refinery landfill and mangroves were still common there after 2 1/2 years.  We studied short-term effects of the spill on common shallow subtidal reef corals, at the individual, population, and community levels.  Numbers of corals, total coral cover, and species diversity based on cover decreased significantly with increased amounts of oiling.  Cover of the large branching coral Acropora palmata decreased most.  Frequency and size of recent injuries on massive corals increased with level of oiling, particularly for Siderastrea siderea.  Growth of three massive species (Porites astreoides, Diploria strigosa, and Montastrea annularis, but not S. siderea) was less at oiled reefs in the year of the spill than during the 9 previous years.  Subtidal coral reefs, particularly those along protected coasts, may suffer extensive damage from chronic exposure after major oil spills.

AB A collation of post-embryonic durations for freshwater and marine calanoid, cyclopoid and harpacticoid copepods is provided, and examined for patterns and conformities which may be of predictive value.  Most of the analysis concerns calanoids.  Only the genus Acartia exhibits evidence of equal stage duration (isochronality).  Accordingly, isochronal development must be rejected as a general pattern in copepods - with various implications to the study of their production.  Conversely, relative stage durations are surprisingly comparable in a wide range of copepods across a broad range of temperatures and food levels.  A loose consistency is evident among copepod species generally, (interspecific equiproportionality), but within given genera, a striking regularity, here termed intergeneric equiproportionality (IGE) is evident.
   Patterns of IGE are consistent with selectively adaptive life-history traits, and IGE thus offers predictive prospects which are of both quantitative and qualitative (heuristic) value.  Empirical support which exists for IGE among marine calanoids suggests that in contrast to isochronality and interspecific equiproportionality, IGE is indeed a real, and ultimately quantifiable feature of copepod development.
   Within calanoids, the ratio of total copepodid to total naupliar duration (Dc/Dn) appears independent of temperature, shows little relationship to adult body mass, but is inversely related to food supply, markedly so in freshwater forms.  In this context, changes in the ratio are attributable largely to influences of food supply upon copepodid development times:  naupliar durations appear relatively independent of food concentrations during development.  Considerably higher Dc/Dn ratios in freshwater than in marine calanoids conceivably arise from selective influences of different nutritional conditions and size-selective predation pressures in freshwater and marine environment.  In the generally high predation environment of freshwaters, acceleration of naupliar development potentially reduces the vulnerability of these smaller stages to size-selective tactile predation, while larger copepodid instars are able to reduce the opposing size-selective influences of visual planktivores by virtue of their escape responses to suction attack.  Within the spectrum of copepod life histories and development schedules, ecologically consistent trends of this nature await formal recognition.  The present recognition of IGE is a modest initiative in this quest.
   Both naupliar and copepodid durations are inverse monotonic functions of temperature.  Several mathematical expressions which account for this temperature-duration response are provided.  The response envelope is much tighter for naupliar than copepodid durations.  Predictability of temperature-duration responses accordingly declines ontogenetically from egg to naupliar to copepodid stages.

AB Frugivorous birds provide important ecosystem services by transporting seeds of fleshy fruited plants. It has been assumed that seed-dispersal kernels generated by these animals are generally leptokurtic, resulting in little dispersal among habitat fragments. However, little is known about the seed-dispersal distribution generated by large frugivorous birds in fragmented landscapes. We investigated movement and seed-dispersal patterns of trumpeter hornbills (Bycanistes bucinator) in a fragmented landscape in South Africa. Novel GPS loggers provide high-quality location data without bias against recording long-distance movements. We found a very weakly bimodal seed-dispersal distribution with potential dispersal distances up to 14.5 km. Within forest, the seed-dispersal distribution was unimodal with an expected dispersal distance of 86 m. In the fragmented agricultural landscape, the distribution was strongly bimodal with peaks at 18 and 512 m. Our results demonstrate that seed-dispersal distributions differed when birds moved in different habitat types. Seed-dispersal distances in fragmented landscapes show that transport among habitat patches is more frequent than previously assumed, allowing plants to disperse among habitat patches and to track the changing climatic conditions.

AB Most carbonate rocky shores of NW Sicily are marked by a coalescence of shells of the gastropod Dendropoma in a construction that is variably developed as a response to wave impact. Here, we review all the available information on these constructions and find that the fossil reefs are reliable sea-level indicators. The thickness of the reef samples never exceeds 30-40 cm below sea-level, whereas all C-14 dates fall within a range of few centuries. Some small fragments ejected by violent sea storms date back to 2500 years cal BP. No samples older than 6200 years cal BP have been detected so far. The present distribution of Mediterranean vermetid platforms should result from a northward migration related to the long term effect of the Holocene sea surface temperature (SST) warming. Some consideration on the morphology of the reefs and the comparison with the available data point out that Dendropoma reefs are excellent biological indicators of sea-level fluctuations especially when detected and sampled in tectonically stable areas as those in NW Sicily.

AB Fire and herbivory are the two consumers of above-ground biomass globally. They have contrasting impacts as they differ in terms of selectivity and temporal occurrence. Here, we integrate continental-scale data on fire and herbivory in Africa to explore (i) how environmental drivers constrain these two consumers and (ii) the degree to which each consumer affects the other. Environments conducive to mammalian herbivory are not necessarily the same as those conducive to fire, although their spheres of influence do overlap-especially in grassy ecosystems which are known for their frequent fires and abundance of large mammalian herbivores. Interactions between fire and herbivory can be competitive, facultative or antagonistic, and we explore this with reference to the potential for alternative ecosystem states. Although fire removes orders of magnitude more biomass than herbivory their methane emissions are very similar, and in the past, herbivores probably emitted more methane than fire. We contrast the type of herbivory and fire in different ecosystems to define 'consumer-realms'.

AB Soil is composed of a mosaic of different rocks and minerals, usually considered as an inert substrata for microbial colonization. However, recent findings suggest that minerals, in soils and elsewhere, favour the development of specific microbial communities according to their mineralogy, nutritive content, and weatherability. Based upon recent studies, we highlight how bacterial communities are distributed on the surface of, and in close proximity to, minerals. We also consider the potential role of the mineral-associated bacterial communities in mineral weathering and nutrient cycling in soils, with a specific focus on nutrient-poor and acidic forest ecosystems. We propose to define this microbial habitat as the mineralosphere, where key drivers of the microbial communities are the physicochemical properties of the minerals.

AB Reintroduction of beaver (Castor spp) may facilitate rehabilitation of freshwater habitats providing a cost-effective sustainable means of improving ecological conditions. Despite extensive research, debate and consultation, a general consensus on the impact of beaver on fishes has proven elusive because of variability in biological response. This paper provides a systematic review of the impacts of beaver dams on fishes and fish habitat based on a meta-analysis of the literature and expert opinion. Research is regionally biased to North America (88%). The most frequently cited benefits of beaver dams were increased habitat heterogeneity, rearing and overwintering habitat and flow refuge, and invertebrate production. Impeded fish movement because of dams, siltation of spawning habitat and low oxygen levels in ponds were the most often cited negative impacts. Benefits (184) were cited more frequently than costs (119). Impacts were spatially and temporally variable and differed with species. The majority of 49 North American and European experts considered beaver to have an overall positive impact on fish populations, through their influence on abundance and productivity. Perceived negative effects related to the movement of aquatic organisms in tributary streams, including upstream and downstream migrating salmonids, and the availability of suitable spawning habitat.

AB The efficacy of communication relies on detection of species-specific signals against the background noise. Features affecting signal detection are thus expected to evolve under selective pressures represented by masking noise. Spectral partitioning between the auditory signals of co-occurring species has been interpreted as the outcome of the selective effects of masking interference. However, masking interference depends not only on signal's frequency but on receiver's range of frequency sensitivity; moreover, selection on signal frequency can be confounded by selection on body size, because these traits are often correlated. To know whether geographic variation in communication traits agrees with predictions about masking interference effects, we tested the hypothesis that variation in the male-male communication system of the Amazonian frog, Allobates femoralis, is correlated with the occurrence of a single species calling within an overlapping frequency range, Epipedobates trivittatus. We studied frogs at eight sites, four where both species co-occur and four where A. femoralis occurs but E. trivittatus does not. To study the sender component of the communication system of A. femoralis and to describe the use of the spectral range, we analyzed the signal's spectral features of all coactive species at each site. To study the receiver component, we derived frequency-response curves from playback experiments conducted on territorial males of A. femoralis under natural conditions. Most geographic variation in studied traits was correlated with either call frequency or with response frequency range. The occurrence of E. trivittatus significantly predicted narrower and asymmetric frequency-response curves in A. femoralis, without concomitant differences in the call or in body size. The number of acoustically coactive species did not significantly predict variation in any of the studied traits. Our results strongly support that the receiver but not the sender component of the communication system changed due to masking interference by a single species.

AB Predictions of the effects of climate change on the extent of forests, savannas and deserts are usually based on simple response models derived from actual vegetation distributions. In this review, we show two major problems with the implicitly assumed straightforward cause-effect relationship. Firstly, several studies suggest that vegetation itself may have considerable effects on regional climate implying a positive feedback, which can potentially lead to large-scale hysteresis. Secondly, vegetation ecologists have found that effects of plants on microclimate and soils can cause a microscale positive feedback, implying that critical precipitation conditions for colonization of a site may differ from those for disappearance from that site. We argue that it is important to integrate these nonlinearities at disparate scales in models to produce more realistic predictions of potential effects of climate change and deforestation.

AB Clutch-size determination in the Common Eider (Somateria mollissima) was evaluated in a colony in northern Norway. Females in good body condition (determined from mass at hatching) produced large clutches and had a shorter incubation period than females with small body reserves. Females in good body condition cared for young (including adoption of the young of other females), while females in poor body condition abandoned their young soon after hatching. Repeatability (an upper limit to heritability) of clutch size, which for individual females varies from three to six eggs, does not differ significantly from zero. A hypothesis is proposed, suggesting that there is a trade-off involved in allocating body reserves to eggs, incubation, and care of chicks and that females use a particular clutch-size strategy related to their body condition and ability to care for young.

AB In this study, PM10-bound concentrations of 28 trace metals and 3 ionic components were measured from samples collected at Daejeon Industrial Complexes I and II, Korea from April 2000 to December 2002. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) and conditional probability function (CPF) were applied to these PM data sets to identify the diverse sources in the industrial area. A total of nine source types were identified to be important which include: secondary aerosol, cement/construction, soil dust, road dust, vehicle exhaust, incineration/Pb-related industry, metal smelting, fossil fuel combustion, and field burning. Results of our study suggest that there are competing relationships between anthropogenic and natural source processes in this industrial area. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The placenta is a complex organ that mediates all physiological and endocrine interactions between mother and developing embryos. Placentas have evolved throughout the animal kingdom, but little is known about how or why the placenta evolved. We review hypotheses about the evolution of placentation and examine empirical evidence in support for these hypotheses by drawing on insights from the fish family Poeciliidae. The placenta evolved multiple times within this family, and there is a remarkable diversity in its form and function among closely related species, thus providing us with ideal material for studying its evolution. Cut-rent hypotheses fall into two categories: adaptive hypotheses, which propose that the placenta evolved as an adaptation to environmental pressures, and conflict hypotheses, which posit that the placenta evolved as a result of antagonistic coevolution. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Each may have played a role at different stages of the evolutionary process.

AB Modular organisms consist of repeated building blocks. An important consequence of modularity may be reflected in the ability of a colony to continually reallocate priority of resource transport among its units in response to stress. Hermatypic corals, the main organisms constructing tropical reefs, are prone to damage by a multitude of agents. Since colonization of lesions by competitors is a potent threat to colonial organisms, fast recovery is an important component of colony survival. Previous regeneration studies have claimed that the energy requirements of this essential process are fueled only by the polyps directly bordering the injured area. This "localized regeneration hypothesis" rejects the necessity for wide colony integration during regeneration and sees no advantage to large colony size. The objective of the present study was to test an alternative regeneration hypothesis that argues, in contrast, that injury repair (i.e., closure of lesions by newly formed tissues) in corals may require extended colony integration (i.e., internal translocation of resources from sites of acquisition to sites of maximal demand). To test our hypothesis we examined: (1) the relationship between colony size and percentage recovery of lesions differing in size and shape; and (2) the effect of different sized lesions on the fecundity of polyps located at increasing distances from the lesion site. Both experiments were conducted on the common, spherically shaped coral Favia favus in the Red Sea near Eilat, Israel. The relatively small lesions (<1 cm(2)) were the only ones to support the localized regeneration hypothesis, since their recovery was unaffected by colony size. However, the two larger lesion types (approximate sizes of 2 cm(2) and 3 cm(2)) confirmed the importance of large colony size for achieving fast recovery. In the second experiment we found that small lesions, repeated monthly, caused only a localized reduction in fecundity, while larger monthly repeated lesions caused significant reductions in fecundity up to a distance of 15 cm away from their site. Both experiments indicate that regeneration from injury may require an extended magnitude of energy integration throughout the colony, and that the extent of this integration is regulated by the colony in accordance with lesion characteristics. It is also concluded that in long-lived organisms such as corals, there is a priority of energy allocation to recovery rather than to reproduction. Our findings reveal the existence of injury thresholds within a colony that determine energy allocation and intra-colonial translocation of energy products toward regions of maximal demand. We suggest that such injury thresholds may characterize many other coral species and that colony integration during stress is a basic life-preserving ability and one of the most important advantages of clonal and colonial organisms.

AB Ecological theory of alternative stable communities suggests the switch between different species assemblages occurs when environmental conditions alter species composition so that it crosses a critical threshold and enters a different basin of attraction. The theory implies that once the threshold is crossed, rates of key ecological processes, such as predation and competition, will change. This conjecture was tested on sheltered intertidal shores of New England that are dominated by either mussel (Mytilus edulis) beds or algal (Ascophyllum nodosum) stands. Twelve sets of clearings of different sizes, which mimicked effects of ice scour, were created in algal stands, and mortality of transplanted mussels was monitored. Clearings were 1, 2, 4 and 8 m in diameter. Mussel mortality due to the predatory snail Nucella lapillus declined in a step-like manner in clearings greater than or equal to 4 m in diameter. Initial densities of the predator did not vary among experimental clearings or sites and were not correlated with mussel mortality. Mussel mortality was correlated with predatory snail densities during and at the end of the experiment. These results provide experimental evidence supporting conjectures about the switch between alternative states in ecological communities.

AB Spatially periodic patterns can be observed in a variety of ecosystems. Model studies revealed that patterned ecosystems may respond in a nonlinear way to environmental change, meaning that gradual changes result in rapid degradation. We analyze this response through stability analysis of patterned states of an arid ecosystem model. This analysis goes one step further than the frequently applied Turing analysis, which only considers stability of uniform states. We found that patterned arid ecosystems systematically respond in two ways to changes in rainfall: (1) by changing vegetation patch biomass or (2) by adapting pattern wavelength. Minor adaptations of pattern wavelength are constrained to conditions of slow change within a high rainfall regime, and high levels of stochastic variation in biomass (noise). Major changes in pattern wavelength occur under conditions of either low rainfall, rapid change or low levels of noise. Such conditions facilitate strong interactions between vegetation patches, which can trigger a sudden loss of half the patches or a transition to a degraded bare state. These results highlight that ecosystem responses may critically depend on rates, rather than magnitudes, of environmental change. Our study shows how models can increase our understanding of these dynamics, provided that analyses go beyond the conventional Turing analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reintroductions and translocations are increasingly used as conservation tools. However, despite guidelines recommending that health-screening be an integral part of such programmes, few reports are available. For most species, even baseline data, against which to compare future results, are not published. Here we report two case studies of health surveillance in wildlife reintroduction programmes - for water voles (Arvicola terrestris) in the UK, and for marsupial dibblers (Parantechinus apicalis) in Australia. These illustrate the potential importance of even basic screening strategies in helping to avoid disease transfer and identifying predictors of survival. Factors to be considered in the design of future monitoring schemes are also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nectar and pollen within flowers are usually the primary attractants to floral visitors. Chemical analysis of almond nectar and pollen in this study revealed that they contain the secondary compound amygdalin. Floral display often reflects pollinator characters, and almond flowers are accordingly designated as "bee flowers". A previous study in Israel showed that when almonds bloom early in the season they attract honeybees, but later in the season the bees shift toward other species that start blooming. In this study, we offered honeybees sugar solutions containing various concentrations of amygdalin. These preference experiments revealed that in mid-summer bees were not selective, whereas early in the summer they were more discriminating, and consumed faster the sugar solutions with the lower amygdalin concentrations. Possible roles of amygdalin in almond nectar and pollen are discussed.

AB The construction of an ecological security pattern (ESP) is an effective measure to improve the structure and function of ecosystems, maintain ecosystem services, and ensure ecological security. Our focus is the hilly and gully region of the Loess Plateau in China, a typical county area where the extensive use of land has put tremendous pressure on the ecosystem and caused a series of ecological problems. Therefore, considering different targets for decision makers, we introduced hot spot analysis method to construct two plans of ESP based on local conditions and the proposed long-term optimization strategy of ESP. The results showed that the ecological source areas of plans A and B accounted for 31.47% and 43.26% of the ecological land, respectively, covering the core areas of most nature reserves, effectively validating the accuracy and feasibility of our method. Additionally, the total area of the optimized ecological source was 8.91% higher than that of the existing area, which expands the radiation range of ecological sources and enhances the internal connectivity. In order to form a regional functionalized and structured spatial structure layout system, the ecological framework of "two axes, four cores, six belts, and eight zones" was proposed according to the spatial distribution of the river corridors and important ecological landscape components. Overall, this study adds new insight into the methodology of ESP construction that can provide important references for regional development planning and ecological protection.

AB Variation in nectar chemistry among plants, flowers, or individual nectaries of a given species has been only rarely explored, yet it is an essential aspect to our understanding of how pollinator-mediated selection might act on nectar traits. This paper describes variation in nectar Sugar composition in a population of the perennial herb Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae) and dissects it into components due to variation among plants, flowers of the same plant, and nectaries of the same flower. The proportions of sucrose, glucose, and fructose in single-nectary nectar samples collected at two times in the flowering season were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Sugar composition varied extensively among nectaries, and nearly all combinations of individual sugars were recorded. Population-wide variance was mainly accounted for by variation among flowers of the same plant (56% of total), nectaries of the same flower (30%), and only minimally by differences among plants (14%). In absolute terms, intraplant variation was similar to or greater than that ordinarily reported in interspecific comparisons. Results suggest that the prevailing notion of intraspecific constancy in nectar sugar composition may be unwarranted for some species and that more elaborate nectar sampling designs are required to detect and appropriately account for extensive within-plant variance. Within-plant variation in nectar sugar composition will limit the ability of pollinators to exert selection on nectar chemistry in H. foetidus and may be advantageous to plants by reducing the number of flowers visited per foraging bout by variance-sensitive, risk-averse pollinators.

AB Consideration of optimal patch use by animals that may face danger from predators and that allocate time among several activities is an extension of the marginal value theorem (Brown 1988). According to the theorem, an animal should leave a food patch when its harvest rate of food equals the sum of its energetic and predation costs arising from foraging and its missed opportunity costs arising from foregoing other activities. A technique derived from this theory involves presenting foragers with depletable food patches and measuring food density remaining after foraging. The food density remaining is a measurement of an animal's foraging efficiency and can be used to measure various foraging inputs. We applied the technique to Nubian ibex (Capra ibex) to obtain information on patch use, food preference, and functional response to food density. We used results to infer the effect of ibex on forage plants and the consequences of predatory risk. We found that (1) ibex tended to consume food from patches until the food occurred at similar densities across patches, (2) the technique can be used to determine food preference, (3) patch use by ibex led to indirect effects on competitive relationships between food plant species (short-term apparent competition), (4) ibex foraging effort changed with resource density, and (5) predatory risk affected patch use by ibex.

AB Ecohydrological feedbacks are likely to be critical for understanding the mechanisms by which changes in exogenous forces result in ecosystem state change. We propose that in drylands, the dynamics of ecosystem state change are determined by changes in the type (stabilizing vs amplifying) and strength of ecohydrological feedbacks following a change in exogenous forces. Using a selection of five case studies from drylands, we explore the characteristics of ecohydrological feedbacks and resulting dynamics of ecosystem state change. We surmise that stabilizing feedbacks are critical for the provision of plant-essential resources in drylands. Exogenous forces that break these stabilizing feedbacks can alter the state of the system, although such changes are potentially reversible if strong amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks do not develop. The case studies indicate that if amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks do develop, they are typically associated with abiotic processes such as runoff, erosion (by wind and water), and fire. These amplifying ecohydrological feedbacks progressively modify the system in ways that are long-lasting and possibly irreversible on human timescales. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This study presents data on seasonal changes of the phytoplanktonic community of a small tropical lake, Lagoa Santa, in the Brazilian cerrado. Temporal variation in the community structure was small and we observed a permanent dominance of the cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. This dominance could be associated to the stability of several environmental conditions. Especially water temperature, always within the optimal growth range for C. raciborskii, and the constant mixed water column may have been important factors driving to the long term dominance of this species in the lake. Remarkable seasonal variation in rainfall, as well as the occasional and non-seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations, were important to explain changes in environmental and biological variables, but were not related to the dominance of C raciborskii. Pearson's correlation and PCA could just in part explain the stable dominance of this cyanobacterium. Meteorological and chemical factors seem to have no clear control on the variability of the phytoplankton dynamics in Lagoa Santa. The weak relationship between C. raciborskii abundance and environmental variables points to additional intrinsic factors associated to this species that may be important in structuring the phytoplankton assemblage.

AB This study examines whether post-dispersal seed predators could be an important selective force in determining the seed bank strategies of grassland plants. It tests the hypothesis that species with persistent seed banks should sustain proportionally less predation of buried seeds than species which have transient seed banks and that this should be true irrespective of seed size. Results are drawn from a field experiment examining the relative susceptibility of surface versus buried seeds for 19 herbaceous taxa exhibiting different degrees of seed bank persistence. The data were consistent with the hypothesis that seed predators (rodents) influence the seed bank characteristics of seeds. Rodents removed proportionally more large seeds than small seeds and removed a smaller proportion of seeds with persistent rather than transient seed banks, independently of seed size. On average, burial reduced seed removal by almost 50%. The decrease in rates of seed removal following burial was marked for seeds with persistent seed banks but negligible for seeds with transient seed banks. Herbaceous plants with relatively large seeds (seed mass > 1 mg) that form persistent seed banks were either completely avoided or only consumed in small quantities by rodents. In contrast, large-seeded species with transient seed banks suffer high rates of seed predation. Models of life-history evolution predict tradeoffs between seed dormancy and seed mass since dormancy and seed size are correlated traits that both reduce risk in variable environments and thus will show patterns of negative covariation. This paper presents an alternative explanation for this trade-off based on experimental evidence of a negative relationship between seed bank persistence and predation risk.

ID HERBIVORY
AB There are several well-known mechanisms by which grazing can reduce the subsequent growth rate of plants, and several other well-documented mechanisms by which grazing can enhance plant growth rate. The net effect of single or repeated grazing events on the cumulative growth of plants may thus be zero, negative, or positive, depending on availability of leaf area, meristems, stored nutrients, and soil resources, and on the frequency and intensity of defoliation. Plants are preadapted to compensate, up to a certain point, for losses due to grazing, by virtue of their modular structure and development.
   Reports of ''overcompensation'' to grazing, as one extreme of a wide range of responses observed in natural grasslands, need not be treated with special skepticism; neither are they a solid base for a general theory of evolved grass-grazer mutualism. The question of compensatory growth is of relevance to management of Western rangelands for livestock production, but of relatively little relevance to conservation goals. No region-wide answers can be expected. Any drastic change in grazing intensity in either direction requires evaluation by community-specific and long-term research.

AB To maximize success, reintroduction programs generally select predator-free release areas having high habitat quality. Past studies provide little insight into recovery efforts where multiple, potentially novel, mortality hazards occur. The ability of translocated animals to cope with novel environments can be affected by both pre- and postrelease experiences with habitat and mortality risks. We experimentally released elk (Cervus elaphus) having different background experiences into an area where predators and hunters were prevalent and habitat quality varied. Using a competing risks approach, we predicted the postrelease survival of individuals and their fidelity to release areas as a function of animal source and postrelease encounters with forage resources and areas used by wolves (Canis lupus) or humans. Mortality patterns were consistent with prerelease exposure to mortality risks but not habitat differences among source areas. Wolf predation, poaching, and legal Native hunting were equivalent in magnitude and accounted for the majority of elk mortalities. Familiarity with either wolves or hunters prior to release yielded first-year survival rates 1.9-2.2 times greater than observed for animals naive to both risks. These 2 primary sources of mortality traded off temporally as well as spatially given the proximity of roads, which wolves avoided. The prevalence of forage resources in release areas increased fidelity to release sites but coincided with higher mortality risk during the critical first year, potentially setting an ecological trap for animals naive to local risks. Translocated individuals largely mediated their respective vulnerabilities over time, showing second-year survival rates equivalent to resident elk. In addition to using source populations that are able to adjust to mortality risks in release areas, spatial and temporal variation in mortality risks might be exploited when planning releases to increase the success of translocations into risky landscapes.

AB Sheltered rocky bays in the Gulf of Maine support communities usually dominated either by the fucoid rockweed Ascophyllum nodosum or the mussel Mytilus edulis. In order to test whether clearing size determines the subsequent pattern of recruitment by intertidal organisms, we examined four common species in clearings in stands of A. nodosum. Circular experimental clearings of 1, 2, 4, and 8 m in diameter, which mimicked severe ice scour, and uncleared controls were established at 12 sites spread across four bays. Recruitment of A. nodosum and of three species not common in A. nodosum stands (mussels, barnacles, and the rockweed Fucus vesiculosus) varied with clearing size and the patterns did not vary among bays. Recruitment of A. nodosum declined exponentially with clearing size. Fucus and barnacles recruited in greater densities to large clearings (greater than or equal to4 m) compared to small clearings (<4 m). Recruitment of F. vesiculosus was also site specific, reflecting patterns of local abundance, but that of A. nodosum was not. Mussels recruited onto artificial substrates in fewer numbers in large clearings, but in marginally greater numbers to rock underneath these substrates in large clearings. Recruitment densities of mussels and barnacles were strongly site specific. These results suggest that (1) the rate of succession varies site specifically, and (2) the trajectory of succession, either convergence toward or divergence from the surrounding community, is contingent upon the interplay between species interactions and the size of the clearing.

AB We investigated the relationships among spectral and temporal advertisement-call characteristics and the sizes of the laryngeal and ear components thought to underlie the generation and reception of species-specific vocalizations in male cricket frogs (Acris crepitans). We tested the predictions that the volumes of the structural elements necessary for acoustic communication would be correlated with various parameters of the vocalizations. The anatomy of laryngeal and ear structures was reconstructed from serial sections of the heads of male cricket frogs of two subspecies collected from several sites across the range of this species in Texas, USA, The relationships among the anatomy and call parameters were assessed using several univariate and multivariate analyses, Highly significant univariate correlations among the laryngeal components suggest that the temporal and spectral characteristics of the calls are not independently produced, Dominant frequency correlates strongly with most of the other call and morphological characteristics. Removing body size effects, however, removes the relationship between dominant frequency and the volume of the whole larynx and ear. This is also the case for call pulse rate, indicating that for this species both spectral and temporal call parameters are biomechanically related to laryngeal size which is, in turn, largely mediated by body size. General body size effects might also explain the existence of significant relationships between ear size and temporal characteristics of the call that probably do not have a functional basis.

AB Synthesizing trait observations and knowledge across the Tree of Life remains a grand challenge for biodiversity science. Species traits are widely used in ecological and evolutionary science, and new data and methods have proliferated rapidly. Yet accessing and integrating disparate data sources remains a considerable challenge, slowing progress toward a global synthesis to integrate trait data across organisms. Trait science needs a vision for achieving global integration across all organisms. Here, we outline how the adoption of key Open Science principles-open data, open source and open methods-is transforming trait science, increasing transparency, democratizing access and accelerating global synthesis. To enhance widespread adoption of these principles, we introduce the Open Traits Network (OTN), a global, decentralized community welcoming all researchers and institutions pursuing the collaborative goal of standardizing and integrating trait data across organisms. We demonstrate how adherence to Open Science principles is key to the OTN community and outline five activities that can accelerate the synthesis of trait data across the Tree of Life, thereby facilitating rapid advances to address scientific inquiries and environmental issues. Lessons learned along the path to a global synthesis of trait data will provide a framework for addressing similarly complex data science and informatics challenges.
   A decentralized community is introduced that aims to standardize and integrate species trait data across organismal groups, based on principles of Open Science.

AB Saline habitats cover a wide area of our planet and halophytes (plants growing naturally in saline soils) are increasingly used for human benefits. Beside their genetic and physiological adaptations to salt, complex ecological processes affect the salinity tolerance of halophytes. Hence, prokaryotes and fungi inhabiting roots and leaves can contribute significantly to plant performance. Members of the two prokaryotic domains Bacteria and Archaea, as well as of the fungal kingdom are known to be able to adapt to a range of changes in external osmolarity. Shifts in the microbial community composition with increasing soil salinity have been suggested and research in functional interactions between plants and micro-organisms contributing to salt stress tolerance is gaining interest. Among others, microbial biosynthesis of polymers, exopolysaccharides, phytohormones and phytohormones-degrading enzymes could be involved.

AB Coral records of relative sea level change provide a history of vertical interseismic and coseismic deformation along the coast of northern Simeulue Island, Sumatra, and reveal details about earthquakes in the 10th and 14th-15th centuries A.D. along the southern end of the December 2004 M-w 9.2 Sunda megathrust rupture. Over a 56 year period between A.D. 1390 and 1455, northern Simeulue experienced a cluster of megathrust ruptures, associated with total uplift that was considerably more than in 2004. Uplifted corals at two sites constrain the first event of the cluster to A.D. 1393 +/-3 and 1394 +/- 2 (2 sigma). A smaller but well-substantiated uplift occurred in northern Simeulue in 1430 +/- 3. An inferred third uplift, in A.D. 1450 +/- 3, killed all corals on the reef flats of northern Simeulue. The amount of uplift during this third event, though confirmed only to have exceeded 28 and 41 cm at two sites, probably surpassed the 100 and 44 cm that occurred, respectively, at those sites in 2004, and it was likely more than in 2004 over all of northern Simeulue. The evidence for past earthquake clustering combined with the inference of considerably greater uplift in A.D. 1390-1455 than in 2004 suggests that strain may still be stored along the southernmost part of the 2004 rupture. Interseismic subsidence rates recorded by northern Simeulue coral microatolls have varied by up to a factor of 4 at some sites from one earthquake cycle to another.

AB 1. It was recently shown that body size of Palearctic shrews decreases with increasing latitude, thus contradicting Bergmann's rule, and this trend was explained by food shortage during the cold northern winter. In Alaska, global warming has resulted in milder winters that may improve food supply. In this study we tested the hypothesis that body size of Alaskan shrews increased during the second half of the twentieth century, in response to global warming.
   2. Data on body weight and length of body, tail, hind foot and ear of museum specimens of the masked shrew Sorex cinereus Kerr from Alaska were used in order to examine the effects of latitude, longitude, mean ambient temperature in January and July, and year of collection, on these parameters.
   3. We found that variation in body size of the masked shrew in Alaska appears to contradict to the prediction of Bergmann's rule, decreasing in high latitudes and in areas cold January temperature.
   4. Body size of shrews in Alaska increased significantly during the second half of the twentieth century, apparently due to the higher food availability in winter as a result of improved weather conditions for its prey.

AB This study aimed to identify potential factors responsible for geographically structured morphological variation within the widespread Australian frogs Limnodynastes tasmaniensis Gunther and L. peronii Dumeril & Bibron. There was support for James's rule, and both latitude and present climate explained large amounts of the variation in body size and shape (particularly in L. peronii). There was also some support for the influence of several biogeographical barriers. Finally, both species were sexually dimorphic for body size and the degree of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) varied geographically. Climate was an important explanation for SSD variation in L. peronii, while latitude was most important for L. tasmaniensis. Geographical variations in sexual selection via male-male physical competition and climate-related resources are suggested as potential explanations for SSD variation in L. peronii.

AB Giant ragweed seeds have high nutritional value, consisting of 47% crude protein and 38% crude fat, and may be an important food source for rodent and invertebrate populations in agricultural and early successional ecosystems. We investigated temporal patterns of postdispersal giant ragweed seed predation on the soil surface of a no-tillage cornfield as affected by involucre (seed dispersal unit) size and presence or absence of crop residue. Cage exclusion experiments indicated that rodents and invertebrates were the principal predators of giant ragweed seed, and total predation of involucres over a 12-mo period beginning in November was 88%. Rodents were the greatest predators of giant ragweed involucres during fall and winter, and cumulative predation by February I in treatments with rodent access ranged from 39 to 43%. In contrast, giant ragweed involucre predation by invertebrates occurred mainly from May I to November 1. When rodent access to involucres was prevented, total involucre predation by invertebrates over a 12-mo period ranged from 57 to 78%. Rodents showed an initial preference for large involucres (> 4.8-mm diameter), and invertebrates preferred small involucres (< 4.8-mm diameter). Involucres covered with corn plant residue underwent less predation by rodents from November to February than uncovered involucres, but residue cover had no effect on seed predation by invertebrates. In a laboratory feeding trial, the carabid Harpalus pensylvanicus preferred seed of smooth pigweed and yellow foxtail to giant ragweed seed, suggesting that giant ragweed seed is an incidental rather than a preferred food source for some carabids. Because giant ragweed exhibits relatively low fecundity and short seed bank persistence, results of this study suggest that postdispersal predation may directly reduce giant ragweed recruitment the next year by reducing new seed bank inputs. However, seed losses from predation alone may be insufficient to maintain giant ragweed populations below economic threshold levels in no-tillage cornfields.

AB The influence of ambient temperature on daily activity level was assessed for greater kudus observed in two study areas in South Africa. Active time proportion for adult females and subadults of both sexes was significantly negatively correlated with maximum daily temperature, but uninfluenced directly by cloud cover. However, maximum temperature differences between days accounted for only a quarter of the variability in active time. On most days the overall activity level and hence daily foraging time allocation were somewhat lower than the maximum levels observed for the prevailing temperature conditions. The upper limit to the distribution of active time was lower during the mild dry season than over the hot wet season, probably due to a seasonal change in pelage by kudus. Temperature influences were strongest during the early growing season, when food availability was low and conditions frequently hot. The active and foraging times of kudus during daylight hours appeared to be restricted below the target level only when maximum daily temperature exceeded 36 degrees C in the wet season, and 30 degrees C in the dry season. Only 15% of days exceeded these levels during the respective mid-seasonal periods, suggesting that foraging activity was effectively constrained by thermal tolerance on only about one day in seven. Optimal foraging models that assume thermal stress to be a consistent daily constraint on foraging time may be misleading.

AB This exploratory study suggests that different geological systems (carbonate vs. granitic) in tropical waters have contrasting patterns of photosynthetic nutrient limitation correlated with inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability. Physiological assays for 21 predominant macrophyte species show that inorganic N and P are much less limiting to photosynthesis on granitic islands than is the case on carbonate islands and that, of the two, P is more likely to limit production in carbonate-rich tropical waters. Patterns of nutrient limitation in turn are reflected by differences in the relative dominance of functional groups of sessile, epilithic, photosynthetic organisms. Surveys at 33 sites on 10 islands revealed that nearshore waters on high granitic islands tend to be characterized by large and species-rich standing stocks of frondose macroalgae, often dominated by Sargassum spp., whereas waters around low carbonate islands tend to be dominated by hermatypic corals. Macrophyte tissue and seawater analyses also indicate a possible trend toward higher levels of N and P in granitic vs. carbonate islands. Pagode Island, a low carbonate island influenced by guano from seabird colonies, is an exception, with few corals, relatively high levels of tissue and seawater N and P, and a predominance of macroalgae (mostly Dictyosphaeria cavernosa).

AB R. J. Whittaker et al. recently proposed a 'general dynamic model of oceanic island biogeography' (GDM), providing a general explanation of island biodiversity patterns by relating fundamental biogeographical processes - speciation, immigration, extinction - to area (A) and time (T; maximum island geological age). We adapt their model, which predicts a positive relationship with area combined with a humped relationship to time (designated the ATT(2) model), to study the factors promoting diversification on the Azores for several arthropod groups.
   The Azorean archipelago (North Atlantic; 37-40 degrees N, 25-31 degrees W).
   We use the number of single-island endemics (SIEs) as a measure of diversification, to evaluate four different predictions for the variation in SIEs between different islands, derived from the GDM theory and our knowledge of the fauna and history of the Azores. We calculated the number of SIEs for seven out of the nine Azorean islands and six groups of species (all arthropods, beetles, cavernicolous and non-cavernicolous species, and taxa with high and low dispersal abilities). Several variables accounting for island characteristics (area, geological age, habitat diversity and isolation) and generalized linear models were used to evaluate the reliability of each prediction.
   A linear and positive relationship between SIEs and an AT (area + time) model was the most parsimonious explanation for overall arthropod diversification. However, cavernicolous species showed the opposite pattern (more SIEs inhabiting the youngest islands). Also, isolation was an important predictor of diversification for all groups except for the species with high dispersal ability; while the former were negatively related to the distance from the main source of colonizing lineages (Santa Maria island in most cases), the latter were related to area. Dispersal ability was also a key factor affecting the diversification of most groups of species.
   In general, the diversification of Azorean arthropods is affected by age, area and isolation. However, different groups are affected by these factors in different ways, showing radically different patterns. Although the ATT(2) model fails to predict the diversification pattern of several groups, it provides a framework for integrating these deviations into a general theory. Further improvements of the GDM theory need to take into account the particular traits of each group and the role of isolation in shaping island diversity.

AB The accuracy in parameter estimation approach to sample size planning is developed for the coefficient of variation, where the goal of the method is to obtain an accurate parameter estimate by achieving a sufficiently narrow confidence interval. The first method allows researchers to plan sample size so that the expected width of the confidence interval for the population coefficient of variation is sufficiently narrow. A modification allows a desired degree of assurance to be incorporated into the method, so that the obtained confidence interval will be sufficiently narrow with some specified probability (e.g., 85% assurance that the 95% confidence interval width will be no wider than omega units). Tables of necessary sample size are provided for a variety of scenarios that may help researchers planning a study where the coefficient of variation is of interest plan an appropriate sample size in order to have a sufficiently narrow confidence interval, optionally with some specified assurance of the confidence interval being sufficiently narrow. Freely available computer routines have been developed that allow researchers to easily implement all of the methods discussed in the article.

AB Nutritional requirements. functional response. development and reproduction of Cyclops vicinus were studied with exclusively algal food. Phytoflagellates were found to be adequate food resources for both juvenile development and egg production. Ingestion measurements were performed with Chlamlydomonas reinhardii. The functional response data give evidence for low feeding efficiency, especially for the naupliar stages. A difference between nauplii and older instars was also found in their quantitative food needs. A higher threshold food concentration was observed for naupliar development (0.4 mg C l-1) than for copepodite development (0.2 mg C l-1). rhe calculation of assimilation efficiencies suggests that the high food requirements are due to low specific ingestion rates rather than poor assimilation efficiency. Development time decreased as algal density increased and males developed more quickly than females at all food concentrations. Body size and carbon content increased with increasing food concentration. Continuous egg production was observed above a food concentration of 0.5 mg C l-1. The results have implications for the life cycle of C.vicinus. Summer diapause is interpreted as a strategy to avoid starvation of the juvenile stages. The facultative herbivory of the adults might be an advantage when competing against other more carnivorous cyclopoid copepods.

   PATTERNS
AB Seasonal changes in benthic community composition were investigated on a degraded fringing reef subject to nutrient-enriched submarine groundwater discharge. From December to February (hot season), algae dominate the benthic community, overgrowing scleractinians: 19 % of hard corals died in the studied area, of which 16 % were overgrown by algae (turfs mostly composed of Ceramiales, Dictyosphaeria setchellii and encrusting coralline algae) and 3 % were bleached and subsequently died. In a qualitative assessment, the rhodophyte Gracilaria crassa appeared to be a major factor in the overgrowth and mortality of corals on the reef flat. Algal components displayed strong seasonal variation in abundance and dominance. Changes in the algal community are highly correlated with 2 environmental factors: (1) early onset of intermittent trade winds in March, correlated with replacement of large fleshy algal facies by lithophytic algal facies and (2) calm conditions in November, associated with warming of the waters, correlated with an increase in large fleshy algae capable of overgrowing many substrate. Thus, during the hot season, hydrological conditions cause eutrophic conditions and enhance algal growth while reducing coral vitality. Therefore, this is the most critical period for a coral community growing in eutrophic conditions.

AB Ecosystems with alternative attractors are susceptible to abrupt regime shifts that are often difficult to predict and reverse. In this study, we quantify multiple system dynamics to determine whether the transition of mesic grassland to shrubland, a widespread phenomenon, represents a linear reversible process, a nonlinear but reversible threshold process, or a transition between alternative attractors that is nonlinear and prone to hysteresis. Using a 28-yr data set with annual resolution and extensive spatial replication, we found that shrub cover is correlated with distinct thresholds of fire and C-4 grass cover, resulting in temporal bimodality of shrub cover and abrupt shifts of shrub cover despite gradual changes in grass cover. These abrupt increases in shrub cover are the most rapid ever reported in grasslands, and illustrate internal thresholds that separate grasslands and shrublands. Nonlinear transitions from low to high shrub cover were also closely associated with positive feedback mechanisms that alter fire and competition (r(2) = 0.65), suggesting that grasslands and shrublands could show hysteresis, and by definition exist as alternative attractors. Thus, the response of this ecosystem to anthropogenic activity should tend to be rapid, nonlinear, and perhaps difficult to reverse. Regime shifts in this mesic grassland were predictable: we found that grassland and shrubland attractors were differentiated by critical thresholds of similar to 50-70% grass cover, 5-10% shrub cover, and a fire return interval of similar to 3 yr. These thresholds may provide adaptive potential for managing nonlinear behavior in socio-ecological systems in a changing environment.

AB To obtain critical information on distribution and abundance of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) residing in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), systematic line-transect surveys and photo-identification studies were conducted in the eastern and western sections of the estuary in 2005-2006 and 2007-2008, respectively. Dolphins in the eastern section occurred throughout Lingding Bay, whereas their distribution in the western section extended from the mouth of Modaomen to the channel between Shangchuan and Xiachuan islands. Variations in dolphin distribution during the wet and dry seasons were evident and probably associated with movements of their prey species. Photo-identification of individuals confirmed exchange of at least some individuals between the western and eastern sections of PRE, and thus dolphins from both areas almost certainly comprise a single population. Using line-transect analysis, the total population size of the PRE humpback dolphins was estimated to be 2555 during the wet season and 2517 during the dry season. However, these should be considered preliminary as the coefficients of variation in some survey areas were high. Further studies should focus on refining these estimates and working towards understanding the western boundary of the PRE population.

AB The summer phytoplankton population in the Arcos reservoir (Spain), an oligotrophic/mesotrophic waterbody, was dominated by the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum, accompanied by Planktothrix cf. agardhii and smaller proportions of other cyanobacterial species. The bloom remained for approximately 1 month in the summer of 2004. The Arcos reservoir had moderate conductivity, up to 1756 mu Scm(-1), and relatively high nutrient concentrations. Planktonic biomass collected during the bloom period was found to be toxic by the Artemia salina bioassay. Analytical procedures based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated the absence of microcystins and anatoxin-a but clearly demonstrated the presence of cylindrospermopsin (CYN), suggesting that CYN from Aphanizomenon ovalisporum was the compound responsible for the toxicity in the bioassay. Measurements indicate that up to 9.4 mu g CYN-1 were present in the sestonic fraction. This is the first report of high concentrations of this cyanotoxin in European waters and the first known instance of a massive bloom of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum in Spain.

AB The coral reefs of Eilat (Red Sea) have been heavily damaged as a result of extensive tourist activity. Artificial reefs have been demonstrated to be a potential tool for the restoration of marine habitats. We investigated the fish assemblage on pillars supporting the oil jetties in Eilat, studying the species composition on these vertical structures; and the relationships between fish community features and the structural characteristics of these artificial reefs over time, using multivariate regression analysis. The fish assemblage on these 25-year-old structures was shown to be abundant and diverse, comprising 146 species, distributed among 35 families. The 10 most abundant species were planktivores, accounting for 78% of all individuals; the most numerous fish was Neopomacentrus miryae (Pomacentridae). Size and complexity of pillars were correlated with fish abundance, richness and diversity, and related to the availability of shelters. These community indices increased near the bottom, possibly due to behavioral preferences. High coefficient of variance (CV) values indicated high temporal variability, resulting from a pronounced recruitment of N. miryae and other common species during April 1993. We discuss the possible use of these artificial reefs as a model for the construction of artificial habitats aimed at the rehabilitation of fish assemblages in deteriorating natural coral reef areas.

AB The loss of resilience in systems characterised by multiple equilibria is indicated by a discontinuous change in the state of the system, or the transition from one locally stable state corresponding to a particular mix of species to another state corresponding to a different mix of species. The resilience of the system (the state of the range in this example) may be influenced by the management regime through its impact on the response to disturbances. The paper shows that optimal management of an event-driven system should be sensitive to the opportunities created by such events. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Oxygenic photosynthesis is Earth's dominant metabolism, having evolved to harvest the largest expected energy source at the surface of most terrestrial habitable zone planets. Using CO2 and H(2)Omolecules that are expected to be abundant and widespread on habitable terrestrial planetsoxygenic photosynthesis is plausible as a significant planetary process with a global impact. Photosynthetic O-2 has long been considered particularly robust as a sign of life on a habitable exoplanet, due to the lack of known false positivesgeological or photochemical processes that could also produce large quantities of stable O-2. O-2 has other advantages as a biosignature, including its high abundance and uniform distribution throughout the atmospheric column and its distinct, strong absorption in the visible and near-infrared. However, recent modeling work has shown that false positives for abundant oxygen or ozone could be produced by abiotic mechanisms, including photochemistry and atmospheric escape. Environmental factors for abiotic O-2 have been identified and will improve our ability to choose optimal targets and measurements to guard against false positives. Most of these false-positive mechanisms are dependent on properties of the host star and are often strongest for planets orbiting M dwarfs. In particular, selecting planets found within the conservative habitable zone and those orbiting host stars more massive than 0.4 M (M3V and earlier) may help avoid planets with abundant abiotic O-2 generated by water loss. Searching for O-4 or CO in the planetary spectrum, or the lack of H2O or CH4, could help discriminate between abiotic and biological sources of O-2 or O-3. In advance of the next generation of telescopes, thorough evaluation of potential biosignaturesincluding likely environmental context and factors that could produce false positivesultimately works to increase our confidence in life detection.

AB Coral reefs are currently experiencing substantial ecological impoverishment as a result of anthropogenic stressors, and the majority of reefs are facing immediate risk. Increasing ocean surface temperatures induce frequent coral mass bleaching events-the breakdown of the nutritional photo-symbiosis with intracellular algae (genus: Symbiodinium). Here, we report that Stylophora pistillata from a highly diverse reef in the Gulf of Aqaba showed no signs of bleaching despite spending 1.5 months at 1-2 degrees C above their long-term summer maximum (amounting to 11 degree heating weeks) and a seawater pH of 7.8. Instead, their symbiotic dinoflagellates exhibited improved photochemistry, higher pigmentation and a doubling in net oxygen production, leading to a 51% increase in primary productivity. Nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging revealed subtle cellular-level shifts in carbon and nitrogen metabolism under elevated temperatures, but overall host and symbiont biomass proxies were not significantly affected. Now living well below their thermal threshold in the Gulf of Aqaba, these corals have been evolutionarily selected for heat tolerance during their migration through the warm Southern Red Sea after the last ice age. This may allow them to withstand future warming for a longer period of time, provided that successful environmental conservation measures are enacted across national boundaries in the region.

AB Coastal ecosystems produce and sequester significant amounts of carbon ("blue carbon"), which has been well documented in humid and semi-humid regions of temperate and tropical climates but less so in arid regions where mangroves, marshes, and seagrasses exist near the limit of their tolerance for extreme temperature and salinity. To better understand these unique systems, we measured whole-ecosystem carbon stocks in 58 sites across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in natural and planted mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass beds, microbial mats, and coastal sabkha (inter- and supratidal unvegetated salt flats). Natural mangroves held significantly more carbon in above- and belowground biomass than other vegetated ecosystems. Planted mangrove carbon stocks increased with age, but there were large differences for sites of similar age. Soil carbon varied widely across sites (2-367 Mg C/ha), with ecosystem averages that ranged from 49 to 156 Mg C/ha. For the first time, microbial mats were documented to contain soil carbon pools comparable to vascular plant-dominated ecosystems, and could arguably be recognized as a unique blue carbon ecosystem. Total ecosystem carbon stocks ranged widely from 2 to 515 Mg C/ha (seagrass bed and mangrove, respectively). Seagrass beds had the lowest carbon stock per unit area, but the largest stock per total area due to their large spatial coverage. Compared to similar ecosystems globally, mangroves and marshes in the UAE have lower plant and soil carbon stocks; however, the difference in soil stocks is far larger than with plant stocks. This incongruent difference between stocks is likely due to poor carbon preservation under conditions of weakly reduced soils (200-350 mV), coarse-grained sediments, and active shoreline migration. This work represents the first attempt to produce a country-wide coastal ecosystem carbon accounting using a uniform sampling protocol, and was motivated by specific policy goals identified by the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative. These carbon stock data supported two objectives: to quantify carbon stocks and infer sequestration capacity in arid blue carbon ecosystems, and to explore the potential to incorporate blue carbon science into national reporting and planning documents.

AB Corals and macroalgae release large quantities of dissolved organic matter (DOM), one of the largest sources of organic matter produced on coral reefs. By rapidly taking up DOM and transforming it into particulate detritus, coral reef sponges are proposed to play a key role in transferring the energy and nutrients in DOM to higher trophic levels via the recently discovered sponge loop. DOM released by corals and algae differs in quality and composition, but the influence of these different DOM sources on recycling by the sponge loop has not been investigated. Here, we used stable isotope pulse-chase experiments to compare the processing of naturally sourced coral- and algal-derived DOM by three Red Sea coral reef sponge species: Chondrilla sacciformis, Hemimycale arabica and Mycale fistulifera. Incubation experiments were conducted to trace C-13- and N-15-enriched coral- and algal-derived DOM into the sponge tissue and detritus. Incorporation of C-13 into specific phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs) was used to differentiate DOM assimilation within the sponge holobiont (i.e. the sponge host vs. its associated bacteria). All sponges assimilated both coral- and algal-derived DOM, but incorporation rates were significantly higher for algal-derived DOM. The two DOM sources were also processed differently by the sponge holobiont. Algal-derived DOM was incorporated into bacteria-specific PLFAs at a higher rate while coral-derived DOM was more readily incorporated into sponge-specific PLFAs. A substantial fraction of the dissolved organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) assimilated by the sponges was subsequently converted into and released as particulate detritus (15-24% C and 27-49% N). However, algal-derived DOM was released as detritus at a higher rate. The higher uptake and transformation rates of algal- compared with coral-derived DOM suggest that reef community phase shifts from coral to algal dominance may stimulate DOM cycling through the sponge loop with potential consequences for coral reef biogeochemical cycles and food webs.

AB Ecosystem regime shifts are regarded as abrupt global transitions from one stable state to an alternative stable state, induced by slow environmental changes or by global disturbances. Spatially extended ecosystems, however, can also respond to local disturbances by the formation of small domains of the alternative state. Such a response can lead to gradual regime shifts involving front propagation and the coalescence of alternative-state domains. When one of the states is spatially patterned, a multitude of intermediate stable states appears, giving rise to step-like gradual shifts with extended pauses at these states. Using a minimal model, we study gradual state transitions and show that they precede abrupt transitions. We propose indicators to probe gradual regime shifts, and suggest that a combination of abrupt-shift indicators and gradual-shift indicators might be needed to unambiguously identify regime shifts. Our results are particularly relevant to desertification in drylands where transitions to bare soil take place from spotted vegetation, and the degradation process appears to involve step-like events of local vegetation mortality caused by repeated droughts.

AB Millepores are colonial polypoidal hydrozoans secreting an internal calcareous skeleton of an encrusting or upright form, often of considerable size. Defensive polyps protruding from the skeleton are numerous and highly toxic and for this reason millepores are popularly known as "stinging corals" or 'fire corals. " In shallow tropical seas millepore colonies are conspicuous on coral reefs and may be locally abundant and important reef-framework builders. The history of systematic research on the Milleporidae and the sister family Stylasteridae is rich and full with the works of early naturalists beginning with Linnaeus. Seventeen living millepore species are recognised. Marked phenotypic variation inform and structure of colonies is characteristic of the genus Millepora. The first published descriptions of the anatomy and histology of millepores were by H. N. Moseley in one of the Challenger Expedition reports. These original, detailed accounts by Moseley remain valid and, except for recent descriptions of the ultrastructure of the skeleton and skeletogenic tissues, have not needed much modification.
   Millepores occur worldwide on coral reefs at depths of between I and 40 m and their distribution on reefs is generally zoned in response to physical factors. Colonies may be abundant locally on coral reefs but usually comprise < 10% of the overall surface cover. Growth rates of colonies are similar to the measured rates of branching and platelike scleractinian corals. Millepores are voracious zooplankton feeders and they obtain part of their nutrition from autotrophic sources, photosynthetic production by symbiotic zooxanthellae.
   Reproduction in millepores is characterised by alternation of generations with a well-developed polypoid stage that buds off planktonic medusae. Sexual reproduction is seasonal for known species and the medusae have a brief planktonic life. Asexual production is achieved by sympodial growth, the production of new skeleton and soft tissue along a growing edge or branch tip, and by the reattachment, regeneration and repair of damaged or broken colony fragments.
   The physiological and ecological responses of species of millepores are similar to those of the species of scleractinian corals over a broad range of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Severe damage to colonies may occur during major storms. Delicately branching species are more susceptible than massive and bladed species. The ability of broken fragments to regenerate can ameliorate the extent of damage. Widespread bleaching and mortality of millepores has been reported during mass bleaching events that have affected many coral reefs. Millepores are often the first to recover after short-term bleaching events. Harmful effects of oil spills, chronic oil pollution and oil-spill detergents have been widely reported for millepores.
   Although the hydrozoan coenosarc, with its fiercely stinging zooids, does not appear to be an attractive substratum for attachment and settlement Of epizooans, a number of sessile and errant forms commonly occur on millepores. These include barnacles, amphipods, tanaid and alpheid crustaceans, polychaetes and gastropods. Burrowing molluscs, polychaetes and crustacea also abound. Many of these species or their close relatives also occur on scleractinian corals. A variety of predators, grazers and fouling organisms occur on millepores. These include errant polychaetes, several coral-feeding fish and a gastropod mollusc. Various invasive green, red and brown algae are widespread, growing on dead branches of millepores and overgrowing live coral tissue. Various "band diseases" associated with microorganisms that appear to cause lesions on millepores and loss of tissue have been documented but are not of widespread occurrence. Infestations of endolithic algae and fungi growing within the skeletons have been reported in a number of millepore species.

AB Aim The negative correlation between temperature and body size of ectothermic animals (broadly known as the temperature-size rule or TSR) is a widely observed pattern, especially in aquatic organisms. Studies have claimed that the TSR arises due to decreased oxygen solubility and increasing metabolic costs at warmer temperatures, whereby oxygen supply to a large body becomes increasingly difficult. However, mixed empirical evidence has led to a controversy about the mechanisms affecting species' size and performance under different temperatures. We review the main competing genetic, physiological and ecological explanations for the TSR and suggest a roadmap to move the field forward. Location Global. Taxa Aquatic ectotherms. Time period 1980-present. Results We show that current studies cannot discriminate among alternative hypotheses and none of the hypotheses can explain all TSR-related observations. To resolve this impasse, we need experiments and field-sampling programmes that specifically compare alternative mechanisms and formally consider energetics related to growth costs, oxygen supply and behaviour. We highlight the distinction between evolutionary and plastic mechanisms, and suggest that the oxygen limitation debate should separate processes operating on short, decadal and millennial time-scales. Conclusions Despite decades of research, we remain uncertain whether the TSR is an adaptive response to temperature-related physiological (enzyme activity) or ecological changes (food, predation and other mortality), or a response to constraints operating at a cellular level (oxygen supply and associated costs). To make progress, ecologists, physiologists, modellers and geneticists should work together to develop a cross-disciplinary research programme that integrates theory and data, explores time-scales over which the TSR operates, and assesses limits to adaptation or plasticity. We identify four questions for such a programme. Answering these questions is crucial given the widespread impacts of climate change and reliance of management on models that are highly dependent on accurate representation of ecological and physiological responses to temperature.

AB The most studied ecogeographic rule is Bergmann's rule, but aspects of the original paper are often presented incorrectly even though Bergmann (1847) is explicitly cited. The goal of this paper is to 1) summarize the contents of Bergmann's paper, supported by direct translations, and 2) to discuss the main issues surrounding Bergmann's rule based on Bergmann's intentions and early definitions of the rule. Although Bergmann himself never formulated an explicit rule, based on Bergmann's (1847) intentions and early definitions of Bergmann's rule, Bergmann's rule is: Within species and amongst closely related species of homeothermic animals a larger size is often achieved in colder climates than in warmer ones, which is linked to the temperature budget of these animals. Bergmann (1847) assumed that the surface area of an animal is a measure for heat dissipation and an animal's volume a measure of its heat production. As body size increases, an animal's surface area increases less than its volume; however, modifications in morphology and behaviour will also influence the temperature budget. Bergmann hypothesized that when everything but size is equal, the smaller animals should live in warmer areas. This was supported by empirical data on > 300 bird species belonging to 86 genera. Recommendations for use of the term Bergmann's rule include 1) inclusion of a thermoregulatory mechanism, 2) application only to homoeothermic animals, 3) but to any taxonomic group, 4) tests of the rule should test the assumption that larger animals have to produce less heat to increase body temperatures, and 5) future authors should either go back to the original publication (Bergmann 1847) when referring to it or simply not cite it at all.

TI High-amplitude fluctuations and alternative dynamical states of midges

ID POPULATION-DYNAMICS; DIPTERA; CHAOS; PREDATORS; STABILITY; SYSTEMS;
   LIMITS
AB Complex dynamics are often shown by simple ecological models(1,2) and have been clearly demonstrated in laboratory(3,4) and natural systems(5-9). Yet many classes of theoretically possible dynamics are still poorly documented in nature. Here we study long- term time- series data of a midge, Tanytarsus gracilentus ( Diptera: Chironomidae), in Lake Myvatn, Iceland. The midge undergoes density fluctuations of almost six orders of magnitude. Rather than regular cycles, however, these fluctuations have irregular periods of 4 - 7 years, indicating complex dynamics. We fit three consumer - resource models capable of qualitatively distinct dynamics to the data. Of these, the best- fitting model shows alternative dynamical states in the absence of environmental variability; depending on the initial midge densities, the model shows either fluctuations around a fixed point or high- amplitude cycles. This explains the observed complex population dynamics: high-amplitude but irregular fluctuations occur because stochastic variability causes the dynamics to switch between domains of attraction to the alternative states. In the model, the amplitude of fluctuations depends strongly on minute resource subsidies into the midge habitat. These resource subsidies may be sensitive to human- caused changes in the hydrology of the lake, with human impacts such as dredging leading to higher- amplitude fluctuations. Tanytarsus gracilentus is a key component of the Myvatn ecosystem, representing two- thirds of the secondary productivity of the lake(10) and providing vital food resources to fish and to breeding bird populations(11,12). Therefore the high- amplitude, irregular fluctuations in midge densities generated by alternative dynamical states dominate much of the ecology of the lake.

TI Social learning in noncolonial insects?
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY

AB Social-information use has generated great interest lately and has been shown to have important implications for the ecology and evolution of species [1-6]. Learning about predators or predation risk from others may provide low-cost life-saving information and would be expected to have adaptive payoffs in any species where conspecifics are observable and behave differently under predation risk. Yet, social learning and social-information use in general have been largely restricted to vertebrates ([1-3, 5, 7-9], but see [10-16]). Here, we show that crickets adapt their predator-avoidance behavior after having observed the behavior of knowledgeable others and maintain these behavioral changes lastingly after demonstrators are gone. These results point toward social learning, a contingency never shown before in noncolonial insects. We show that these long-lasting changes cannot instead be attributed to long re-emergence times, long-lasting effects of alarm pheromones, or residual odor cues. Our findings imply that social learning is likely much more phylogenetically widespread than currently acknowledged and that reliance on social information is determined by ecological rather than taxonomic constrains [17, 18], and they question the generally held assumption that social learning is restricted to large-brained animals assumed to possess superior cognitive abilities.

AB 1. The behaviour of ungulates foraging in non-patchy habitats is studied with the help of a new model of optimal foraging based on a time minimization utility function. The model predicts that an animal uses a foraging station only if the biomass exceeds a prescribed threshold level. Moreover, the forager does not consume all the available food but it gives up the station when food density reaches the threshold level.
   2. The assumptions of the model were tested using 36 foraging paths of adult female fallow deer (Dama dama L.) in two different study areas (one wild and one fenced) and seasons (summer and autumn, respectively). Despite the ecological differences between the two sites, the deer exhibited the same pattern of search behaviour which can be described as a first-order biased random walk. Neither herd seemed able to detect and exploit food patches.
   3. Partial consumption of food was regularly observed in both study areas, There is strong evidence that the fenced-in animals behaved in agreement with the model's prediction, abandoning the foraging stations when the biomass density fell below 10 g m(-2) of dry matter. On the other hand, the deer living in the wild exhibited a more variable foraging behaviour.
   4. The theoretical analysis shows that in comparison to the fenced-in deer those in the wild require more information to correctly evaluate the threshold level of their more heterogenous environment.
   5. It is argued that the foraging behaviour of fallow deer consists of two basic components: a random search for food coupled with a threshold in the selection of foraging stations.

AB Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine whether the two cyclopoid copepods, Cyclops vicinus and Mesocyclops leuckarti, exploit the same food resources.  The food requirements of juveniles of the two cyclopoid copepods were investigated.  Moreover, the importance of algae for the predaceous adults was studied.  Nauplii of both M.leuckarti and C.vicinus successfully developed into copepodites when fed the motile algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlamydomonas sphaeroides and Cryptomonas sp.  Threshold food concentrations for naupliar development varied between offered algae and between the two cyclopoid species.  The food threshold for successful naupliar development, when reared on C.reinhardtii, was lower for M.leuckarti (0.3 mg C l-1) than for C.vicinus (0.5 mg C l-1), whereas a similar food threshold was found using Cryptomonas sp. (0.3 mg C l-1) and C.sphaeroides (<0.2 mg C l-1).  Naupliar development time was inversely related to food concentration.  Food required for copepodite development differed for the two cyclopoid species.  Cyclops vicinus was able to develop to the adult stage on a pure diet of any one of the three algal species, whereas M.leuckarti required a prey supply of the rotifer Brachionus rubens.  Food composition, i.e. algal species, algal concentration and rotifer abundance, influenced copepodite survivorship of both cyclopoids and was always higher in the presence of B.rubens.  Under similar food conditions, mortality was higher for M.leuckarti than for C.vicinus.  Mesocyclops leuckarti females were very dependent on animal food.  The predation rate of M.leuckarti was not lower in the presence of algae.  Egg production of M.leuckarti was low on a pure algal diet and significantly higher when B.rubens was present.  The results were used to discuss the life cycle strategy and the possibility of exploitative competition of the two cyclopoid copepods.

AB A major challenge for advancing our understanding of the functional role of soil microbial communities is to link changes in their structure and function under climate change. To address this challenge requires new understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the capacity of soil microbial communities to resist and recover from climate extremes. Here, we synthesize emerging understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence the resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities to climate extremes, with a focus on drought, and identify drivers that might trigger abrupt changes to alternative states. We highlight research challenges and propose a path for advancing our understanding of the resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities to climate extremes, and of their vulnerability to transitions to alternative states, including the use of trait-based approaches. We identify a need for new approaches to quantify resistance and resilience of soil microbial communities, and to identify thresholds for transitions to alternative states. We show how high-resolution time series coupled with gradient designs will enable detecting response patterns to interacting drivers. Finally, to account for extrinsic factors, we suggest that future studies should use environmental gradients to track soil microbial community responses to climate extremes in space and time. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.

AB Cement-based materials, such as concrete and mortars, are used in extremely large amounts. For instance, in 2009 concrete production was superior to 10 billion tons. Cement plays an important role in terms of economic and social relevance since it is fundamental to build and improve infrastructure. On the other hand, this industry is also a heavy polluter. Cement production releases 5-6% of all carbon dioxide generated by human activities, accounting for about 4% of global warming. It can release huge amounts of persistent organic pollutants, such as dioxins and heavy metals and particles. Energy consumption is also considerable. Cement production use approximately 0.6% of all energy produced in the United States. On the other hand, the chemistry underlying cement production and its applications can be very helpful to overcome these environmental issues. In terms of manufacture, there are many alternative materials that can be used to minimize carbon dioxide production and reduce energy consumption, such as calcium sulfoaluminates and beta-Ca2SiO4-rich cements. Using residues from other industrial sectors can also improve the sustainability of cement industry. Under adequate conditions, waste materials such as tyres, oils, municipal solid waste and solvents can be used as supplementary fuel in cement plants. Concrete can be used for encapsulation of waste materials such as tyres, plastics and glasses. In this review, we discuss some aspects of the cement industry associated with environmental science. Other issues such as economic aspects, the chemistry of cement manufacture and its properties are also presented. Special attention is given to the role that cement chemistry can play in terms of sustainability. The most relevant aspects are outlined, such as the use of alternative materials, new possibilities and also the recycling of materials. It is also argued that an important aspect is the role of research and development necessary to improve cement sustainability.

AB The presence of sex-stereotyped behavior in monomorphic animals, where there are no sexual differences in form to account for sexual differences in function, is often attributed to intraspecific competition or to differential parental investment. The possibility that the use of different behavioral strategies by each parent may increase reproductive success for both partners through risk partitioning is seldom considered. We studied thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), where the male exclusively feeds the offspring during the late chick rearing. During the period of biparental care, males fed on "risk-averse'' prey (consistent across time and space; unitized risk = 0.29), whereas females fed on "risk-prone'' prey (risk = 0.59). Males fed at night at 1 colony, during the day at 2 colonies, and there was no pattern at another colony. We suggest that these differences reflect the availability of risk-prone prey. Modeling suggested that mixed-risk pairs had higher success than "risky'' or "riskless'' pairs. Males accumulated reserves and reduced chick provisioning just prior to fledging. Thus, sex-specific patterns at 1 period (male-only care during postfledging) may have led to sex-specific patterns at earlier periods through the need for specialization in foraging habits and risk. We propose that risk partitioning may contribute to the prevalence of sex-specific behaviors in monomorphic animals and that patterns are likely context specific rather than species specific.

AB An allochthonous input can modify trophic relationships, by providing an external resource that is normally limiting within a system. The subsidy may not only elicit a growth response of the primary producers via a bottom-up effect, but it also may lead to runaway herbivore growth in the absence of increased predation. If the consumer is migratory and predation is similarly dampened in the alternative system, the increased numbers may produce a top-down cascade of direct and indirect effects on an ecosystem that may be a great distance from the source of the subsidy. In an extreme case, it can lead to a catastrophic shift in ecosystem functioning as a result of biotic exploitation that produces an alternative stable state. The loss of resilience is particularly sensitive to herbivore density which can result in two different outcomes to the vegetation on which the consumer feeds. Over-compensatory growth of above-ground biomass gives way to sward destruction and near irreversible changes in soil properties as density of a herbivore increases. A striking temporal asymmetry exists between a reduction in the consumer population and recovery of damaged vegetation and degraded soils.

AB Accidental oil spills from ships or rigs and inputs of effluent such as production formation water (PFW) are key perceived threats to tropical biota from industry activities. Scleractinian corals are an important functional component of tropical reefs and the abundance, diversity and resilience of coral communities can be used as an indicator of ecosystem health. In this paper, we report the effects of petroleum products, including mater accommodated fractions (WAF) of crude oil, PFW and dispersant (Corexit 9527), on fertilization and larval metamorphosis of the widespread scleractinian coral, Acropora millepora (Ehrenberg, 1834) in laboratory-based assays. At 20% v/v PFW fertilization was inhibited by 25%. This concentration was equivalent 0.0721 mg l(-1) total hydrocarbon (THC). In contrast, larval metamorphosis was more sensitive to this effluent, with 98% metamorphosis inhibited at the same concentration. Crude oil WAF did not inhibit fertilization of gametes until dispersant was introduced. Dispersed oil was slightly more toxic to fertilization than dispersant alone, suggesting toxicity to that event may be additive. The minimum concentration of dispersed oil which inhibited fertilization was 0.0325 mg l(-1) THC. Larval metamorphosis was more sensitive than fertilization to crude oil. Although crude oil and dispersant inhibited larval metamorphosis individually, this toxicity was magnified when larvae were exposed to combinations of both. Crude oil inhibited metamorphosis at 0.0824 mg l(-1) THC and at 0.0325 mg l(-1) THC when dispersed in 10% v/v (dispersant/oil). Management of petroleum-related risks to spawning corals should consider not only the occurrence of the annual coral spawning event, but also the subsequent 1-3-week period during which most larval metamorphosis and recruitment occur.

AB Nitrification in lakes and rivers is usually modeled using first-order water column kinetics. Over the years, a number of scientists have, however, recognized the importance of sediment nitrification, especially in shallow systems. The aim of this study is to determine the extent of nitrification in the water column and sediments of a eutrophic system and to propose simple kinetic equations to describe the process. An intensive experimental study was performed (summer and fall 1992, fall 1993) on Onondaga Lake and the adjoining Seneca River, a hypereutrophic system with high ammonia concentrations (2-10 mgN l(-1)). Water samples and sediment cores were collected and laboratory nitrification studies performed. The results clearly demonstrate that there is rapid nitrification in the sediments of both Onondaga Lake (0.37 gN m(-2) d(-1)) and the Seneca River (0.32 gN m(-2) d(-1)). In contrast, no apparent nitrification was observed in the water column of the lake or river, despite high ammonia concentrations. The findings of the Most Probable Number (MPN) test provide a likely reason for this phenomenon, showing that the lack of nitrification in the water column is probably due to low nitrifier densities (similar to 10(1) cells ml(-1)), whereas the rate is rapid in the sediments due to high nitrifier populations (similar to 10(5) cells ml(-1)). It is therefore believed that nitrification in this relatively deep system is localized to the sediments and simple zero order kinetics is proposed as a first approach to model the process. It also stimulates the question of whether nitrification in most freshwater systems is principally a sediment process and should be modeled accordingly. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB 1. The wetlands of the Atchafalaya Delta, Louisiana are characterized by a warm climate, highly fertile sediments, and an absence of moisture limitations. Consequently, vegetation succession (on islands that emerged in 1973) was expected to occur relatively rapidly.
   2. From 1980 until 1986, annual surveys of vegetation cover and substrate elevation were conducted on 110 permanent plots along six transect lines crossing four islands. In addition, to evaluate the effect of herbivory (predominantly by Myocastor coypus, nutria or coypu), four 50-m x 40-m exclosures and four control plots were constructed on two of the islands.
   3. Community structure changed dramatically through time along the permanent transects. Because several species shifted in elevational range, ordination (using detrended correspondence analysis) only generally separated plant communities into different elevational zones.
   4. The 20 most dominant species, representing 95% of the total cover, were classified into three distinct groups according to cover pattern: (i) species that increased in abundance through time and stabilized within particular elevational zones (e.g. Colocasia esculenta, Justicia ovata, Leersia oryzoides, Polygonum punctatum, Scirpus americanus, Vigna luteola), (ii) species with relatively stable cover over time (e.g. Aeschynomene indica, Eleocharis spp., Panicum sp., Sagittaria lancifolia, Salix nigra, Scirpus validus, Typha domingensis), and (iii) species that occurred over a wide range initially, but eventually disappeared at low elevations (e.g. Ammannia coccinea, Cyperus difformis, Hydrocotyle sp., Mikania scandens, Sagittaria latifolia, Sagittaria platyphylla, Sphenoclea zeylandica).
   5. Two general trends across all islands through time involved a decrease in vegetated area and a marked increase in species diversity. The decrease in vegetated area is attributable to increased grazing damage by nutria combined with the negative effect of prolonged flooding. These two factors at least partially counterbalanced the forces that were expected to promote rapid succession.
   6. Because of the strong abiotic (fluvial and marine) forces and because the most influential herbivore is an exotic species, the Atchafalaya Delta appears to lie at the allogenic extreme of the autogenic-allogenic continuum of successional types.

AB Reintroductions are commonly used for re-establishing self-sustainable populations in formerly inhabited areas. Reintroductions are expensive, and thus, it is worth performing a thorough demographic analysis of current and likely future population trajectories to guide strategic decisions on release policy.
   Bearded vultures Gypaetus barbatus were exterminated from the Alps in the late 19th century, mainly due to human persecution. To re-establish them, captive-bred young have been released annually since 1986. Since the first successful breeding in the wild in 1997, the population has increased to 9 pairs in 2006. It is not known, however, for how long releases should be continued to obtain a self-sustaining, viable population.
   We estimated age-specific survival probabilities with a mark-resighting model and quantified fecundity rates of released individuals. Using the resulting demographic estimates, we built a stochastic population model to estimate population growth rates, and explored the value of continuing to release birds for varying periods into the future.
   Annual survival probabilities were high (first year of life, 0.88; later years, 0.96); average annual fecundity was 0.6 fledglings per breeding pair. Using the estimated survival probabilities, projected population growth rates would increase with additional years of releases. Yet, the population would grow, even if releases had stopped after 2006. Only if mortality increased by >= 50% would the population start to decline.
   Synthesis and applications. Our population dynamics model provides essential information to optimize decision-making within a major reintroduction programme. From a demographic viewpoint, releases of captive-raised bearded vultures can be ceased in the Alps. The resources freed could be redirected towards a close demographic surveillance of the free-ranging population, with periodic evaluation of its viability and the option to release birds if deemed necessary. Birds available from the captive stock could be used for reintroductions in other areas where the bearded vulture is extinct.

AB Re-introduction programs for endangered animals operate under the hope that protected habitats can sustain viable populations that rely little on humans. The goal of these programs is to supply animals with the resources and skills they need to succeed in the modem wild. However, predicting the set of skills necessary to respond to unpredictable selection events is difficult and efforts sometimes fail as animals respond inappropriately to environmental variation because they lack behavioral flexibility. Population resilience to environmental change may be enhanced if all members of a population do not exhibit the same response when selection pressures change. In many species individual animals express behavioral types that exhibit alternative responses to the same stimuli. Yet when animals are prepared for release to the wild, there is rarely consideration of consistent behavioral variation between individuals. Since experience influences both behavioral and physiological responses to varied stimuli and can shape the future behavioral type of captive animals, pre-release environmental enrichment may be successful in facilitating the expression of varied behavioral types in populations slated for release. This approach to environmental enrichment requires a departure from a 'one size fits all' strategy and may also involve exposure to increased challenge and competition. In addition, there is a need for empirical evidence to better understand the role of environmental enrichment and behavioral types on post-release success. The zoo environment provides an excellent arena for examining the development and expression of behavioral types and for taking a novel functional approach to environmental enrichment research that may prove to be very important to re-introduction efforts.

AB We investigated the effect of sucrose concentration on the patterns of feeding, gut function, and energy management in the nectar-eating Chilean hummingbird Sephanoides sephanoides. We interpreted these results using a simple model of digestive function. The predictions of this model are: (a) Hummingbirds should exhibit 100% assimilation efficiency of sugars at all sugar concentrations; (b) Daily rates of energy intake should be positively correlated with sugar concentration; and (c) Increased sugar concentration should lead to linearly increasing meal retention times, and, therefore, to linearly increasing time intervals between meals. In agreement with the model, hummingbirds exhibited almost complete assimilation of sugars and increased meal retention times and intermeal intervals with increased sugar concentration. Hummingbirds did not, however, show any significant differences in daily energy intake when fed different sugar concentrations. Birds differed in their temporal pattern of feeding when fed solutions with sucrose solutions of contrasting concentrations. At low food sucrose concentrations (0.25 M), birds showed a burst of feeding before dark. In contrast, birds feeding on higher sucrose concentrations (0.5 M and 0.75 M) showed steadily declining feeding activity throughout the day. In addition to measuring the behavior and gut function of hummingbirds, we also measured their daily patterns of energy use using respirometry. Hummingbirds showed considerable flexibility in their patterns of energy use. The amount of energy used at night was positively correlated with the surplus of energy (intake minus diurnal expenditures) at dusk. Although birds exhibited only small variation in total daily energy budgets as a function of sugar concentration, birds feeding at the lowest sucrose concentration (0.25 M) seemed to rely on nocturnal torpor with more frequency than those fed on higher concentrations. We conclude that energy maximization is probably an inappropriate assumption for birds that are not growing, storing fat, or reproducing. We present a modification of the original model that allows assuming that birds do not maximize energy intake, but rather maintain constant rates of energy intake. We describe experiments and criteria that allow discriminating among the two models. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Precise empirical data on current gene flow by pollen, both with respect to distance and abundance, is crucial to understand whether habitat fragments are functionally connected. Based on a large-scale inventory (approximate to 100 km(2)) in which all individuals of a naturally scattered forest tree (Sorbus domestica) were mapped, we inferred current gene flow by pollen using genetic paternity analysis. We detected an extensive network of effective pollen transfer. Although short pollen flow distances were most abundant, 10% of the assigned pollen donors were more than 2 km away from their female mating partners, and 1.8% were even at a distance of 12-16 km. This latter pollen flow shows that current long-distance gene flow over a fragmented landscape clearly occurs. Pollen dispersal was well described by a fat-tailed inverse curve. Using parentage analysis of established trees, maternally inherited chloroplast markers and diameter at breast height measurements as an indicator of individual tree age, we were able to infer regular seed dispersal distances over several hundred metres up to more than 10 km. We conclude that in temperate, insect-pollinated and animal-dispersed tree species such as S. domestica, fragmented subpopulations are functionally connected by gene flow through both pollen and seed.

AB The biogeographical patterns and drivers of diversity on oceanic islands in the tropical South Pacific (TSP) are synthesized. We use published studies to determine present patterns of diversity on TSP islands, the likely sources of the biota on these islands and how the islands were colonized. We also investigate the effect of extinctions.
   We focus on oceanic islands in the TSP.
   We review available literature and published molecular studies.
   Examples of typical island features (e.g. gigantism, flightlessness, gender dimorphism) are common, as are adaptive radiations. Diversity decreases with increasing isolation from mainland sources and with decreasing size and age of archipelagos, corresponding well with island biogeographical expectations. Molecular studies support New Guinea/Malesia, New Caledonia and Australia as major source areas for the Pacific biota. Numerous studies support dispersal-based scenarios, either over several 100 km (long-distance dispersal) or over shorter distances by island-hopping (stepping stones) and transport by human means (hitch-hiking). Only one vicariance explanation, the eastward drift of continental fragments (shuttles) that may have contributed biota to Fiji from New Caledonia, is supported by some geological evidence, although there is no evidence for the transport of taxa on shuttle fragments. Another vicariance explanation, the existence of a major continental landmass in the Pacific within the last 100 Myr (Atlantis theory), receives little support and appears unlikely. Extinction of lineages in source areas and persistence in the TSP has probably occurred many times and has resulted in misinterpretation of biogeographical data.
   Malesia has long been considered the major source region for the biota of oceanic islands in the TSP because of shared taxa and high species diversity. However, recent molecular studies have produced compelling support for New Caledonia and Australia as alternative important source areas. They also show dispersal events, and not vicariance, to have been the major contributors to the current biota of the TSP. Past extinction events can obscure interpretations of diversity patterns.

AB 1. In order to investigate seed dispersal by animals on a landscape scale, we developed the spatially explicit, individual-based mechanistic model SEED (Simulation of Epi- and Endozoochorous Seed Dispersal). The purpose of the model is to predict patterns and densities of seeds dispersed by animals (especially mammals) within a simulated landscape.
   2. The model was parameterized for sheep, cattle and deer as vectors but may be applied to other animals if data for parameterization is available. The model data base currently includes parameter values for about 100 plant species.
   3. Seed attachment to and seed detachment from the fur, as well as seed excretion after passage through the gut, are explicitly simulated by drawing randomly from distributions that were determined by standardized experiments. Animal movement is simulated as a correlated random walk, but to increase reality of the model, radio-tracking data of animals can also be used.
   4. A sensitivity analysis of SEED was conducted to identify the relative importance of plant and animal traits. The analysis highlighted where the main gaps in our knowledge of seed dispersal processes lie. Even though in our study endozoochorous dispersal had the higher potential for long-distance dispersal compared to epizoochory, there is only scarce knowledge about seed production and especially about the proportion of seeds eaten by an animal, parameters which were shown to be of major importance for dispersal.
   5. A comparison of variation in plant and animal traits, respectively, showed that dispersal kernels depend more on changes in the animal vector than on the comparably little variation a particular plant species can exhibit. For this reason, animal movement is, from all the dispersal-relevant parameters, the one for which more exact data is most urgently needed.
   6. Synthesis. The newly developed simulation model will help to understand, quantify and predict long-distance seed dispersal by animals. The possibility to incorporate real landscapes and movement data from very different animals makes the model generalizable and possibly applicable to a wide range of scientific and applied questions.

AB The influence of temporal and spatial heterogeneity in seed availability on the foraging behaviour of the harvester ant Messor arenarius was studied in an arid shrubland in the Negev Desert, Israel. The study investigated the implications of behavioural responses to heterogeneity in seed availability for the seed predation process and the potential for feedback effects on vegetation. Vegetation and seed rain were monitored across two landscape patch types (shrub patches and inter-shrub patches) in 1997. Shrub patches were shown to have higher plant and seed-rain density than inter-shrub patches. Patch use and seed selection by M. arenarius foragers were monitored through the spring, summer and autumn of 1997. After a pulse of seed production ill the spring, the ants exhibited very narrow diet breadth, specialising on a single annual grass species, Stipa capensis. At this time, ants were foraging and collecting seeds mainly from inter-shrub patches. In the summer, diet breadth broadened and use of shrub patches increased, although the rate of seed collection per unit area was approximately equal in the two patch types. The increase in the use of shrub patches was due to colony-level selection of foraging areas with relatively high shrub cover and an increase in the use of shrub patches by individual foragers. In the autumn, a pulse of seed production by the shrub species Atractylis serratuloides and Noaea mucronata led to a reduction in diet breadth as foragers specialised on these species. During this period, foragers exhibited a large increase in the proportion of time spent in shrub patches and in the proportion of food items collected from shrub patches. The seasonal patterns in foraging behaviour showed linked changes in seed selection and patch use resulting in important differences in the seed predation process between the two landscape patch types. For much of the study period, there was higher seed predation pressure on the inter-shrub patches, which were of relatively low productivity compared with the shrub patches. This suggests that the seed predation process may help maintain the spatial heterogeneity in the density of ephemeral plants in the landscape.

AB We studied effects of a major oil spill in Panama on injury, regeneration and growth of subtidal reef corals over 5 yr. Corals exhibited much higher levels of injury, faster regeneration rates and slower growth on heavily oiled reefs. Concentrations of hydrocarbons in reef sediments were significantly positively correlated with amounts of coral injury and significantly negatively correlated with coral growth. The probable cause of persistently high levels of coral injury is chronic exposure to sediments mixed with partially degraded oil that are exported from mangroves onto adjacent reefs. Injury apparently results in a reallocation of resources to regeneration and consequently decreased investment in fecundity and growth. There was no evidence of coral recovery 5 yr after the oil spill.

AB This paper is devoted to the analysis of the cyclic behavior of predator-prey systems under the assumption that the time responses of prey and predator are quite diversified. In such a case, a geometric approach (separation principle) based on the singular perturbation method can be applied to detect slow-fast limit cycles. The main characteristic of these cycles is that the fast component of the ecosystem is present at significantly high densities only during a fraction of the cycle. At the start and at the end points of this period the slow component of the ecosystem reaches its minimum and maximum densities, which are related to each other through an integral equation. This equation is specialized for the classical predator-prey model and is later used to study the cyclic behavior of more complex predator-prey systems, some of which were not fully understood up to now. The conclusion of the analysis is that the existence of slow-fast limit cycles can be ascertained by means of the separation principle, while the geometry of the cycle can be fully specified only by using the integral equation discussed in this paper.

AB Drylands are pattern-forming systems showing self-organized vegetation patchiness, multiplicity of stable states and fronts separating domains of alternative stable states. Pattern dynamics, induced by droughts or disturbances, can result in desertification shifts from patterned vegetation to bare soil. Pattern formation theory suggests various scenarios for such dynamics: an abrupt global shift involving a fast collapse to bare soil, a gradual global shift involving the expansion and coalescence of bare-soil domains and an incipient shift to a hybrid state consisting of stationary bare-soil domains in an otherwise periodic pattern. Using models of dryland vegetation, we address the question of which of these scenarios can be realized. We found that the models can be split into two groups: models that exhibit multiplicity of periodic-pattern and bare-soil states, and models that exhibit, in addition, multiplicity of hybrid states. Furthermore, in all models, we could not identify parameter regimes in which bare-soil domains expand into vegetated domains. The significance of these findings is that, while models belonging to the first group can only exhibit abrupt shifts, models belonging to the second group can also exhibit gradual and incipient shifts. A discussion of open problems concludes the paper.

AB Mineral-microbe interaction has been a key factor shaping the lithosphere of our planet since the Pre-cambrian. Detailed investigation has been mainly focused on the role of bioweathering in biomining processes, leading to the selection of highly efficient microbial inoculants for the recovery of metals. Here we expand this scenario, presenting additional applications of bacteria and fungi in mineral dissolution, a process with novel biotechnological potential that has been poorly investigated. The ability of microorganisms to trigger soil formation and to sustain plant establishment and growth are suggested as invaluable tools to counteract the expansion of arid lands and to increase crop productivity. Furthermore, interesting exploitations of mineral weathering microbes are represented by biorestoration and bioremediation technologies, innovative and competitive solutions characterized by economical and environmental advantages. Overall, in the future the study and application of the metabolic properties of microbial communities capable of weathering can represent a driving force in the expanding sector of environmental biotechnology.

AB The conservation of bison in Yellowstone National Park, from near extinction in the late 19th century to a recent high of 5000, has led to long-term societal conflict regarding perceived overabundance, transboundary movements, and potential transmission of brucellosis from bison to livestock. We synthesized available information to address two central questions in this debate: (1) has the Yellowstone bison population surpassed numbers that can be supported by the forage base in the park; and (2) why do some bison move outside the park during winter, even when numbers are below food-limited carrying capacity? A spatially-explicit model of the system that integrated abiotic variables with biotic processes indicated bison have not reached a theoretical food-limited carrying capacity of 6200 in Yellowstone National Park. However, more bison began to migrate earlier to lower-elevation winter ranges as numbers increased and climatic factors interacted with density to limit nutritional intake and foraging efficiency. A gradual expansion of the winter range as bison numbers increased enabled relatively constant population growth and increased food-limited carrying capacity. Current management actions attempt to preserve bison migration to essential winter range areas within and adjacent to the park, while actively preventing dispersal and range expansion to outlying areas via hazing and removals (i.e., dispersal sink). A population of 2500-4500 bison should satisfy collective interests concerning the park's forage base, bison movement ecology, retention of genetic diversity, brucellosis risk management, and prevailing social conditions.

AB 1. We evaluated one of the most extensive efforts to date to re-introduce an endangered species: attempts to establish an actively managed meta-population of African wild dogs Lycaon pictus in South Africa.
   2. Using an information-theoretic approach, known-fate modelling in program MARK was employed to estimate the survival of re-introduced wild dogs and their offspring, and to model covariate effects relative to survival. Multiple a priori hypotheses on correlates of re-introduction success were tested (collated from extensive individual experiences) using different re-introduction attempts as natural quasi experiments.
   3. Survival analyses revealed that the determinants of re-introduction success can be reduced to two factors relevant for management, suggesting that wild dog re-introductions should be attempted with socially integrated animals that are released into securely fenced areas, unless measures are implemented to mitigate human-related mortalities outside protected areas.
   4. Synthesis and application. This study illustrates that monitoring and evaluation of conservation efforts, complimented with expert knowledge, forms the foundation of informed decision-making to underpin management recommendations with scientific evidence, particularly if the proposed actions are controversial.

AB A 17-year monitoring programme of reef flats at Ko Phuket, Thailand afforded an opportunity to evaluate both univariate and multivariate measures of environmental stress in an assessment of change on coral reef ecosystems. The sites at Ko Phuket suffered the effects of dredging in 1986-1987 and then anomalously low sea levels in 1997-1998 as a result of climate-related events in the Indian Ocean. Univariate measures of species diversity and taxonomic distinctness (Delta*) increased across the reef flat, reflecting the greater effects of physical stresses on the inner reef flats (compared with outer reef flats) at all sites, with more congeneric species present on the inner reef and more confamilial species on the outer reef. Multivariate measures showed a clear breakdown in seriation patterns at all sites during the dredging in 1987 and in 1998, as a result of earlier negative sea-level anomalies. Recovery from environmental disturbances was obvious within 12 months in each case. The domination of the reefs by massive coral species, which are physiologically adapted to intertidal living and which display partial rather than total colony mortality, may be a factor contributing to the apparent resilience of the reef flats together with continued recruitment and survival of juvenile corals during adverse environmental conditions. Elevated sea temperatures and extensive bleaching of corals in 1991, 1995, and 1998 had no effect upon coral community measures, with many corals recovering their zooxanthellae numbers within 3-5 months of the bleaching events.

AB Runoff is one of the main water sources responsible for water redistribution within a given ecosystem. Water redistribution is especially important in arid regions, and may be of great importance an sandy dunes, where the likelihood of runoff is low owing to the high infiltration rates of sand. Redistribution of water may significantly affect plant and animal distribution, and may explain vegetation patterns within an ecosystem.
   Runoff yield over sandy dune slopes in the western Negev Desert was measured under natural conditions during 1990-1994. The magnitude of runoff yield on different slope sections and on north and south exposures was established. The results demonstrate that while slope position controlled the microbiotic crust cover, crust cover and crust biomass controlled the amounts of runoff obtained. Whereas no runoff was measured on the upper dune sections devoid of crust, only meagre quantities were measured on the midslope sections, characterized by discontinuous crust cover. Substantially larger amounts were, however, obtained at the bottoms of the slopes, characterized by continuous crust cover. North-facing slopes, usually characterized by a chlorophyll a content of 29-41 mg m(-2), yielded on average 3.2 times more runoff than south-facing footslopes, characterized by a 17 mg m(-2) chlorophyll a content. Whereas microbiotic crust was found to be responsible for runoff generation, additional water supply owing to runoff may also explain the occurrence of a high biomass crust and the dense vegetation belt at the dune-interdune interface of the northern exposure, where runoff tends to collect. Thus, whereas crust may reduce in filtration in certain habitats, runoff generated by crust may also be responsible for the promotion of crust growth in other habitats. Runoff may also be used to promote vegetation growth at the dune footslopes. The possibility of using runoff to facilitate agroforestry is discussed. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Studies in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon near to Low Isles indicate that significant increases in phytoplankton concentrations have occurred over the past 65 years. The results show a change from a system characterized by both centric and pennate diatoms to one that is now dominated by pennate diatoms and small flagellates. Such changes in class structure are indicative of anthropogenic eutrophication, the most likely cause of which is runoff from agricultural development. The remote nature of Low Isles suggests that the eutrophication is a large-scale phenomenon and as such poses both direct, e.g. by algal overgrowth, and indirect, e.g. by promotion of crown of thorns starfish, threats to many reefs in the GBR. The lack of recovery of the shallow-water coral cover at Low Isles and at other locations is consistent with the hypothesis that large-scale eutrophication is already a significant problem in the GBR lagoon.

AB Model systems have had a profound influence on the development of ecological theory and general principles. Compared to alternatives, the most effective models share some combination of the following characteristics: simpler, smaller, faster, general, idiosyncratic or manipulable. We argue that biological soil crusts (biocrusts) have unique combinations of these features that should be more widely exploited in community, landscape and ecosystem ecology. In community ecology, biocrusts are elucidating the importance of biodiversity and spatial pattern for maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality due to their manipulability in experiments. Due to idiosyncrasies in their modes of facilitation and competition, biocrusts have led to new models on the interplay between environmental stress and biotic interactions and on the maintenance of biodiversity by competitive processes. Biocrusts are perhaps one of the best examples of micro-landscapes-real landscapes that are small in size. Although they exhibit varying patch heterogeneity, aggregation, connectivity and fragmentation, like macro-landscapes, they are also compatible with well-replicated experiments (unlike macro-landscapes). In ecosystem ecology, a number of studies are imposing small-scale, low cost manipulations of global change or state factors in biocrust micro-landscapes. The versatility of biocrusts to inform such disparate lines of inquiry suggests that they are an especially useful model system that can enable researchers to see ecological principles more clearly and quickly.

AB Background: The evolutionary history of the biota of North Africa and Arabia is inextricably tied to the complex geological and climatic evolution that gave rise to the prevalent deserts of these areas. Reptiles constitute an exemplary group in the study of the arid environments with numerous well-adapted members, while recent studies using reptiles as models have unveiled interesting biogeographical and diversification patterns. In this study, we include 207 specimens belonging to all 12 recognized species of the genus Stenodactylus. Molecular phylogenies inferred using two mitochondrial (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA) and two nuclear (c-mos and RAG-2) markers are employed to obtain a robust time-calibrated phylogeny, as the base to investigate the inter- and intraspecific relationships and to elucidate the biogeographical history of Stenodactylus, a genus with a large distribution range including the arid and hyper-arid areas of North Africa and Arabia.
   Results: The phylogenetic analyses of molecular data reveal the existence of three major clades within the genus Stenodactylus, which is supported by previous studies based on morphology. Estimated divergence times between clades and sub-clades are shown to correlate with major geological events of the region, the most important of which is the opening of the Red Sea, while climatic instability in the Miocene is hypothesized to have triggered diversification. High genetic variability is observed in some species, suggesting the existence of some undescribed species. The S. petrii - S. stenurus species complex is in need of a thorough taxonomic revision. New data is presented on the distribution of the sister species S. sthenodactylus and S. mauritanicus.
   Conclusions: The phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus Stenodactylus presented in this work permits the reconstruction of the biogeographical history of these common desert dwellers and confirms the importance of the opening of the Red Sea and the climatic oscillations of the Miocene as major factors in the diversification of the biota of North Africa and Arabia. Moreover, this study traces the evolution of this widely distributed and highly specialized group, investigates the patterns of its high intraspecific diversity and elucidates its systematics.

AB Twenty-nine C-14 dates of precise biological sea-level indicators from the Lebanese coast show evidence for two significant regional crustal uplift episodes during the past 6000 years. We elucidate: (1) an upper shoreline at ca. +120 to +140 cm, which lasted from ca. 6000 to 3000 BP; and (2) a lower shoreline at +80 +/- 40 cm, developed between the fifth century BC and the sixth century AD. These movements are associated with: (1) two major seismic crises along the Yammuneh fault and the Roum-Tripoli Thrust (RTT); and (2) subsequent seismic events on a series of second-order ENE trending dextral transpressive faults. Vertical movements affected north Lebanon, whilst the coasts of south Lebanon generally underwent crustal downlift. This is in contrast with relative stability in northern Israel, suggesting an area of stationary tectonic conditions west of the Dead Sea-Rosh Hanikra/Ras Nakoura fault. The main C-14 age cluster, corresponding to the second uplift event, may have resulted from fault movements during the "Early Byzantine Tectonic Paroxysm" (EBTP), between ca. 1750 and 2000 BP. Relative sea level stabilised to present level around 1000 BP. (c) 2006 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

AB Indirect effects propagated through intervening species in a food web have important effects oil Community properties. Traditionally, these indirect effects have been conceptualized as mediated through density changes of the intervening species, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that those mediated through trait (phenotypic) responses also can be very important. Because density- and trait-mediated indirect effects have different properties, it is critical that we understand the mechanisms of transmission in order to predict how they will interact, and when or where they will be important.
   In this study, we examined the mechanisms and Consequences of the lethal (density-mediated) and,nonlethal (trait-mediated) effects of a larval odonate predator on a guild of four herbivore species (a larval anuran and three species of snails) and their resources. We also manipulated system productivity in order to explore the effects of environmental context oil the transmission of these two types of indirect effects. We show that trait-mediated effects arising from the predator can be very strong relative to density-mediated effects oil both the competing herbivores and the species composition and production of their resources. A number of these indirect effects are shown to be contingent on productivity of the system. We further present evidence that trait- and density-mediated indirect effects originating from a predator may be transmitted independently through different routes in a food web, particularly when spatial responses of the transmitting prey are involved. Finally, effects on prey growth due to trait responses to the predator varied from negative to positive in predictable ways as a function of time and indirect effects oil the larger food web. These results indicate the important role that trait-mediated indirect effects can play in trophic cascades and keystone predator interactions, and we discuss how the mechanisms involved can be incorporated in theory.

AB Although a few countries protect mangroves (USA, some states in Mexico), the systematic destruction of these ecosystems is increasing. Deforestation of mangrove communities is thought to be one of the major reasons for the decline in coastal fisheries of many tropical and subtropical countries. Although mangroves in the tropics can regenerate themselves or be restored using low-technology propagule planting, arid mangroves (areas having limited or no access to fresh water) can seldom regenerate, and if they do, it happens very slowly. To conserve arid tropical mangrove ecosystems, maintenance and restoration of the microbial communities is required. There is sufficient published evidence to propose a close microbe-nutrient-plant relationship that functions as a major mechanism for recycling and conserving essential nutrients in the mangrove ecosystem. The highly productive and diverse microbial community living in tropical and subtropical mangrove ecosystems continuously transforms dead vegetation into sources of nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients that can later be used by the plants. In turn, plant-root exudates serve as a food source for the microorganisms living in the ecosystem, with other plant material serving a similar role for larger organisms, such as crabs and detritus-feeding fish. This speculative synthesis of recent work on growth-promoting bacteria proposes that mangrove rhizosphere bacteria be used as a tool to enhance reforestation with mangrove seedlings. This can be done by inoculating seedlings with plant-growth-promoting bacteria participating in one or more of the microbial cycles of the ecosystem.

AB 1. In precocial birds, where the young feed themselves, the costs and benefits of brood size are still poorly understood. An experimental manipulation of brood size was employed to examine the effects of brood size on both parents and young in a wild population of barnacle geese [Branta leucopsis (Bechstein)] during brood-rearing on Svalbard.
   2. Social dominance of the family unit, the amount of vigilance behaviour of the parents, the growth of the goslings in the family unit and an index of body condition for female parents during moult were all positively correlated with brood size.
   3. When brood size changed as a result of natural events (i.e. predation or adoption) or experimental manipulation, rates of dominance, parental vigilance, gosling growth and female parent condition changed in a similar direction to the observed relation between the variable and brood size in unchanged broods.
   4. After fledging, the fast-growing goslings in large broods survived better during autumn migration, while there was no apparent net cost in survival or next-year breeding for the parents.
   5. Via a direct effect of brood size on dominance of the family unit, large broods were beneficial for both parent and young in a situation where there was strong intraspecific competition for the available food resources.
   6. This study provides a clear demonstration of a causal relationship between brood size and various components of both gosling and adult fitness and is of direct relevance to the phenomenon of adoption and the evolution of brood size in this species.

AB We present three models representing the trophic and behavioral dynamics of a simple food chain (primary producers, grazers, and predators) at temporal scales shorter than the scale of consumer reproduction, and at the spatial scales typically employed in field experiments. These models incorporate flexible behavioral responses of organisms to their predators and resources in spatially heterogeneous environments that are open to immigration and emigration. The basic models include passive immigration at all trophic levels, producer growth rates and losses to grazer consumption, grazer emigration rate as a behavioral response to producer and predator densities, grazer losses to predator consumption, and predator emigration as a function of grazer density. We model this system as: (1) a set of ordinary differential equations (''well-mixed model''); (2) a set of partial differential equations describing a population of discrete grazers foraging on discrete patches of primary producers (''discrete-grazer model''); and (3) a set of simulation rules describing the movement and foraging of individual grazers and the growth of primary producers on discrete patches in explicit space (''individual-based model''). The ordinary differential-equation models produced similar results to individual-based models with well-mixed producers, and the discrete-grazer and individual-based models produced similar results when grazers possessed a long-term memory of patch reward rates. The well-mixed and discrete-grazer models thus represent specific, limiting cases of the general individual-based model.
   Multiple equilibria and sustained oscillations are possible but are less likely in the discrete-grazer and individual-based models than in the well-mixed model, because localized foraging of discrete grazers leads to the rapid development of spatial heterogeneity in producer biomass and, hence, to a decrease in overall primary production. All models predict that stable equilibrium densities of all trophic levels increase with enrichment, provided grazers increase their emigration rates as predator density increases. If increasing predator density leads to decreasing grazer-emigration rates, predator and grazer densities increase, but producer biomass may increase or decrease with enrichment. These results contrast with predictions from models that assume ideal free distributions of grazers and/or predators with respect to their resources. Our models also predict that densities at all trophic levels will increase with increasing producer immigration, and that producer density will decline with increasing grazer immigration and increase with increasing predator immigration. Our qualitative findings on enrichment are used to interpret an experiment dealing with the short-term dynamics of a stream community open to grazers and predators.

AB Savannas are highly dynamic, and reactions to particular events, such as fire or temporarY drought, are transmitted through the ecosystem by interactions between different components. Indigenous herbivores respond to spatial and temporal variations in the vegetation by selectivity of forage on scales from landscape to a single bite, and by demographic changes. Herbivory itself induces changes in plants and vegetation, which in turn may promote or deter further foraging. Domestic herbivores are less mobile than many wild species, impeding large-scale selectivity, and are kept at less variable and usually higher densities, which prevents small-scale selectivity. Livestock numbers decrease following fodder shortage, only after a considerable timelag. Herbivores may interact with competitive patterns between woody and herbaceous vegetation as well as with fire regimes, and may thus be involved in large-scale physiognomic dynamics of savannas.

AB Quantitative coral damage assessment by means of line transects was performed in several northern Red Sea coral reef sites in Israel (Eilat) and Egypt (Hurghada area). Reefs with high and low visitor frequency were compared. For both reef systems, breakage was found to be the most common damage category, being significantly higher on highly frequented reefs. Also, all observed damage (breakage, tissue loss, algal overgrowth) was most frequent within the first ten meters depth. A significant difference in the amount of corals overgrown by algae was found on the reefs near Hurghada as compared to all other reefs. Algal overgrowth was correlated with the occurrence of tissue loss and breakage, being considered as a consequence of pollution or the former damage types. In all cases of damage, Acropora was the most frequently affected genus, while Millepora dichotoma was the most affected species.

AB In this overview (introductory article to a special issue including 14 papers), we consider all main types of natural and artificial inland freshwater habitas (fwh). For each type, we identify the main biodiversity patterns and ecological features, human impacts on the system and environmental issues, and discuss ways to use this information to improve stewardship. Examples of selected key biodiversity/ecological features (habitat type): narrow endemics, sensitive (groundwater and GDEs); crenobionts, LIHRes (springs); unidirectional flow, nutrient spiraling (streams); naturally turbid, floodplains, large-bodied species (large rivers); depth-variation in benthic communities (lakes); endemism and diversity (ancient lakes); threatened, sensitive species (oxbow lakes, SWE); diverse, reduced littoral (reservoirs); cold-adapted species (Boreal and Arctic fwh); endemism, depauperate (Antarctic fwh); flood pulse, intermittent wetlands, biggest river basins (tropical fwh); variable hydrologic regime-periods of drying, flash floods (arid-climate fwh). Selected impacts: eutrophication and other pollution, hydrologic modifications, overexploitation, habitat destruction, invasive species, salinization. Climate change is a threat multiplier, and it is important to quantify resistance, resilience, and recovery to assess the strategic role of the different types of freshwater ecosystems and their value for biodiversity conservation. Effective conservation solutions are dependent on an understanding of connectivity between different freshwater ecosystems (including related terrestrial, coastal and marine systems).

AB The mysterious fairy circles' are vegetation-free discs that cover vast areas along the pro-Namib Desert. Despite 30 yr of research their origin remains unknown. Here we adopt a novel approach that focuses on analysis of the spatial patterns of fairy circles obtained from representative 25-ha aerial images of north-west Namibia. We use spatial point pattern analysis to quantify different features of their spatial structures and then critically inspect existing hypotheses with respect to their ability to generate the observed circle patterns. Our working hypothesis is that fairy circles are a self-organized vegetation pattern. Finally, we test if an existing partial-differential-equation model, that was designed to describe vegetation pattern formation, is able to reproduce the characteristic features of the observed fairy circle patterns. The model is based on key-processes in arid areas such as plant competition for water and local resource-biomass feedbacks. The fairy circles showed at all three study areas the same regular spatial distribution patterns, characterized by Voronoi cells with mostly six corners, negative correlations in their size up to a distance of 13 m, and remarkable homogeneity over large spatial scales. These results cast doubts on abiotic gas-leakage along geological lines or social insects as causal agents of their origin. However, our mathematical model was able to generate spatial patterns that agreed quantitatively in all of these features with the observed patterns. This supports the hypothesis that fairy circles are self-organized vegetation patterns that emerge from positive biomass-water feedbacks involving water transport by extended root systems and soil-water diffusion. Future research should search for mechanisms that explain how the different hypotheses can generate the patterns observed here and test the ability of self-organization to match the birth- and death dynamics of fairy circles and their regional patterns in the density and size with respect to environmental gradients.

TI Bergmann's rule in mammals: a cross-species interspecific pattern

AB Although Bergmann's rule - stating that among closely related species, the bigger ones will inhabit the colder climates/higher latitudes - was formulated for inter-specific comparisons, most analyses that tested this pattern in mammals were on an intra-specific level. To date, no large-scale taxonomy-driven cross-species evaluation of the pattern predicted by Bergmann exists. Here we show, in a dataset comprising 3561 mammal species from 26 orders, that while there is no significant correlation between latitude and body mass using conventional methods, this correlation is highly significant when the phylogenetic structure of the dataset is accounted for, thus supporting Bergmann's claim that the rule only applies to closely related species. Analyses of different subsets indicate that the Bergmann's rule is evident across a variety of latitude ranges. In many taxonomic subsets, when analysed alone, there is no significant correlation between body mass and latitude. In combination with both the significant relationship in the overall dataset and with results of intra-specific analyses from the literature, this suggests that Bergmann's rule describes a fundamental principle within mammals, but that its expression has been modified by a variety of factors during mammalian diversification yet to be resolved.

   RATES; FOOD-INTAKE; FEEDING-BEHAVIOR; CANOPY STRUCTURE; DIET SELECTION;
   PATCH CHOICE; SWARD HEIGHT
AB Organisms respond to their heterogeneous environment in complex ways at many temporal and spatial scales. Here, I examine how the smallest scale process in foraging by mammalian herbivores, taking a bite, influences plants and herbivores over larger scales. First, because cropping bites competes with chewing them, bite size influences short-term intake rate of herbivores within plant patches. On the other hand, herbivores can chew bites while searching for new ones, thus influencing the time spent vigilant and intake rate as animals move among food patches. Therefore, bite size affects how much time herbivores must spend foraging each day. Because acquiring energy is necessary for fitness, herbivores recognize the importance of bite size and select bites, patches and diets based on tradeoffs between harvesting rates, digestion, and sheering forces. In turn, induced structural defenses of plants, such as thorns, allow plants to respond immediately to herbivory by reducing bite size and thus tissue loss. Over evolutionary time, herbivores have adapted mouth morphology that allows them to maximize bite size on their primary forage plant, whereas plants faced with large mammalian herbivores have adapted structures such as divarication that minimize bite size and protect themselves from herbivory. Finally, bite size available among plant communities can drive habitat segregation and migration of larger herbivores across landscapes.

AB In classical polyandry, sex roles are reversed and a female reproduces with several males, each of whom raises his offspring with little or no help from her. This mating system occurs in some fishes and birds, and it is of great interest in relation to parental investment, sex role and sexual selection theory. The evolution of classical polyandry, however, is debated and not well understood. It is here suggested to generally take place in three main steps. (1) First evolves male care for eggs, for reasons that differ between fishes and birds. (2) Second, a female becomes able to lay more eggs than a male can accommodate. This can happen, for example, by evolution of male pregnancy or smaller body size, or by female production of more or larger eggs, made possible by larger female body size or more food. Polyandry in several taxa is associated with shift to a habitat rich in food during the breeding season, to novel specialised foraging methods, or to both. A favourable food situation may be crucial for evolution of classical polyandry. (3) In step three, females compete to lay two or more clutches in sequence for different males. Successful polyandrous females obtain more offspring, spreading traits that enhance success in competition over males. Step three may be most likely in species with small body size, for reasons of reproductive constraints and seasonality. Evolution of classical polyandry appears to have followed these steps in shorebirds, coucals and pipefishes, but the reasons why certain species differ from their close phylogenetic relatives in being polyandrous are far from clear. Behavioural and ecological studies of additional species, and detailed phylogenies of taxa with diverse mating systems including polyandry, are needed for testing these ideas.

DE pastoralism; livestock; saiga antelope; density dependence; Soviet Union
ID POPULATION-DYNAMICS; SAIGA ANTELOPE
AB We examine factors regulating numbers of domestic livestock and saiga antelopes during the major periods of Kazakhstan's history. In the pre-Soviet period livestock migrations were relatively unrestricted and covered huge distances. Little winter feed or veterinary care was provided for domestic livestock and numbers were regulated largely by winter snow or ice cover. Drought affected fecundity but did not cause large-scale mortality. During the Soviet period the provision of winter feed shielded domestic livestock from winter mortality while hunting controls allowed saiga numbers to recover from over-hunting. Livestock and saiga numbers during this period were high and there is evidence that productivity was affected. However, there were no crashes in livestock numbers linked to high densities, probably because rainfall variability is relatively low and catastrophic droughts are rare. Today livestock numbers in Kazakhstan have crashed because of the withdrawal of state support and the use of animals as currency. The collapse of the state also meant the end of hunting controls and increased poverty, which has lead to widespread saiga poaching and dramatic population declines.

AB POLDSIP 1.0 is a free software package to estimate the distribution of pollen dispersal distances from mother-offspring diploid genotypic data. It requires the spatial coordinates and genotypes of a sample of seed plants and their respective maternal progenies, providing estimates of the average, variance and kurtosis of the pollen dispersal curve. POLDSIP also estimates the effective reproductive density of pollen donors and the correlation of paternity within and among maternal sibships. POLDSIP is useful for characterizing the spatial scale of pollen dispersal, for assessing the variation in male fertility and for investigating biological factors affecting correlated paternity in plants.

AB 1. The functional response, i.e. the quantity of food consumed per unit of time as a function of food availability, is a central process in foraging ecology. The application of this concept to foraging by mammalian herbivores has led to major insights into the process of resource acquisition, but it has so far been little used to understand foraging in avian herbivores.
   2. In this study, we describe the functional responses of three grazing Anatidae, the wigeon Anas penelope L. (mean body mass in this study 620 g), the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis B. (2000 g), and the greylag goose Anser anser L. (3500 g). We measured instantaneous intake rates on eight grass heights from 1 cm to 12 cm, as well as pecking rates and peck sizes, and used the Spalinger-Hobbs model developed for mammalian herbivores to explore the mechanisms limiting intake in these three species.
   3. Greylag geese increased their intake rate with increasing food availability (a Type II response), wigeon showed a weak quadratic (Type IV) response, and intake rate by barnacle geese did not vary significantly across the range of variability we offered the birds.
   4. Intake rates differed markedly between individuals, especially in greylag geese, where body mass explained much of the variation. For individuals in all three species, peck sizes strongly influenced instantaneous intake rates, and the size of the bill (width in particular) appeared to be an important determinant of peck size.
   5. Peck sizes increased with sward height (although only very weakly in wigeon), but so did cropping time for wigeon and barnacle geese, which led to a significant decline of intake rates on the tallest grass, at least in the small wigeon. For these very selective small herbivores, the time to crop a mouthful was therefore a significant limiting factor for the birds' instantaneous intake rate (in addition to peck size and swallowing time). This differs markedly from the situation in mammalian herbivores where bite size (through chewing time) is the principal controlling process in food concentrated patches, a result that we found in greylag geese. We discuss the differences in foraging between the three species in relation to their principal food resources, body mass and bill morphology.

AB Patterns of rodent seed predation in extensive cereal croplands of central Spain were investigated by measuring rodent predation rates on artificial seed patches, together with seed availability, rodent abundance and habitat physiognomy. Sampling was designed to cope with the spatial and temporal variability of factors potentially affecting rodent activity (natural and man-made habitat features, season and moonlight). Rodent predation was unpredictably distributed in summer. In winter, rodents foraged on average in the patches least used by man; moonlight, however, did alter this pattern, so that rodent predation was closely associated with shrubs in the bright nights nad evenly distributed in the dark ones. I conclude that the need of stable underground refuges and predation risk in the winter period seemed to be the main factors constraining rodent foraging activity in the man-made ecosystem studied.

AB Despite differences in focus, goals, and strategies between conservation biology and animal welfare, both are inextricably linked in many ways, and greater consideration of animal welfare, although important in its own right, also has considerable potential to contribute to conservation success. Nevertheless, animal welfare and animal ethics are not always considered explicitly within conservation practice. We systematically reviewed the recent scientific peer-reviewed and online gray literature on reintroductions of captive-bred and wild-caught animals (mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles) to quantify the occurrence of animal welfare issues. We considered monitoring that could be indicative of the animal's welfare status and supportive management actions that could improve animal welfare (regardless of whether the aim was explicitly animal-welfare orientated). Potential welfare issues (of variable nature and extent) were recorded in 67% of 199 projects reviewed; the most common were mortality >50%, dispersal or loss of animals, disease, and human conflict. Most (>70%) projects monitored survival, 18% assessed body condition, and 2% monitored stress levels. Animal welfare, explicitly, was referred to in 6% of projects. Supportive actions, most commonly use of on-site prerelease pens and provision of supplemental food or water, were implemented in 79% of projects, although the extent and duration of support varied. Practitioners can address animal-welfare issues in reintroductions by considering the potential implications for individual animals at all stages of the release process using the decision tree presented. We urge practitioners to report potential animal-welfare issues, describe mitigation actions, and evaluate their efficacy to facilitate transparent evaluation of common moral dilemmas and to advance communal strategies for dealing with them. Currently, comparative mortality rates, health risks, postrelease stress, effectiveness of supportive measures, and behavior of individuals warrant further research to improve animal welfare in reintroductions and to increase success of such projects.

AB Phosphate contamination can negatively affect corals, modifying growth rates, skeletal density, reproduction, mortality, and zooxanthellae. We determined the effects of elevated phosphate on coral growth and density. Genetically distinct colonies of Acropora muricata were sub-divided and distributed among three 110-L aquaria, and exposed to phosphate levels of 0.09, 0.20, and 0.50 mg L-1 for four months. Total skeletal length, living tissue length, weight, branch production, and polyp extension were measured. Linear extension and tissue growth increased under all conditions. Growth rates were highest at a phosphate concentration of 0.50 mg L-1. Weight increased through time, graded from low to high with phosphate concentration. Density decreased through time, and was significantly lowest in the high phosphate treatment. Phosphate concentration produced no visible effects of stress on the corals, as indicated by polyp extension and lack of mortality. It is suggested that the phosphate enhanced growth was due to increased zooxanthellar populations and photosynthetic production within the coral. Skeletal density reduction may be due to phosphate binding at the calcifying surface and the creation of a porous and structurally weaker calcium carbonate/calcium phosphate skeleton. Increased phosphate concentrations, often characteristic of eutrophic conditions, caused increased coral growth but also a more brittle skeleton. The latter is likely more susceptible to breakage and damage from other destructive forces (e.g., bioerosion) and makes increased coral growth a poor indicator of reef health.

AB Despite the current interest in using closed areas for fisheries management, few studies have actually examined the benefits for invertebrate fisheries such as scallops. This study details the dynamics of a population of great scallops Pecten maximus (L.), within a closed area and an adjacent fished area off the Isle of Man, over a 14 yr period (1989 to 2003). Scallop densities were very low in both areas when the closed area was set up, but increased at an accelerated rate over time within the closed area. Scallop densities also increased on the adjacent fishing ground, but not to the same extent. Consequently, the density of scallops above the minimum legal landing size (110 mm SL) was more than 7 times higher in the closed area than in the fished area by 2003. There was also a shift towards much older and larger scallops in the closed area and, correspondingly, lower estimates of total mortality. Experimental dredging of 2 plots within the closed area confirmed that fishing drove these differences in population dynamics and structure. These patterns of scallop density, age and size structure resulted in the exploitable biomass (adductor muscle and gonad) of scallops being nearly 11 times higher in the closed area than in the fished area by 2003, and the reproductive biomass was 12.5 times higher. This is significant for fisheries management because the build up of high densities of large P. maximus individuals enhanced local reproductive potential and therefore the likelihood of export of larvae to the surrounding fishing grounds. Along with these direct benefits of closed area protection, juvenile scallops had higher survival and individual growth rates in the closed area, apparently in response to reduced fishing disturbance. Although juvenile scallops are not subject to direct removal by fishing, protection during this critical phase therefore appeared to assist the recovery of the closed area population. In summary, this study joins a growing number indicating that the use of closed areas offers a range of benefits over more traditional methods of managing fisheries. Fisheries for relatively sedentary and long-lived species such as P. maximus appear to be particularly suitable for this type of management.

AB Gross and net O-2 production between May 1996 and February 1999 was determined in bottle incubation experiments with (H2O)-O-18 spike and from the change in O-2 concentration. Carbon fixation rates were obtained from C-14 incubations. In general, production rates determined using the H,H-2(18)-spike were about twice the primary production determined by the C-14 method, where the latter was close to net oxygen evolution. These relationships are similar to results for the open ocean. During the spring bloom, when the dinoflagellate Peridinium was abundant, the ratio of gross O-2 production to carbon fixation was about 7.5, and net O-2 production was greater than carbon fixation. The difference between O-2 gross production and carbon fixation results, at least in part, from uptake by Mehler reaction and from recycling of the C-14 tracer by dark respiration and the alternative oxidase (AOX). We used the difference in isotopic discrimination against O-18, occurring during O-2 consumption by various biological pathways, to place constraints on the relative engagement of these pathways. We estimated the overall discrimination against O-18 in the lake from O-2 isotopic mass balance as 20.5-29parts per thousand. The only mechanism that can explain the strong overall fractionation in the lake is AOX, which strongly discriminates against O-18 (similar to31parts per thousand). Our results show, for the first time, that uptake by AOX is widespread and quantitatively important to oxygen consumption in aquatic systems.

AB The spawning biology of the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina on Heron Reef, Australia, was investigated to identify putative environmental and endogenous factors controlling spawning. Spawnings by II. asinina were highly regular and, in comparison to most other haliotids and marine invertebrates, frequent and extremely synchronous. These events appeared to be regulated by more than 1 environmental cue. The spawning season of H. asinina extends from October to April and is associated with an increase in water temperature. During the spawning season, recently captured abalone, housed in flow-through aquaria, released gametes for 2 nights every 2 wk during the new and full moons. However, the exact date of spawning did not correlate precisely with the lunar cycle. Occasionally the spawning events between 2 populations of H. asinina on Heron Reef that were 1.5 km apart differed by 1 d, suggesting that differential tidal regimes might influence the date of spawning. The population that was exposed to slightly longer spring low tides occasionally spawned 1 d earlier. In the aquaria, the onset of male spawnings was earlier than the onset of female spawnings by an average of 31 min. The time of spawning of either sex was highly correlated with the evening high tide; males spawned an average of 19 min prior to the high tide, and females spawned 11 min after the high tide. Spawnings were highly synchronous amongst individuals, with 90% commencing spawning within 89 min of the first individual that spawned. A greater percentage of individuals spawned when in the presence of the opposite sex and the frequency of male ejaculation was greater when in the presence of females. Synchronous spawning patterns persisted for 6 wk in H. asinina maintained in aquaria; after this period, spawnings continued but were irregular and asynchronous. We propose that low tide exposure and time of high tide indirectly regulate the date and time of spawning respectively, and that these tidal elements influence the spawning biology of H. asinina by maintaining endogenous rhythms that persist in non-tidal environments for at least 6 wk.

AB Compared to the catastrophic impacts of various environmental disturbances and the subsequent recovery of scleractinian coral communities from these events, little is known about the early successional dynamics of coral communities following major volcanic eruptions. The 1988 volcanic eruption of Gunung Api, Banda Islands, Indonesia, provided a unique opportunity to study the rate at which a reef-building coral community develops on an andesitic lava flow. Coral colonization was studied at three locations varying in substrate characteristics. Five years after the eruption, the sheltered lava flow supported a diverse coral community (124 species) with high coral cover (x) over bar = 61.6% +/- 7.5. Tabulate acroporids were a dominant component of the lava flow coral community, with some colonies measuring over 90 cm in diameter. Higher average coral diversity, coral abundance and cover were recorded on the andesitic lava flow than on an adjacent carbonate reef not covered by the lava, and on a substrate of unstable pyroclastic deposits located on the southwestern coast of the volcano. In some areas of high coral diversity and environmental stability, andesitic lava flows may create local hot-spots of coral diversity by providing a structurally complex, predator-free and stable substrate for the recruitment of coral species from the adjacent and regional species pools.

AB Aim Variations in body size are well established for many taxa of endotherms and ectotherms, but remain poorly documented for marine invertebrates. Here we explore how body size varies with latitude, temperature and productivity for a major marine invertebrate class, the Bivalvia. Location Continental shelves world-wide. Methods We used regression models to assess univariate relationships between size and latitude as well as multivariate relationships between size, latitude and environmental parameters (mean and seasonality in temperature and mean productivity). The dataset consisted of 4845 species in 59 families from shelf depths at all latitudes in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. We also used Blomberg's K to assess whether sizelatitude relationships show phylogenetic signal, and test whether functional groups based on feeding mode, substrate relationships, mobility and fixation can account for observed sizelatitude trends. Results Sizelatitude trends are taxonomically and geographically common in bivalves, but vary widely in sign and strength no simple explanations based on environmental parameters, phylogeny or functional group hold across all families. Perhaps most importantly, we found that the observed trends vary considerably between hemispheres and among coastlines. Main conclusions Broadly generalizable macroecological patterns in inter-specific body size may not exist for marine invertebrates. Although sizelatitude trends occur in many bivalve lineages, the underlying mechanisms evidently differ among regions and/or lineages. Fully understanding macroecological patterns requires truly global datasets as well as information about the evolutionary history of specific lineages and regions.

AB Catastrophic regime shifts (CRS) are large-scale, long-lasting changes in ecosystems. Such regime shifts can lead to degradation of ecological services and attendant economic losses. In this paper, we study the impacts of noises and time delay in the vegetation model of grazing ecosystems. We show that the noises only induce frequent CRS, however the combination of the noises and large time delay lead to permanent CRS. For small time delay, the mean first-passage time (MFPT) of CRS from the vegetated state to the desert state as functions of the noise intensities exhibits a maximum, and the noise-enhanced stability of grazing ecosystems is observed. However for large time delay, the MFPT is monotonically decreasing functions of the noise intensities, thus the noises accelerate CRS. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB Species relocation programmes are increasingly performed with the intention of establishing a self-sustaining population of threatened or declining native species. However, the use of experimental quantitative approaches in species relocation programmes is still relatively uncommon, despite a number of international studies recommending clear guidelines and standards. This paper evaluates species relocation programmes conducted within Australia to assess how programmes performed in relation to such standards. The search techniques identified 54 species relocation programmes, the majority of which were reintroductions (52%) and supplementations (30%). Only 25 (46%) of the species relocation programmes claimed success, with a lack of effective predator control recognized as contributing to the failure of 14 programmes. There was considerable variation in the quality of species relocation programmes in relation to key features such as whether the programme integrated experimental approaches with testable hypotheses, whether there were explicit statements of criteria for success, whether suitable habitat was identified for the release site and whether long-term monitoring was conducted. We propose guidelines to improve scientific rigour and success rates of species relocation programmes.

AB In this study we investigated vegetation changes superimposed by grazing and their effect on small mammals in the Karoo (South Africa) on grazed farmland and an adjacent, 10-year livestock enclosure. Plains and drainage line habitats were compared by monitoring vegetation height and cover, and small mammal species composition and abundance along transects. Animals were captured by live trapping. Vegetation cover was low on the grazed compared to the ungrazed study site, but vegetation height did not differ. The number of small mammal individuals and the number of species captured was higher at the ungrazed study site. Two species of climbing rodents captured in the ungrazed drainage line were absent from the grazed drainage line. Numbers of small mammals captured on the plains were similar for grazed and ungrazed land, but grazed plains were dominated by a single species of gerbil. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB Seventeen populations of T. hermanni in Greece differed substantially in mean adult body size? over a range of about one and a half times in length and three times in mass. Females were the larger sex in all populations: the degree of sexual size dimorphism did not vary with mean body size. The proximate cause of the variation of body size among populations was differences in the duration of growth, rather than egg or hatchling size or the growth rates of juveniles. The age at maturity (alpha) increased with body size in the 17 populations. while the Bertalanffy growth constant (li) decreased with body size. The quantities alpha M and M/k (where M is the instantaneous mortality rate) were invariant with body size, suggesting that differences between populations were adaptive rather than the result of short-term disturbance. Body size was greater in cooler areas. and increased with both latitude and altitude. This pattern is opposite to that found in most ectotherms (the reverse Bergmann's rule), and to that which occurs between tortoise species. Several hypotheses about the possible ultimate causes of variation of body size were rejected, including adaptation to long-term habitat disturbance (land use), character displacement, social factors, energetics, thermoregulation, r-K selection, the length of the season available for incubation, or differences in juvenile mortality. The most likely ultimate cause of size variation between sites is differences in adult mortality, the correlation with environmental temperature being through the frequency of fires.

AB Successional patterns in seed rain, seed predation; seed bank, and the density and survival of seedlings were studied for fleshy-fruited plants in a patchy vegetation of dry grassland with interspersed scrub in central Europe. These hay meadows were abandoned 20-30 years ago. Three successional scrub stages (phases) and the adjacent mown and abandoned meadows were used for the investigation. Seeds of 29 fleshy-fruited species were collected in seed traps over two years. The spatial pattern of seed dispersal strongly depended on the successional stage: seed rain density was highest beneath the mature scrub phase and lowest in the grassland. This was also true for seed predation by rodents, and frequency of fleshy-fruited plants in the seed bank. The density of seedlings showed a different pattern; it was highest in the intermediate phase of scrub development. In this phase the seed rain was less abundant than under the mature phase, but the destructive influence of seed predation and the mortality of seedlings (particularly due to shading) were not as strong as beneath the mature phase. Therefore, it can be assumed that this intermediate phase is a regeneration window for fleshy-fruited scrub species.

AB In 1986 a major oil spill in Panama polluted and killed extensive areas of coral reefs. Five years afterwards, reef areas are chronically threatened by oil and large amounts of sediments containing toxic hydrocarbons trapped in mangroves. Sublethal effects of oil on coral reproduction were evaluated 39 months after the spill using healthy and injured colonies of the reef-building coral Siderastrea siderea at heavily oiled and unoiled reefs. Number of reproductive colonies and number of gonads per polyp were not sensitive to level of oiling, but gonads were significantly larger at unoiled than oiled reefs during spawning periods. Colonies with recent injuries demonstrated a consistent decrease in fecundity relative to uninjured parts of the same colonies. Years after the spill, the increased number of injuries and associated reduction in colony size, and decreased size of gonads (eggs) on oiled reefs can reduce the number of reproductively viable colonies and gametes in coral populations, and ultimately reduce population survival.

AB Nest predation has been hypothesized as a major factor influencing clutch size in birds. Indirect and correlative evidence for clutch size reduction under high nest predation risk is accumulating, but such a reduction has never been shown experimentally. We experimentally tested this "nest predation hypothesis" by manipulating nest predation rate in the Collared Flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis. As predicted, clutch size decreased in the year following the experiment in "depredated" areas (in which 20-35% of the nests were totally depredated) compared to control ones (no predation). This could result from (1) phenotypic plasticity in clutch size, or (2) differential breeding habitat selection, with dominant individuals or individuals laying large clutches preferentially leaving depredated areas and settling in control ones. There was no evidence for differential dispersal from areas of the two treatments, nor differential competitive abilities of breeders in areas of the two treatments. Conversely, all individuals had a smaller clutch size in depredated areas, supporting the hypothesis of clutch size plasticity. These results provide experimental support for the nest predation hypothesis of clutch size variation in birds and suggest the importance of information available to individual birds on local nest predation risk and previous experience for determining clutch size.

AB Corridors that connect patches of disjunct habitat may be promising tools for mediating the negative impacts of habitat fragmentation, but little is known about how corridors affect ecological interactions. In eight 12-ha experimental landscapes, we examined how corridors affect the impact of invertebrate, rodent, and avian seed predators on pokeweed, Phytolacca americana. Over 13 months in 2000 and 2001, we quantified the effects of patch shape, connectivity, and predator type on the number of seeds germinating in the field (germinants), seed removal, and the viability of remaining seeds.
   Corridors did not affect the number of P. americana germinants in experimental exclosures or the viability of seeds remaining in exclosures. However, corridors affected the removal of seeds in a predator-specific manner: invertebrates removed more seeds in unconnected patches, whereas rodents removed more seeds in connected patches. Seed removal by birds was similar in connected and unconnected patches. Total seed removal by all seed predators was not affected by corridors, because invertebrates removed more seeds where rodents removed fewer seeds, and vice versa. Overall, seed predation significantly reduced the number and viability of remaining seeds, and reduced the number of germinants in 2000 but not in 2001. The abundance of naturally occurring P. americana plants in our experimental patches in 2000 decreased with increasing seed removal from exclosures but was not related to viability or germinants in 2000, suggesting that seed removal may shape the distribution and abundance of this species.
   Complementary patterns of seed removal by rodents and invertebrates suggest that corridors alter the effects of these predator taxa by changing the relative amounts of edge and core (nonedge) habitats in a patch. Because invertebrates and rodents do not completely overlap in the seeds they consume, corridors may change predation pressure on seeds that are primarily consumed by one predator type, with potential consequences for the composition of plant and seed predator communities.

AB There has been little experimental work in West Africa that distinguishes grazing from climate effects on rangeland vegetation. In the absence of such knowledge, the recurrence of boom-bust cycles in livestock populations, along with the seemingly degraded state of semiarid range, have been used to support notions of the inevitability of overgrazing. Regional stocking rates are used as indicators of degradation potential. I argue that the persistent reliance by environmental analysts on carrying-capacity models oversimplifies range ecology and excludes social processes from causal analyses. Both regional stocking rates and the seasonality of livestock distributions should be treated as proximate factors, each affected by biophysical and socioeconomic conditions. The common assumption that the size of local livestock populations is primarily affected by bioclimatic factors results from a misunderstanding of the pastoral economy. A case study examines the underlying causes of the cattle population boom in the Maasina during the 1960s. Rather than being solely a biological phenomenon, growth in the Maasina cattle population resulted from the historical confluence of inoculation programs with greater local demand for covert accumulation brought about by the changing social relations between the Fulbetae and the Rimaybetae.

AB Physical characterization and chemical analysis of settled dusts collected in Xi'an from November 2007 to December 2008 show that (1) dust deposition rates ranged from 14.6 to 350.4 g m(-2) yr(-1). The average deposition rate (76.7 g m(-2) yr(-1)) ranks the 11th out of 56 dust deposition rates observed throughout the world. The coal-burning power was the major particle source; (2) on average (except site 4), similar to 10% of the settled dusts having size <2.6, similar to 30% having size <10.5, and >70% having size <30 mu m; (3) the concentrations for 20 out of 27 elements analyzed were upto 18 times higher than their soil background values in China. With such high deposition rates of dusts that contain elevated levels of toxic elements, actions should be taken to reduce emission and studies are needed to assess the potential impacts of settled particles on surface ecosystem, water resource, and human health in the area.

AB The objective of this work was to evaluate the spatial and temporal impact of dust-pollution in the vicinity of a cement industry, located in an area with dry climate. The spatial impact integrated over time was evaluated from the concentrations of Ca, Fe and Mg in in-situ Xanthoria parietina. The temporal pattern was assessed through one-month transplants of the lichen Ramalina canariensis. Four potential sources of atmospheric dust were evaluated: the limestone-quarry; the unpaved roads, the deposit area and the cement mill. Calcium concentration in lichens was considered the best cement-dust indicator. Different types of dust (clinker and grinded-limestone-dust) resulted in different time-patterns of Ca accumulation, which was also related with the different influence that wet and dry periods have in the lichen accumulation process. The dust pollution was found to be deposited locally and dependent on: the nature of dust particles and the volume and frequency of precipitation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 1. We analysed patterns of variability and correlations in skulls and teeth of a wide (> 100 species; > 17 000 specimens) sample of terrestrial carnivores.
   2. Within species, larger craniodental components vary less than do smaller ones.
   3. The higher variability of canines in comparison with lower carnassials probably reflects the low complexity of the former.
   4. Among species, however, trait variation is not size-related, suggesting that the higher intraspecific variability of small traits is not an artefact of measurement error.
   5. Correlations between the carnassial teeth are higher in carnivores feeding mainly on vertebrates than in those that eat mostly invertebrates or fruit, suggesting that the degree of functional integration between these teeth is under differing selective pressures.
   6. Correlations between the carnassials probably have a phylogenetic basis as well, with caniform carnivores having higher correlation coefficients than feliform ones.

AB Valuation of nature is an important aspect of nature conservation and restoration. Understanding valuation in a broad sense may contribute to conservation strategies since it may lead to better support from society. In this article we propose a model of valuation with respect to conservation and restoration of nature. According to the model, valuation of nature can be characterized by a "valuation approach," consisting of ecological, ethical and aesthetic perspectives. Such an approach includes scientific and normative aspects and leads to a particular claim of conservation. In this paper we discuss different perspectives, and accordingly, we sketch three main types of these valuation approaches. Political and policy issues with respect to nature conservation and restoration are considered in terms of this model.

AB Populations experiencing consistent differences in predation risk and resource availability are expected to follow divergent evolutionary trajectories. For example, live-history theory makes specific predictions for how predation should drive life-history evolution, and according to the Trexler-DeAngelis model for the evolution of matrotrophy, postfertilization maternal provisioning is most likely to evolve in environments with consistent, high levels of resource availability. Using the model system of Bahamas mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) inhabiting blue holes with and without the piscivorous bigmouth sleeper (Gobiomorus dormitor), we provide some of the strongest tests of these predictions to date, as resource availability does not covary with predation regime in this system, and we examine numerous (14) isolated natural populations. We found clear evidence for the expected life-history divergence between predation regimes and empirical support of the Trexler-DeAngelis model. Moreover, based on molecular and lab-rearing data, our study offers strong evidence for convergent evolution of similar life histories in similar predation regimes, largely matching previous phenotypic patterns observed in other poeciliid lineages (Brachyrhaphis spp., Poecilia reticulata), and further supports the notion that matrotrophy is most likely to evolve in stable high-resource environments.

AB A comprehensive understanding of the patterns that occur as human processes transform landscapes is necessary for sustainable development. We provide new evidence on how landscapes change by analysing the spatial patterns of human processes in three forest landscapes in southern Chile at different states of alteration (40%-90% of old-growth forest loss). Three phases of landscape alteration are distinguished. In Phase I (40%-65% of old-growth forest loss), deforestation rates are < 1% yr(-1), forests are increasingly degraded, and clearance for pastureland is concentrated on deeper soils. In Phase 11 (65% -80%), deforestation reaches its maximum rate of 1-1.5% yr(-1), with clearance for pastureland being the main human process, creating a landscape dominated by disturbed forest and shrubland. In this phase, clearance for pastureland is the primary driver of change, with pastures expanding onto poorer soils in more spatially aggregated patterns. In Phase III (80%-90%), deforestation rates are again relatively low (<1% yr(-1)) and forest regrowth is observed on marginal lands. During this phase, clearance is the dominant process and pastureland is the main land cover. As a forest landscape is transformed, the extent and intensity of human processes vary according to the existing state of landscape alteration, resulting in distinctive landscape patterns in each phase. A relationship between spatial patterns of land cover and human-related processes has been identified along the gradient of landscape alteration. This integrative framework can potentially provide insights into the patterns and processes of dynamic landscapes in other areas subjected to intensifying human use. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB 1. The practice of deliberately moving animals from one site to another for conservation is increasing as a tool to re-establish extirpated populations. Resource managers are faced with developing strategies for reintroduction attempts, but often lack experimentally derived evidence upon which to base decisions.
   2. Using the northern water snake Nerodia sipedon sipedon in the USA, we compared the behaviour and performance of resident snakes with that of individuals translocated directly from the wild to a nearby nature reserve or reared in captivity prior to translocation.
   3. Both translocated groups had low survivorship relative to resident snakes, but the proximal causes of their poor performance differed considerably. Captive-reared snakes exhibited restricted surface activity and movements and abnormal habitat use, and ultimately failed to maintain appropriate body temperature and body mass, with high mortality associated with the overwintering period. Wild snakes directly translocated to an unfamiliar site maintained body temperatures and growth comparable with residents, but their more extensive movements resulted in frequent excursions off reserve and high mortality.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We contend that an individual's prior experience is an important factor in determining their behaviour and performance during the phase of early establishment at an unfamiliar site. This suggests the existence of common underlying mechanisms influencing the outcome of reintroduction attempts, and provides a potentially useful framework for improving reintroduction efforts. Resource managers would likely improve success of reintroductions by matching habitats (and associated resources and conditions) between source and release sites, by temporarily confining animals in enclosures that force new associations to be made while limiting exploratory wanderings, or by enrichment of environmental conditions in captivity.

AB A recent interspecific study found Bergmann's size clines for Holarctic anurans and proposed an explanation based on heat balance to account for the pattern. However, this analysis was limited to cold temperate regions, and exploring the patterns in warmer tropical climates may reveal other factors that also influence anuran body size variation. We address this using a Cerrado anuran database. We examine the relationship between mean body size in a grid of 1 degrees cells and environmental predictors and test the relative support for four hypotheses using an AIC-based model selection approach. Also, we considered three different amphibian phylogenies to partition the phylogenetic and specific components of the interspecific variation in body size using a method analogous to phylogenetic eigen vector regression (PVR). To consider the potential effects of spatial autocorrelation we use eigenvector-based spatial filters. We found the largest species inhabiting high water deficit areas in the northeast and the smallest in the wet southwest. Our results are consistent with the water availability hypothesis which, coupled with previous findings, suggests that the major determinant of interspecific body size variation in anurans switches from energy to water towards the equator. We propose that anuran body size gradients reflect effects of reduced surface to volume ratios in larger species to control both heat and water balance.

AB Shedding light on the ability of benthic artificial reef (AR) communities to resemble those of a natural reef (NR) is of great importance if we are to harness ARs as tools for rehabilitation and restoration of degraded marine habitats. Studying recruitment processes to experimental settlement plates attached to ARs and NRs reveal the factors that shape community structure at the two reef types, and determine the ability of an AR to support communities similar to those found in adjacent natural habitats. In this study, conducted in Eilat (Red Sea), we used settlement plates to test the hypothesis that differences in benthic communities between ARs and NRs are derived from differential recruitment processes. A monitoring period of 18 months revealed great differences in the recruitment of corals and other benthic communities between the studied ARs and adjacent NRs. The ARs were either made of PVC or metal and 10-17 years old when the study commenced. The recruitment of soft corals reflected the species assemblage found in the area, consisting mainly of the family Nephtheidae and Xeniidae, species, while that of stony corals was mostly determined by the life history traits of the recruited taxa, e.g., the opportunistic nature of the family Pocilloporidae. Benthic organisms, mainly filter feeders like bryozoans, bivalves, sponges and tunicates, were more abundant at the ARs than at the NRs, mainly on the underside of the plates. We suggest that this differential recruitment resulted from a synergistic effect of abiotic and biotic factors, including current regime, sedimentation load and larval settlement preferences, which subsequently differentiated the composition of the benthic communities at the ARs and NRs. Thus, in order to construct an AR for restoration purposes, it must offer similar structural features to those found in the natural surrounding, leading to recruitment of local taxa. However, if the AR and NR will differ structurally, the composition of recruits will also differ and eventually the communities at the two reef types will become distinct, hereby increasing the species diversity in the area.

AB Large responses of ecosystems to small changes in the conditions-regime shifts-are of great interest and importance. In spatially extended ecosystems, these shifts may be local or global. Using empirical data and mathematical modeling, we investigated the dynamics of the Namibian fairy circle ecosystem as a case study of regime shifts in a pattern-forming ecosystem. Our results provide new support, based on the dynamics of the ecosystem, for the view of fairy circles as a self-organization phenomenon driven by water-vegetation interactions. The study further suggests that fairy circle birth and death processes correspond to spatially confined transitions between alternative stable states. Cascades of such transitions, possible in various pattern-forming systems, result in gradual rather than abrupt regime shifts.

AB Pastoral systems are characterised by a number of features that are absent in arable cropping systems. These features include: (i) pastures are biologically diverse so interactions between plant species must be considered; (ii) economic return requires the inclusion of the animal as an additional trophic level; (iii) interaction between the grazing animal and the pasture is complex, influenced by the environment, plant species and animal behaviour and this creates feedbacks that can result in vicious cycles; (iv) animals spatially transfer substantial amounts of nutrients both randomly and systematically and this creates or exacerbates soil variability; and (v) whole farm management is both more complex and more important to system function in grazed compared to arable systems and it is harder to capture in simulation models. These challenges complicate the process-based modelling of pastoral systems and present significant obstacles to model developers and users.
   Here we discuss these challenges, describe the range of solutions used by different models and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these solutions. We have placed particular emphasis on the analysis of a range of possible solutions with the point of view that diversity between and within models is important to provide the flexibility needed for future uses. We find that for most challenges there is a diversity of solutions incorporated into the models and that there is the potential to capture additional diversity, if needed, from other models.
   We note an apparent lack of development in the modelling of extreme events such as very high temperatures, systematic animal-mediated nutrient transfers, pests, weeds and gene-environment interactions in pastoral simulation models and suggest that these subject areas should receive more attention.

AB The tri-reference point (TRP) theory takes into account minimum requirements (MR), the status quo (SQ), and goals (G) in decision making under risk. The 3 reference points demarcate risky outcomes and risk perception into 4 functional regions: success (expected value of x >= G), gain (SQ < X < G), loss (MR <= x < SQ), and failure (x < MR). The psychological impact of achieving or failing to achieve these reference points is rank ordered as MR > G > SQ. We present TRP assumptions and value functions and a mathematical formalization of the theory. We conducted empirical tests of crucial TRP predictions using both explicit and implicit reference points. We show that decision makers consider both G and MR and give greater weight to MR than G, indicating failure aversion (i.e., the disutility of a failure is greater than the utility of a success in the same task) in addition to loss aversion (i.e., the disutility of a loss is greater than the utility of the same amount of gain). Captured by a double-S shaped value function with 3 inflection points, risk preferences switched between risk seeking and risk aversion when the distribution of a gamble straddled a different reference point. The existence of MR (not G) significantly shifted choice preference toward risk aversion even when the outcome distribution of a gamble was well above the MR. Single reference point based models such as prospect theory cannot consistently account for these findings. The TRP theory provides simple guidelines for evaluating risky choices for individuals and organizational management.

AB One mineral-solubilizing bacterial strain designated KT was isolated from a soil in Henan Province, China. The full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence showed 95.2 to 96.7% similarity to the bacteria of the genus Paenibacillus, indicating that the strain KT belonged to the genus Paenibacillus. The potential of this strain to release potassium from silicate minerals was investigated using a potassium-bearing rock as the sole source of potassium to support its growth. After inoculation for 7 days, the concentrations of water-soluble Al, Ca and Fe released from the potassium-bearing rock in active bacterial culture were higher than those from the control with autoclaved inoculum, but the concentration of water-soluble K in active bacterial culture was similar to that in the control. The concentrations of HNO3-extractable Al, Ca, Fe and K from the bacterial culture were also higher than those in the control. These results showed strain KT was able to release potassium from potassium-bearing rock. These results have important implications for extraction of potassium from rocks to support plant growth.

AB A renewed interest in investigating the relationships existing between body size and environmental variables is pervading ecological studies. Phytoplankton has a long tradition as model system in studies of community ecology and several research concepts were developed using these organisms. In this paper we try to review the relevance of analyzing the morphological features of phytoplankton in ecology. Starting with a brief account of allometric relationships existing in phytoplankton, we i) examine the physical context in which phytoplankton grow, and ii) highlight the role of their size in nutrient uptake, and that of their shape in light harvesting. Moreover, the way in which the morphology of phytoplankton organisms cope with the hydrodynamical conditions of a given water-body are considered. In addition, we also included a paragraph on the role of grazing in moulding the size and the shape structure of phytoplankton assemblages. An account on the main research currents about the role of morphology in the definition of morpho-functional traits of phytoplankton is offered. All these approaches, which can be viewed as complementary of taxonomy, both molecular and "traditional", are promising tools to better understand the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and may offer a vast array of new perspectives in the field of aquatic ecology and phytoplankton research as well as a simplified tool to perform water quality monitoring.

AB The prevailing assumption in the primate literature is that young or juvenile primates are more innovative than adult individuals. This innovative tendency among the young is frequently thought to be a consequence, or side effect, of their increased rates of exploration and play. Conversely, Reader and Laland's [International Journal of Primatology 22:787-806, 2001] review of the primate innovation literature noted a greater reported incidence of innovation in adults than nonadults, which they interpreted as (in part) a reflection of the greater experience and competence of older individuals. Within calli-trichids there is contradictory evidence for age differences in response to novel objects, foods, and foraging tasks. By presenting novel extractive foraging tasks to family groups of callitrichid monkeys in zoos, we examined, in a large sample, whether there are positive or negative relationships of age with neophilia, exploration, and innovation, and whether play or experience most facilitates innovation. The results indicate that exploration and innovation (but not neophilia) are positively correlated with age, perhaps reflecting adults' greater manipulative competence. To the extent that there was evidence for play in younger individuals, it did not appear to contribute to innovation. The implications of these findings for the fields of innovation and conservation through reintroduction are considered. Am. J. Primatol. 66:167-188, 2005. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Promoting indigenous submerged macrophytes is considered an important measure to restore shallow lakes. On the other hand, dense stands of aquatic vegetation often cause nuisance for boating, swimming and by obstruction of water flow. Consequently, the interests of recreational users may conflict with nature conservation. At first sight, aiming lake management at intermediate vegetation biomass seems a good solution for this controversy. However, as can be shown with a simple economical model, such a compromise may not always be an optimal solution in terms of total welfare across all users of a lake. Here, we show that a management strategy aimed at moderate plant biomass can also be unfeasible for ecological reasons. This is shown by applying two very different models: a minimal logistic model of plant growth which is easy to understand, and the relatively complex and realistic simulation model Charisma which, among other things, includes the seasonal cycle and a detailed description of the dynamics of light availability for macrophytes. The qualitative results of both models were remarkably similar. If the ecosystem has no alternative stable states, it is possible to set vegetation to any desired sustainable level using an appropriate harvesting strategy. However, if an intermediate vegetation biomass is to be realized the costs of harvesting are high, because the yield is predicted to be maximal in that case, If the ecosystem has alternative stable states, harvesting becomes risky because the vegetation may collapse entirely below a certain, in practice unknown, biomass. Also, even moderate harvesting may reduce the resilience of the vegetated state, making the ecosystem more vulnerable to adverse conditions such as unfavorable weather conditions or bird grazing.

AB 1 In recent decades, foraging by increasing numbers of lesser snow geese has led to loss of vegetation and changes in soil conditions in marshes on the Hudson Bay coast.
   2 Changes in species composition were recorded in areas unprotected from goose foraging and in exclosures of varying age (5-15 years) erected in intact swards and on bare sediments where foraging had occurred at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba.
   3 In the supratidal marsh, plants failed to establish naturally in either open or exclosed (15 years) plots in bare areas. In moist intertidal soils, vegetative fragments of the asexual species Puccinellia phryganodes readily established and formed a mat in exclosures (5 years).
   4 Changes in species assemblages occurred over 11 years in exclosed and adjacent open plots in intertidal and supratidal marshes. Loss of vegetation cover and species richness, particularly dicotyledonous species, and the reversion of later successional plant assemblages to earlier successional assemblages occurred in open plots. In the absence of foraging, late successional graminoids and willow species replaced early successional graminoids.
   5 Late successional grasses of the upper intertidal marsh died when transplanted into degraded soils but still survived after one season in control plots, suggesting that an early successional template is needed for establishment.
   6 In the absence of goose foraging, natural re-vegetation by clonal propagation can occur only where edaphic conditions are suitable. Within exclosures, vegetation changes resemble those in undamaged areas where goose foraging pressure is still moderate. We propose a state and transition model for vegetation change in the system based on succession patterns, alternative vegetation states and geomorphological events.

AB Carrying capacity in plant-herbivore systems generally refers to the equilibrium density that can be attained by a herbivore. In this paper I have summarised and analysed models and methods for calculating the carrying capacity of mammalian herbivores. I examined the models for their ability to objectively and quantitatively estimate carrying capacity in deterministic and stochastic environments. Of the seven model types reviewed, only the interactive model was suitable for calculating carrying capacity in both types of environment. The interactive model relates plant biomass to the rate of increase and food intake of herbivores. The carrying capacity predictions of. the model were tested using a red kangaroo-shrubland assemblage. I adjusted the degree of environmental stochasticity (rainfall) for the assemblage and modelled the resulting plant-herbivore dynamics. The results indicated that the concept of carrying capacity could be validly applied to deterministic, or low variance, environments but in stochastic environments that are characterised by a high degree of unpredictable environmental variance the concept is not useful for describing plant-herbivore dynamics.

AB Studies of density-body size relationships report generalities in the structure of communities and suggest patterns of energy use among species of different sizes. Most density-body size relationships, however, have been developed from data on populations throughout the world and are expected, therefore, to provide only an approximate description of any specific community. In this study, we test 1) whether log-linear density-body size relationships can also be used to describe local communities and 2) whether these relationships vary systematically with environmental conditions. Our analysis is based on population densities of phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoobenthos and fish species measured in 18 lakes worldwide. Mean annual population density (D, individuals m(-2)) decreases log-linearly with increasing species body size (M, mu g fresh mass; log D = a + b x log M), with slopes and intercepts which vary among lakes (b = -1.10 to -0.74, a = 4.5 to 6.9). In contrast with studies which focus on only one group of organisms (e.g. birds, insects, mammals), we found that local communities are well described by density-body size relationships (r(2) = 0.78-0.98) when more complete communities are considered. The slopes of density-body size relationships measure the relative density of small to large species, and tend to be shallower (lower relative density of small species) in lakes near cities, but more steeply negative (greater relative density of small species) in deep, highly productive lakes which flush rapidly. The intercepts measure average population density and are positively related to primary productivity. Such differences in size structure among aquatic communities are large enough to suggest shifts, for example, in the relative energy use of small and large species.

AB 1 The tiller dynamics of the two dominant species in a grassland, Agrostis stolonifera and Lolium perenne, were followed for two years in a field grazing experiment. Sheep grazing was applied in three seasons at two grazing intensities; winter, spring (in both seasons grazed or ungrazed) and summer (hard or light grazed).
   2 Tiller densities of both species showed peaks in late summer and troughs in spring due to variation in tiller birth rates. Tiller death rates were not seasonal. Year-to-year weather variation also affected the dynamics.
   3 Harder summer grazing increased tiller birth and death rates of both species, increasing tiller turnover, but did not affect tiller densities. The tiller death rates were higher and the summer peak in birth rates was earlier in the winter-grazed paddocks. Therefore, winter grazing decreased tiller densities over the two years by reducing densities in the non winter-grazed paddocks during the late summer months. There were no main effects of spring grazing treatment or interactions among grazing treatments. Tiller birth and death rates were density-dependent, indicating that the populations were regulated.
   4 Agrostis generally had higher tiller birth and death rates and therefore had a more rapid tiller turnover than Lolium. Fewer tillers flowered and there was less seedling establishment in the Agrostis populations. However, both species showed similar seasonal dynamics, density-dependent regulation, effects of between year climatic variation and responses to spring and summer grazing treatments. Agrostis showed a significantly greater response to winter grazing.
   5 The tiller populations of both species were regulated by density-dependent birth and death rates but showed seasonal dynamics upon which were superimposed effects of grazing treatment and yearly variation in the weather. However, their tiller population numbers were little affected by grazing level in spring or summer. Only grazing in winter decreased their densities and this is the treatment most likely to bring about changes in species composition in the grassland.

AB The spatial organization of a dry woodland/savanna/shrub-steppe ecosystem in a 9000 km2 region of arid Northern Kenya was explored by analysing the abundance and distribution of woody vegetation in relation to landscape gradients and gradients in rainfall. Woody species assemblages were clustered into four major groups. Three of these (and most of the sites) were dominated by species of Acacia. Acacia tortilis was the community dominant in riparian and riverine zones, A. senegal on hilly and rocky sites, and A. reficiens on non-riparian sites with fine soils. The fourth group, found at highest elevations, was distinguished by a very low abundance of Acacia. These soil/landform associations were systematically distributed along land system gradients (mountains, pediment, valley, bajada), thus relating woody species groups to large-scale landscape characteristics. Tree woody canopy cover ranged from < 1.0% to 100% over the region as a whole. Cover was directly related to precipitation when the effects of water concentration in riparian zones were removed. However, canopy cover was not greatly influenced by either species composition or landscape characteristics. Fire reduced woody canopy cover, however, fires appeared to affect a relatively small portion of the ecosystem. Recent anthropogenic disturbances such as wood-cutting and livestock corralling were encountered in patches, but the cumulative long-term effects of patch scale disturbances could not be discerned in vegetation patterns at the regional scale. Vegetation physiognomy (woodland, bush, bushed grassland, etc.) was controlled by both water availability and landscape pattern. Woodland and forest occurred almost exclusively in riparian and riverine situations while the driest parts of the region supported dwarf shrub grassland with few trees. Over the region as a whole, climate and landscape gradients converged in diverse ways, giving rise to structurally variable associations of woody plant species.
   Vegetation structure in tropical savannas and dry woodlands is often interpreted in terms of competition between woody and herbaceous life forms for soil moisture. The outcome of this competitive interaction is thought to be influenced by disturbances that shift the system from one stable state to another. However, our findings suggest that dry tropical ecosystem structure is hierarchically constrained by physical factors: by climate at regional to continental scales; by topographic effects on rainfall and landscape water redistribution, and geomorphic effects on soil and plant available water at the landscape to regional scales; and finally by water redistribution and disturbance at local and patch scales.

AB In complex systems, a critical transition is a shift in a system's dynamical regime from its current state to a strongly contrasting state as external conditions move beyond a tipping point. These transitions are often preceded by characteristic early warning signals such as increased system variability. However, early warning signals in complex, coupled human-environment systems (HESs) remain little studied. Here, we compare critical transitions and their early warning signals in a coupled HES model to an equivalent environment model uncoupled from the human system. We parameterize the HES model, using social and ecological data from old-growth forests in Oregon. We find that the coupled HES exhibits a richer variety of dynamics and regime shifts than the uncoupled environment system. Moreover, the early warning signals in the coupled HES can be ambiguous, heralding either an era of ecosystem conservationism or collapse of both forest ecosystems and conservationism. The presence of human feedback in the coupled HES can also mitigate the early warning signal, making it more difficult to detect the oncoming regime shift. We furthermore show how the coupled HES can be "doomed to criticality": Strategic human interactions cause the system to remain perpetually in the vicinity of a collapse threshold, as humans become complacent when the resource seems protected but respond rapidly when it is under immediate threat. We conclude that the opportunities, benefits, and challenges of modeling regime shifts and early warning signals in coupled HESs merit further research.

TI Cranial size has increased over 133years in a common bat, Pipistrellus

AB Aim
   Bats are promising candidates for studying morphometric responses to anthropogenic climate or land-use changes. We assessed whether the cranial size of a common bat (Pipistrellus kuhlii) had changed between 1875 and 2007. We formulated the following hypotheses: (1) if heat loss is an important reaction to climate change, body size will have decreased in response to the increased temperatures, because small bats have a larger surface-to-volume ratio and dissipate heat more effectively; (2) if water loss is the main driver, body size will have increased in response to the temperature increase, because larger bats will lose water more slowly through a reduced surface-to-volume ratio; (3) the energetic benefits provided by urbanization (food concentration at street lamps, warmer maternity roosts in buildings) will lead to a general body size increase in P.kuhlii; and (4) because street lamps impair moth antipredatory manoeuvres, cranial size may have selectively increased as an adaptive response to handle larger prey (moths) in artificially illuminated sites. Ours is the first study to assess temporal trends in bat body size over more than a century and to relate them to urbanization.
   Location
   Mainland Italy.
   Methods
   We used traditional morphometrics to compare seven variables of skull size in 117 museum specimens (75 female, 42male).
   Results
   Cranial size increased after 1950, but this change was not paralleled by an increase in body size, measured as forearm length. This selective increase matched a rapid increase in electric public illumination in Italy.
   Main conclusions
   Street lights are crucial foraging sites for P.kuhlii. The directional change that we found in cranial size might represent microevolutionary adaptive tracking of a sudden shift in food size, making more profitable prey available.

AB Research on ecosystem and societal response to global environmental change typically considers the effects of shifts in mean climate conditions. There is, however, some evidence of ongoing changes also in the variance of hydrologic and climate fluctuations. A relatively high interannual variability is a distinctive feature of the hydrologic regime of dryland regions, particularly at the desert margins. Hydrologic variability has an important impact on ecosystem dynamics, food security and societal reliance on ecosystem services in water-limited environments. Here, we investigate some of the current patterns of hydrologic variability in drylands around the world and review the major effects of hydrologic fluctuations on ecosystem resilience, maintenance of biodiversity and food security. We show that random hydrologic fluctuations may enhance the resilience of dryland ecosystems by obliterating bistable deterministic behaviours and threshold-like responses to external drivers. Moreover, by increasing biodiversity and the associated ecosystem redundancy, hydrologic variability can indirectly enhance post-disturbance recovery, i.e. ecosystem resilience.

AB Populations of small mammals often fluctuate dramatically in arid environments, persisting at very low density during drought and erupting briefly but dramatically after rain. We selected 3 species that exhibit such boom and bust dynamics in spinifex grassland in the Simpson Desert, central Australia, and asked how they survive prolonged dry periods when they are scarce or absent from the trapping record. We postulated that animals persist by retreating to small patches of open woodland that are embedded within the grassland matrix and predicted that these patches would provide more food and shelter for small mammals than the surrounding grassland during dry periods but not at other times. We also predicted that capture rates and activity of the study species would be higher, and risk of predation lower, in the woodland than in the grassland during drought, and that after heavy rain the rate of return of small mammals to spinifex grassland would be correlated with proximity to patches of woodland. Sampling provided partial support for these predictions. Some food resources (seeds) were more abundant in woodland patches irrespective of environmental conditions, but others (invertebrates) showed no clear pattern; shelter resources were mostly invariant between habitats and times. Of the 3 study species, only the sandy inland mouse (Pseudomys hermannsburgensis) behaved largely as we had anticipated, but even this species was not confined to woodland during droughts. Both the spinifex hopping-mouse (Notomys alexis) and brush-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus blythi) continued to use grassland more than woodland during drought and nondrought periods, although N. alexis showed a tendency to increase its activity in woodland during dry conditions. Trappability remained relatively constant among species, habitats, and times, indicating that the temporal patterns of habitat use we uncovered were real and not artifacts of changes in animal behavior or susceptibility to capture. We conclude that woodland patches contribute importantly to the persistence of P. hermannsburgensis during droughts, whereas N. alexis and D. blythi either use other unidentified refugia at such times or occur at such low densities in grassland habitat that their chances of being captured are very small.

AB Since reintroduction programmes involve moving animals from captive or wild environments and releasing them into novel environments, there are sure to be a number of challenges to the welfare of the individuals involved. Behavioural theory can help us develop reintroductions that are better for both the welfare of the individual and the conservation of populations. In addition to modifying captive environments to prepare animals for release to the wild, it is possible to modify the animals' experience in the post-release environment. For releases to be more successful, they need to better accommodate the ecological and psychological needs of individuals. A better understanding of sensory ecology how animals acquire and respond to information in their environment is needed to develop new, more successful management strategies for reintroductions. Sensory ecology integrates ecological and psychological processes, calling for better synergy among researchers with divergent backgrounds in conservation and animal welfare science. This integrative approach leads to new topics of investigation in reintroduction biology, including more careful consideration of post-release stress and the role of social support. Reintroductions are essentially exercises in 'forced' dispersal; thus, an especially promising avenue of research is the role of proximate mechanisms governing dispersal and habitat selection decisions. Reintroduction biologists have much to gain from the study of mechanism because mechanisms, unlike function or adaptive value, can be manipulated to enhance conservation and welfare goals.

AB Numerous changes have occurred at the Uva Island reef since the original calcium carbonate budget model was published (Eakin, 1996). Minor bleaching events occurred during the 1990s and a widespread event occurred in 1997-98. In 1989 and 1993, reef flat exposures bleached and killed corals that had recruited to the reef flat. Since 1983 erosion by sea urchins and infauna. have eliminated much of the structure that previously existed in the seaward reef base. Earlier work reported that the reef was largely depositional before 1983 (8600 kg; CaCO3 yr(-1) net), and highly erosional in the early 1990s (-4800 kg CaCO3, yr(-1) net). New data related to post-1983 disturbances are presented and incorporated into the calcium carbonate model. Modeling suggests that the reef has remained erosional, varying from around -3000 to -18,000 kg CaCO3 yr(-1) net. The reef budget varies substantially with changes in community composition, topographic complexity and echinoid density La Nina-driven low tidal exposures had more influence on the budget than the 1997-98 El Nino. As the carbonate framework in the reef base eroded sea urchin density declined and corals began to recover. Climate factors, mediated by biological processes, continue to influence the course of the Uva Island reef ecosystem and its physical structure.

AB This paper analyses the dynamics of two predator-prey models, namely, Lotka-Volterra and Leslie-Gower, when submitted to a specific harvesting schedule known as the weighted escapement policy. The main goal is to show that global stability of a desired equilibrium population can be achieved by the application of simple switching controls, chosen in accordance with variable structure system theory. A qualitative analysis shows that the global stability depends on the existence of virtual equilibrium points which in turn is ensured by a suitable choice of the control parameters.

AB Tropical marine ecosystems are characterized by a specific cyanobacterial flora, temperature most probably being the major factor limiting the geographic distribution of the species. When compared with the open ocean, the highest biodiversity of cyanobacteria is observed in the littoral zones where they form intertidal and infralittoral mats, live as endoliths in carbonate substrates or form symbiotic associations, especially with sponges and ascidians. Their diversity, which especially in the less accessible infralittoral is still largely unknown, is also a source of diverse bioactive compounds, some of which are important as herbivore deterrents. As photosynthetic organisms, cyanobacteria sensu lato (including Prochlorophyta) are important contributors to benthic and open ocean primary production, but their main role in the tropical marine ecosystems appears to be as nitrogen fixers. Of primary importance in the often oligotrophic tropical oceans is the nonheterocystous, planktonic broom-forming Trichodesmium, which probably represents a major nitrogen source for the marine and global nitrogen cycle.

AB The intensive development of industry and urban structures along the seashores of the world, as well as the immense increase in marine transportation and other activities, has resulted in the deposition of thousands of new chemicals and organic compounds, endangering the existence of organisms and ecosystems. The conventional single biomarker methods used in ecological assessment studies cannot provide an adequate base for environmental health assessment, management and sustainability planning. The present study uses a set of novel biochemical, physiological, cytogenetic and morphological methods to characterize the state of health of selected molluscs and fish along the shores of the German North Sea, as well as the Israeli Mediterranean and Red Sea. The methods include measurement of activity of multixenobiotic resistance-mediated transporter (MXRtr) and the system of active transport of organic anions (SATOA) as indicators of antixenobiotic defence; glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity as an indicator of biotransformation of xenobiotics; DNA unwinding as a marker of genotoxicity; micronucleus test for clastogenicity; levels of phagocytosis for immunotoxicity; cholinesterase (ChE) activity and level of catecholamines as indicators of neurotoxicity; permeability of external epithelia to anionic hydrophilic probe, intralysosomal accumulation of cationic amphiphilic probe and activity of non-specific esterases as indicators of cell/tissue viability. Complete histopathological examination was used for diagnostics of environmental pathology. The obtained data show that the activity of the defensive pumps, MXRtr and SATOA in the studied organisms was significantly higher in the surface epithelia of molluscs from a polluted site than that of the same species from control, unpolluted stations, providing clear evidence of response to stress. Enhanced frequency of DNA lesions (alkaline and acidic DNA unwinding) and micronucleus-containing cells was significantly higher in samples from polluted sites in comparison to those from the clean sites that exhibited genotoxic and clastogenic activity of the pollutants. In all the studied molluscs a negative correlation was found between the MXRtr levels of activity and the frequency of micronucleus-containing hemocytes. The expression of this was in accordance with the level of pollution. The complete histopathological examination demonstrates significantly higher frequencies of pathological alterations in organs of animals from polluted sites. A strong negative correlation was found between the frequency of these alterations and MXRtr activity in the same specimens. In addition to these parameters, a decrease in the viability was noted in molluscs from the polluted sites, but ChE activities remained similar at most sites. The methods applied in our study unmasked numerous early cryptic responses and negative alterations of health in populations of marine biota sampled from the polluted sites. This demonstrates that genotoxic, clastogenic and pathogenic xenobiotics are present and act in the studied sites and this knowledge can provide a reliable base for consideration for sustainable development.

AB 1. Mechanisms of grass- and forb-seed input and output in the central Monte desert of Argentina were studied in 1995 to test the hypothesis that seed consumption by autumn-winter granivores, especially birds, has qualitative as well as quantitative effects on soil-seed reserves.
   2, The abundance of perennial grass seeds in late summer soils (approximate to 2400 seeds m(-2) or 0.36 g m(-2)) remained unchanged the following early spring (approximate to 2400 seeds m(-2) or 0.39 g m(-2)), despite the incorporation of about 3000 seeds m(-2) or 0.71 g m(-2) newly produced grass seeds during autumn-winter. Grass seeds appeared to be heavily consumed, especially the medium-sized ones.
   3, The annual forb-seed bank was about the same size in late summer (approximate to 5500 seeds m(-2) or 1.34 g m(-2)) as in early spring (approximate to 6500 seeds m(-2) or 1.53 g m(-2)). Since forb-seed production had been relatively low (approximate to 400 seeds m(-2) or 0.12 g m(-2)), these seeds apparently suffered negligible postdispersal losses.
   4. This pattern of grass- and forb-seed loss coincides with the pattern of seed consumption by granivorous birds - on average, 93% of seed mass in bird stomachs was from grass seeds, while only 7% was from forb seeds.
   5, Further evidence of a major impact of bird foraging on seed reserves is that the mass of particular grass seeds that was lost from soils was positively correlated with the mass of such seeds in bird diets, and that the main target of bird consumption, i.e. medium-sized grass seeds, suffered the highest postdispersal loss.
   6. It is concluded that autumn-winter granivores in the central Monte desert, particularly birds, mainly consume newly produced grass seeds and that they might have major qualitative as well as quantitative impacts on soil-seed reserves.

AB In this study, plants of six species (Chamaecrista chamaecristoides, Palafoxia lindenii, Trachypogon gouini, Canavalia rosea, Ipomoea pes-caprae and Schizachyrium scoparium) which grow in the sand dunes of the Gulf of Mexico were experimentally buried with sand at different depths. For all species, burial increased plant vigour in terms of biomass and leaf area. In general, buried plants allocated more biomass towards the aerial parts (except in T. gouini, in which the reverse was true). The tested species exhibited good tolerance to sand burial. Their germination occurred during the period when sand movement was at its lowest. Growth form of species affected their ability to withstand burial. For example, shrubby species were the most tolerant ones and herbaceous plants the least. Such tolerance to burial seems to be related to local distribution of species in the dune system.

AB Spatial variations in the abundance of insect herbivores and in herbivore damage are both striking an commonplace. The standard explanations for heterogeneity in herbivore attack emphasize spatial variations in plant genetype, soils, or physical environment. Here I examine an alternative hypothesis-that heterogeneity arises in plant-herbivore systems, even in homogeneous environments, as a result of the direct coupling of herbivore movement to herbivore density and plant quality. Using a mathematical model for plant quality and herbivore growth and dispersal, I demonstrate how spatial instabilities about homogeneous steady state values result in both transient and stationary waves of damage to the plant. Key herbivore movement behaviors include the tendendy for herbivores to aggregate over a range of spatial scales for increased feeding efficiency and the tendency for herbivores to move up gradients in plant quality (herbivory-taxis). My approach translates the biased ''random walk'' behavior of individual herbivores into a continuum partial differential equation model. Analytical and numerical methods are used to demonstrate the nature of the spatio-temporal variations in plant quality and herbivore density.    (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB Gloger's rule is an ecogeographical rule that links animal colouration with climatic variation. This rule is named after C.W.L. Gloger who was one of the first to summarise the associations between climatic variation and animal colouration, noting in particular that birds and mammals seemed more pigmented in tropical regions. The term 'Gloger's rule' was coined by B. Rensch in 1929 and included different patterns of variation from those described by Gloger. Rensch defined the rule in two ways: a simple version stating that endothermic animals are predicted to be darker in warmer and humid areas due to the increased deposition of melanin pigments; and a complex version that includes the differential effects of humidity and temperature on both main types of melanin pigments - eu- and phaeo-melanin. The blackish eu-melanins are predicted to increase with humidity, and decrease only at extreme low temperatures, while the brown-yellowish phaeomelanins prevail in dry and warm regions and decrease rapidly with lower temperatures. A survey of the literature indicates that there is considerable variation/confusion in the way Gloger's rule is understood (based on 271 studies that define the rule). Whereas the complex version is hardly mentioned, only a quarter of the definitions are consistent with the simple version of Gloger's rule (darker where warm and wet), and most definitions mention only the effects of humidity (darker where wet). A smaller subset of studies define the rule based on other correlated climatic and environmental variables such as vegetation, latitude, altitude, solar radiation, etc., and a few even contradict the original definition (darker where cold). Based on the literature survey, I synthesised the qualitative (N = 124 studies) and quantitative (meta-analytically, N = 38 studies, 241 effects) evidence testing the simple version of Gloger's rule (I found no tests of the complex version). Both lines of evidence supported the predicted effects of humidity (and closely linked variables) on colour variation, but not the effects of temperature. Moreover, humidity effects are not restricted to birds and mammals, as the data indicate that these effects also apply to insects. This suggests that the simple version of Gloger's rule as originally defined may not be valid, and possibly that the rule should be re-formulated in terms of humidity effects only. I suggest, however, that more data are needed before such a reformulation, due to potential publication biases. In conclusion, I recommend that authors cite Rensch when referring to Gloger's rule and that they make clear which version they are referring to. Future research should concentrate on rigorously testing the validity and generality of both versions of Gloger's rule and establishing the mechanism(s) responsible for the patterns it describes. Since humidity seems to be the core climatic variable behind Gloger's rule, I suggest that the two most plausible mechanisms are camouflage and protection against parasites/pathogens, the latter possibly through pleiotropic effects on the immune system. Understanding the processes that lead to climatic effects on animal colouration may provide insights into past and future patterns of adaptation to climatic change.

AB The balance between facilitation and competition is likely to change with age due to the dynamic nature of nutrient, water and carbon cycles, and light availability during stand development. These processes have received attention in harsh, arid, semiarid and alpine ecosystems but are rarely examined in more productive communities, in mixed-species forest ecosystems or in long-term experiments spanning more than a decade. The aim of this study was to examine how inter- and intraspecific interactions between Eucalyptus globulus Labill. mixed with Acacia mearnsii de Wildeman trees changed with age and productivity in a field experiment in temperate south-eastern Australia. Spatially explicit neighbourhood indices were calculated to quantify tree interactions and used to develop growth models to examine how the tree interactions changed with time and stand productivity. Interspecific influences were usually less negative than intraspecific influences, and their difference increased with time for E. globulus and decreased with time for A. mearnsii. As a result, the growth advantages of being in a mixture increased with time for E. globulus and decreased with time for A. mearnsii. The growth advantage of being in a mixture also decreased for E. globulus with increasing stand productivity, showing that spatial as well as temporal dynamics in resource availability influenced the magnitude and direction of plant interactions.

AB P>1. Vegetation fires can have major social, economic and ecological consequences. Research into fire behaviour has aimed to give managers greater ability to predict and control fires. Fire and grazing are important and interacting disturbances in grasslands. Fire is known to widely affect grazing patterns, but the effects of grazing on the incidence of fire are less well known. There have been few tests of the idea that 'grazing reduces blazing', which has popular and political currency in some countries. This study addresses the hypothesis that grazing affects fire potential in native grasslands.
   2. Paired grazed and ungrazed quadrats were established at five lawn and five tussock grassland sites. Fuel load, percentage dead fuel and the number of days sustaining fires where possible were compared between treatments.
   3. In lawn grasslands, grazing markedly reduced fire potential through the removal of plant biomass and by preventing the vegetation escaping into the unpalatable and flammable tussock state. Grazing led to increased fire potential in tussock grasslands where animals selectively removed live shoots, leaving a high proportion of dead fuel.
   4. The difference in flammability responses to grazing between lawn and tussock grassland appeared to be due to differences in palatability that in turn may relate to soil fertility and the constancy of intense grazing. These differences mean that grazing lawns and tussock grasslands are likely to be subject to differing disturbance regimes. This association between disturbance regime and vegetation structural type suggests that lawns and tussock grasslands represent alternative stable states within the grassland ecosystem.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Grazing is only likely to reduce the probability of fire where the bulk of the vegetation consists of potential food for grazing animals. It is likely that the negative relationship between vegetation palatability and fire potential applies to grasslands generally and possibly to many other vegetation types. Grassland managers may need to manipulate disturbance regimes in order to maintain vegetation structural heterogeneity and thereby promote landscape-scale biodiversity.

AB The stability of predator-prey models, in the context of exploitation of renewable resources, subject to threshold policies (TP) is studied in this paper using the idea of backstepping and control Liapunov functions (CLF) well known in control theory, as well as the concept of virtual equilibria. TPs are defined and analysed for different types of one and two species predator-prey models. The models studied are the single species Noy-Meir herbivore-vegetation model, in a grazing management context, as well as the Rosenzweig-MacArthur two species predator-prey model, in a fishery management context. TPs are shown to be versatile and useful in managing renewable resources, being simple to design and implement, and also yielding advantages in situations of overexploitation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Upper Miocene deposits in the Cabo de Gata region (SE Spain) provide a unique opportunity to study cliff-related temperate carbonates, a poorly known type of fossil non-tropical carbonates. The studied submarine cliffs lie on the western flank of the Monte Ricardillo volcanic dome. Two main biocenoses colonised the cliff walls: vertical and subvertical walls were either overgrown by vermetid gastropods, forming a vermetid framestone, or colonised by robust branching bryozoans, which were reworked post-mortem and accumulated as aprons at the foot of the submarine cliffs. Coralline algae in the vermetid build-up indicate palaeodepths below 15-20 m. Depressions in front of the cliffs were occupied by nodular bryozoans and bivalves. Within these depressions, barnacles settled on secondary hard substrates. With progressive flooding of the depositional area, substrate relief was filled in and a carbonate ramp with facies belts following the palaeobathymetric gradient evolved. A delicate branching bryozoan facies occurs in the proximal part of the ramp and a nodular bryozoan-bivalve facies in its middle part. Distally, these deposits give way to a coralline algal facies. These results provide a first insight into temperate-water carbonates related to rocky submarine cliffs. This work also reveals a major control of substrate relief on temperate carbonate facies and biofacies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lesser spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos minor is a territorial species with its food resources distributed in patches. i.e. insect larvae in dead branches of trees. The species is threatened in Northern Europe, and therefore it is of interest to identify factors responsible for its decline. We hypothesise that (a) foraging behaviour is maximising fitness, (b) the woodpeckers, through their foraging behaviour, reveal their own opinion about their territory or their individual quality, and (c) that an inter-territorial comparison of behaviour and reproduction shows which factor is responsible for the breeding success of the woodpeckers. We collected data on giving-up density of prey (GUD) and patch residence time (PRT) during branch visits about one month before egg laying. The data was collected from a natural breeding population in southern Sweden, 1993-1996, A positive correlation between GUD and PRT within individuals is diagnostic for a Bayesian forager exploiting a clumped distribution of prey, This correlation was found in 22 of 28 investigated individuals. Average GUD of the breeding individuals was positively related to breeding success, i.e. there was a significant negative correlation between average GUD and commencement of egg laying, and a significant positive correlation between average GUD and number of fledglings. For the number of eggs laid there was a weak (not significant) positive relation with average GUD. Average GUD was not influenced by the age or sex of the individuals. Neither did these individual quality measures influence the relations between average GUD and reproductive success. Average GUD and average PRT of individuals was positively correlated. In concert, these results suggest that differences in average prey density across territories prior to breeding is the factor explaining most of the variation in breeding success of the lesser spotted woodpeckers in the studied population.

AB A review of the literature suggests that aquatic macrophytes can enhance water clarity and reduce phytoplankton biomass through shading, reduction of nutrient availability, excretion of allelopathic substances and reduction of resuspension. In addition, vegetation fields are reported to enhance grazing on phytoplankton by providing a day-time refuge against fish predation for planktonic filter feeders such as Daphnia and by providing a suitable habitat for macrophyte associated filter feeders such as Sida crystallina, Eurycercus lamellatus and Simocephalus velutus. I use a graphical and a simple mathematical model to explore how top-down control by these grazers may interact with the effect of reduced phytoplankton production due to the other factors mentioned. The analysis suggests that grazing tends to be an all-or-none effect, driving phytoplankton to a very low biomass once a certain threshold level of grazing pressure is exceeded. This threshold level is predicted to increase with the productivity of the phytoplankton. Thus, the model suggests that, in plant beds, productivity reducing factors such as shading and reduced nutrient concentrations can pave the way for top-down control of phytoplankton even by a relatively moderate population of filter-feeders, and that phytoplankton biomass will decrease sharply beyond a critical macrophyte (or grazer) density. Indeed such a discontinuous response is observed in field experiments. Also, the idea that filter feeding cladocerans such as Daphnia play a key role is in line with the observation that brackish lakes where Daphnia does not thrive tend to be turbid despite the often dense weed beds.

AB It is well known that vegetation patterns characterize the distribution of the vegetation and provide some signs for vegetation protection. The positive feedbacks regulation between the water and plant biomass play an important role in the vegetation patterns in semi-arid environments, yet its influence on vegetation patterns is far from being well understood. In order to reveal a mechanism of positive feedbacks on pattern formation, a water-biomass model in semi-arid environments with soil-water diffusion feedback is presented. Our results reveal that, as the soil-water diffusion intensity decreases, the pattern transitions: gap patterns -> stripe (labyrinth) patterns -> spot patterns emerge. More importantly, when the soil-water diffusion feedback intensity is smaller, the feedback will promote the growth of the vegetation; when the feedback intensity is much larger, the vegetation biomass will decrease and the feedback may induce the emergence of desertification. Additionally, the rainfall can also induce the pattern transition. As the rainfall capacity decreases, the vegetation disappears and becomes the bare soil state. Our findings highlight the relationship among feedback intensity, rainfall and pattern dynamics of the vegetation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Specimens and associated data in natural history collections (NHCs) foster substantial scientific progress. In this paper, we explore recent contributions of NHCs to the study of systematics and biogeography, genomics, morphology, stable isotope ecology, and parasites and pathogens of mammals. To begin to assess the magnitude and scope of these contributions, we analyzed publications in the Journal of Mammalogy over the last decade, as well as recent research supported by a single university mammal collection (Museum of Southwestern Biology, Division of Mammals). Using these datasets, we also identify weak links that may be hindering the development of crucial NHC infrastructure. Maintaining the vitality and growth of this foundation of mammalogy depends on broader engagement and support from across the scientific community and is both an ethical and scientific imperative given the rapidly changing environmental conditions on our planet.

AB Environmental conditions and plant size may both alter the outcome of inter-specific plant-plant interactions, with seedlings generally facilitated more strongly than larger individuals in stressful habitats. However, the combined impact of plant size and environmental severity on interactions is poorly understood.
   Here, we tested explicitly for the first time the hypothesis that ontogenetic shifts in interactions are delayed under increasingly severe conditions by examining the interaction between a grass, Agrostis magellanica, and a cushion plant, Azorella selago, along two severity gradients.
   The impact of A. selago on A. magellanica abundance, but not reproductive effort, was related to A. magellanica size, with a trend for delayed shifts towards more negative interactions under greater environmental severity. Intermediate-sized individuals were most strongly facilitated, leading to differences in the size-class distribution of A. magellanica on the soil and on A. selago. The A. magellanica size-class distribution was more strongly affected by A. selago than by environmental severity, demonstrating that the plant-plant interaction impacts A. magellanica population structure more strongly than habitat conditions.
   As ontogenetic shifts in plant-plant interactions cannot be assumed to be constant across severity gradients and may impact species population structure, studies examining the outcome of interactions need to consider the potential for size-or age-related variation in competition and facilitation.

AB Natural reforestation of European mountain landscapes raises major environmental and societal issues. With local stakeholders in the Pyrenees National Park area (France), we studied agricultural landscape colonisation by ash (Fraxinus excelsior) to enlighten its impacts on biodiversity and other landscape functions of importance for the valley socio-economics. The study comprised an integrated assessment of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) since the 1950s, and a scenario analysis of alternative future policy. We combined knowledge and methods from landscape ecology, land change and agricultural sciences, and a set of coordinated field studies to capture interactions and feedback in the local landscape/land-use system. Our results elicited the hierarchically-nested relationships between social and ecological processes. Agricultural change played a preeminent role in the spatial and temporal patterns of LUCC. Landscape colonisation by ash at the parcel level of organisation was merely controlled by grassland management, and in fact depended on the farmer's land management at the whole-farm level. LUCC patterns at the landscape level depended to a great extent on interactions between farm household behaviours and the spatial arrangement of landholdings within the landscape mosaic. Our results stressed the need to represent the local SES function at a fine scale to adequately capture scenarios of change in landscape functions. These findings orientated our modelling choices in the building an agent-based model for LUCC simulation (SMASH-Spatialized Multi-Agent System of landscape colonization by ASH). We discuss our method and results with reference to topical issues in interdisciplinary research into the sustainability of multifunctional landscapes.

AB We experimentally tested the hypothesis that the extensive within-plant variation of nectar sugar composition in Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae) and other species results from differences between flowers and nectaries in pollinator visitation history. Experiments were conducted to mimic single-nectary visits by wild-caught individuals of the main bee pollinators of H. foetidus, which were assayed for their capacity to modify the sugar composition of natural and artificial nectar. Experimental nectar probing with bee mouthparts induced extensive changes in proportional sugar composition 48 h after treatment, and bee taxa differed widely in their effects. Nectar probing by Andrena, medium-sized Anthophoridae, Apis mellifera, and Lasioglossum had no subsequent effects on nectar sugar composition, while probing by Bombus terrestris and B. pratorum induced an extensive reduction in percentage sucrose, a marked increase in percentage fructose, and a slight increase in percentage glucose. Results support the hypothesis that stochastic variations among flowers or nectaries in the taxonomic identity of recent visitors and their relative visitation frequencies may eventually generate very small-scale mosaics in nectar sugar composition. Changes in nectar sugar composition following bumblebee probing may be the consequence of nectar contamination with pollinator-borne nectarivorous yeasts.

AB If selective forces on locomotor ability and reproductive biology differ among habitats, we expect to see relationships between habitat, morphology, and life-history traits. Comparative ( phylogenetically based) analysis of data from 12 pythonid and 12 boid snake species reveals multiple evolutionary shifts in habitat use, notably in the evolution of arboreal habits. Compared to terrestrial and aquatic taxa of the same overall body size, arboreal species have narrower and more laterally compressed bodies and relatively longer tails. Offspring sizes are not affected by arboreality, but presumably reflecting space constraints within their narrow bodies, arboreal species ( 1) produce smaller clutch sizes relative to maternal body length and ( 2) have left and right ovaries that overlap little if at all along the length of the body (i.e., the right ovary is positioned anterior to the left ovary) whereas in terrestrial snakes the two ovaries overlap along much of their length. This modi. cation of ovarian morphology in arboreal snakes presumably reduces the degree of bodily distension during vitellogenesis and pregnancy, thus enhancing climbing ability and camouflage among the branches.

DT Article
ID PREFERENCES; INTRANSITIVITY; VARIABILITY; VIOLATIONS; SIMILARITY;

AB Existing models of risk-sensitive foraging assume that animals assign value to different options according to an absolute currency. It follows from this assumption that choices are expected to be both transitive and regular, because the value assigned to an option is independent of its context. I tested these predictions by comparing preferences obtained in binary and trinary contexts. European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, were trained using an operant paradigm to forage for three options: Constant (C) that provided a fixed number of food pellets; Low variance (L) with a coefficient of variation of 71% in the number of pellets; High variance (H) with a coefficient of variation of 106%. The preferences of the birds were tested in three binary choice treatments (CL, CH, LH) and one trinary choice treatment (CLH). Overall, there was no evidence for violations of either transitivity or regularity. However, overall, a bird's relative preference for its most preferred option over its second most preferred option was significantly greater in the trinary treatment than in the comparable binary treatment. This effect of context on choice is compatible with starlings' use of comparative instead of absolute currencies in decision making. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   GEITONOGAMY; BORAGINACEAE; BEHAVIOR; PATTERNS
AB Most hermaphroditic, many-flowered plants should Suffer reduced fitness from within-plant selfing (geitonogamy). Large inflorescences are most attractive to pollinators, but also promote many flower visits during a single plant visit, which may increase selfing and decrease pollen export. A plant might avoid the negative consequences of attractiveness through modification of the floral display to promote fewer flower visits, while retaining attractiveness. This report shows that increasing only the variance in nectar volume per flower results in fewer flower visits per inflorescence by wild hummingbirds (Selasphorus rufus) and captive humble bees (Bombus flavifrons) foraging on artificial inflorescences. Inflorescences were either constant (all flowers contained the same nectar volume) or variable (half the flowers were empty, the other half contained twice as Much nectar as in the constant flowers). Both types of inflorescence were simultaneously available to foragers. Risk-averse foraging behaviour was expressed as a patch departure preference: birds and bees visited fewer flowers on variable inflorescences, and this preference was expressed when resource variability could be determined only by concurrent sampling. When variance treatments were clearly labelled with colour and offered to hummingbirds, the departure effect was maintained however, when preference was measured by inflorescence choice, birds did not consistently prefer to visit constant inflorescences. The reduced visitation lengths on variable inflorescences by both birds and bees documented in this study imply that variance in nectar production rates within inflorescences may represent an adaptive trait to avoid the costs of geitonogamy.

AB In view of its fundamental and pervasive influences and impacts on organism physiology and ecology, body size is recognized as a key component of evolutionary fitness and serves as the cornerstone of a seminal contribution in freshwater zooplankton ecology-the Size Efficiency Hypothesis (SEH) of Brooks & Dodson (Science 150:28-35, 1965). While the roles and implications of body size in predation and competition-central tenets of the SEH-have been widely considered and reviewed, no broader integrated synthesis exists of the collective array of body size determinants and their implications in the ecology in crustacean zooplankton-a numerically and functionally dominant group of aquatic organisms. Focusing on planktonic Cladocera and Copepoda in inland waters, in particular, we provide a wide-ranging overview of the direct and/or indirect effects of environmental conditions, consumable resources and biotic interactions that independently and/or collectively influence the phenotypic expression of body size (particularly as length), both within and between species. Some indirect ultimate evolutionary consequences of body size are considered, and we identify some controversies and unresolved issues related to this biologically crucial trait. While by no means exhaustive, our overview reveals a complex nexus of extrinsic proximate abiotic and biotic factors and interactions that influence body size, the phenotypic expression of which in natural systems commonly reflects contrasting outcomes related to conflicting direct and/or indirect selective pressures. In general, however, body size (both inter- and intra specifically) declines with rising temperature and increases with rising food supply (depending on its quality), although both temperature and food supply exert contrary influences on particular taxa (or life history stages) under certain environmental circumstances. Predation undoubtedly has an overriding influence on body size selection. Depending on its mechanistic basis (visual, tactile or both in tandem), it selectively favours either small or large body size, both within (adults vs. juveniles) and between prey species, which are accordingly often 'size-trapped' between contrasting selective pressures, with consequent indirect effects. The bioenergetics of fundamental physiological processes undoubtedly set constraints on body size and serve as the primary determinant. However, within such constraints, the phenotypic expression of body size reflects its adaptive modification in response to the prevailing abiotic and biotic environment. As such, body size represents an emergent ecological property, reflecting the outcome of specific circumstances and conditions, which vary both temporally within and spatially between different ecosystems, and are accordingly context dependent. Nevertheless, underlying physiological advantages of larger size (within and between species) among crustacean zooplankters-lower mass-specific metabolic rates (although recently challenged), higher individual feeding rates (at least among cladocerans), potentially wider food size-ranges, better starvation tolerances, higher potential fecundity, etc.-collectively favour the selection of increased body size, as predicted by the SEH. Although competitive superiority of large size (measured in terms of minimal food requirements) has been confirmed experimentally, this cannot be generalized to natural conditions, where conflicting and temporally variable pressures apply, and contribute to generally mixed, and temporally variable body size compositions.
   Complex undrlying ecological interactions and influences ultimately determine the phenotypic expression of body size in directions consistent with fitness optimization under prevailing circumstances. Certain specific and general deficiencies in information are identified. In particular, the overwhelming emphasis on daphniid cladocerans as model study taxa in freshwater ecosystems has marginalized the acquisition of a comparably broad and penetrating understanding of specific features both of non-daphniid cladoceran and copepod life histories and body size selection. Among daphniid cladocerans, contemporary definitive understanding devolves largely from reductionist laboratory approaches. Holistic re-integration of these mechanistic findings into natural system circumstances presents a difficult challenge that is attracting increasingly attention. With regard to copepods, synthetic integration of the expansive marine knowledge base appears crucial to inform and direct future investigations on freshwater taxa. The question of intrinsic body size regulation in copepods and cladocerans, especially in regard to final phenotypic plasticity in body size expression, awaits resolution. Overall, body size remains a multi-facetted and complex topic, offering promising challenges for further investigation.

AB Reintroductions are an important tool in conservation biology but frequently fail. Factors influencing reintroduction 'success' are rarely tested experimentally. We examined the relationship between habitat quality and reintroduction success in an experimental reintroduction of populations of water voles (Aruicola terrestris) in the UK.
   We released cohorts of 44 water voles into 12 replicate 800 m stretches of river, each supporting a different habitat abundance. Water voles initially established at nine sites, failing to establish at three sites due to predation from American mink (two sites) and atypically severe flooding post-release (one site). For sites where voles established, at those with higher vegetation abundance more of the release cohort survived (initial survival rates range 0.43-0.61), and post-establishment survival rates (range 0.45-0.80) and population densities (range 2.1-5.4 voles per 100 m of habitat) were higher. A further two populations were lost to American mink predation post-establishment. Reintroductions are commonly designated as either a 'success' or a 'failure'. The principal cause of a failed release in our study was insufficient mink control. However, whilst seven of our 12 reintroductions were 'successful', our results indicated substantial variation in the population densities and survival rates that the replicate habitats could support. This highlights the need to ensure that any habitat selected for a reintroduction is the best obtainable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Species reintroduction programmes, in prioritizing areas for reintroductions, have traditionally used tools that include measures of habitat suitability and evaluations of area requirements for viable populations. Here we add two tools to this approach: evaluation of ecological requirements of species and evaluation of future suitability for species facing changing climates. We demonstrate this approach with two species for which reintroduction programmes are in the planning stages in Mexico: California condor Gymnogyps californianns and Mexican wolf Canis lupus baileyi. For the condor, we identify three areas clustered in the Sierra San Pedro Martir, Baja California; for the wolf, we identify a string of suitable sites along the Sierra Madre Occidental of western Mexico. We discuss the limitations of this approach, identifying ways in which the models illustrated could be made more realistic and directly useful to reintroduction programmes.

AB In terms of widespread distribution and high population density Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum mangarevense are the most conspicuous organisms settled on the reefs in Tahiti and other high islands of French Polynesia. This study reports on quantitative investigations of the temporal and spatial patterns displayed by these two species. It was carried out at three different sites on Tahiti Island. Data dealing with density, maturity, size structure of the mature population, sex-distribution and fertility were collected over 16 months between November 1994 and February 1996. Turbinaria ornata and Sargassum mangarevense populations settle on the reef throughout the year with a peak in density during the cool season. A density gradient from the fringing reef to the outer biogenic ridge was evident. A peak in maturity and fertility was observed during the warm season. A dwarfism of thallus length was noticed in Turbinaria ornata on the outer biogenic ridge whereas it was not observed in Sargassum mangarevense. The populations of both species settled on the fringing reef and outer biogenic ridge, two physically and chemically unstable areas, exhibited a high sexual reproduction, whereas it was lower on the inner barrier reef. Whatever the area considered the period of reproduction of these two species extended throughout the whole year. The data collected during this study were used to explain the colonization of different habitats by these two species.

AB Prey composition of Barn Owl (Tyto alba) pellets from northwestern Negev, Israel, was examined. The 414 individual specimens of mammals represented by 256 pellets comprised: 9.2% Meriones sacramenti, 41.1% M. tristrami, 8.2% Gerbillus andersoni, 40.1% Mus musculus, and 1.4% Crocidura suaveolens. The pellets also contained some remains of insects, small specimens of the snake Eryx jaculus, and two passerine birds. We tested whether the observed distribution of prey species in the 256 pellets could be obtained if owls hunted at random. Direct calculation and simulations indicate that more single-species pellets contained large mammals than would be expected from random sampling. In simulation of owls sampling at random from the database, the distribution of ''pellets'' containing 1, 2, 3, or more prey items was similar to the observed distribution only when a cumulative weight limit for pellet ejection was set at 80-100 g. Even when Barn Owls do not hunt some species preferentially, the contents of the pellets may be biased towards larger prey. This result should be taken into consideration when accumulated pellets are used in ecological and paleontological studies to approximate the distribution of mammal prey in real communities, present or past.

AB The recent debate about the sustainability of African pastoralism is taken to illustrate four general issues in environmental management: (i) the extent to which the institutionalization of environmental paradigms has made them conform to the Kuhnian model; (ii) the intimate link between environmental policies and paradigms; (iii) the need to understand the dialogue between scientists, policy-makers and educators and the environment; and (iv) the theoretical and practical weakness of an environmental science that does not rest on a dialogue with cultural geography. The 'old paradigm' in range ecology depended on three main sets of actors: (i) range ecologists who believed in Clement's (1916) model of succession and ecological stability; (ii) economists who believed in Hardin's (1968) concepts of the 'tragedy of the commons'; and (iii) authoritarian administrations which saw pastoralists as backward and destructive, and which had the power and the structures to use and perpetuate scientific paradigms. The so-called 'new paradigm' sees semi-arid ecosystems as being in permanent disequilibrium but persistent on broad temporal and spatial scales whilst many indigenous pastoral strategies are carefully adapted to these characteristics.

AB In January 1989, a long-term study site was established on a coral reef off the south coast of St. John, U. S. Virgin Islands. Five 20 m transects were installed at depths of ca 11 to 13 m. Hurricane Hugo struck St. John on September 17 and 18, 1989. Analysis of quantitative data collected before and after the storm allowed documentation of the effects of this powerful storm on coral community structure. The total living cover by scleractinians, including the dominant species, Montastrea annularis, decreased significantly. The amount of substrate available for colonization increased. Cover by macroscopic algae increased dramatically after the storm, later decreased, and then rose again 1 yr later. In spite of the reduction in live cover by the dominant coral species, neither diversity (H') nor evenness (J') increased. Topographical complexity, estimated from calculations of spatial indices, did not decrease along the transects as a result of the storm. No measurable recovery of the live corals has occurred in the 12 mo following the initial post-storm survey.

AB Wildlife translocations can have conservation value but results have been mixed regarding animal behavior and survival post-release. Practitioners have adopted antipredator training, environmental enrichment, and soft release as pre-release conditioning tactics to encourage adaptive behavior and improve post-release survival, but their utility has not been broadly quantified. We performed a formal literature review and conducted meta-analysis on 108 effects from 41 studies experimentally testing how these tactics affected survival, movement, or site fidelity compared to unconditioned animals. We further investigated how each conditioning tactic, animal source (wild-to-wild translocated or captive-released), age, and taxonomic group (birds, fish, mammals, and reptiles) influenced outcomes. Relative to unconditioned animals, conditioned individuals were 1.5 times more likely to survive, had reduced movement, and were three times more likely to show site fidelity. Each of the three conditioning tactics resulted in improved survival. Juveniles released from captivity derived the greatest survival benefit from conditioning. Across taxa, conditioning most benefitted survival of fish. Conditioning also had positive effects on survival of mammals and reptiles, albeit with less certainty than for fish. Estimates comparing survival of conditioned to unconditioned birds were much more variable, suggesting avian translocation programs using conditioning generally need improvement. Soft release consistently reduced movement and increased site fidelity; this was an especially viable technique for adult wild-to-wild translocated animals. We provide quantitative evidence that behavioral conditioning can aid wildlife translocations, and we encourage continued experiments to further elucidate how refined tactics could advance conservation efforts using translocation as a management tool.

AB The use of conservation translocations to mitigate human effects on biodiversity is increasing, but how these efforts are allocated remains unclear. Based on a comprehensive literature review and online author survey, we sought to determine the goals of translocation efforts, whether they focus on species and regions with high threat and likelihood of perceived success, and how success might be improved. We systematically searched the ISI Web of Knowledge and Academic Search Complete databases to determine the species and regions of conservation translocations and found 1863 articles on conservation translocations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and Caribbean published from 1974 to 2013. We questioned 330 relevant authors to determine the motivation for translocations, how translocations were evaluated, and obstacles encountered. Conservation translocations in North America were geographically widespread (in 21 countries), increased in frequency over time for all animal classes (from 1 in 1974 to 84 in 2013), and included 279 different species. Reintroductions and reinforcements were more common in the United States than in Canada and Mexico, Central America, or the Caribbean, and their prevalence was correlated with the number of species at risk at national and state or provincial levels. Translocated species had a higher threat status at state and provincial levels than globally (International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categorization), suggesting that translocations may have been motivated by regional priorities rather than global risk. Our survey of authors was consistent with these results; most translocations were requested, supported, or funded by government agencies and downlisting species at national or state or provincial levels was the main goal. Nonetheless, downlisting was the least reported measure of success, whereas survival and reproduction of translocated individuals were the most reported. Reported barriers to success included biological factors such as animal mortality and nonbiological factors, such as financial constraints, which were less often considered in the selection of release sites. Our review thus highlights discrepancies between project goals and evaluation criteria and between risk factors considered and obstacles encountered, indicating room to further optimize translocation projects.
   La Alineacion de la Amenaza, el Esfuerzo y el Exito Percibido en las Translocaciones para Conservacion en America del Norte El uso de las translocaciones para conservacion y mitigar los efectos humanos sobre la biodiversidad esta incrementando, pero aun no es claro como se asignan estos esfuerzos. Con base en una revision integral de literatura y una encuesta de autor en linea buscamos determinar los objetivos de los esfuerzos de translocacion, ya sea que se enfoquen en especies y regiones con una amenaza mayor y una probabilidad de exito percibido y como el exito puede mejorarse. Buscamos sistematicamente las bases de datos completas de la Red de Conocimiento y Busqueda Academica ISI para determinar las especies y regiones de las translocaciones para conservacion y encontramos 1,863 articulos sobre translocaciones para conservacion en los Estados Unidos, Canada, Mexico, America Central y el Caribe, publicados entre 1974 y 2013. Consultamos a 330 autores relevantes para determinar los motivos de las translocaciones, como fueron evaluadas y los obstaculos a los que se enfrentaron. Las translocaciones para conservacion en America del Norte estaban dispersas geograficamente (en 21 paises), incrementaron su frecuencia con el tiempo para todas las clases animales (de una en 1974 a 84 en 2013) e incluyeron a 279 especies diferentes. Las reintroducciones y los refuerzos fueron mas comunes en los Estados Unidos que en Canada, Mexico, America Central o el Caribe, y su prevalencia estuvo correlacionada con el numero de especies en riesgo a nivel nacional, estatal o provincial. Las especies reubicadas tenian un mayor estado de amenaza a nivel estatal y provincial que a nivel global (categorias de la Lista Roja de la Union Internacion para la Conservacion de la Naturaleza), lo que sugiere que las reubicaciones podrian haber estado motivadas por prioridades regionales en lugar del riesgo global. Nuestra encuesta a los autores fue consistente con estos resultados ya que la mayoria de las reubicaciones fueron solicitadas, apoyadas o financiadas por agencias del gobierno y bajar la categoria de la especie a nivel nacional, estatal o provincial era el objetivo principal. Sin embargo, bajar la categoria fue la medida de exito menos reportada. Los obstaculos para el exito reportados incluyeron factores biologicos, como la mortalidad animal, y factores no biologicos, como las restricciones financieras, que fueron menos considerados en la seleccion de los sitios de liberacion. Nuestra revision resalta asi las discrepancias entre los objetivos del proyecto y los criterios de evaluacion y entre los factores de riesgo considerados y los obstaculos enfrentados, lo que indica que existe espacio para optimizar aun mas los proyectos de reubicacion.

AB This paper describes a procedure for evaluating the desertification risk in threatened areas. The procedure is based on an eight-equation dynamic model of a generic human-resource system that can be applied to different desertification syndromes. For each application, interest focuses on finding all the possible long-term final states of the system and on defining the conditions that mark out sustainability and long-term desertification by means of unambiguous specific parameter relations. The procedure is applied to three typified cases in Spain: (A) rainfed crops in areas with high soil erosion risk; (B) irrigated intensive agricultural systems; and (C) commercial rangelands. Results show that, in case A, high profit scenarios are responsible for the final extension of desertification but do not determine the specific threshold between sustainability and desertification. They do, however, in cases B and C. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Aims Most studies on cactus recruitment have focused on the role of woody plants as seedling facilitators. Although the spatial association of cacti with objects had been described, the mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown. The aims of this study were to identify which mechanisms facilitate the establishment of a columnar cactus under the shade and protection of objects and to compare these mechanisms with those involved in plant-plant facilitation.
   Methods Three split-split-plot field experiments were conducted to compare the effects of two microhabitats (inside rocky cavities and beneath plant canopies) on seed removal, germination, seedling survivorship and dry weight. Flat, open spaces were used as the control. For each microhabitat, the effect of seed or seedling protection and substrate limitation were explored; aboveground microclimate and some soil properties were also characterized.
   Key Results The permanence of superficial seeds was greater inside rocky cavities than beneath woody plant canopies or on flat, open areas. Germination was similar in cavities and beneath plant canopies, but significantly higher than on flat, open areas. Seedling survivorship was greater beneath plant canopies than inside cavities or on flat, open spaces.
   Conclusions The mechanisms of plant facilitation are different from those of object facilitation. There are seed-seedling conflicts involved in the recruitment of P. leucocephalus: nurse plants favour mainly seedling survivorship by providing a suitable microenvironment, while nurse objects mainly favour seed permanence, by protecting them from predators.

AB Hypotheses for trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) decline in Rocky Mountain national parks include long-term high herbivory by elk (Cervus elaphus), decreased disturbance, climate change, and long-term low elk herbivory. Predation theory, as applied to herbivores, was used to describe alternative functional responses predicted by each hypothesis. Further, we postulated that elk behavioral patterns resulting from predation risk could also influence aspen herbivory. We tested predictions by sampling aspen density and browsing conditions in spatially separate watersheds in the Canadian Rockies, with three areas in each of three elk density levels (<2, 2-4, >4 elk/km(2)), and in each of four tree cover classes: recently disturbed (<25 years ago), and low, moderate, and high. Plot elk use was indexed with pellet group counts classed by habitat patch type, aspen condition (open or thicket), and different distances from trails or park boundaries used by predators, hunters, or park visitors. The herbivory rate on aspen saplings (>1 m height and <1 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) fitted the predictions of a Type 2 functional response (e.g. increased rate of herbivory with decreased sapling density). The Type 2 response appeared to result from low elk use in dense aspen thickets when predation risk is high. An interaction effect in the tree cover x elk density factorial analysis indicated that recent disturbances (<25 years) have incrementally increased the number of aspen saplings, but did not cause a major shift to an abundant sapling state in areas of high and moderate elk density. These results best supported the predictions of the low elk herbivory hypothesis. Anthropogenic burning combined with human and carnivore predation effects on elk (behavioral and numeric) appeared to be important in aspen's long-term persistence, and its recent decline.

AB Animal foraging may be influenced by multiple demands simultaneously (e.g., nutrient gain and predator avoidance). Conventional approaches to understand the trade-offs between these demands require examining them in similar currencies, which is impractical in many field situations. We introduce a new method, called multiobjective programming, as a framework to explore how animals balance conflicting demands. Multiobjective programming allows one to explore the influence of foraging demands directly, without explicit assumptions about how they enter into fitness and without conversion to some common currency. Using multiobjective programming, we show that, as foraging demands change, animals may adaptively adjust their behavior, even if the constraints on feasible behavior are unaffected (contrary to the predictions of the conventional models). Hence, we may see a variable response in foraging that is consistent with adaptive behavior. We used an empirical test with herbivore grasshoppers and predator spiders to evaluate the utility of multiobjective programming. Our experiments show that grasshoppers are able to optimally balance the foraging objectives of energy intake and vigilance under changing levels of predation risk. The multiobjective model is used both to evaluate the biological significance of the broad variation that was observed in the grasshoppers' foraging behavior and to quantify explicitly the trade-off between energy intake and predator avoidance.

AB This paper deals with sublethal salinity stress on reef building corals in the Inner Gulf of Thailand. Maximum photosynthetic and respiratory rates were measured in Porites lutea and Pocillopora damicornis as changes in dissolved oxygen levels per hour and the gross production to respiration ratio (Pg:R) calculated. Pg:R ratios were significantly lowered in both species when exposed to sudden salinity drops from ambient 30 parts per thousand to 20 and 10 parts per thousand, but P. lutea was less affected. Photosynthetic rates were lowered in proportion to the salinity reductions in both species, whereas respiration rates were either slightly decreased or unaltered. When calculating the Pg:R ratios on a 24 h basis both species displayed values below 1, even at ambient salinity (P. lutea 0.71 +/- 0.04 and P. damicornis 0.89 +/- 0.02), thus indicating that they do not solely depend on internal primary production for their maintenance. In an experiment on the capacity of heterotrophic feeding with Artemia salina, P. damicornis showed a clearance rate 4 times higher than P. lutea, indicating that P. damicornis may be more capable of compensating for a low Pg:R ratio by heterotrophic feeding.

TI Overnight memory retention of foraging skills by bumblebees is imperfect
SO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
LA English
DT Article
ID HONEY-BEES; SCENT-MARK; BEHAVIOR
AB Newly emerged bees learn to forage more efficiently as they gain experience. To test the hypothesis that foraging efficiency would increase as bees gain experience during the day, but would decrease after a night, owing to loss of memory, naive Bombus terrestris bumblebees were allowed to forage on two clusters of artificial flowers of unequal profitabilities during 3 consecutive days. Nectar intake rate, percentage of visits to the more profitable cluster, probing time and time intervals between visits were computed as measures of the bees' foraging efficiency. Nectar intake rates increased significantly during the day, and decreased partially but significantly after a night. They varied greatly between bees. The bees did not show a preference for one of the clusters at the onset of the experiment, and none consistently increased their visits to the more profitable cluster during single observation days. Most individuals did not visit the higher-reward cluster exclusively by the end of the third day. However, visits to the higher-reward cluster did increase significantly when the first day of observation was compared with the third day. Preference for the higher-reward duster increased after the first night but decreased significantly after the second night. Probing time and inter-visit intervals decreased significantly during observation days, and increased significantly after a night. The results indicate that bees learn to approach and probe flowers faster, as they gain experience, during a foraging day, but that these skins are partially forgotten overnight. Patch preference is formed more slowly. Once formed, it is also weakened overnight. Such partial forgetting may aid the bee in reacting quickly to overnight changes in resource profitability by modifying flower choices and handling techniques.

AB Scientists of different disciplines have recognized the valuable role of terrestrial caves as ideal natural laboratories in which to study multiple eco-evolutionary processes, from genes to ecosystems. Because caves and other subterranean habitats are semi-closed systems characterized by a remarkable thermal stability, they should also represent insightful systems for understanding the effects of climate change on biodiversity in situ. Whilst a number of recent advances have demonstrated how promising this fast-moving field of research could be, a lack of synthesis is possibly holding back the adoption of caves as standard models for the study of the recent climatic alteration. By linking literature focusing on physics, geology, biology and ecology, we illustrate the rationale supporting the use of subterranean habitats as laboratories for studies of global change biology. We initially discuss the direct relationship between external and internal temperature, the stability of the subterranean climate and the dynamics of its alteration in an anthropogenic climate change perspective. Owing to their evolution in a stable environment, subterranean species are expected to exhibit low tolerance to climatic perturbations and could theoretically cope with such changes only by shifting their distributional range or by adapting to the new environmental conditions. However, they should have more obstacles to overcome than surface species in such shifts, and therefore could be more prone to local extinction. In the face of rapid climate change, subterranean habitats can be seen as refugia for some surface species, but at the same time they may turn into dead-end traps for some of their current obligate inhabitants. Together with other species living in confined habitats, we argue that subterranean species are particularly sensitive to climate change, and we stress the urgent need for future research, monitoring programs and conservation measures.

AB Invasive rodents are among the most ubiquitous and problematic species introduced to islands; more than 80% of the world's island groups have been invaded. Introduced rats (black rat, Rattus rattus; Norway rat, R. norvegicus; Pacific rat, R. exulans) are well known as seed predators but are often overlooked as potential seed dispersers despite their common habit of transporting fruits and seeds prior to consumption. The relative likelihood of seed predation and dispersal by the black rat, which is the most common rat in Hawaiian forest, was tested with field and laboratory experiments. In the field, fruits of eight native and four non-native common woody plant species were arranged individually on the forest floor in four treatments that excluded vertebrates of different sizes. Eleven species had a portion (3-100%) of their fruits removed from vertebrate-accessible treatments, and automated cameras photographed only black rats removing fruit. In the laboratory, black rats were offered fruits of all 12 species to assess consumption and seed fate. Seeds of two species (non-native Clidemia hirta and native Kadua affinis) passed intact through the digestive tracts of rats. Most of the remaining larger-seeded species had their seeds chewed and destroyed, but for several of these, some partly damaged or undamaged seeds survived rat exposure. The combined field and laboratory findings indicate that many interactions between black rats and seeds of native and non-native plants may result in dispersal. Rats are likely to be affecting plant communities through both seed predation and dispersal.

AB Although Semipalmated Sandpipers Calidris pusilla are monogamous, with biparental incubation, most females (86-97%) deserted their broods to the care of their mates, 0-11 days (average 6) after their eggs hatched. Males left the brood an average of 8 days later, shortly before or after the chicks fledged. In several instances, females that deserted in one year remained with the chicks the next year, and vice versa. Females deserted chicks at nests that hatched later in the season at an earlier age than those had hatched earlier (r2 > 0.6). Since females appeared to have an energy deficit in at least some years, and suffered higher mortality rates than males during breeding, it is possible that females deserted broods in order to take advantage of better feeding conditions at migratory stopovers in northeastern North America early in the season. There was little evidence of higher nesting success or earlier hatching date in reuniting pairs, although if both members of a pair returned to the breeding area, 80% reunited. Increased survival of their mate may be most advantageous to males in ensuring that they obtain a female the following year.

AB The distribution and abundance of sessile organisms under coral rubble has been studied at Bonaire and Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. Species richness under rubble is extremely high with at least 367 species of which sponges, tunicates and bryozoans are the most important. Shallow sub-rubble communities can be considered refuges as the majority of these species are crypt-obligate. Sub-rubble communities may also have a preserve function for sponges, but do not harbour enough corals to ensure a quick coral recolonization of the reef surface after a major disaster. Cryptic community composition is affected by depth and pollution, and differs substantially between the two neighbouring islands, possibly as a result of different bottom characteristics. Biomass of the sub-rubble communities may contribute considerably to total reef biomass. Diversity varies inversely with increased depth and increased rubble size, possibly indicating abiotic control (e. g. physical disturbance by wave action and reef slope substrate collapse).

AB An algal bloom of Peridinium gatunenese generally precedes the annual maximum of methane release from the profundal sediment of Lake Kinneret. Therefore, we investigated the response of the sediment methanogenic microbial community to simulated algal deposition. Addition of algal biomass on top of sediment cores resulted in increased CH4 production rates and concentrations of the fermentation products acetate and propionate in the upper 4-cm layers with maximum values at 1-cm depth. Addition of algae to sediment slurries also resulted in increased CH4 production rates and a transient increase of H-2, propionate, and acetate concentrations within the first 10 d after addition. The composition of the active microbial community was determined by analysis of terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP) targeting ribosomal RNA and cloning and sequencing of reverse-transcribed 16S rRNA. Analysis of the sediment in the presence and absence of algae indicated that among the Bacteria, members of Deltaproteobacteria and Clostridiales responded by synthesis of ribosomes after 1 d of incubation and those of Bacteroidetes after 6 d. Among the Archaea, ribosomal RNA of the Methanosaetaceae (i.e., acetate-utilizing methanogens) slightly increased after 6 d. Algal deposition apparently stimulated ribosomal synthesis in these sediment microorganisms, thus resulting in increased activity. We conclude that these microorganisms were involved in degradation of the algal biomass resulting in transient release of acetate and other fermentation products and increased production of CH4.

AB The aim of this study was to provide an analysis of vegetation and environment relationships in the Alxa Plateau of Inner Mongolia, China. Seventy species representing 46 genera and 16 families were collected. The largest families were Leguminosae, Polygonaceae, Gramineae and Compositae, representing 20.0%, 15.7%, 14.3% and 14.3% of the total flora, respectively. Phanerophytes and hemicryptophytes were the most abundant life-form. Classification of the vegetation was analysed using two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) techniques. This resulted in the recognition of six vegetation groups, each of definite vegetation and soil characteristics, which could be linked to a specific geomorphologic unit. Ordination techniques as detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to examine the relationship between the vegetation and environmental parameters. Analysis with DCA gave results similar to CCA, suggesting that there is a relatively strong correspondence between vegetation and environmental factors. CCA axis 1 was highly associated with organic matter, total nitrogen, silt and clay content, elevation, Kira moisture index and relative humidity, while CCA axis 2 showed significant correlation with chlorine, calcium ion, magnesium ion and electrolytic conductivity. These gradients were related closely to the first two canonical axes, and accounted for 60% of the species-environment relationship in the study sites. Understanding relationships between environmental variables and vegetation distribution in this area helps us to apply these findings in management, reclamation, and development of arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems.

AB Floral structure, including morphology, anatomy and histology, was comparatively studied in representatives of all seven families of Cucurbitales as currently circumscribed by other authors based on molecular analyses and including Corynocarpaceae, Coriariaceae, Tetramelaceae, Datiscaceae, Begoniaceae, Cucurbitaceae and Anisophylleaceae. Three superfamilial clades are supported by floral structure: Tetramelaceae/Datiseaceae, Tetramelaceae/Datiscaceae/Begoniaceae and Corynocarpaceae/Coriariaceae. Anisophylleaceae appear most isolated in Cucurbitales, and show more similarities with Oxalidales, especially Cunoniaceae, although some features of interest are shared with other Cucurbitales and not Oxalidales. Tetramelaceae and Datiscaceae share dioecy, completely isomerous (but not regularly pentamerous) flowers (not in male Datiscaceae), only small sepals, lacking petals (not in male Octomeles). Tetramelaceae, Datiscaceae and Begoniaceae share the presence of numerous small ovules and seeds with a large-celled surface, 2-cell-layered integuments, and a collar around the funicle by an extension of the outer integument. Corynocarpaceae and Coriariaceae share thick petals, unifacial stigmas, superior ovaries with a single, median, pendant syntropous ovule per carpel, and annular outer integuments with vasculature at the base. The four classical core families of Cucurbitales: Tetramelaceae, Datiscaceae, Begoniaceae and Cucurbitaceae (relationship unresolved, not retrieved as a clade as yet in molecular studies) share in various combinations androdioecy, basifixed and extrorse or latrorse anthers, trimerous gynoecia, bifurcate free carpel parts, an extended roof over the ovary formed by the ventral parts of the carpels, and parietal placentae. Trends of interest at the order level are unisexual flowers, thick, pointed petals (if present) that do not conform to the model in other rosids or basal core eudicots, a 2-cell-layered inner integument, which is delayed in development, and lacking or scant tanniferous tissues in flowers.

AB The top-down and bottom-up properties of model food webs that include intraguild predation and self-limiting factors such as cannibalism are investigated. Intraguild predation can dampen or even reverse the top-down effects predicted by food chain theory. The degree of self-limitation among the intraguild prey is a key factor in determining the direction and strength of the top-down response. Intraguild predation and self-limiting factors can also substantially alter the bottom-up effects of enrichment. These results can help explain the disparate results of trophic cascade experiments in lakes, where cascades are usually seen when large Daphnia are the primary herbivores, but not when smaller-bodied herbivores are dominant. Top-down manipulations should cascade at least modestly to phytoplankton in those lakes whose food web can be reasonably approximated by a chain (typically, those where Daphnia is the dominant herbivore), as predicted by food chain theory. On the other hand, smaller-bodied zooplankton are often preyed upon heavily by invertebrate predators as well as by planktivorous fish, thereby introducing elements of intraguild predation into these food webs. In this case, conventional food chain theory is likely to give incorrect predictions. Very large cascade effects may be due primarily to regime shifts between intraguild predation-dominated food webs and those that more resemble food chains, rather than due to the simple food chain cascade usually considered.

AB Models made to explain sudden and irreversible vegetation shifts in semi-arid grasslands typically assume that herbivore density is independent of the state of the vegetation, e.g., under the control of humans. We relax this assumption and investigate the mathematical implications of vegetation-regulated herbivore population dynamics. We show that irreversible vegetation change may also occur in systems where herbivore population dynamics are affected by changes in plant standing crop. Our analysis furthermore shows that irreversible vegetation change may occur for a larger set of soil and climatic conditions when herbivore numbers are independent of the vegetation, as compared to systems where vegetation density determines herbivore population size. Hence, our analysis suggests that irreversible vegetation change is less likely to occur in systems with natural herbivore population dynamics than in systems where humans control herbivore density.

AB Harmful effects of five third-generation oil dispersants (Inipol IP-90, Petrotech PTI-25, Bioreico R-93, Biosolve and Emulgal C-100) on planula larvae of the Red Sea stony coral Stylophora pistillata and the soft coral Heteroxenia fuscescense were evaluated in short-term (2-96 h) bioassays, Larvae were exposed to Egyptian oil water soluble fractions (WSFs), dispersed oil water accommodated fractions (WAFs) and dispersants dissolved in seawater, in different concentrations. Mortality, settlement rates and the appearance of morphologic:ai and behavioural deformations were measured, While oil WSF treatments resulted in reductions in planulae settlement only, treatments by all dispersants tested revealed a further decrease in settlement rates and additional high toxicity. Dispersed oil exposures resulted in a dramatic increase in toxicity to both coral larvae species. Furthermore, dispersants and WAFs treatments caused larval morphology deformations, loss of normal swimming behaviour and rapid tissue degeneration. Out of the five tested dispersion agents, the chemical Petrotech PTI-25 displayed the least toxicity to coral larvae, We suggest avoidance of the use of chemical dispersion in cases of oil spills near or within coral reef habitats.

AB The diet and microhabitat use of two species of native Australian desert rodents, the spinifex hopping-mouse Notomys alexis and sandy inland mouse Pseudomys hermannsburgensis, were studied in the Simpson Desert, south-western Queensland. Contrary to expectation, both species were confirmed from analyses of their stomach contents to be omnivorous. The diets of both species varied through time in a similar manner; seeds were important in summer and especially in winter, but in autumn invertebrates constituted nearly 50% and 60% of the diet of N. alexis and P. hermannsburgensis, respectively. Other plant material (root, leaf, floral part, stem) was found in appreciable amounts in the stomach contents of both species, and fungi were identified from a small number of individuals. Both species showed a high degree of overlap in the broad types of food they ingested (seed, plant material, invertebrates); however, there was considerably less overlap in the species of seeds eaten. Analysis of microhabitat use suggested that this difference was due to differential foraging between the species; the larger, bipedal N. alexis forages in the open more than the smaller, quadrupedal P. hermannsburgensis, which is found more commonly in or under hummocks of spinifex grass. Although our findings parallel patterns of morphological specialisation and differential foraging on seeds that have been described within communities of North American heteromyid rodents, we found little evidence that the foraging economics of N. alexis or P. hermannsburgensis should depend solely or primarily on the distribution patterns of seeds. In the absence of dietary information, we suggest that ecological studies of desert rodents which focus solely on granivory, and neglect other important aspects of rodent foraging, can lead to a misinterpretation of species coexistence and community structure.

AB A generic simulation model for the dynamics of submerged macrophytes is presented, called MEGAPLANT ('Model Evaluating General Aquatic Pland Laws And New Theories'). Although the model is kept relatively simple, it includes many aspects that have an effect on vegetation dynamics during the seasonal cycle, such as grazing, overwintering strategies, wave action and seed dispersal. The characteristics of both the plant and the environment can be adjusted by the user. The model is meant as an aid to enhance insight into the interplay of processes that influence vegetation dynamics. As an example, it is used to analyze mechanisms that determine the survival of vegetation in turbid eutrophic lakes. The following results were found. (1) Hot spots of propagule-producing vegetation can permanently maintain vegetation stands at sites that would otherwise be devoid of macrophytes. (2) Moderate fluctuations in environmental factors that normally have little impact on the vegetation can cause large year-to-year fluctuations in biomass of vegetation growing under suboptimal conditions. (3) Grazing by herbivores such as coots can cause the existence of two alternative stable states: under-exploited and overgrazed. This implies that herbivores may prevent the recovery of submerged macrophytes in lakes that are recovering from eutrophication, but also that temporary exclusion of herbivores can trigger permanent recovery of the vegetation.
   It is shown that the quantitative simulation results are sensitive to the setting of several parameters but that the qualitative results presented are quite robust against changes in parameter setting. It is argued that although the prospects of accurate predictive simulation of aquatic vegetation are poor, relatively simple models like the one presented can be a useful tool to improve the theoretical framework for understanding the dominant mechanisms regulating submerged plant dynamics.

AB 1. The response of different salt-marsh plant communities to grazing by lesser snow geese and isostatic uplift was examined at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba on the Hudson Bay coast. Results are based on direct experimental manipulation of swards and previously published floristic and biomass data.
   2. At the seaward end of the salt-marsh the vegetation is composed of Puccinellia phryganodes and Carex subspathacea. This assemblage of species is also present in the upper marsh, but only as a consequence of intense grazing by geese. Grazed swards of these species persist over a period of at least 10 years.
   3. When swards are protected from grazing in the upper marsh, rapid changes in floristic composition of vegetation occur. There is a substantial increase in above-ground biomass and the vegetation is dominated by Calamagrostis deschampsiodes, Festuca rubra and dicotyledonous plants. When these swards are grazed the species composition does not revert to the Puccinellia-Carex assemblage.
   4. In the presence of grazing this change from the Puccinellia-Carex assemblage to the Calamagrostis-Festuca assemblage occurs gradually as a consequence of changes in edaphic conditions associated with isostatic uplift. The geese delay the rate of vegetational development associated with the effects of isostatic uplift but they cannot arrest it.
   5. Both types of plant assemblage may become extinct locally as a result of grubbing by the geese for roots and rhizomes of graminoid species. Habitat conditions are sufficiently altered following grubbing that the process of succession recommences from bare sediment.
   6. The results of changes in floristic composition, above-ground biomass and replacement rates of vegetation are examined in relation to predictions of multiple-state models which emphasize the directional asymmetry in the development of plant communities.

   RESPONSES
AB Understanding general rules governing macroecological body size variations is one of the oldest pursuits in ecology. However, this science has been dominated by studies of terrestrial vertebrates, spurring debate over the validity of such rules in other taxonomic groups. Here, relationships between maximum body size and latitude, temperature, and elevation were evaluated for 29 North American freshwater fish species. Bergmann''s rule (i.e., that body size correlates positively with latitude and negatively with temperature) was observed in 38% of species, converse Bergmann''s rule (that body size correlates negatively with latitude and positively with temperature) was observed in 34% of species, and 28% of species showed no macroecological body size relationships. Most notably, every species that expressed Bergmann''s rule was a cool- or cold-water species while every species that expressed converse Bergmann''s rule was a warm-water species, highlighting how these patterns are likely connected to species thermal niches. This study contradicts previous research suggesting Bergmann''s rule does not apply to freshwater fishes, and is congruent with an emerging paradigm of variable macroecological body size patterns in poikilotherms.

AB With 28% of the 350 species of parrots considered threatened, numerous conservation efforts have been initiated for these species. Among these, the restoration or establishment of new populations has increasingly relied on reintroductions as a conservation strategy, often with mixed or uncertain results. We reviewed the results and methodologies of 47 distinct releases and reintroductions of psittacines in nine different countries worldwide over the past 25 years to identify common denominators of successful efforts. To do so, we established a uniform and objective definition of reintroduction success (first-year survival >0.50 and released birds breeding with conspecifics, either captive-reared or wild), and applied generalized linear models and information-theoretic model selection to multiple datasets to identify important predictor variables. We identified several likely predictors of successful psittacine reintroductions, relating to predation mitigation, habitat quality, and post-release supplementation that may provide guidance for future efforts. We also advocate SWOT analysis for objectively evaluating the suitability of potential reintroduction sites. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB P>1. Up to 73% of the world's rangelands are degraded, and increasing demand for meat in developing countries and a growing human population are likely to exert even greater pressures on rangelands in the next 20-50 years. Restoration of rangeland grazing potential and resilience is therefore important, particularly in the face of climate change.
   2. We investigated the influence of past stocking rates (from 1910 to 1987), rainfall, and current grazing regimes (from 1988 to 2008) on plant assemblages, grazing potential, and diversity of palatable species in southern Karoo rangelands, South Africa.
   3. We used herbivore exclusion experiments to test whether resting rangeland for 20 years enables recovery of plant assemblages (where seed sources are present within 50 m), regardless of previous grazing history. Mean annual rainfall over this period was 15% higher than the mean annual rainfall for the preceding 80 years and included two exceptionally wet years.
   4. While rainfall was a primary driver of total vegetation cover, grazing history explained differences in plant species composition: plots with shared historical grazing intensity were more similar than plots with the same grazing regimes between 1988 and 2008.
   5. In historically heavily-grazed exclusion plots, cover of the palatable species Tripteris sinuata (formerly Osteospermum sinuatum) returned to levels comparable to that in both exclusion and lightly-grazed plots with a moderate grazing history. Five palatable species (Pteronia empetrifolia, Tetragonia spicata, Berkheya spinosa, Hereroa latipetala and Ruschia spinosa) failed to re-establish, however, despite the presence of seed-producing plants nearby. Furthermore, only cover of P. empetrifolia increased significantly in historically moderately-grazed plots. Cover of unpalatable plants (e.g. Pteronia pallens) increased in all plots over time.
   6.Synthesis and applications. These findings suggest that present species composition of arid shrublands reflects historical management at time scales greater than 20 years. Despite high rainfall enabling the return of grazing potential through recovery of a single forage species, rest alone did not ensure the return of all palatable species, with implications for rangeland resilience. Restoring the full suite of palatable species over management timeframes will require more complex interventions such as reseeding or selective clearing.

AB The most suitable method for estimation of size diversity is investigated. Size diversity is computed on the basis of the Shannon diversity expression adapted for continuous variables, such as size. It takes the form of an integral involving the probability density function (pdf) of the size of the individuals. Different approaches for the estimation of pdf are compared: parametric methods, assuming that data come from a determinate family of pdfs, and nonparametric methods, where pdf is estimated using some kind of local evaluation. Exponential, generalized Pareto, normal, and log-normal distributions have been used to generate simulated samples using estimated parameters from real samples. Nonparametric methods include discrete computation of data histograms based on size intervals and continuous kernel estimation of pdf. Kernel approach gives accurate estimation of size diversity, whilst parametric methods are only useful when the reference distribution have similar shape to the real one. Special attention is given for data standardization. The division of data by the sample geometric mean is proposed as the most suitable standardization method, which shows additional advantages: the same size diversity value is obtained when using original size or log-transformed data, and size measurements with different dimensionality (longitudes, areas, volumes or biomasses) may be immediately compared with the simple addition of ln k where k is the dimensionality ( 1, 2, or 3, respectively). Thus, the kernel estimation, after data standardization by division of sample geometric mean, arises as the most reliable and generalizable method of size diversity evaluation.

AB Life- history traits in wild populations are often regarded as being subject to directional selection, and the existence of substantial variation and microevolutionary stasis of these characters is therefore a problem in need of explanation. Avian clutch size is an archetypal life- history trait in this context, and many studies have sought to test explanations for stasis in clutch size. Surprisingly, there are many fewer studies that used long- term data to ask how selection acts on clutch size, particularly in a multivariate framework. In this article, we report selection, inheritance, and evolution of clutch size over 25 years in a colony of mute swans using a multivariate quantitative genetic framework to control for correlations with breeding time. We show that clutch size is influenced by both additive genetic and permanent environmental effects and that selection acts on clutch size in combination with breeding time. Natural selection on clutch size is strongly directional, favoring larger clutches, and we observe an increase in clutch size of 0.35 standard deviations, consistent with the expected response based on selection and inheritance of clutch size. We hypothesize that these changes result from recent relaxation of food constraints and predation risks experienced by this colony.

AB Bleaching of corals is the result of the loss of their symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) and/or their pigments. The supply of photoassimilates provided by the zooxanthellae to the corals declines during bleaching and reduces their ability to activate energy-costly processes. In the present study we compared regeneration capabilities of unbleached Oculina patagonica colonies (an encrusting Mediterranean stony coral) with those of bleached and partly bleached colonies. Using the C-14 point-labelling technique on coral tissue, we examined possible intra-colonial translocation of photosynthetic products from the site of tissue labelling to recuperating lesions in partly bleached versus unbleached intact colonies, The percentage recovery of 2 cm 2 lesions inflicted on unbleached O. patagonica colonies was significantly higher than the percentage recovery of similar lesions within the bleached area of the partly bleached colonies. Totally bleached colonies showed no regeneration of lesions. Lesion regeneration in unbleached O. patagonica resulted in oriented intra-colonial translocation of C-14 products towards recuperating lesions located up to 4-5 cm away. In partly bleached colonies (40 to 80%), such translocation did not occur, probably explaining the reduced recovery rates of lesions in these colonies. Our findings suggest a bleaching threshold of ca. 30% within O. patagonica colonies that determines the levels of colony integration and intra-colonial translocation of resources to regions of maximal demand.

AB The rocky intertidal zone has the potential to be one of the harshest environments for free-spawning organisms, but empirical data on fertilization success are scarce. Here, I report on an intertidal, solitary ascidian, Pyura stolonifera, which was observed to spawn at low tide. At a scale likely to be most important to gametes (metres, duration of tide), approximately 30% of individuals in the population were spawning synchronously. Spawned gametes remained in a viscous matrix and this appeared to minimise their dilution. Fertilization success varied greatly among individuals (0 to 92%) and was related to the distance to the nearest neighbouring spawner. Occasional wave wash facilitated the movement of sperm between spawners. Fertilization success in some individuals was limited by the scarcity of sperm whilst the experimental addition of sperm did not increase success in others.

AB 1. We examined the cost of reproduction in high-Arctic barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis Bechstein) by manipulating the length of the incubation period by +/-5 days. Unmanipulated clutches were used as controls.
   2. Nests with prolonged incubation suffered a higher egg loss to predators than control nests and nests with shortened incubation.
   3. Among females with prolonged incubation, body condition at hatching was significant lower than among females with shortened incubation. These, however, did not increase their feeding effort to compensate for mass loss.
   4. Increased levels of parental effort did not affect adult return rate or date of arrival to the breeding ground the following season. Accordingly, there is no evidence from this study that barnacle geese invest in young at the expense of their own survival or future fecundity.
   5. We propose that breeding females retain some reserves at the end of laying in order to (i) incubate more continuously, thus shortening the incubation period and minimizing the risk of egg predation, and/or (ii) have a buffer against weight loss due to increased energy expenditure during inclement weather.

AB The lifespan of an individual flower is often affected by pollination success. Species differ regarding whether male function (pollen removal), female function (pollen deposition), or both trigger floral senescence. We studied senescence in the single-flowered, deceptive orchid Calypso bulbosa by manipulating the degree of male and female reproductive success. We found that deposition of any amount of pollen resulted in dramatic changes in shape and color within 4 d, whereas unmanipulated flowers and those that had had pollinia removed remained unchanged for 8-11 d after treatment. Selection may favor the reproductive function that is less easily satisfied as the trigger for senescence, because a flower that senesces after accomplishment of this function is likely to have already succeeded at the more easily satisfied one. Deceptive (i.e., rewardless) flowers are more likely to satisfy male than female function since the latter requires that a pollinator be fooled twice, first to pick up pollen and second to deposit it. A survey of naturally pollinated Calypso showed that male function, pollinium removal, was more likely to occur than female function, deposition (95% vs. 66% of visited flowers); thus floral senescence in Calypso is triggered by achievement of the function less likely to succeed. Studies of senescence triggers in species in which female function is more likely to be achieved than male are necessary to further test this hypothesis.

AB The state and transition model and the ball and cup analogy are used to organize the vegetation dynamics knowledge base for California's annual-dominated Mediterranean grasslands. These models help identify irreversible transitions and alternate stable states. Mechanisms that facilitate movement between successional stable states are categorized as demographic inertia, seedbank and germination, grazing impacts, establishment and competition, fire feedback, and irreversible changes in soil conditions. While theoretical work needs to continue to further describe states and transitions, managers can begin to use existing knowledge to develop management plans with realistic species composition objectives and to select the appropriate tools for reaching objectives.

AB The paintings from Tomba della Scimmia, in Tuscany, are representative of the heavy bacterial colonization experienced in most Etruscan necropolises. The tomb remained open until the late 70's when it was closed because of severe deterioration of the walls, ceiling and paintings after decades of visits. The deterioration is the result of environmental changes and impacts suffered since its discovery in 1846. We show scanning electron microscopy and molecular studies that reveal the extent and nature of the biodeterioration. Actinobacteria, mainly Nocardia and Pseudonocardia colonize and grow on the tomb walls and this process is linked to the availability of organic matter, phyllosilicates (e. g. clay minerals) and iron oxides. Nocardia is found metabolically active in the paintings. The data confirm the specialization of the genera Nocardia and Pseudonocardia in the colonization of subterranean niches.

AB Large temporal variations in the nitrogen isotopic composition (delta N-15) of particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) species in Lake Kinneret occurred in response to seasonal phasing of dominant nitrogen cycle processes. The lowest delta N-15 POM values (-5.5 parts per thousand) were observed in early winter, a consequence of isotopic fractionation by chemoautotrophic microbial NH4+ assimilation, and during the first phase of the nitrification period, by seasonally dominant NH4+ oxidizers. Nitrification itself was strongly fractionating, producing N-15-depleted NO3- and strongly enriching water-column NH4+ in N-15. Toward the end of nitrification and into the phytoplankton bloom period in later winter and early spring, there was a corresponding 15-30 parts per thousand jump in POM delta N-15 because of assimilation of high-delta N-15 NH4+. Maximal delta N-15 POM values were thus measured during the algal blooms of Peridinium gatunense in 2004 and Debarya sp. and Microcystis sp. in 2005. Toward the end of the blooms in mid- to late spring, POM delta N-15 values decreased to values similar to delta N-15 for NO3- (8-12 parts per thousand), indicating a switch to this DIN source. NO3- assimilation into POM appeared to occur without isotopic fractionation. Late spring was also the denitrification period with NO3- removal in the newly suboxic hypolimnion. Though delta(NO3-)-N-15 increased in the residual NO3-, complete consumption by denitrification suggests no net effect, as supported by a lack of increase in delta N-15 POM at this time. Oligotrophic conditions are found in the epilimnion in late summer and early autumn and low (3.3 parts per thousand) delta N-15 POM was found during the bloom of the filamentous N-2-fixing cyanobacteria Aphanizomenon ovalisporum and Cylindrospermopsis cuspis. The delta N-15-dissolved organic nitrogen isotopic signature at this time was significantly higher, 8-12 parts per thousand, suggesting a phytoplankton source from earlier in the seasonal cycle. Overall, the largest known seasonal variations in N isotope composition have been observed in Lake Kinneret, providing a uniquely useful biogeochemical tool for studying N cycling in lakes as well as detecting long-term changes in N source and cycling in response to watershed land use changes and climate change.

AB Marble extraction is an economically important and widespread activity in Greece that exists since historical times. The extraction takes place by open-pit quarries in hill slopes. The original landform. is permanently altered and the original vegetation cover is destroyed. The visual impact of the quarries extends over larger areas as noticeable scars of high colour contrast, reducing the aesthetic appeal of the landscape and deteriorating the scenic quality of areas where tourism often is a major constituent of income. The aim of this work was to assess the ecological, landscape and visual impacts of marble quarries on the island of Thasos, NE Greece by employing remote sensing, geographical analysis and landscape metrics. Change detection and object-based classification were used to monitor the landscape dynamics (1984-2000) of marble quarries. A new index was defined to estimate the 'cumulative visibility load' on the landscape. An expansion trend of marble quarries was identified by the creation of new and the enlargement of existing quarries in the NE part of the island on areas previously covered by semi-natural pine forest. The visual impact increased by a factor of 2.52 and although the area of quarries was less than 1% of the landscape in 2000, it affected 13.5% of the island, including areas such as the island's capital and nearby coasts.

AB Since the 19th century, 41% of the land on Chilo6 Island (41 degrees 50'S, 73 degrees 40'W) in Chile was cleared. Following clearing and burning, much of the converted land remains in sparse shrub cover. We hypothesized that the arrested conversion back to forests may reflect a nearly permanent condition associated with a rise in the water table. To evaluate this possibility we acquired data from a 60-year old evergreen forest and an area in shrub cover to parameterize two hydrologic models; one that accounts for hourly interception losses and predicts net precipitation (Gash model), the other that calculates hourly transpiration from both overstory and understory components as well as evaporation from the soil (a modified Penman-Monteith model). In addition, standpipes were installed to record water table levels over 18 months. The fraction of a total annual precipitation (similar to 2100 mm) transpired by shrub and forest cover differed (8% versus 22%) roughly in proportion to differences in the leaf area index (2.2 versus 5.0). Although whole canopy (stomatal) conductances were similar, the aerodynamic conductance was more than three-fold higher for forests compared with shrub cover (similar to 12 mol m(-2) s(-1) versus 3 mol m(-2) s(-1)). The frequent wetting of tree canopies, combined with an average wind speed of 0.74 m s(-1), resulted in similar to 30% interception losses from forests compared with 1% of annual precipitation lost through this pathway from shrub cover. As a result of these differences, only about half of the precipitation enters the ground under forest cover compared to 90% under shrub cover. This difference in canopy interception losses accounts for a rise in the water table from an average of 45-10 cm. The high water table prevents normal tree regeneration. This condition is stable unless an effort is made to provide an elevated substrate for tree seedlings to become established. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The skulls of 272 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and 308 Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) collected in Denmark over the last 120 years were measured to determine any temporal changes in skull size (and. by implication, body size) during the studied period. We wished to determine whether global warming had resulted in a decrease in skull and body size in accordance with Bergmann's rule. Contrary to our predictions, there were no significant negative relationships between any of the four skull characters measured and mean annual temperature. Among badgers. two of the four characters measured had increased significantly during the twentieth century (zygomatic breadth by about 2% and length of upper molar by about 3.5%). but only in Jutland. In the red fox, three of the four skull characters measured had increased significantly during the twentieth century (zygomatic breadth by about 5%, length of fourth upper premolar,9 by about 7% and diameter of canine by about 9%). with one parameter (zygomatic breadth) increasing twice as fast in Zealand as in Jutland. All the above three characters are closely associated with diet: the size of the zygomatic arch is closely related to the size of the masseter muscle. the size of the carnassial and the diameter of canine are generally associated with prey size. and the size of the first molar is associated with grinding of grain and larger invertebrates. Larger teeth enable a predator to take and handle larger prey items. However, the fourth parameter (greatest length of skull) had not increased during the studied period. Since all the above skull characters are significantly related to body size, these results indicate that the body size of both species had increased during the twentieth century. The increase in skull characters is probably related to contemporaneous changes in Danish agriculture and land use, which, in turn resulted in changes to the foxes' and badgers' diets.

AB The effects of interactions between the density of ungulates and forest fires on forest dynamics were studied on an area of 1188 ha called Planken Wambuis. The vegetation consists mainly of heathland and Scots pine forest but also includes oak, beech and birch, and parts of former arable land that is now covered with grass. The ungulate species considered are bovine, horse, red deer, roe deer and wild boar. The spatially explicit and process-based model FORSPACE was used for this analysis. FORSPACE is a forest gap-dynamics model that includes a mechanistic description of ungulate dynamics and a stochastic forest fire simulator. The scenarios analysed included three levels of ungulate density (no ungulates, low density due to population regulation by management, high density due to absence of regulation), and three levels of ignition frequency of wild fires (zero, low and high).
   The simulation results indicate that fires at high ignition frequency may shift the system into a different stable state in the phase plane of producers (represented by total ecosystem foliage biomass) versus consumers (represented by total ecosystem ungulate biomass). This pattern was found both at low and high ungulate densities, although the effect is more pronounced at high ungulate density. Grazing is predicted to reduce the occurrence of both small and large-scale wild fires by reducing fuel load and altering the vertical structure of the vegetation. This occurs even at low ungulate densities and is most pronounced at high ignition frequencies.
   The ungulate consumption and plant production figures predicted by the model fall within the ranges that are presented in the literature for temperate forest ecosystems. For the scenarios with regulated ungulate densities the ungulate biomass per unit area are of the same magnitude as found in temperate forest ecosystems. However, if ungulate densities are not regulated by management, the model results suggest that the ungulate biomass per unit area may increase two-fold.

AB Muricid gastropods in the genus Drupella are found on coral reefs throughout the tropical and subtropical shallow waters of the Indo-Pacific. They are corallivorous and prey almost exclusively on living coral tissues. Over the past decade there have been reports of population outbreaks of Drupell on several reefs in the tropical Indo-West Pacific region (Japan, the Philippines, the Marshall Islands, Western Australia). These high densities of snails appear to have been responsible for extensive and significant coral mortality on a scale which has previously only been documented for the crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster planci. At Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, where the outbreak has been on a greater temporal and spatial scale than has so far been documented elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region, it is estimated that live coral cover in the back-reef areas may have been reduced by more than 75%. The implications of such extensive coral mortality for the reefs population, community and ecosystem structure and function, and the ramifications of such changes in ecological, evolutionary and geomorphological terms are unknown.
   The available information regarding the reproduction, early life history, feeding biology, growth and longevity, mortality and population genetics of Drupella is reviewed and areas where further research is required are identified.
   The history of the outbreaks is reviewed, and the possible causes examined. Both anthropogenic (increased terrestrial run-off, over-fishing and increased reef damage) and natural (variable larval recruitment) causes have been proposed to explain the outbreaks. There is insufficient information available at present to enable any of the alternative hypotheses to be objectively assessed. Information on the effects of Drupella outbreaks on coral reefs and reef recovery following outbreaks are described and the management issues associated with these outbreaks are discussed. There are conflicting views regarding the significance of outbreaks of Drupella, and consequently, the desirability and feasibility of implementing appropriate management responses.

AB Environmental changes can affect the functioning of an ecosystem directly, through the response of individual life forms, or indirectly, through interspecific interactions and community dynamics. The feasibility of a community-level response has motivated numerous studies aimed at understanding the mutual relationships between three elements of ecosystem dynamics: the abiotic environment, biodiversity and ecosystem function. Since ecosystems are inherently nonlinear and spatially extended, environmental changes can also induce pattern-forming instabilities that result in spatial self-organization of life forms and resources. This, in turn, can affect the relationships between these three elements, and make the response of ecosystems to environmental changes far more complex. Responses of this kind can be expected in dryland ecosystems, which show a variety of self-organizing vegetation patterns along the rainfall gradient. This paper describes the progress that has been made in understanding vegetation patterning in dryland ecosystems, and the roles it plays in ecosystem response to environmental variability. The progress has been achieved by modeling pattern-forming feedbacks at small spatial scales and up-scaling their effects to large scales through model studies. This approach sets the basis for integrating pattern formation theory into the study of ecosystem dynamics and addressing ecologically significant questions such as the dynamics of desertification, restoration of degraded landscapes, biodiversity changes along environmental gradients, and shrubland-grassland transitions.

AB The intentional translocation of animals is an important tool for species conservation and ecosystem restoration, but reported success rates are low, particularly for threatened and endangered species. Publication bias further distorts success rates because the results of successful translocations may be more likely to be published than failed translocations. We conducted the first comprehensive review of all published and unpublished translocations of herpetofauna in New Zealand to assess publication bias. Of 74 translocations of 29 species in 25 years, 35 have been reported in the published literature, and the outcomes of 12 have been published. Using a traditional definition of success, publication bias resulted in a gross overestimate of translocation success rates (41.7% and 8.1% for published and all translocations, respectively), but bias against failed translocations was minimal (8.3% and 6.8%, respectively). Publication bias against translocations with uncertain outcomes, the vast majority of projects, was also strong (50.0% and 85.1% for published and all translocations, respectively). Recent translocations were less likely to be published than older translocations. The reasons behind translocations were related to publication. A greater percentage of translocations for conservation and research were published (63.3% and 40.0%, respectively) than translocations for mitigation during land development (10.0%). Translocations conducted in collaboration with a university were more frequently published (82.7% and 24.4%, respectively). To account for some of this publication bias, we reassessed the outcome of each translocation using a standardized definition of success, which takes into consideration the species' life history and the time since release. Our standardized definition of translocation success provided a more accurate summary of success rates and allows for a more rigorous evaluation of the causes of translocation success and failure in large-scale reviews.

TI "Nullius in Bergmann" or the pluralistic approach to ecogeographical
   rules: a reply to Watt et al. (2010)
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID BODY-SIZE; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; LAWS; EUROPE
AB Bergmann's rule is one of the best known empirical generalizations in biogeography and remains a topic of much interest and debate. Watt et al. claimed in 2010 that the only definition for the rule should be the one devised by Bergmann in the 19th-century. Based on direct translations from the original German manuscript, they concluded that tests of the rule should be restricted to interspecific studies of body size variation in endotherms. Furthermore, they suggested that Bergmann's heat conservation mechanism is an integral part of the rule and, hence, a simple falsificationist test of this mechanism might be enough to validate the rule. Here I advocate on a pluralistic approach to study ecogeographical rules, in general, and Bergmann's rule in particular. Our perceptions on the status and validity of laws and rules depend on the narrowness of the epistemological scope we adopt. Laws can have exceptions, do not necessarily have to be explanatory and may not be predictive. Also, we should differentiate between correlative and causal laws. Bergmann's rule is a correlative law, not a causal law, as Watt et al. implicitly assumed. It is a broad generalization with no inherent mechanism, and subject to the scrutiny of empirical investigation. Because of the ecological and evolutionary contingencies there will hardly be any law in ecology that is universally true. We have to consider each of these contingencies and study Bergmann's rule in a diversity of systems, organisms and levels of biological organization to gain further insight into the processes underlying the geographic variation in body size. On the basis of the empirical evidence to date, we cannot entirely dismiss a thermoregulatory mechanism to explain body size clines in both ectotherms and endotherms and support a food availability mechanism instead, as Watt et al. suggested. Even so, a unifying explanation for Bergmann's rule still remains elusive.

   COMMUNITIES; TURBIDITY; CLIMATE; GROWTH; TIME
AB Extreme tidal events are one of the most predictable natural disturbances in marine benthic habitats and are important determinants of zonation patterns in intertidal benthic communities. On coral reefs, spring low tides are recurrent disturbances, but are rarely reported to cause mass mortality. However, in years when extremely low tides coincide with high noon irradiances, they have the potential to cause widespread damage. Here, we report on such an event on a fringing coral reef in the central Great Barrier Reef (Australia) in September 2005. Visual surveys of colony mortality and bleaching status of more than 13,000 corals at 14 reef sites indicated that most coral taxa at wave-protected sites were severely affected by the event. Between 40 and 75% of colonies in the major coral taxa (Acropora, Porites, Faviidae, Mussidae and Pocilloporidae) were either bleached or suffered partial mortality. In contrast, corals at wave-exposed sites were largely unaffected (< 1% of the corals were bleached), as periodic washing by waves prevented desiccation. Surveys along a 1-9 m depth gradient indicated that high coral mortality was confined to the tidal zone. However, 20-30% of faviid colonies were bleached throughout the depth range, suggesting that the increase in benthic irradiances during extreme low tides caused light stress in deeper water. Analyses of an 8-year dataset of tidal records for the area indicated that the combination of extended periods of aerial exposure and high irradiances occurs during May-September in most years, but that the event in September 2005 was the most severe. We argue that extreme low-tide, high-irradiance events are important structuring forces of intertidal coral reef communities, and can be as damaging as thermal stress events. Importantly, they occur at a time of year when risks from thermal stress, cyclones and monsoon-associated river run-off are minimal.

AB The semi-enclosed Gulf of Aqaba is under high pressure by urban and industrial pollution, shipping and port activities as well as tourism. Off the Jordanian Red Sea coast, the trophic community structure of shore fishes was determined on coral reefs in front of an industrial area (disturbed), in a marine reserve and site without industry or port activities (undisturbed), as well as in a seagrass-dominated bay. Planktivores were the most abundant feeding guild on coral reefs as well as in the seagrass-dominated bay. The relative abundance of feeding guilds other than planktivores seems to be strongly influenced by the benthic habitat. Multivariate analysis clearly separated disturbed from undisturbed sites, whereas univariate measures, such as species richness, diversity and evenness did not reveal any negative impact of disturbance. The disturbance of the coral reefs led to changes in the fish community through the reduction of total fish abundance by 50%, increased total abundance of herbivorous and detritivorous fishes, decreased total abundance of invertebrate- and fish-feeders, and increased relative abundance of planktivorous fishes,

AB Theoretical models of species coexistence between desert mammals have generally been based on a combination of food and microhabitat selection by granivorous rodents. Although these models are applicable in various deserts of the world, they cannot explain resource use by mammals in Neotropical deserts. The present study examines diet composition in a mammal assemblage in the Monte desert, Argentina. The results show that two main strategies are used by these mammals: medium-sized species (hystricognath rodents: Dolichotis patagonum, Lagostomus maximus, Microcavia australis and Galea musteloides; and an exotic lagomorph: Lepus europaeus) are herbivores, whereas small-sized species (a marsupial: Thylamys pusillus; and sigmodontine rodents: Graomys griseoflavus, Akodon molinae, Calomys musculinus, Eligmodontia typus) are omnivorous. Small mammals also show a tendency towards granivory (C. musculinus), insectivory (A. molinae and T. pusillus) and folivory (G. griseoflavus).

AB We isolated an obligately anaerobic halophilic bacterium from the Dead Sea that grew by respiration of selenate. The isolate, designated strain DSSe-1. was a gramnegative, non-motile rod. It oxidized glycerol or glucose to acetate+CO2 with concomitant reduction of selenate to selenite plus elemental selenium. Other electron accepters that supported anaerobic growth on glycerol were nitrate and trimethylamine-N-oxide; nitrite, arsenate, fumarate, dimethylsulfoxide, thiosulfate. elemental sulfur, sulfite or sulfate could not serve as electron accepters. Growth on glycerol in the presence of nitrate occurred over a salinity range from 100 to 240 g/l, with an optimum at 210 g/l. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence suggests that strain DSSe-1 belongs to the order Halanaerobiales, an order of halophilic anaerobes with a fermentative or homoacetogenic metabolism, in which anaerobic respiratory metabolism has never been documented. The highest 16S rRNA sequence similarity (90%) was found with Acetohalobium arabaticum (X89077). On the basis of physiological properties as well as the relatively low homology of 16S rRNA from strain DSSe-1 with known genera, classification in a new genus within the order Halanaerobiales, family Halobacteroidaceae is warranted. We propose the name Selenihalanaerobacter shriftii. Type strain is strain DSSe-1 (ATCC accession number BAA-73).

AB Foraging theory can be applied to the study of ecological communities. We developed and tested several local mechanisms of species coexistence based on foraging theory for a desert granivore community in a heterogeneous landscape in the Negev Desert, Israel. The most common species were Allenby's gerbil (Gerbillus allenbyi), Wagner's gerbil (Gerbillus dasyurus), and crested lark (Galerida cristata). Allenby's gerbils were most abundant on sandy substrates; Wagner's gerbils were most abundant on cobble and loess substrates; crested larks occurred across all three. To test among predictions of the different mechanisms of coexistence, we used live-trapping and counts to census rodents and birds, recorded spoor in sand-tracking plots to determine habitat-specific activity patterns, and measured giving-up densities in depletable food patches to estimate relative foraging efficiencies on different substrates and within different habitats. Allenby's gerbil had an advantage in habitat selection by being the most efficient forager (lowest giving-up densities on seeds in feeding trays) in the sandy habitat. The crested lark was the tolerant forager. Its foraging abilities were affected little by escape substrate, foraging substrate, or food type. As a result, the crested lark had three advantages: it was the most efficient forager in the loess habitat, it was a better insectivore than the gerbils, and its diurnal habit allowed it first access to seed patches that renew in the afternoon in the sandy habitat when winds typically arise. In response to our measures of foraging aptitude, Wagner's gerbil revealed no advantage over the other species, and factors promoting its success eluded our proposed mechanisms of species coexistence. Foraging ecology and community ecology can be integrated to understand local species distributions, abundances, and community structure and organization. Uniform conceptual and methodological techniques can be applied across taxa and communities. We were able to relatively quickly test which mechanisms of coexistence apply. In the community we studied, there were two species whose presence we feel we understood and one species whose presence remained an enigma.

AB 1. The nutritional value of a pure algal food, the phytoflagellate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and a mixed diet was tested for five planktonic cyclopoid copepods (Acanthocyclops robustus, Cyclops vicinus, Cyclops abyssorum, Mesocyclops leuckarti and Thermocyclops crassus). The algae were offered at high density (4.5 x 10(5) cells ml-l; 22.5 mg C l(-1)) in a flow-through system. The mixed diet consisted of concentrated natural plankton (rotifers, copepod nauplii, small copepodites and large phytoplankton forms) in the size range 50-150 mu m and with a dry mass > 20 mg 1-1. Reproductive parameters (clutch size, interclutch periods, number of clutches produced) and adult longevity were monitored as indicators of nutritive value.
   2. All species had a significantly lower reproductive output and a shorter or unchanged adult lifespan on the algal compared with the mixed diet.
   3. The species differed considerably in their ability to use algae. Mesocyclops leuckarti produced no clutches with algae, and females died earlier than with the mixed food. Acanthocyclops robustus and C. vicinus produced smaller and fewer clutches, displayed a longer interclutch period and shorter (A. robustus) or similar (C, vicinus) lifespan on the algal food than on the mixed food. Thermocyclops crassus and C. abyssorum produced smaller clutches with the algal food, but interclutch period was shorter with the algal than with the mixed diet (T. crassus) or of the same length with both diets (C. abyssorum). Adult lifespan was the same under both food regimes. Unfed females produced no eggs.
   4. The ability to utilize algae, the reproductive output and the reproductive allocation were not related to body size. Acanthocyclops robustus, a species of intermediate size, produced by far the largest clutches and the most eggs per lifetime under both food regimes and invested more in reproduction than the other species.
   5. Reproduction was costly. Unfed and non-reproducing females of C. vicinus and C. abyssorum reached the same age or lived longer than fed and reproducing ones.
   6. The adult cyclopoids tested are primarily omnivorous, but utilize algae which are frequently sufficient for egg production.

AB Halophilic representatives of the genus Dunaliella, notably D. salina and D. viridis, are found worldwide in salt lakes and saltern evaporation and crystallizer ponds at salt concentrations up to NaCl saturation. Thanks to the biotechnological exploitation of D. salina for beta-carotene production we have a profound knowledge of the physiology and biochemistry of the alga. However, relatively little is known about the ecology of the members of the genus Dunaliella in hypersaline environments, in spite of the fact that Dunaliella is often the main or even the sole primary producer present, so that the entire ecosystem depends on carbon fixed by this alga. This review paper summarizes our knowledge about the occurrence and the activities of different Dunaliella species in natural salt lakes (Great Salt Lake, the Dead Sea and others), in saltern ponds and in other salty habitats where members of the genus have been found.

AB Urban fugitive dust samples were collected to determine the chemical profiles of fugitive dust over Xi'an. Seventy eight samples were collected and divided into categories of paved road dust, construction dust, cement dust, and soil dust. Eighteen elements, including Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Ba, and Pb, and eight water-soluble inorganic ions, including Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NH4+, F-, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-, were measured. The most abundant elements in these urban dust samples were Al, Si, Ca, and Fe. Al, Si, K, and Ti and showed strong positive correlations with each other, indicating they are typical dust trace elements. In contrast, elements of Ca, Zn, As, and Pb had negative correlations to crustal elements. Si/Al, K/Al, Ti/Al, Mn/Al, and Fe/Al ratios varied insignificantly among these four samples types; these ratios are similar to the properties of loess, desert, and Gobi soil dust reported in previous studies. A significantly higher Ca/Al ratio was dominant in the chemical profile of the cement samples. In addition, high Pb/Al and Zn/Al ratios were detected in comparison with those in the Gobi soil, desert soil, and loess soil samples, which indicated that Pb/Al and Zn/Al ratios can be considered as markers of urban dust. Total water-soluble ions occupied only a small fraction (<5%) in the urban fugitive soil samples indicating that most of the materials in the fugitive dust were insoluble. Ca2+ and SO42- were the most abundant ions in all samples. Most of the Ca and K in the fugitive soil samples were in insoluble phases, which differ significantly in comparison with combustion sources. A strong correlation was observed between Ca2+ and estimated CO32- levels indicating that most of Ca2+ was in the form of CaCO3 rather than other calcium minerals in Xi'an fugitive dust.

AB It has long been recognized that gradual secular changes in environmental parameters may lead to discontinuous changes in ecosystems. The dominant model ex plaining such changes has been the presence of alternative attractors and their basins. We discuss a related model, that of basin boundary collisions, that may also produce discontinuous changes in an environmental variable. The alternative model suggests that the underlying structure of the basins themselves may be gradually changed by the changing environmental factor. Consequently, the basin of the chaotic attractor may disappear, because it intersects the alternative basin; hence the term basin boundary collision. The implications of this model can be dramatic, such as sudden and unpredictable extinctions or dramatic and unexpected changes in ecosystem syndromes. Furthermore, where this model applies, ancillary phenomena such as a lag in time of the ecosystem change or the existence of so-called chaotic transients may be important. Also discussed are the implications of these results in a world in which slowly changing forcing parameters are well known (e.g., gradual increases of CO2 in the atmosphere, and gradual changes in political attitudes about conservation).

AB This paper explores the ecological consequences of competition and cooperation, and the resultant abrupt species zonation that could occur along smooth environmental stress gradients. We present one-and two-species models of sessile organisms incorporating competition for space and two forms of cooperation: habitat amelioration and positive recruitment. In these models, habitat amelioration reduces an organism's mortality rate when it is surrounded by other organisms (''safety-in-numbers''), and positive intraspecific recruitment enables juveniles to use the shelter of established individuals as settlement (or germination) sites. A single-species model incorporating both forms of cooperation may exhibit sharp discontinuities in population density along an environmental gradient. In a two-species model the same mechanisms may lead to sharp boundaries in species composition if, as empirical studies suggest, a trade-off exists between colonization and cooperation abilities (e.g., strong cooperators are poor colonizers). Positive interspecific recruitment obscures the interspecific boundaries.

AB Morphological and cytological alterations at the light microscope (LM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) levels were observed in the thymus, spleen, head-kidney, and liver of cardinal fishes (Apogonidae, Teleostei) from the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, sampled from a strongly polluted site at the northern end of the gulf, and compared to similar samples from a clean, reference site. At the polluted site, the most prominent change was the formation of numerous deposits of cells rich in phagosomes with lipofucin, melanin granules, and phagocytosed debris, including a high increase in number and dimensions of Hassall's corpuscles and melano-macrophage centers. The number of Hassall's corpuscles was 20 (+/- 8.0)/mm(2) and of melano-macrophage centers 18 (+/- 4.0)/mm(2) at the polluted site, and 7.0 (+/- 4.0)/m(2) vs. 5.0 (+/- 2.0)/mm(2) respectively at the reference site. In numerous instances the head kidney's melano-macrophage centers in fishes from the polluted site were encapsulated by reticulocytes, a phenomenon recognized as a marker of neoplasmosis and possible malignancy. In the spleens of fishes from the polluted site, numerous deposits of cell debris, peroxisomes, and enlarged lysosomes were also observed. The livers (hepatopancreas) of fishes from polluted waters demonstrated very strong hyperlipogeny. Many of their hepatocytes were laden with lipid vesicles, fragmented endoplasmic reticulula, and aberrant mitochondria. Although the observed alterations in the glands and liver do not indicate any immediate threat to the life of the fish, they can become crucial with respect to energy turnover and fecundity trajectories.

AB Why do some parents care for their young whereas others divorce from their mate and abandon their offspring? This decision is governed by the trade-off between the value of the current breeding event and future breeding prospects. In the precocial Kentish plover Charadrius alexandrinus females frequently, but not always, abandon their broods to be oared for by their mate, and seek new breeding partners within the same season. We have shown previously that females' remating opportunities decline with date in the season, so brood desertion should be particularly favourable for early breeding females. However, the benefits are tempered by the fact that single-parent families have lower survival expectancies than those where the female remains to help the male care for the young. We therefore tested the prediction that increasing the value of the current brood ibv brood-size manipulation! should increase the duration of female care early in the season, but that in late breeders, with reduced remating opportunities, desertion and thus the duration of female care should be independent of current brood size. These predictions were fulfilled, indicating that seasonally modulated trade-offs between current brood value and remating opportunities can be important in the desertion decisions of species with flexible patterns of parental care.

AB Foraging behaviour and diet selection determine both the nutrient intake by the animals and their impact on the vegetation. They are therefore of importance for animal and vegetation management. Animals exploit the heterogeneity of resources through selective grazing, choosing a diet of better quality than the average vegetation on offer. Recent increased effort has been made to develop models of the grazing process supported by theory, which should facilitate generalisation and application to a broad range of situations. Foraging involves the interactions between the characteristics of the animal and the characteristics of food in the environment. We review some of the animals' foraging decisions within the vegetation, morpho-physiological, digestive and behavioural constraints they face. The determinants of foraging behaviour and diet selection remain, however, somewhat obscure and a matter of debate. The complexity of the animal/vegetation interactions have prompted the development of simple experimental approaches, and further research is needed to extrapolate these to larger spatio-temporal scales.

AB Halite endoliths in the Atacama Desert represent one of the most extreme ecosystems on Earth. Cultivation-independent methods were used to examine the functional adaptations of the microbial consortia inhabiting halite nodules. The community was dominated by haloarchaea and functional analysis attributed most of the autotrophic CO2 fixation to one unique cyanobacterium. The assembled 1.1 Mbp genome of a novel nanohaloarchaeon, Candidatus Nanopetramus SG9, revealed a photoheterotrophic life style and a low median isoelectric point (pI) for all predicted proteins, suggesting a 'salt-in' strategy for osmotic balance. Predicted proteins of the algae identified in the community also had pI distributions similar to 'salt-in' strategists. The Nanopetramus genome contained a unique CRISPR/Cas system with a spacer that matched a partial viral genome from the metagenome. A combination of reference-independent methods identified over 30 complete or near complete viral or proviral genomes with diverse genome structure, genome size, gene content and hosts. Putative hosts included Halobacteriaceae, Nanohaloarchaea and Cyanobacteria. Despite the dependence of the halite community on deliquescence for liquid water availability, this study exposed an ecosystem spanning three phylogenetic domains, containing a large diversity of viruses and predominance of a 'salt-in' strategy to balance the high osmotic pressure of the environment.

AB Particulate matter (PM) is widely recorded as a source of diseases, being more harmful those particles with smaller size. PM is released to the environment as a consequence of different activities, being one of them cement production. The objective of this pilot study was to characterize PM of different sizes around cement facilities to have a preliminary approach of their origin, and evaluate their potential health risks. For that purpose, three fractions of PM (10, 2.5, and 1) were collected in the nearby area of two cement plants With different backgrounds (urban and rural) in different seasons. Subsequently, main components, outdoor and indoor concentrations, exposure, and human health risks were assessed. Greatest levels of PM1, organic matter, and metals were found in urban location, especially in winter. Consequently, environmental exposure and human health risks registered their highest values in the urban plant during wintertime. Exposure was higher for indoor activities, expressing some metals their peak values in the PM1 fraction. Non-carcinogenic risks were below the safety threshold (HQ < 1). Carcinogenic risks for most of the metals were below the limit of 10(-5), except for Cr (VI), which exceeded it in both locations, but being in the range considered as assumable (10(-6)-10(-4)).

AB Forest vegetation can interact with its surrounding environment in ways that enhance conditions favorable for its own existence. Removal of forest vegetation has been shown to alter these conditions in a number of ways, thereby inhibiting the reestablishment of the same community of woody plants. The effect of vegetation on an environmental variable along with vegetation susceptibility to the associated environmental conditions may imply a positive feedback: Changes in the internal conditions controlling this variable such as deforestation could inhibit the reestablishment of woody vegetation cover that in turn would act to further degrade the conditions necessary for forest regeneration. Understanding these feedbacks is important because in some cases where these feedbacks are present, deforestation can lead to irreversible state shifts where the forest vegetation cannot recover. In this review, we examine the different cases in which deforestation can lead to a loss of conditions necessary to sustain forest vegetation. We examine the spatial scale and extent of each feedback in addition to considering the temporal scale over which a feedback may be considered irreversible. Juxtaposing the spatial extent of these feedbacks with a map of deforestation enables the identification and discussion of at-risk areas to state changes following deforestation. Last, we discuss the economic implications of these feedbacks and how socioeconomic factors can affect the convergence of a system to a given stable state. Citation: Runyan, C. W., P.

AB The impacts of predation and competition on life history, behavioral, and morphological traits are well established for many organisms, but effects on locomotor performance have received relatively little attention. We examined variation in sprint speed and critical swimming speed (U-crit, a measure of stamina) in the Trinidadian killifish (Rivulus hartii) across a gradient of ecological communities. R. hartii are located in (1) "high-predation'' sites with large, piscine piscivores, (2) "Rivulus-guppy'' sites with guppies, and (3) "Rivulus-only'' sites with only R. hartii. R. hartii suffer higher mortality in high-predation sites. In Rivulus-guppy sites, population densities are reduced and growth rates increased compared with Rivulus-only sites, which likely represent indirect effects of guppy predation on young R. hartii. We show a significant negative relationship, suggesting a trade-off, between sprint speed and endurance; Rivulus from high-predation sites were faster sprinters but had reduced critical swimming speeds. This trade-off was also apparent in correlations of the nine population means. At the individual level, the correlation was weaker and only significantly negative when all nine populations (three from each site) were pooled and values were not corrected for body size. Sex had a significant effect on Ucrit, with females having a lower Ucrit, but sexes did not differ in sprint speed. Fish from high-predation sites also exhibited increased tail lengths and fineness ratios compared to sites without large predators. The two low-predation sites showed no statistical differences in locomotor performance or morphology.

AB 1. Rapid assessment protocols for determining and monitoring the status of any given coral reef are provided and include measuring: (a) standing stocks of functional indicator groups, (b) herbivore populations, (c) water-column nutrient levels, (d) tissue C:N:P ratios, (e) algal physiological-response assays, and (f) herbivory assays. These measurements can reveal quantitative tipping-point levels beyond which resilience to undesirable phase shifts begins to become critically reduced. Universal tipping-point approximations are reviewed for inorganic nutrients, and posited for the first time for herbivory.
   2. The relative roles of top-down and bottom-up controls in determining benthic community structure and the health of coral reefs are especially important management concerns. This paper specifically addresses the top-down effects of herbivory and bottom-up effects of nutrient enrichment on critical indicator groups, i.e. reef-building corals, crustose coralline algae, dense turf algae and frondose macroalgae.
   3. A predominance of (a) massive corals and calcareous coralline algae relative to frondose macroalgae and algal turfs indicates a healthy spatially heterogeneous condition reflecting low nutrients and high herbivory. An abundance of (b) frondose macroalgae illustrates the least desirable condition of elevated nutrient levels and reduced herbivory, possibly reflecting pollution in concert with destructive herbivore fishing practices. High coverage of (c) coralline algae suggests healthy high herbivory levels, but problems with elevated nutrients that are inhibitory to some corals. Domination by (d) dense turf algae indicates desirably low nutrient levels, but an inadequate herbivory component.
   4. The fast growth and turnover rates of fleshy algae compared to other reef organisms highlight their value as early warning indicators of reef degradation.
   5. From a management perspective, levels of herbivory and nutrients rank among the most useful quantitative indicators of coral reef resilience; whereas, the degree of degradation and mortality are inferred from the above functional indicator groups of benthic primary producers.

AB The role of bacteria and protozoa in the food web of Lake Kinneret was examined for 14 seasons over a 4-yr period (1989-1992) using a mass-balanced carbon Bur model and network analysis. These microorganisms supplied nearly half of the carbon requirements of metazoan zooplankton grazers during the late winter-spring Peridinium bloom, when the lake was in its most eutrophic phase. The level of primary productivity was not seen to have a significant effect on the relative amounts of carbon passing from bacteria and protozoa to higher trophic levels, Rather, this depended on the proportion of photosynthetically fixed carbon that originated from "inedible" net-phytoplankton and the efficiency with which bacterial carbon was transferred to metazoans. The importance of the microbial loop as a carbon source to higher trophic levels in Lake Kinneret was a result of the often high levels of inedible net-phytoplankton (mostly Peridinium gatunense). The higher levels also occurred because bacterial production was transferred to metazoans in a relatively efficient one- or two-step process. These results indicate that even in eutrophic environments, bacteria and protozoa can supply significant amounts of carbon to metazoans.

AB Nitrogen fixation and colonization by associative cyanobacteria in the aerial roots (pneumatophores) of black mangrove trees was evaluated in situ at Balandra lagoon, Baja California Sur, Mexico, for 18 consecutive months. Year-round vertical zonation of cyanobacterial colonization was determined along the pneumatophores. The bottom part close to the sediment was colonized mainly by nonheterocystous, filamentous cyanobacteria resembling Lyngbya sp. and Oscillatoria sp. The central zone was colonized mainly by filaments resembling Microcoleus sp. and the upper part was colonized by coccoidal cyanobacteria within defined colonies resembling Aphanothece sp. mixed with undefined filamentous cyanobacteria. Two of the cyanobacteria (Microcoleus sp. and Anabaena sp.) isolated from the pneumatophore were diazotrophs. Massive biofilm production along the pneumatophores was evident throughout the observation period. The surrounding sediment was seasonally dominated by heterocystous Anabaena sp. Glass and dead-wood surfaces incubated for 18 months in the pneumatophore vicinity showed no zonation in the colonization pattern, although they were heavily colonized. In situ N-2 fixation showed seasonal and diurnal fluctuations. N-2 fixation was low during winter, increased in early summer, and reached its peak in midsummer. N-2 fixation in the summer showed diurnal peaks: one in the morning until midday and the second in the late afternoon. N-2 fixation was at its lowest levels near midnight. Light and water temperature are probably primary environmental factors governing N-2 fixation on the pneumatophores.

AB This study examines the potential impact of directly transmitted macroparasites on the population dynamics of ungulate grazing systems. It combines simple, previously published mathematical models for plant-herbivore and host-parasite interactions in a model that captures the essential features of the plant-herbivore-parasite system. The most ecologically complex and interesting case, in which herbivore numbers are food limited and allowed to vary more or less naturally, is considered in detail. On one hand, this analysis confirms the potential role of parasites as functional "top predators" and in particular the potential of parasite-induced host mortality to increase the plant equilibrium of otherwise overgrazed systems. This result underlines the dangers of indiscriminate anthelmintic application in marginal grazing systems without a consideration of the possible ecological consequences of parasite control. By contrast, the analysis also underlines two unique features of parasitism in the context of grazing system dynamics. First, the effect of the coupling of gut parasite transmission to food consumption simplifies grazing system dynamics by linearizing the herbivore's functional response near the parasite equilibrium. Second, the destabilizing impact of parasite-induced reductions in host reproductive rate can throw the system into chaotic plant-herbivore-parasite cycles. The ecological implications of these results are discussed.

AB The role of ungulate grazing in shaping rangeland ecosystems is well known relative to other important plant-animal interactions such as pollination, seed dispersal, granivory, and belowground herbivory. Successful rangeland revegetation may be enhanced by strategies that favor certain groups of animals and discourage others. Many perennial forbs and shrubs require animals for successful pollination, reproduction, and subsequent maintenance of species on a site; however, pollination biology of many rangeland plants and pollinator abundances at potential revegetation sites are largely unknown. Granivory may be significant in some locations and planning and design of revegetation areas may be improved by implementing principles of seed escape mechanisms, such as predator satiation, seed escape in space (low perimeter-to-area ratio for revegetation site), and seed escape in time (synchronous or staggered timing for nearby revegetation sites). Seedling establishment may be associated with invertebrate population levels which need to be considered in future revegetation projects. Timing and site preparation are important in limiting belowground herbivory. Animals can serve as dispersal agents of seeds. Livestock dosed with desirable seeds can disperse them in their dung across the landscape, thereby creating patches of desirable plants. If revegetation sites will be grazed by livestock, then managers should choose plant species that tolerate rather than avoid grazing and should apply adequate management to establish and maintain plant populations. Seeds inoculated with mutualistic species such as mycorrhizae, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, or actinomycetes may enhance establishment, productivity, and nutrient quality of rangeland species while increasing rates of succession.

AB Microbes, similar to plants and animals, exhibit biogeographic patterns. However, in contrast with the considerable knowledge on the island biogeography of higher organisms, we know little about the distribution of microorganisms within and among islands. Here, we explored insular soil bacterial and fungal biogeography and underlying mechanisms, using soil microbiota from a group of land-bridge islands as a model system. Similar to island species-area relationships observed for many macroorganisms, both island-scale bacterial and fungal diversity increased with island area; neither diversity, however, was affected by island isolation. By contrast, bacterial and fungal communities exhibited strikingly different assembly patterns within islands. The loss of bacterial diversity on smaller islands was driven primarily by the systematic decline of diversity within samples, whereas the loss of fungal diversity on smaller islands was driven primarily by the homogenization of community composition among samples. Lower soil moisture limited within-sample bacterial diversity, whereas smaller spatial distances among samples restricted among-sample fungal diversity, on smaller islands. These results indicate that among-island differences in habitat quality generate the bacterial island species-area relationship, whereas within-island dispersal limitation generates the fungal island species-area relationship. Together, our study suggests that different mechanisms underlie similar island biogeography patterns of soil bacteria and fungi.

TI Bergmann's Rule rules body size in an ectotherm: heat conservation in a

AB Bergmann's Rule predicts larger body sizes in colder habitats, increasing organisms' ability to conserve heat. Originally formulated for endotherms, it is controversial whether Bergmann's Rule may be applicable to ectotherms, given that larger ectotherms show diminished capacity for heating up. We predict that Bergmann's Rule will be applicable to ectotherms when the benefits of a higher conservation of heat due to a larger body size overcompensate for decreased capacity to heating up. We test this hypothesis in the lizard Psammodromus algirus, which shows increased body size with elevation in Sierra Nevada (SE Spain). We measured heating and cooling rates of lizards from different elevations (from 300 to 2500m above sea level) under controlled conditions. We found no significant differences in the heating rate along an elevational gradient. However, the cooling rate diminished with elevation and body size: highland lizards, with larger masses, have a higher thermal inertia for cooling, which allows them to maintain heat for more time and keep a high body temperature despite the lower thermal availability. Consequently, the net gaining of heat increased with elevation and body size. This study highlights that the heat conservation mechanism for explaining Bergmann's Rule works and is applicable to ectotherms, depending on the thermal benefits and costs associated with larger body sizes.

AB Herbivory and climate are key environmental drivers, shaping ecosystems at high latitudes. Here, we focus on how these two drivers act in concert, influencing the high arctic tundra. We aim to investigate mechanisms through which herbivory by geese influences vegetation and soil processes in tundra ecosystems under ambient and warmed conditions. To achieve this, two grazing treatments, clipping plus faecal additions and moss removal, were implemented in conjunction with passive warming. Our key finding was that, in many cases, the tundra ecosystem response was determined by treatment impacts on the moss layer. Moss removal reduced the remaining moss layer depth by 30% and increased peak grass biomass by 27%. These impacts were probably due to observed higher soil temperatures and decomposition rates associated with moss removal. The positive impact of moss removal on grass biomass was even greater with warming, further supporting this conclusion. In contrast, moss removal reduced dwarf shrub biomass possibly resulting from increased exposure to desiccating winds. An intact moss layer buffered the soil to increased air temperature and as a result there was no response of vascular plant productivity to warming over the course of this study. In fact, moss removal impacts on soil temperature were nearly double those of warming, suggesting that the moss layer is a key component in controlling soil conditions. The moss layer also absorbed nutrients from faeces, promoting moss growth. We conclude that both herbivory and warming influence this high arctic ecosystem but that herbivory is the stronger driver of the two. Disturbance to the moss layer resulted in a shift towards a more grass-dominated system with less abundant mosses and shrubs, a trend that was further enhanced by warming. Thus herbivore impacts to the moss layer are key to understanding arctic ecosystem response to grazing and warming.

AB How does the process of life-history evolution interplay with population dynamics? Almost all models that have addressed this question assume that any combination of phenotypic traits uniquely determine the ecological population state. Here we show that if multiple ecological equilibria can exist, the evolution of a trait that relates to competitive performance can undergo adaptive reversals that drive cyclic alternation between population equilibria. The occurrence of evolutionary reversals requires neither environmentally driven changes in selective forces nor the coevolution of interactions with other species. The mechanism inducing evolutionary reversals is twofold. First, there exist phenotypes near which mutants can invade and yet fail to become fixed; although these mutants are eventually eliminated, their transitory growth causes the resident population to switch to an alternative ecological equilibrium. Second, asymmetrical competition causes the direction of selection to revert between high and low density. When ecological conditions for evolutionary reversals are not satisfied, the population evolves toward a steady state of either low or high abundance, depending on the degree of competitive asymmetry and environmental parameters. A sharp evolutionary transition between evolutionary stasis and evolutionary reversals and cycling can occur in response to a smooth change in ecological parameters, and this may have implications for our understanding of size-abundance patterns.

AB Patterns of granivorous ant seed predation in extensive cereal croplands of central Spain were investigated by measuring seed removal rates on artificial seed patches. Sampling was designed to cope with the seasonal and daily foraging cycle of ant colonies. Simultaneously with removal rates, I measured seed availability, habitat physiognomy at two spatial scales (landscape and microhabitat), weather variables (temperature and rainfall), and distance to the nearest ant nest. Ant seed predation was concentrated on shrublands, and associated with places with high covers of shrubs, chamaephytes and stones. These results were in close agreement with those obtained by analyzing the spatial distribution of granivorous ant nests (Diaz 1991). Moreover, there was a close relationship between seed removal rates and distance to the nearest ant nest, that fitted the predictions of the optimal foraging model developed by Reyes-Lopez (1987). Seasonal and daily patterns of ant foraging activity seemed to depend more on endogenous factors than on environmental variation. I conclude that ants were not able to track the spatial and temporal variation of their food resources in these man-modified habitats, so that their potential to interact with other members of the granivore system is greatly reduced by human activities.

AB Context A background assumption of landscape approaches is that some landscape patterns are more sustainable than others, and thus searching for these patterns should be a unifying theme for all landscape-related studies. We know much about biodiversity, ecosystems, and human wellbeing in our landscapes, but much less about how their interactions influence, and are influenced by, landscape patterns. To help fill this knowledge gap, landscape sustainability science (LSS) has emerged. However, the core research questions and key approaches of this new field still need to be systematically articulated. Objectives The main objectives of this paper were: (1) to propose a set of core research questions for LSS, and (2) to identify key cross-disciplinary approaches that can help address these questions. Methods I took a qualitative and subjective approach to review and synthesize the literature relevant to landscape sustainability, based on which I developed core questions and identified key cross-disciplinary approaches. Results Eight core questions were proposed to focus on understanding the relationships among landscape pattern, biodiversity, ecosystem function, ecosystem services, and human wellbeing, assessing the impacts of environmental and socio-institutional changes on these relationships, and fusing knowledge and action through landscape design/planning and governance processes. Ten inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches were identified, and their key characteristics were discussed in relation to landscape sustainability. Conclusions LSS has emerged as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research field that aims to understand and improve sustainability by focusing on landscape scales, while considering local and global scales in the same time. To advance LSS, future research not only needs to emphasize the relationships among landscape pattern, ecosystem services, and human wellbeing, but also to proactively integrate complementary approaches across natural and social sciences. Landscape sustainability is inevitably connected to the broader regional and global context; but if global sustainability is to be achieved, our landscapes must be sustained first. It is not the other way around.

AB Reintroductions and other conservation translocations are an important but often controversial form of wildlife management. Some authors have suggested the low success rates may reflect poor planning and decision-making. In this study, we used examples of herpetofaunal reintroductions, published in four volumes of the IUCN's Reintroduction Specialist Group Global Perspectives in Reintroduction Biology, to identify the objectives set by reintroduction practitioners, the indicators of success they choose and the types of difficulties they encounter. We found objectives focused on target species, but also on broader ecological objectives, such as ecosystem restoration, and social and economic aims. Practitioners reported high success rates: however, these referred to a mixture of general objectives, reflecting the fundamental aims of programmes, and technical aspects, such as developing husbandry protocols, that are important only as stepping stones for broader objectives. In some cases, important objectives were not assigned relevant indicators, thus making assessment impossible. Non-biological aspects such as funding dynamics were the most important source of difficulties; however, they were not always openly recognized by assigning relevant objectives and indicators. We argue that the adoption of a more structured approach to decision-making could help in addressing all these issues. In particular, we recommend that where possible, managers should clearly state all relevant objectives and constraints, and distinguish their respective relevance and importance. If such elements are not clearly defined a priori, planning and assessing reintroductions can become difficult or even impossible, increasing the risk of inefficient use of resources.

AB In the seed-eating ant Pogonomyrmex barbatus, the return of successful foragers stimulates inactive foragers to leave the nest. The rate at which successful foragers return to the nest depends on food availability; the more food available, the more quickly foragers will find it and bring it back. Field experiments examined how quickly a colony can adjust to a decline in the rate of forager return, and thus to a decline in food availability, by slowing down foraging activity. In response to a brief, 3- to 5-min reduction in the forager return rate, foraging activity usually decreased within 2-3 min and then recovered within 5 min. This indicates that whether an inactive forager leaves the nest on its next trip depends on its very recent experience of the rate of forager return. On some days, colonies responded more to a change in forager return rate. The rapid colony response to fluctuations in forager return rate, enabling colonies to act as risk-averse foragers, may arise from the limited interval over which an ant can track its encounters with returning foragers.

As a result, the small amount of plant tissue produced in deserts dies unconsurned and turns to litter that is consumed by macrodetritivorous arthropods, which are preyed upon by. small ectothermic arthropods and reptiles. This ectotherm-based food chain is energetically efficient and, despite the low productivity of the desert habitat, is able to support a fourth trophic level of endothermic predators, i.e. mammals and birds, that forage over large areas and locate their prey visually from a distance. This four-link chain results in trophic interactions that run from the large endothermic predators through the ectothermic ones to the macrodetritivores. Thus, macrodetritivores are released from predation and become food-limited. However, the full expression of these interactions occurs only in low productivity habitats with low plant cover. In productive habitats, plant cover blocks the vision of endothermic predators and provides refuge to small ectothermic ones. This results in ectothermic predators becoming abundant in habitats with high plant cover and controlling their prey, the macrodetritivores. Thus, the increase in productivity in deserts decreases the amount of energy that reaches top predators as it has a mainly structural effect: to increase plant cover and mediate predation interactions.

AB Two strains of Dunaliella salina (Dunal) Teod., UTEX 1644 and UTEX 200, were cultured under different growth regimes, including 10 mM NO3- or NH4+, 1.5 or 3.0 M NaCl, and low (0.035%) or high (5%) CO2 in air. The release of C-14-labeled dissolved organic carbon (DOC), expressed as a rate and as a percentage of photo synthetic (CO2)-C-14, assimilation, was subsequently determined. The percentage of DOC released was inversely related to cell density in the assay medium, but photosynthesis on a per-cell basis was not. Release of DOC was low, in the range of 1-5% of photosynthesis, but during acclimation to growth on NH4+, it rose to 11%. The presence of NH4+ rather than NO3- in the growth medium increased the rate of release by both strains, but the percentage release was stimulated only in UTEX 200 cells, because their photosynthetic ra te was depressed by NH4+. For UTEX 1644, high, as compared to low, CO2-grown cells, had somewhat higher rates a nd percentages of DOC release, but release from UTEX 200 cells was unaffected by the growth-CO2. The rate of DOC release by high CO2-grown cells was not enhanced at a low concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon, indicating that the released material did not originate from the photorespiratory pathway. The effects of NaCl on DOC release varied with strain a nd growth conditions. For UTEX 200, the cells in NO3-, but not NH4+, exhibited a doubling or more in percentage Of release with a doubling in NaCl concentration, irrespective of growth-CO2. With UTEX 1644 the low CO2-grown cells showed the greatest enhancement in 3.0 M NaCl. Organic matter accumulated on the external surface of the cell membrane and constituted a well-defined cell-coat, which was more dense in NH4+ than in NO3--grown cells. Microtubules, which may play a role in maintaining cell shape, were observed just below the plasma membrane.
   From a practical viewpoint, the presence of organic material in the hypersaline ponds of salt-works is detrimental to salt production. When D. salina cells become abundant in such ponds, the attendant, continuous release of DOC may make a significant contribution to the problem.

AB Fixed position linear transects were established in early 1989 at Buck Island Reef National Monument, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. On September 17-18 of that year Hurricane Hugo, the most severe cyclone to impact the area in over 60 years, passed directly over the island bringing hurricane-force winds for over 12 h and maximum estimated wind speeds of 70 m . s-1 (160 mph). Despite the severity of the storm, damage to coral reefs was extremely localised and concentrated mainly on reefs open to its southeasterly direction of approach. The southeast reef front at Buck Island was razed to substrate level between the surface and 7 m depth and the reef crest behind it was smothered in a 1 m deep berm of broken coral rubble. At a site on the north backreef, however, only a slight loss of coral cover was detected which was more than compensated for during 1990-91. At a south reef site which was in 8-10 m depth, just outside the region of severe damage, coral cover was reduced by 40-46% on three out of four transects. Shifts in community structure were detected by multi-dimensional scaling of Bray-Curtis similarity measures and by k-dominance curves, but not by the Shannon diversity statistic (H'). Coral cover had returned to approximate pre-hurricane levels by June 1991, but community composition remained distinct. One of the four transects at this south site was apparently not significantly damaged during the hurricane. Such spatial variability may affect recovery rates, since pockets of relatively undisturbed benthos may provide seed populations for recruitment into adjacent, more severely damaged areas. Hurricane Hugo did not appear to cause an immediate increase in species diversity by differential mortality of the dominant species in the community. This result is consistent with previous studies of the impact of less severe storms on St. Croix. but contrary to several reports of hurricane impact in other areas.

AB Sources of error in the fractionation of C-14 primary productivity samples were studied in the northern Baltic from 1984 to 1990. Acidification of the whole C-14 sample followed by 24 h in open vials to remove (CO2)-C-14 (no bubbling) proved to be a simple, accurate, and precise (C.V. 6.9%, n = 128) method for measuring apparent net primary productivity (total organic C-14). In 1985, the total recovery of organic C-14 with 0.2-mu-m cellulose acetate filters was 81% of the annual apparent net primary production. Different post-filtration treatments of the cellulose ester filters (rinsing, acidification) all gave significant unaccountable losses of up to 34% of organic C-14. No losses were recorded with glass-fiber filters. Excess release of dissolved organic C-14 due to filtration was generally unimportant, as only minor quantitative or qualitative differences were found between the < 0.2-mu-m filtrates of the whole and centrifuged samples.

AB Plants and vegetation play a critical-but largely unpredictable-role in global environmental changes due to the multitude of contributing processes at widely different spatial and temporal scales. In this Perspective, we explore approaches to master this complexity and improve our ability to predict vegetation dynamics by explicitly taking account of principles that constrain plant and ecosystem behaviour: natural selection, self-organization and entropy maximization. These ideas are increasingly being used in vegetation models, but we argue that their full potential has yet to be realized. We demonstrate the power of natural selection-based optimality principles to predict photosynthetic and carbon allocation responses to multiple environmental drivers, as well as how individual plasticity leads to the predictable self-organization of forest canopies. We show how models of natural selection acting on a few key traits can generate realistic plant communities and how entropy maximization can identify the most probable outcomes of community dynamics in space- and time-varying environments. Finally, we present a roadmap indicating how these principles could be combined in a new generation of models with stronger theoretical foundations and an improved capacity to predict complex vegetation responses to environmental change.
   Integrating natural selection and other organizing principles into next-generation vegetation models could render them more theoretically sound and useful for earth system applications and modelling climate impacts.

TI Are Namibian "Fairy Circles" the Consequence of Self-Organizing Spatial
   Vegetation Patterning?

   DYNAMICS; PATCHES; ANTS; FORM
AB Causes of over-dispersed barren "fairy circles" that are often surrounded by ca. 0.5 m tall peripheral grasses in a matrix of shorter (ca. 0.2 m tall) grasses in Namibian grasslands remain mysterious. It was hypothesized that the fairy circles are the consequence of self-organizing spatial vegetation patterning arising from resource competition and facilitation. We examined the edaphic properties of fairy circles and variation in fairy circle size, density and landscape occupancy (% land surface) with edaphic properties and water availability at a local scale (<50 km) and with climate and vegetation characteristics at a regional scale. Soil moisture in the barren fairy circles declines from the center towards the periphery and is inversely correlated with soil organic carbon, possibly indicating that the peripheral grass roots access soil moisture that persists into the dry season within fairy circles. Fairy circle landscape occupancy is negatively correlated with precipitation and soil [N], consistent with fairy circles being the product of resource-competition. Regional fairy circle presence/absence is highly predictable using an empirical model that includes narrow ranges of vegetation biomass, precipitation and temperature seasonality as predictor variables, indicating that fairy circles are likely a climate-dependent emergent phenomenon. This dependence of fairy circle occurrence on climate explains why fairy circles in some locations may appear and disappear over time. Fairy circles are only over-dispersed at high landscape occupancies, indicating that inter-circle competition may determine their spacing. We conclude that fairy circles are likely to be an emergent arid-grassland phenomenon that forms as a consequence of peripheral grass resource-competition and that the consequent barren circle may provide a resource-reservoir essential for the survival of the larger peripheral grasses and provides a habitat for fossicking fauna.

AB Seagrass habitats in the Arabian Gulf constitute a critical marine resource in the region, sustaining a high primary production, harbouring a high biodiversity of associated plant and animal species, and serving as important nursery grounds for penaeid shrimps, pearl oysters and various other marine organisms. The extreme environmental conditions in the Arabian Gulf, with major seasonal variations in water temperature and salinity, are tolerated by only three opportunistic seagrass species (Halodule uninervis, Halophila stipulacea and H. ovalis). Approximately 7,000 km(2) of seagrass habitat has been mapped in the Arabian Gulf to date, with particularly extensive meadows in the coastal waters of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar. This area also sustains the world's second largest population of approximately 5800 dugongs, which feed almost exclusively on seagrasses. Meanwhile, massive land-reclamation projects and rapid industrial developments (including power- and desalination plants) are posing an unprecedented threat to seagrass habitats in this region. This paper provides a detailed overview of the known distribution of seagrass habitats in the Arabian Gulf and their tolerance thresholds for temperature, salinity, turbidity and sedimentation. The paper concludes with a summary of the main threats to seagrasses in the Gulf and recommendations for their conservation and management.

AB Deer overabundance reduces forest ground-layer vegetation and can cause cascading impacts on a forest ecosystem. To predict these effects, we must elucidate the relationship between deer density and the status of ground-layer vegetation. This relationship was studied in the Boso Peninsula, where the deer population density exhibits a clear geographical gradient. We examined species richness and cover of ground-layer vegetation at several cedar plantations and hardwood forests in the Boso Peninsula. We also examined whether deer impacts were altered by light condition, soil water content and forest type (cedar and hardwood). Species richness of ground-layer vegetation was maximized at an intermediate level of deer density, suggesting an intermediate disturbance effect. This phenomenon was compatible with the observation that evergreen species, which were competitive dominants, decreased with increasing deer density, whereas less competitive deciduous species increased until herbivory was intermediate. As deer density increased, cover of ground-layer vegetation gradually decreased, but species unpalatable to deer increased in abundance, suggesting indirect positive effects of deer for unpalatable species. Cedar plantations tended to have greater species richness and ground-layer cover than hardwood forests with similar deer levels. Canopy openness, an indicator of light conditions, increased species richness of hardwood forests and ground-layer cover of cedar plantations, even under deer herbivory. Topographic wetness index, an indicator of soil water content, significantly increased the ground-layer cover of cedar plantations under deer herbivory. These results emphasize the importance of environmental productivity and forest type in the management of ground-layer vegetation experiencing deer overabundance.

AB We report the results of eight years of post-release monitoring of 37 wild-born, captive chimpanzees released into the Conkouati-Douli National Park, Republic of Congo. Overall survival was high, with 23 (62%) individuals remaining in the release zone, and only 5 (14%) confirmed dead. Released females regularly interacted with wild chimpanzees. Several females appeared to have integrated into wild groups for extended periods of time, and four released females gave birth to a total of five offspring. However, encounters with wild chimpanzees were a major cause of mortality in released males, and 40-50% of released males would have died without veterinary intervention. These sex differences are in accordance with knowledge of chimpanzee behavioural ecology. Our results demonstrate that wild-born, captive chimpanzees can be released into the wild successfully, under certain specific conditions. Most importantly, careful planning and preparation is critical at all stages; a suitable release area must be identified; potential risks to existing wild populations, including the possibility of disease transmission, must be minimised; and post-release monitoring is essential. Adolescent females are the most suitable candidates for release, as they appear to be able to integrate successfully into wild communities. However, males should not be released where wild chimpanzees occur, as they are likely to be attacked and killed. Release into the wild addresses the welfare of certain individual animals, although it clearly cannot address the fate of all captive, wild-born chimpanzees. Knowledge of how to successfully release chimpanzees into the wild also has both current and potential future benefits for the conservation of wild chimpanzee populations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Field experiments were conducted to quantify the natural levels of post-dispersal seed predation of arable weed species in spring barley and to identify the main groups of seed predators. Four arable weed species were investigated that were of high biodiversity value, yet of low to moderate competitive ability with the crop. These were Chenopodium album, Sinapis arvensis, Stellaria media and Polygonum aviculare. Exclusion treatments were used to allow selective access to dishes of seeds by different predator groups. Seed predation was highest early in the season, followed by a gradual decline in predation over the summer for all species. All species were taken by invertebrates. The activity of two phytophagous carabid genera showed significant correlations with seed predation levels. However, in general carabid activity was not related to seed predation and this is discussed in terms of the mainly polyphagous nature of many Carabid species that utilized the seed resource early in the season, but then switched to carnivory as prey populations increased. The potential relevance of post-dispersal seed predation to the development of weed management systems that maximize biological control through conservation and optimize herbicide use, is discussed.

AB 1. Coupled plant-herbivore models, allowing feedback from plant to herbivore populations and vice versa, enable us to predict the impact of biocontrol agents on their target weed populations; however, they are rarely used in biocontrol studies. We describe the population biology of the invasive plant Echium plantagineum and the weevil Mogulones larvatus, a biocontrol agent, in Australia. In order to understand the dynamics of this plant-herbivore system, a series of coupled models of increasing complexity was developed.
   2. A simple model was extended to include a seed bank, density-dependent plant fecundity, competition between weevil larvae and plant tolerance of herbivory, where below a threshold plants could compensate for larval feeding. Parameters and functional forms were estimated from experimental and field data.
   3. The plant model, in the absence of the weevil, exhibited stable dynamics and provided a good quantitative description of field densities before the weevil was introduced.
   4. In the coupled plant-herbivore model, density dependence in both plant fecundity and weevil larval competition stabilized the dynamics. Without larval competition the model was unstable, and plant tolerance of herbivory exacerbated this instability. This was a result of a time delay in plant response to herbivore densities.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The coupled plant-herbivore model allowed us to predict whether stable coexistence of target plant and biocontrol agents was achievable at an acceptable level. We found this to be the case for the Echium-Mogulones system and believe that similar models would be of use when assessing new agents in this and other invasive plant biocontrol systems. Density dependence in new biocontrol agents should be assessed in order to determine whether it is likely to result in the aims of classical biocontrol: low, stable and sustainable populations of plant and herbivore. Further work should be done to characterize the strength of density dependence according to the niche occupied by the biocontrol agent, for example the strength and functional form of density dependence in stem borers may be quite different to that of defoliators.

AB Alternative- states theory commonly applied, for aquatic systems, to shallow lakes that may be dominated alternately by macrophytes and phytoplankton, under clear- water and enriched conditions, respectively, has been used in this study as a basis to define different states that may occur with changes in wetland salinity. Many wetlands of the south- west of Western Australia are threatened by rapidly increasing levels of salinity as well as greater water depths and permanency of water regime. We identified contrasting aquatic vegetation states that were closely associated with different salinities. Salinisation results in the loss of freshwater species of submerged macrophytes and the dominance of a small number of more salt- tolerant species. With increasing salinity, these systems may undergo further change to microbial mat- dominated systems composed mostly of cyanobacteria and halophilic bacteria. The effect of other environmental influences in mediating switches of vegetation was also examined. Colour and turbidity may play important roles at low to intermediate salinities [ concentration of total dissolved solids ( TDS) < 10000 mg L-1]; however, coloured or turbid wetlands are rarely found at intermediate to high salinities (> 10000 mg L-1 TDS). The role of nutrients remains largely unquantified in saline systems. We propose that alternative- states theory provides the basis of a conceptual framework for predicting impacts on wetlands affected by secondary salinisation. The ability to recognise and predict a change in state with changes in salinity adds a further tool to decision- making processes. A change in state represents a fundamental change in ecosystem function and may be difficult to reverse. This information is also important for the development of restoration strategies. Further work is required to better understand the influence of temporal variation in salinity on vegetation states and probable hysteresis effects.

AB The concurrent discussions of landscape scale restoration among restoration ecologists, and of historic disturbance pattern as a guideline for forest management among forest scientists, offer a unique opportunity for collaboration between these traditionally separated fields. The objective of this study was to review the environmental history, early restoration projects, and current plans to restore landscape patterns at broader scales in the 450,000 ha northwest Wisconsin Pine Barrens. The Pine Barrens offer an example of a landscape shaped by fire in the past. In northwestern Wisconsin historically the barrens were a mosaic of open prairie, savanna, and pine forests on very poor, sandy soils. The surrounding region of better soils was otherwise heavily forested. Six restoration sites have been managed since the middle of this century using prescribed burns to maintain the open, barrens habitat. However, these sites are not extensive enough to mimic the shifting mosaic of large open patches previously created by fire. Extensive clear-cuts may be used as a substitute for these large fire patches so that presettlement landscape patterns are more closely approximated in the current landscape. We suggest that such silvicultural treatments can be suitable to restore certain aspects of presettlement landscapes, such as landscape pattern and open habitat for species such as grassland birds. We are aware that the effects of fire and clear-cuts differ in many aspects and additional management tools, such as prescribed burning after harvesting, may assist in further approximating the effect of natural disturbance. However, the restoration of landscape pattern using clear-cuts may provide an important context for smaller isolated restoration sites even without the subsequent application of fire, in this formerly more open landscape.

AB We examined associations between warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and coral bleaching in the Galapagos Islands and the Gulf of Panama, in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean. Interannual SST variability is dominated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon at Galapagos, whereas only strong events have an SST signature in Panama. We explored various SST-related metrics potentially associated with bleaching occurrence: maximum absolute SST, SST anomaly, and the combined effect of intensity and duration of both SST anomalies (described via a ''degree days'' index) and high SST events. In Galapagos, three Nino years (1983, 1987, and 1992) coincided with bleaching. These were the top three years in both maximum annual SSTs and degree days values. In Panama, bleaching in 1983 coincided with high maximum SSTs and high degree days. In contrast, no bleaching was detected in 1972 despite high values of both quantities. We found all temperature-related metrics to be highly correlated, and it was impossible to isolate their effects.

AB Climate change threatens coral reefs across the world. Intense bleaching has caused dramatic coral mortality in many tropical regions in recent decades, but less obvious chronic effects of temperature and other stressors can be equally threatening to the long-term persistence of diverse coral-dominated reef systems. Coral reefs persist if coral recovery rates equal or exceed average rates of mortality. While mortality from acute destructive events is often obvious and easy to measure, estimating recovery rates and investigating the factors that influence them requires long-term commitment. Coastal development is increasing in many regions, and sea surface temperatures are also rising. The resulting chronic stresses have predictable, adverse effects on coral recovery, but the lack of consistent long-term data sets has prevented measurement of how much coral recovery rates are actually changing. Using long-term monitoring data from 47 reefs spread over 10 degrees of latitude on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), we used a modified Gompertz equation to estimate coral recovery rates following disturbance. We compared coral recovery rates in two periods: 7 years before and 7 years after an acute and widespread heat stress event on the GBR in 2002. From 2003 to 2009, there were few acute disturbances in the region, allowing us to attribute the observed shortfall in coral recovery rates to residual effects of acute heat stress plus other chronic stressors. Compared with the period before 2002, the recovery of fast-growing Acroporidae and of "Other" slower growing hard corals slowed after 2002, doubling the time taken for modest levels of recovery. If this persists, recovery times will be increasing at a time when acute disturbances are predicted to become more frequent and intense. Our study supports the need for management actions to protect reefs from locally generated stresses, as well as urgent global action to mitigate climate change.

ID IDENTIFICATION; EVOLUTION; ECOSYSTEM; SCIENCE
AB It is thought that the science of ecology has experienced conceptual shifts in recent decades, chiefly from viewing nature as static and balanced to a conception of constantly changing, unpredictable, complex ecosystems. Here, we ask if these changes are reflected in actual ecological research over the last 30 years. We surveyed 750 articles from the entire pool of ecological literature and 750 articles from eight leading journals. Each article was characterized according to its type, ecological domain, and applicability, and major topics. We found that, in contrast to its common image, ecology is still mostly a study of single species (70% of the studies); while ecosystem and community studies together comprise only a quarter of ecological research. Ecological science is somewhat conservative in its topics of research (about a third of all topics changed significantly through time), as well as in its basic methodologies and approaches. However, the growing proportion of problem-solving studies (from 9% in the 1980s to 20% in the 2000 s) may represent a major transition in ecological science in the long run.

AB Climate change is causing spatio-temporal shifts in environmental conditions, and species that are not able to track suitable environments may face increased risks of extinction. Assisted colonization, a form of translocation, has been proposed as a tool to help species survive the impacts of climate change. Unfortunately, translocations generally have a low success rate, a well-documented fact that is not considered in most of the recent literature on assisted colonization. One of the main impediments to translocation success is inadequate planning. In this review, we argue that by using well-known analytical tools such as species distribution models and population dynamics modelling we can maximize the success of assisted colonization. In particular, we present guidelines as to which questions should be investigated when planning assisted colonization and suggest methods for answering them. Finally, we also highlight further implementation and research issues that remain to be solved for assisted colonizations to be efficient climate change adaptation tools.

AB Mutualisms are almost ubiquitously exploited by species that gain the benefits that mutualists offer to each other, but that offer nothing in return. This paper investigates the possible dynamical outcomes of a mechanistically formulated model system, involving two obligate mutualists and one exploiter. The model is based conceptually on a mutualism between a plant species and its pollinating seed parasite in the presence of an obligate, nonpollinating seed parasite. Of particular interest are the conditions under which the exploiter species can invade and coexist with a mutualism that, by itself, possesses an equilibrium stabilized by other density-dependent regulating factors. Two types of models are used in the analyses: a deterministic, nonspatial model described by a set of discrete time equations, and an individual-based simulation incorporating stochastic interactions and spatial structure. Comparing the results of these two models uncovers the temporal dynamics of both well-mixed local systems and spatially distributed populations. Using these two situations, we examine how the predictions of the nonspatial model are affected by habitat structure.
   In the nonspatial case, and without the exploiters, there are typically two stable equilibria: one having zero densities for both mutualist species, and the other having nonzero densities. This bi-stability is a characteristic feature of obligate mutualisms. When the exploiter species is included, the system always retains the stability of the zero-density equilibrium, but the dynamics of the upper equilibrium can be more complicated, including limit cycle and extinction dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that. spatial structure is a highly stabilizing influence on the three-species system as long as the exploiter's dispersal distance is large relative to the seed dispersal distance of the plant species. Given this condition, the model predicts spatial distributions that are marked by a patchy distribution of plants, with mutualists and exploiters situated about these patches.

AB Two types of numerical response function have evolved since Solomon first introduced the term to generalize features of Lotka-Volterra predator-prey models: (i) the demographic numerical response, which links change in consumer demographic rates to food availability; and (ii) the isocline numerical response, which links consumer abundance per se to food availability. These numerical responses are interchangeable because both recognize negative feedback loops between consumer and food abundance resulting in population regulation. We review how demographic and isocline numerical responses have been used to enhance our understanding of population regulation of kangaroos and possums, and argue that their utility may be increased by explicitly accounting for non-equilibrium dynamics (due to environmental variability and/or biological interactions) and the existence of multiple limiting factors. Interferential numerical response functions may help bridge three major historical dichotomies in population ecology (equilibrium versus non-equilibrium dynamics, extrinsic versus intrinsic regulation and demographic versus isocline numerical responses).

AB SCUBA ecotourism provides economic support for local human communities and for conservation. Such support should be sustainable and as ecologically non-destructive as possible to its coral reef foundation. In recent years, the major increase in SCUBA activity has become a significant consideration at some locations. Among these are the South African coral reefs at Sodwana Bay, which receive 80 000 dives per year. Between May 1998 and January 1999, assessments using line-intercept and belt transects showed that 5.9% of hard corals and 4.0% of soft corals were damaged from various causes, while only 0.02% of the hard corals were dead. Of the 222 diver contacts observed, only 1.63% produced instant and visually-clear damage, with no measurable decline in overall coral reef health. Direct observations on 89 recreational divers showed that photographers made damaging contacts on nine out of ten dives, while novice divers made one such contact per six dives, moderately experienced divers about once every 14 dives, and very experienced divers about once every 123 dives. Increased time lapsed since the last dive increased diver damage by novices. We calculated that the 80 000 dives were equivalent to 1 m(2) of reef receiving 2.3 diver contacts per year. Acropora austera was by far the most significantly damaged coral, with one out of four branches broken per year. But as this species accounted for only 0.2% of reef benthos cover, this impact was not representative of overall reef health. This heavy species-specific impact makes A. austera a good bio-monitor.

AB We examined the respective roles of climate and vegetation structure on geographical Variation in bird species richness. The Province of Buenos Aires (central-eastern Argentina) was divided into 146 squares of 50 km on a side. For each square we evaluated the number of bird species, the value of thirteen climatic variables, and the value of a vegetation strata index. The climatic matrix was analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the first factors resulting from PCA were considered as multifactorial climatic gradients. Simple and Partial Correlation Analysis among bird species richness, vegetation strata, and the first two factors derived from PCA (65% of total variation) indicated that bird richness distribution was determined by the availability of vegetation strata, associated with different vegetation types that, at the same time, were influenced by the climatic conditions summarized in the first climatic factor (a gradient of precipitation, relative humidity, annual termical amplitude, and frost occurrence). This relationships reflect the complexity of factors that can act directly as well as indirectly on the geographical patterns in species richness.

AB Longevity and competence were studied in planulae of several species of Red Sea soft corals, including the zooxanthellate planulae of Litophyton arboreum, Nephthea sp, and Xenia umbellata, and the azooxanthellate planulae of Parerythropodium fulvum fulvum and Dendronephthya hemprichi. The relationship between presence of zooxanthellae in the planulae and their competence, longevity and caloric content was examined. Planulae of X. umbellata and D. hemprichi had the longest competency of 76 and 74 d, respectively, planulae of P. f, fulvum were competent for a maximal period of 64 d, and planulae of L, arboreum and Nephthea sp, showed a similar competency of 57 d. The highest longevity of 155 d was found in planulae of X. umbellata. Planulae of P. f. fulvum, D. hemprichi and L. arboreum had maximum longevities of 76, 81 and 92 d, respectively. No significant differences existed between the competence or longevity of the zooxanthellate and azooxanthellate planulae. The ratio of the maximum values of longevity to competency was significantly higher for the zooxanthellate compared to the azooxanthellate planulae. That zooxanthellate planulae survived beyond their competence period might be due to the ability of larvae to utilize photosynthates produced by the zooxanthellae. However, the presence of symbiotic algae in planulae does not necessarily increase competency. The caloric value of 3 d old planulae of P. f. fulvum was 0.096 +/- 0.002 cal planula(-1), and that of 4 d old planulae of X. umbellata was 0.012 +/- 0.001 cal planula(-1). The caloric content of the former decreased with development, but increased in the latter. These results support the assumption that the photosynthates of symbiotic algae contribute to the energetic content of the planulae throughout their life. Considering the competence and longevity of the planulae, it is concluded that they are able to disperse from the southern Red Sea reefs to the degraded reefs of Eilat (northern Red Sea).

AB Natural and human activities lead to soil degradation and soil salinization. The decrease of farmlands threatens food security. There are approximately 1 billion ha salt-affected soils all over of world, which can be made available resources after chemical, physical and biological remediation. Nostoc, Anabaena and other cyanobacterial species have outstanding capabilities, such as the ability to fix nitrogen from the air, produce an extracellular matrix and produce compatible solutes. The remediation of salt-affected soil is a complex and difficult task. During the past years, much new research has been conducted that shows that cyanobacteria are effective for salt-affected soil remediation in laboratory studies and field trials. The related mechanisms for both salt tolerance and salt-affected soil remediation were also evaluated from the perspective of biochemistry, molecular biology and systems biology. The effect of cyanobacteria on salt-affected soil is related to nitrogen fixation and other mechanisms. There are complicated interactions among cyanobacteria, bacteria, fungi and the soil. The interaction between cyanobacteria and salt-tolerant plants should be considered if the cyanobacterium is utilized to improve the soil fertility in addition to performing soil remediation. It is critical to re-establish the micro-ecology in salt-affected soils and improve the salt affected soil remediation efficiency. The first challenge is the selection of suitable cyanobacterial strain. The co-culture of cyanobacteria and bacteria is also potential approach. The cultivation of cyanobacteria on a large scale should be optimized to improve productivity and decrease cost. The development of bio-remediating agents for salt-affected soil remediation also relies on other technical problems, such as harvesting and contamination control. The application of cyanobacteria in salt-affected soil remediation will reconstruct green agriculture and promote the sustainable development of human society. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mangroves provide several ecosystem goods and services to society. However, mangroves are frequently subjected to land conversion, overharvesting, and pollution including increased nitrogen (N) availability. Aiming to provide useful information to predict effects of N enrichment on mangroves, we evaluated literature data on N transformation rates in sediment, dissolved N (DN) fluxes across the sediment-water interface, and natural abundance of N stable isotopes (delta N-15) in the sediment-plant system in conserved mangroves and those subjected to anthropogenic N enrichment.
   Mangroves and terrestrial tropical forests exhibit a great overlap in rates of biological N fixation (BNF) and denitrification and nitrous oxide flux rates. Mangroves can be highly efficient users of DN forms from tidal waters, related to rapid plant uptake and an efficient conservation of DN in sediment by microbial activity. The main factors limiting N transformation rates in mangrove sediment are inorganic DN availability and microbial immobilization. The delta N-15 data indicated that fringe forests exhibit higher N transformation rates in sediment and higher N losses to atmosphere, compared to other mangrove types. Except for BNF, all other N transformation and flux rates seem to be intensified by increasing N availability.

AB This paper reviews the socio-economic, ecological, and conservation experiences during the establishment of Marine Reserves (no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPA)) in New Zealand in an international context. Once operational, reserves became popular with the public and provided economic benefits. In one reserve, 'spill-over' of lobsters counter-balanced lost fishing. The reserves provided the control sites that showed the effects of fishing on ecosystems through depleted populations and habitat change due to trophic cascades. Studies in other countries indicated that these trophic cascades were common globally. Research showed reserves protect benthic and pelagic species, including those that move outside the reserves. These findings benefited from reserves having a map of seabed habitats and data on the relative abundance of species of ecological importance. Information on other species (e.g. macro-invertebrates), and previous and nearby fishing effort over time, may have provided additional insights.
   Marine Reserves can provide benefits to (1) conservation of species and habitats, (2) science as controls for fishing effects, and (3) fisheries as reference sites that conserve natural genetic and population structure, host brood-stock, and provide spill-over to nearby fisheries. They should be distributed geographically in networks that include replicated examples of habitats and species. To do so, they need to be suitably located, large enough, and enforced to fulfil these opportunities. However, these benefits remain limited by the relatively small area occupied by Marine Reserves within and between countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the factors that drive geographic variation in life history is an important challenge in evolutionary ecology. Here, we analyze what predicts geographic variation in life-history traits of the common lizard, Zootoca vivipara, which has the globally largest distribution range of all terrestrial reptile species. Variation in body size was predicted by differences in the length of activity season, while we found no effects of environmental temperature per se. Females experiencing relatively short activity season mature at a larger size and remain larger on average than females in populations with relatively long activity seasons. Interpopulation variation in fecundity was largely explained by mean body size of females and reproductive mode, with viviparous populations having larger clutch size than oviparous populations. Finally, body size-fecundity relationship differs between viviparous and oviparous populations, with relatively lower reproductive investment for a given body size in oviparous populations. While the phylogenetic signal was weak overall, the patterns of variation showed spatial effects, perhaps reflecting genetic divergence or geographic variation in additional biotic and abiotic factors. Our findings emphasize that time constraints imposed by the environment rather than ambient temperature play a major role in shaping life histories in the common lizard. This might be attributed to the fact that lizards can attain their preferred body temperature via behavioral thermoregulation across different thermal environments. Length of activity season, defining the maximum time available for lizards to maintain optimal performance, is thus the main environmental factor constraining growth rate and annual rates of mortality. Our results suggest that this factor may partly explain variation in the extent to which different taxa follow ecogeographic rules.

AB Seed size and dormancy are reproductive traits that interact as adaptations to environmental conditions. Here, we explore the evolution of these traits in environments that differ in overall mean favorability and in the extent of temporal predictability.
   Our model simulates a population of annual plants living in a range of environments that differ in aridity, namely mean annual precipitation and inter-annual variation of this mean precipitation.
   The optimal fitness curve is investigated assuming density dependence, three alternative hypothetical relationships between seed mass and seed survival in the soil (negative, positive, and independent of mass), and three alternative relationships between survival in soil and precipitation (strong and intermediate negative relationships, and no relationship).
   Our results show that seed size and dormancy are not two substitutable evolutionary traits; that specific combinations of these two traits are selected in environments that differ in favorability and temporal predictability; that a certain degree of seed dormancy is advantageous not only in temporally unpredictable environments but also in temporally predictable environments with high competition; and that more than one combination of seed size and dormancy (defined in terms of germination fraction) can be optimal, even in spatially homogeneous environments, potentially allowing selection for more variation in these traits within and among species.

AB We have previously documented multiple, independent origins of placentas in the fish family Poeciliidae. Here we summarize similar analyses of fishes in the family Zenarchopteridae. This family includes three live-bearing genera. Earlier studies documented the presence of superfetation, or the ability to carry multiple litters of young in different stages of development in the same ovary, in some species in all three genera. There is also one earlier report of matrotrophy, or extensive postfertilization maternal provisioning, in two of these genera. We present detailed life-history data for approximately half of the species in all three genera and combine them with the best available phylogeny to make inferences about the pattern of life-history evolution within this family. Three species of Hemirhamphodon have superfetation but lack matrotrophy. Most species in Nomorhamphus and Dermogenys either lack superfetation and matrotrophy or have both superfetation and matrotrophy. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that matrotrophy may have evolved independently in each genus. In Dermogenys, matrotrophic species produce fewer, larger offspring than nonmatrotrophic species. In Nomorhamphus; matrotrophic species instead produce more and smaller offspring than lecithotrophic species. However, the matrotrophic species in both genera have significantly smaller masses of reproductive tissue relative to their body sizes. All aspects of these results are duplicated in the fish family Poeciliidae. We discuss the possible adaptive significance of matrotrophy in the light of these new results. The two families together present a remarkable opportunity to study the evolution of a complex trait because they contain multiple, independent origins of the trait that often include close relatives that vary in either the presence or absence of the matrotrophy or in the degree to which matrotrophy is developed. These are the raw materials that are required for either an analysis of the adaptive significance of the trait or for studies of the genetic mechanisms that underlie the evolution of the trait.

AB Diversity, biomass, and productivity, the three key community/ecosystem variables, are interrelated and pose reciprocal influences on each other. The relationships among the three variables have been a central focus in ecology and formed two schools of fundamentally different nature with two related applications: (1) management - how biomass manipulation (e.g., grazing, burning) affects diversity and productivity, and (2) restoration - how diversity manipulation (e.g., seeding, planting) affects biomass and productivity. In the past, the two apparently related aspects have been studied intensively but separately in basic research and the reciprocal effects of the three variables and applied aspects have not been jointly addressed. In most cases, optimal management often involves regulating biomass so that high diversity and productivity or other preferred habitat characteristics can be achieved and maintained, while restoration usually involves planting/seeding a certain number and/or combination of native species so that the native structure and function of the habitat can be restored and degraded ecosystems can recover faster. This article attempts to unify these two schools and discusses the significance and implications of the diversity-biomass-productivity relationships in practice, with particular emphasis on grassland ecosystems.

AB The atoll reefs of the Lakshadweep, in the Indian Ocean suffered a catastrophic mortality of hard coral in the wake of the El Ni (n) over tildeo event of 1998. This study tracked changes to coral and other benthic elements in three atolls in the Lakshadweep from 2000 to 2003. The recovery of coral was highly site-specific, and appeared to be driven by differences in post-settlement survival of coral recruits, that were in turn, influenced by the local hydrodynamics of the atolls. Post bleaching recovery was highest on west-facing reefs, while recovery on east-facing reefs was very limited. However, no 'phase-shift' to macroalgal dominated reefs was evident. High herbivore pressures were perhaps the most important control of macroalgae. Five years after the mass mortality, the genera that showed the maximum gains represented a mix of different susceptibilities to bleaching, while some genera that were not particularly susceptible to bleaching showed significant declines. These results suggest that decline or recovery of coral is likely dependent on individual life history strategies, post-recruitment survival, and contingency.

AB [1] In this paper, we discuss observations of tidal variations in currents and elevation taken in the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat) over the fringing coral reef at Eilat, Israel. Both currents and elevations appear to be strongly affected by conditions in the main body of the Red Sea. Tidal currents, which vary considerably in strength throughout the year, appear to be associated with internal waves generated at the Strait of Tiran where density-driven exchanges between the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea take place. Water level also has significant annual and interannual variations; as seen in other studies of the Red Sea, these appear to be associated with corresponding variations in winds acting on the entire Red Sea.

AB Seed predation by rodents affects plant population dynamics and it may respond to changes in vegetation structure at forest edges. This study investigates the magnitude and direction of a potential edge effect in temperate deciduous forests, and it seeks possible explanations based on predator abundance and vegetation structure. The study was conducted at twelve forest edges in northern Switzerland; in six sites all shrubs at the forest edge were removed, whereas the other sites maintained a structurally rich shrub layer. In each site three transects were laid out from the edge towards the forest interior. In six plots along these transects (at 1, 3, 6, 12, 25, 50 m) we studied seed removal from experimental dishes, rodent abundance in live-traps and four characteristics of the vegetation structure. For both woody seed species (Prunus avium, Viburnum lantana) predation was significantly higher near the forest edge in the structurally rich sites; in the other sites no such gradient was found. Selectively accessible dishes revealed that rodents were the main predators, whereas predation by insects or molluscs was not observed. Abundance of rodents (Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, Clethrionomys glareolus) was highest under dense shrubs close to the forest edge. In the structurally rich sites there was a clear gradient of decreasing shrub cover from the edge towards the forest interior; a weaker gradient was observed in the structurally poor sites. We conclude that high shrub cover near the forest edge is the main determinant for edge effects in seed predation, and edges without a shrub belt show no such effect.

AB 1. Intrinsic variation in the availability of food to animal populations reflects the influence of foraging by the animals themselves. Intrinsic variation in food availability provides a link between population density, subsequent food availability and variation in the rate of population increase (r), operating through density-dependent food shortage. In contrast, extrinsic variation in food availability is caused by environmental influences on food or animal abundance, which are independent of animal foraging. Extrinsic variation in food availability is random relative to that arising through intrinsic shortage. Intrinsic and extrinsic variation in food availability can influence animal populations simultaneously. Intrinsic variation will impart a tendency towards an equilibrium between animal and food abundance, which will be progressively obscured by density-independent variation as the influence of extrinsic factors increases.
   2. This study used a large-scale field experiment, in which the density of food-limited feral pig (Sus scrofa L.) populations was manipulated on six sites, to assess the relative influence of intrinsic and extrinsic variation in food availability. The experiment evaluated the influence of pig population density on r and the abundance of food resources measured as pasture biomass. It was predicted that if intrinsic shortages dominated variation in food availability, pasture biomass and r would decline with increasing pig density. If extrinsic factors dominated variation in food availability, pig density would have no systematic effect on either pasture biomass or r. If intrinsic and extrinsic sources simultaneously affected variation in food availability, higher pig densities would have no systematic effect on r, but would reduce pasture biomass. The simultaneous model predicts reduced pasture biomass because, in the absence of compensatory changes in other sources of variation, the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors will be additive.
   3. To examine further the degree of interdependence in pig and pasture abundance, a series of stochastic models of the grazing system were estimated and the feedback loop comprising the functional and numerical responses of feral pigs to variation in pasture biomass was manipulated.
   4. In the large-scale experiment, neither pasture biomass nor r declined with increasing pig density, suggesting that food availability was dominated by extrinsic factors. However, limitations of the experiment meant that a minor decline in pasture biomass may have gone undetected. Comparison of simulation models, which included and omitted pasture offtake by pigs, indicated that because they were less efficient grazers and persisted at lower average densities relative to other large herbivores, pigs had little influence on variation in pasture biomass.
   5. The minor influence pigs appear to exert on pasture biomass suggests that trophic processes, typically invoked to explain herbivore population persistence, have, at best, limited consequences for pig populations. Despite this, simulation models indicate that pigs are able to persist indefinitely under rangelands conditions, because their high intrinsic capacity for increase (r(m) = 0.69) means that they are able to exploit periods when pasture is plentiful more effectively than other large herbivores.
   6. The study concludes that intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variation in food availability represent two extremes of a continuum in the strength of interaction between herbivores and their food resources. The position or a grazing system along this hypothetical continuum depends on the relative influence of stochastic, density-independent environmental processes (extrinsic variation) and the efficiency of its vegetation-herbivore feedback loop (intrinsic variation). Feral pig populations in the rangelands appear to occupy a position towards the extrinsic extreme of this continuum. where their dynamics are more influenced by extrinsic than intrinsic sources of variation in pasture availability.

AB Landscape scientists have increasingly studied sustainability during the past three decades, with a plurality of perspectives and methods. However, a comprehensive review of the relevant literature is still lacking. Two concepts capture the core of these studies: sustainable landscapes (SL) and landscape sustainability (LS). Here we present a bibliometric analysis of 333 English papers published in SCI journals (i.e., indexed by Web of Science) during 1990-2017, whose titles, abstracts or keywords contain SL, LS, or both. Using multiple methods, including change-point detection, text and topic mining, and citation analysis, we found: (1) Sustainability studies of landscapes have entered a rapid growth phase since 2004-2006, as determined statistically by the annual publications and citations; (2) There have been many more studies focusing on the ecological and practical dimensions than sociocultural and theoretical dimensions; and (3) Influenced by advances in sustainability research in a broader science context, studies of SL and LS have become increasingly holistic, transdisciplinary, and normative. Our findings suggest that, to further advance landscape sustainability science, scholars need to be more explicit about the underlying sustainability perspective and associated scales of key terms (e.g., SL, LS, and ecosystem services) in specific studies, and need to put more emphasis on place-based case studies of various landscape unsustainability syndromes by integrating the sustainability science-based social-ecological systems and transdisciplinary perspectives.

AB Dolichospermum (formerly Anabaena) and Microcystis cause harmful cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Input reduction of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are commonly recognized as basic ways of controlling blooms, but little is known about the roles of nutrients and their using strategy among cyanobacteria in triggering the succession of diazotrophic to non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria. In this study, we investigated in situ responses of cyanobactria to ambient P status during the transition from Dolichospermum flos-aquae to Microcystis spp. in Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu. While dominant in phytoplankton community, D. fibsaquae experienced P deficiency as evidenced by qualitative detection of extracellular phosphatase via enzyme labeled fluorescence (ELF). The percentage of ELF-labelled D. fios-aquae cells was 33% when it dominated the phytoplankton community, and was 78% when it co-dominated with Microcystis spp., indicating an increase in P deficiency. Meanwhile, no ELF-labelled Microcystis cells were observed while polyphosphate body (PPB) were present, suggesting that Microcystis spp. were not P deficient. Additionally, the percentages of Microcystis cells containing PPB showed an inverted "U-shaped" relationship with concentrations on soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). To validate the field observation, a laboratory study of the monocultures of the dominant cyanobacteria was conducted. Extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) and PPB accumulation were regulated by P availability in monocultures of D. flos-aquae. Interestingly, no cell bound extracellular phosphatase was found on Microcystis aeruginasa even in the culture without P supply. Consistently, the expressions of phosphatase encoding gene phoX showed no differences among the treatments. The way in which PPB accumulation occurred in Microcystis spp. in response to P availability in the cultures was similar to that observed in the field, demonstrating a strategy of energy conservation over P accumulation. The competitive advantage of Microcystis spp. was displayed at low P concentrations: where it could rapidly uptake and store inorganic P, which also increased the P deficiency of the coexisting phytoplankton species. Responses of P-transport gene pstS confirmed this hypothesis. The physiological and molecular mechanisms mentioned above enable Microcystis to survive and proliferate in environment with low available P supply more efficiently. In conclusion, different cyanobacterial species have distinct ways of responding to P availability, suggesting that the control of cyanobacterial blooms by targeted nutrient reduction is largely dependent upon the dominant species. P reduction is more effective in controlling diazotrophic cyanobacteria than non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria.

AB The proximity of coral reefs to coastal urban areas and shipping lanes predisposes corals to petroleum pollution from multiple sources. Previous research has evaluated petroleum toxicity to coral using a variety of methodology, including monitoring effects of acute and chronic spills, in situ exposures, and ex situ exposures with both adult and larval stage corals. Variability in toxicant, bioassay conditions, species and other methodological disparities between studies prevents comprehensive conclusions regarding the toxicity of hydrocarbons to corals. Following standardized protocols and quantifying the concentration and composition of toxicant will aid in comparison of results between studies and extrapolation to actual spills.

AB A member of the cyanobacterial genus Cylindrospermopsis Seenayya et Subba Raju (Order Nostocales) invaded Lake Kinneret (Israel) in 1998. Since then it has been found in the water column nearly every summer, initially at low concentrations, but since 2003 it formed major summer blooms. The goals of the present study were to identify the invading species based on its morphology, annual life cycle, toxicity, genetic markers, and its phylogeny, and to examine its range of morphological variability. Cell counts, allometric measurements, and filament morphology were determined on samples collected weekly from a mid-lake station throughout 2005. Akinetes, heterocytes, filament end types, cellular contents, and the annual cycle of filament morphology were described, supporting the identification as Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya et Subba Raju. Cells had many small, few large, or no dark granules presumed to be polyphosphate bodies. Filament fragmentation was observed and six types of filament ends were described. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and ITS-L DNA fragment from a laboratory isolate of the cyanobacterium also confirmed the identification as C. raciborskii. Biomass of this species collected from Lake Kinneret during a bloom did not show toxicity in Artemia bioassays, and the toxin cylindrospermopsin was not detected in a methanolic extract of the isolate. Genetic examination indicated that C. raciborskii from Lake Kinneret lacked the cyrJ component of the cylindrospermopsin synthase cluster and, thereby, was incapable of producing the toxin. Due to the morphological plasticity of this species, the identification of C. raciborskii from Lake Kinneret was not straight forward and required taking multiple approaches, including microscopic observations over a full annual cycle, culture isolation, and molecular taxonomy.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in the biomass of four functional groups of coral reef algae (canopy algae, foliose algae, turf algae and crustose corallines) was investigated in the southern Red Sea. This region is characterised by extremely high summer temperatures (ca. 35 degrees C). Strong seasonal shifts in the relative contribution of each group to the total macroalgal biomass were observed. On the reef flat, canopy and foliose algae dominated in winter, retaining low biomass in summer. On the fore reef, crustose corallines accounted for most of the macroalgal biomass throughout the year. Turf algae contributed least to the total biomass in all reef zones; biomass peaks shifted from midsummer on the inner reef flat to winter in the deeper zones. Biomass correlated negatively with seawater temperature in most groups, but the correlation was positive for turf algae on the shallow reef flat. We hypothesise both direct and indirect effects of the strong seasonality.

AB Translocation is an important tool for the conservation of species that have suffered severe range reductions. The success of a translocation should be measured not only by the survival of released animals, but by the reproductive output of individuals and hence the establishment of a self-sustaining population. The bridled nailtail wallaby is an endangered Australian macropod that suffered an extensive range contraction to a single remaining wild population. A translocated population was established and subsequently monitored over a four year period. The aim of this study was to measure the reproductive success of released males using genetic tools and to determine the factors that predicted reproductive success. Captive-bred and wild-caught animals were released and we found significant variation in male reproductive success among release groups. Variation in reproductive success was best explained by individual male weight, survival and release location rather than origin. Only 26% of candidate males were observed to sire an offspring during the study. The bridled nailtail wallaby is a sexually dimorphic, polygynous macropod and reproductive success is skewed toward large males. Males over 5800 g were six times more likely to sire an offspring than males below this weight. This study highlights the importance of considering mating system when choosing animals for translocation. Translocation programs for polygynous species should release a greater proportion of females, and only release males of high breeding potential. By maximizing the reproductive output of released animals, conservation managers will reduce the costs of translocation and increase the chance of successfully establishing a self-sustaining population.

AB The reproductive biology of the gregarious Mediterranean vermetid gastropod Dendropoma petraeum (Mollusca: Gastropoda) has been studied in the south-eastern coast of Spain. It apparently is a gonochoristic species with the sex ratio biased toward females (71%). A broad peak of more intense reproductive activity occurs in spring months and an inactive reproductive period during winter. The gonad of the males develops about two months before those of females, and storage of sperm by females has been observed. Internal fertilization takes place after the capture of pelagic spermatophores.
   The egg capsules lie free within the female mantle cavity, and females brood up to 86 capsules simultaneously (the highest number reported for any vermetid gastropod). The size of the capsules is somewhat variable and increases slightly from those containing first stages of development (mean = 678 x 579 mu m) to those containing late stages (mean = 996 x 693 mu m). Each egg capsule usually contains a single large egg or embryo, but sometimes two (8.2% of the capsules) or rarely three (0.24%). Production of egg capsules by females seems to be continuous throughout the reproductive period (from March to October).
   The unsegmented eggs measure from 440 to 507 mu m in diameter (man = 482) and are the largest reported for any vermetid gastropod. Nurse eggs are not present, and therefore most of the intracapsular nutrition comes from the internal yolk of the embryo.
   Development is lecithotrophic without a pelagic larval phase. The late intracapsular veliger stage metamorphoses within the capsule and hatching occurs at a crawling juvenile stage. The crawling young snails spend a short time (a few hours) until attachment, and no growth of the shell has been noted during this short period. The protoconch of the hatchlings measures from 680 to 900 mu m in length.

AB Coral reefs in the northern Gulf of Eilat are exposed to continuous man-made disturbances, resulting in decreased coral coverage and reduced recruitment at the Nature Reserve of Eilat. The construction of artificial reefs on sandy bottoms is a possible option to decrease diving pressure on natural reefs. In the present study we tested this hypothesis by submerging an experimental artificial reef anchored to the bottom at 18 m depth and floated vertically 3 m below water surface. The reef was composed of PVC plates, attached both vertically and horizontally along a wire. Propagules of two coral species, the stony coral Stylophora pistillata and the soft coral Dendronephthya hemprichi, were transplanted to this artificial reef. Planulae of S. pistillata were obtained during the breeding season, seeded in petri dishes in the laboratory and after 2 wk the dishes were transferred to the experimental artificial reef. Automized fragments of D. hemprichi which had previously settled on 10 x 10 cm PVC plates were transplanted onto the experimental artificial reef. The survivorship of the transplanted D. hemprichi colonies was significantly higher on the lower sides of shallower plates. Survivorship of S. pistillata colonies increased with depth when located on the vertical plates, or on the upper sides of the horizontal plates. The highest survivorship of this coral was on the vertical plates and on the upper sides of the horizontal plates, while very low survivorship was recorded on the lower sides. The results indicate that vertical artificial surfaces offer the optimal biotic and abiotic conditions for the survival of the two examined corals. The vertical plates are characterized by low sedimentation rates, low coverage of turf-algae, minimal grazing by sea urchins and absence of the competitor tunicate Didemnum sp. In addition, the vertical orientation of the experimental plates reduces shading and offers the required light intensity for zooxanthellate corals such as S. pistillata. Only a few studies to date have tried to implement artificial reefs in a coral reef environment. The results of the present study indicate the potential of enhancing recruitment of corals by transplantation of juvenile recruits onto appropriate artificial structures. Maximal survivorship of these recruits is dependent upon the structural features of the artificial reef, which should offer optimal conditions.

The growth rate of the predator depends upon predation on the modeled and alternate prey; this formulation provides greater realism in describing marine piscivores, such as spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), than two-species predator-prey models. Two stable equilibria separated by a saddle point potentially exist for the predator-prey system, and stochastic variability can lead to movement between equilibrium abundance levels. In addition, endogenous limit cycles may exist in the presence of predator fishing mortality. The model is applied to the predation of spiny dogfish on a representative groundfish species, the Georges Bank haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). Stochastic variability is input to the model in the form of ''red noise'' (variance is a decreasing function of frequency), a feature observed in marine environments. Predator abundance can increase when the modeled prey abundance is low, due to consumption of alternate prey, consistent with the pattern observed in the spiny dogfish-haddock abundances. Increased harvesting on the predator species allows the prey species to spend a greater proportion of time at the high equilibrium. The model presented here poses the interesting management problem of finding the optimal combination of fishing mortality rates for the two species.

AB Geographic variation iri body size and sexual dimorphism, as determined by measurements of condylo-basal length, was investigated in the sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) and the squirrel glider (P. norfolcensis). Correlation and multiple regression analyses were employed to determine whether geographic or climatic variables accounted for more of this size variation. The effects of age and sex were removed from analyses prior to applying statistical techniques. Numerous geographic and climatic variables were correlated with size variation in both species. Both species followed a clinal change in body size consistent with Bergmann's rule (i.e. both species were larger in the south of their ranges where temperatures are colder). One geographic variable, latitude, and three climatic variables representing temperature, precipitation and seasonality, were then selected for multiple regression analyses. Latitude accounted for more of this size variation (20-28%) in P. breviceps than climatic variables in four multiple regression models (considering two age and two sex classes). This result indicated that an isolation-by-distance model was operating in this species which was attributed to the oceanic barriers between the Australian mainland and New Guinea and Tasmania, causing genetic differentiation between isolated populations. Once latitude was removed from the analyses, temperature accounted for more of the variation (18-24%) in body size in three regressions, whilst precipitation (11%) contributed significantly to the remaining model. This result was interpreted as an adaptation to ambient temperature following Bergmann's rule. When using both geographic and climatic variables, latitude accounted for more size variation (47-69%) than climatic variables in two regressions for P. norfolcensis, whilst seasonality accounted for more variation (26-46%) in the remaining two regressions. When latitude was excluded From the analyses, seasonality (body size decreases with increasing seasonality) accounted for more variation in size in three of four regressions (26-46%), whilst precipitation (60%) accounted for the most variation in the fourth regression. These findings for P. norfolcensis suggested that large body size may be an advantage in aseasonal environments where climates and therefore foods are less predictable. Latitude and precipitation both contributed significantly to the degree of sexual dimorphism exhibited across the range of P. breviceps, suggesting that an isolation-by-distance model and primary productivity account for some of the change in sexual dimorphism in this species. Both these variables were more important than temperature and average sexual dimorphism was greater in the tropics. The relationship with primary productivity implies that in areas where food is more abundant, males attempt to grow larger in order to enhance fighting ability for access to food and mates. In contrast, females channel extra energy towards offspring production, not body size, in order to minimise energy costs during reproduction. Character displacement did not appear to influence body size variation in the two Petaurus species.

AB Carbon standing stock distribution in the euphotic zone of Lake Kinneret and the immediate fate of primary-produced carbon are very different during late winter-early spring (with the occurrence of annual dinoflagellate bloom) than they are in late summer (when nanophytoplankton are the dominant primary producers). We used a linear programming model to construct balanced carbon flow charts for these two seasons based on measured primary productivity; on carbon standing stocks of algae, bacteria flagellates, ciliates, cladocerans, rotifers, and fish; and on data on turnover times, respiration, and grazing rates obtained in 1989. The charts were compiled to fit as closely as possible all observed and inferred estimates of carbon fluxes while simultaneously ensuring that mass balance and key biological constraints were maintained for each of the 10 compartments representing the principal biota of the Kinneret food web. We used the model to examine the extent to which individual intercompartmental flux rates were free to vary while the mass-balance and biological constraints were enforced. The model was also capable of generating different yet feasible flow-chart scenarios; it thus proved useful in suggesting alternative hypotheses concerning the role of the microbial food web in the euphotic waters of Lake Kinneret.

AB (1) Several features of the physiology of leaf expansion and the turnover and fate of leaves of two contrasting forage species were studied under continuous grazing to identify the mechanisms that control the relative performance of these species in a mixture. For this, swards of perennial rye-grass and white clover were maintained at three intensities of continuous grazing by sheep (sward surface heights of 3, 6 and 9 cm) and a heavily fertilized grass sward was maintained at 6 cm.
   (2) Grass and clover leaves appeared on average at a similar rate, but grass leaves appeared more slowly in the tall swards than in the short ones. In clover, leaf appearance was unaffected by grazing intensity but in the tall swards the leaves took longer to complete their expansion.
   (3) Growing clover leaves escaped grazing by appearing and expanding close to the soil surface, but once expanded near the top of the canopy, they were soon grazed, often in their entirety. Grass leaves were grazed earlier, often while they were still growing, but defoliation was only partial. This, and a difference in the pattern of leaf unfolding, led to differences between grass and clover in the age structure of the leaf area in the canopy.
   (4) Grass and clover also differed in their degree of investment in lamina. Ungrazed youngest expanded units of clover had a smaller proportion of lamina to total weight than grass when the total size of the unit was large (e.g. under lenient grazing). But clover had a greater specific leaf area than grass in all cases.
   (5) These findings explain how clover had an advantage over grass during summer grazing and increased its proportion in the mixture.

AB Disturbance and habitat modification by humans can alter animal movement, leading to negative impacts on fitness, survival and population viability. However, the ubiquity and nature of these impacts across diverse taxa has not been quantified. We compiled 208 studies on 167 species from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems across the globe to assess how human disturbance influences animal movement. We show that disturbance by humans has widespread impacts on the movements of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish and arthropods. More than two-thirds of 719 cases represented a change in movement of 20% or more, with increases in movement averaging 70% and decreases -37%. Disturbance from human activities, such as recreation and hunting, had stronger impacts on animal movement than habitat modification, such as logging and agriculture. Our results point to a global restructuring of animal movement and emphasize the need to reduce the negative impacts of humans on animal movement.

AB Recent work has indicated that tropical forest and savanna can be alternative stable states under a range of climatic conditions. However, dynamical systems theory suggests that in case of strong spatial interactions between patches of forest and savanna, a boundary between both states is only possible at conditions in which forest and savanna are equally stable, called the 'Maxwell point.' Frequency distributions of MODIS tree-cover data at 250 m resolution were used to estimate such Maxwell points with respect to the amount and seasonality of rainfall in both South America and Africa. We tested on a 0.5 degrees scale whether there is a larger probability of local coexistence of forests and savannas near the estimated Maxwell points. Maxwell points for South America and Africa were estimated at 1760 and 1580 mm mean annual precipitation and at Markham's Seasonality Index values of 50 and 24 %. Although the probability of local coexistence was indeed highest around these Maxwell points, local coexistence was not limited to the Maxwell points. We conclude that critical transitions between forest and savanna may occur when climatic changes exceed a critical value. However, we also conclude that spatial interactions between patches of forest and savanna may reduce the hysteresis that can be observed in isolated patches, causing more predictable forest-savanna boundaries than continental-scale analyses of tree cover indicate. This effect could be less pronounced in Africa than in South America, where the forest-savanna boundary is substantially affected by rainfall seasonality.

AB Improving the realism of spatially explicit demographic models is important for better inferring the history of past populations and for understanding the genetic bases of adaptation and speciation. One particular type of demographic event to take into account is long-distance dispersal (LDD). The goals of this study are to explore the impact of various levels of LDD on genetic diversity and to show to what extent LDD levels can be correctly inferred from multilocus data sets using an approximate Bayesian computation approach. We therefore incorporated LDD into a 2D stepping stone forward simulation framework coupled to a coalescent backward simulation step to generate genetic diversity at 100 microsatellite markers under various demographic conditions relevant to recent human evolution. Our results confirm that LDD considerably increases genetic diversity within demes and decreases levels of diversity between demes. By controlling the spatial occurrence of LDD, it appears that LDD events occurring during a phase of range expansion into new territories are more important in maintaining genetic diversity than those occurring in the wake of the expansion or when colonization is over. We also show that it is possible to infer whether LDD has occurred during a range expansion, but our results suggest that one can only approximately estimate the extent of LDD based on genetic summary statistics.

AB As the world population continues to grow and as global urbanization continues to unfold, our ecosystems and landscapes will be increasingly domesticated and designed. Developing and maintaining sustainable landscapes have become one of the most challenging and imperative tasks for scientists and stakeholders of all sorts. To accomplish this task, landscape ecology and landscape architecture can and must play a critical role. Landscape architects intentionally modify and create landscapes, and their imprints and influences are pervasive and profound, far beyond the physical limits of the designed landscapes. As an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary enterprise that integrates the science and art of studying and influencing the relationship between spatial pattern and ecological processes, the theory, methods, and applications of landscape ecology are directly relevant to sustainability. However, neither landscape ecology nor landscape architecture is likely to achieve its expected goal if they are not truly integrated to produce a sustainable landscape architecture. In this paper, we argue that the ancient Chinese philosophy of "unity of man with nature" and its associated design principles can provide useful guidelines for this integration as well as for the development of a sustainable landscape architecture. We discuss several principles and models of Chinese landscape architecture, including "unity of man with nature" philosophy, "peach blossom spring" ideal, "world-in-a-pot" model, and Feng-Shui theory, and their implications for developing a sustainable landscape architecture. Although differences in the philosophical roots and design traditions between Eastern and Western landscape architecture will continue to exist, interactions and integration between the two will continue to increase under the theme of sustainability. To promote the translation of scientific knowledge into practice, we urge landscape ecologists to work proactively with landscape architects to integrate pattern-process-scale and holistic perspectives into the design and planning of landscapes.

AB The study described in this paper developed a model of animal movement, which explicitly recognised each individual as the central unit of measure. The model was developed by learning from a real dataset that measured and calculated, for individual cows in a herd, their linear and angular positions and directional and angular speeds. Two learning algorithms were implemented: a Hidden Markov model (HMM) and a long-term prediction algorithm. It is shown that a HMM can be used to describe the animal's movement and state transition behaviour within several "stay" areas where cows remained for long periods. Model parameters were estimated for hidden behaviour states such as relocating, foraging and bedding. For cows' movement between the "stay" areas a long-term prediction algorithm was implemented. By combining these two algorithms it was possible to develop a successful model, which achieved similar results to the animal behaviour data collected. This modelling methodology could easily be applied to interactions of other animal species. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, a dynamic simulation model is presented, designed to add to the understanding of commercial livestock-grass-soil systems and, especially, the processes of desertification due to overgrazing. The model has two key innovative features: (i) the joint dynamic treatment of the three mentioned stock variables and (ii) the consideration of livestock dynamics determined by economic variables. The main possible behaviours of the resulting three-dimensional system are presented and it is shown that there are significant differences with respect to the subsystem constrained to livestock and grasses as considered in the literature to date. After analysing the model qualitatively, we are able to propose some early warning indicators of the risk of long-term desertification due to overgrazing. In this article, we illustrate the use of those indicators in three hypothetical, yet likely extensive livestock farming scenarios in Spain. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We examined the effects of seed size on patch use and diet selection for three co-existing Negev Desert granivores: Allenby's gerbil (Gerbillus allenbyi), greater Egyptian sand gerbil (Gerbillus pyramidum). and crested lark (Galerida cristata). We manipulated size and spatial distribution of seeds in experimental food patches and quantified foraging behavior by measuring giving-up densities (GUDs: the amount of food remaining in a resource patch following exploitation by a forager). In one experiment, we presented small (< 1.4 mm in diameter cracked wheat). medium (2.0-3.3 mm), and large (> 3.4 mm) seeds in separate trays; in a second, we presented small and medium seeds separately and mixed together. Gerbils had a higher handling lime efficiency on smaller seeds, but a much higher encounter probability on larger seeds (20 times higher on large than medium seeds, and 2-5 times higher on medium than small seeds). This led gerbils to have significantly lower GUDs on larger seeds than smaller seeds and to harvest a higher proportion of the larger seeds. When presented with rich and poor patches G. allenbyi tended to equalize GUDs in both patches, indicating a quitting harvest rate rule For patch exploitation. In contrast. larks appeared to use a fixed time rule for patch exploitation. For larks, seed size did not influence encounter probabilities, and they showed no seed-size selectivity. Still, larks had higher handling efficiencies on smaller than larger seeds, and consequently had a significantly lower GUD on small than medium seeds. Despite large differences between the gerbils and larks in their foraging, our results do not support species coexistence via seed-size partitioning: the larks had much higher GUDs than the gerbils on all seed sizes. Nonetheless, seed size, seed abundance, seed distribution and the animal's patch use behavior all played major roles in determining gerbils' and larks' diet selectivities and GUDs.

AB It has been suggested that lower rates of granivory in South American warm deserts compared to their Noah American counterparts arose from a reduction of seed reserves in the former owing to the extinction of argyrolagid marsupials. We measured seed reserves in two habitats of the central Monte Desert in an attempt to detect such seed decline, but to no avail. After moderate rainfall, maximum seed standing crops reached 16,000 and 23,000 seeds m(-2) in shrublands and open forests, respectively. Under the canopy of trees and shrubs there were 19,000 and 37,000 seeds m(-2); whereas in exposed areas there were c. 10,000 seeds m(-2) in both habitats. Seed banks in other South American semi-arid areas showed similar values. Total grass seeds as well as those presumably preferred by ants also seem to be similar in both continents. Hence, granivory in South America, as has been already reported for Australia, is lower than in North America in spite of the great similarity of seed bank sizes. Moreover, argyrolagids were unlikely seed-hoarding granivores, therefore some other reason than argyrolagid extinction should be sought to explain the lack of specialized seed-eating mammals, and the smaller overall seed consumption rates in South American deserts.

AB Coral assemblages in northern Safaga Bay, Red Sea, Egypt, are qualitatively described. Nine distinct assemblages were found, which correspond to quantitatively defined community types previously described from the area off Hurghada, northern Red Sea. Their distribution within northern Safaga Bay was mapped. Strong gradient and/or steep relief assemblages were: Acropora assemblage on windward (exposed) reefs, Porites assemblage on leeward (sheltered) reefs, Millepora assemblage on current exposed reefs, Stylophora assemblage on reef flats. Low gradient and/or low relief assemblages were: Acropora dominated coral patches in areas of good circulation to a depth of 15 m, Stylophora/Acropora coral patch assemblages in shallow sheltered environments, faviid carpet in low relief areas between 10 and 25 m which with increasing turbidity turns into a depauperate faviid carpet, Porites carpet in low relief areas between 5 and 15 m with clearest water, Sarcophyton carpet in low relief areas wi th high suspension load, platy scleractinian assemblage in deeper water (>25 m) with low light intensity. The distribution of coral assemblages depends basically on 1) topography 2) hydrodynamics 3) light and 4) suspension load.

AB This paper sets out that the dynamics of the Sahelian rangeland vegetation can be interpreted as a cusp catastrophe and that this interpretation offers a promising basis for the description and analysis of this ecosystem,
   Firstly, an existing scheme of the dynamics of Sahelian herbaceous vegetation is translated into the state-and-transition formulation, Secondly, the application of the cusp catastrophe is explored by studying the behaviour of the Sahelian rangeland ecosystem under changing effective rainfall and grazing intensity, using the transitions from the state-and-transition formulation as vectors along the cusp manifold, This conceptual cusp catastrophe model subsequently results in the identification of hypotheses and the detection of 5 catastrophic properties of this ecosystem (bimodality, inaccessibility, sudden jumps, divergence and hysteresis) that have important management implications,
   The continuous and the discontinuous processes occurring in the Sahelian rangeland ecosystem can both be captured in a unified conceptual model by applying the cusp catastrophe theory, Testing the hypotheses generated by the conceptual model and searching for additional catastrophic properties, such as divergence of linear response and critical slowing down, is a useful direction for future research.

AB The seed banks of deserts typically show a high degree of spatial variability. We examined the influence of the western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, on the spatial heterogeneity of soil seeds in the semi-arid shrub-steppe of south-western Wyoming. Seeds were sampled in the foraging areas of three ant colonies over 2 years, primarily to assess the distribution of seeds with respect to harvester ant nests and foraging trails. In 1989, seed densities varied at the smallest spatial scale sampled - the microhabitat (undershub vs. interspace). In 1990, seed densities varied at the largest spatial scale sampled - the colony foraging area. Seed abundance varied temporally in both years. Harvester ants affected the patterns of seed density in two ways. First, seed numbers in 1989 were higher in interspace areas away from foraging trails than in interspace areas near them, indicating that trails restrict colony search effort. Second, and contrary to our expectations, seed numbers in 1990 were higher near harvester ant nests than in surrounding areas. This difference was attributable to higher densities of the alien annual grass Bromus tectorum and suggests that harvester ants indirectly facilitate B. tectorum near their nests.

AB Female kentish plovers Charadrius alexandrinus typically desert their broods after the chicks hatch, i.e. 1-4 weeks before the chicks fledge or become independent. In this paper we investigate the costs and benefits of desertion for females. Desertion incurs a cost for females: following desertion chick survival in broods is lower (0.95 +/- 0.02 day(-1)) than before the female deserts (0.98 +/- 0.01 day(-1)). We investigated several possible causes for reduced brood survival by comparing characteristics of broods before and after desertion (controlling for differences in brood age). After desertion males increased the time they spent foraging and they tended to reduce time spent brooding chicks. Increased mortality of chicks may occur in deserted broods because following desertion (1) males spend less time alert in vigilance behaviour than before desertion, (2) they attend the chicks from greater distances, and (3) they show greater distraction display distances (in response to human intruders). Growth or development of chicks, measured by weight gain and tarsus length, was not different before and after desertion. Females gain two potential benefits from desertion: (1) they may remate and produce a second brood within the same breeding season or (2) they may enhance their probability of surviving to breed in a subsequent season. At least 27% of female kentish plovers that deserted remated and renested in the same season in this study. In contrast, we found no evidence that brood desertion increased the survival of females: there was no difference in local survival rate (return rate) for females deserting before or after 6 days brood age. These results clearly demonstrate that female kentish plovers that desert their offspring prior to fledging incur costs, but we suggest that there is a trade-off with the potential benefits gained by remating and making a second breeding attempt in the same season.

AB Spatial self-organization of dryland vegetation constitutes one of the most promising indicators for an ecosystem's proximity to desertification. This insight is based on studies of reaction- diffusion models that reproduce visual characteristics of vegetation patterns observed on aerial photographs. However, until now, the development of reliable early warning systems has been hampered by the lack of more in-depth comparisons between model predictions and real ecosystem patterns. In this paper, we combined topographical data, (remotely sensed) optical data, and in situ biomass measurements from two sites in Somalia to generate a multilevel description of dryland vegetation patterns. We performed an in-depth comparison between these observed vegetation pattern characteristics and predictions made by the extended-Klausmeier model for dryland vegetation patterning. Consistent with model predictions, we found that for a given topography, there is multistability of ecosystem states with different pattern wavenumbers. Furthermore, observations corroborated model predictions regarding the relationships between pattern wavenumber, total biomass, and maximum biomass. In contrast, model predictions regarding the role of slope angles were not corroborated by the empirical data, suggesting that inclusion of small-scale topographical heterogeneity is a promising avenue for future model development. Our findings suggest that patterned dryland ecosystems may be more resilient to environmental change than previously anticipated, but this enhanced resilience crucially depends on the adaptive capacity of vegetation patterns.

AB Coastal reefs are highly diverse marine ecosystems that in many regions suffer today from growing pressures by human activities. Among the most highly-stressed are those found in the Levantine basin (south-eastern Mediterranean Sea). The Levant represents the trailing-edge of distribution of native species where they are exposed to the most extreme temperature and salinity conditions, and the region is also fast-warming and exposed to a great many alien species and strong fishing pressure. In this study, the ecological state of reefs in the south-eastern Levant was assessed quantitatively (including inside a small marine reserve) using current, extensive, survey data with reference to anecdotal historical information on their more pristine past. 0002The results of very extensive subtidal community surveys that were conducted in north Israel indicate that reefs in this area are currently dominated by turf-forming algae and aliens, and sustain low numbers of top predators. Specifically, it was found that on these Levant reefs: (1) commercial species represent a very small part of the fish assemblage (except inside the reserve); (2) alien species constitute a considerable portion (23-44%) of the fish assemblage (including in the reserve) and 95-99% of epi-benthic molluscs, including inside the marine reserve; and (3) turf barrens are the dominant substrate cover, while cover of native brown algae canopy is limited to small patches occurring only during winter and spring. 0003These findings suggest that the Levant reefs have been highly transformed by overfishing and alien invasions, and probably also climate change, and that even well managed marine reserves had little effect on alien species presence. From a biogeographic-conservation perspective, as both warming and bioinvasions continue in the Mediterranean, it is expected that this degraded reef state will gradually advance westward. Alleviating fishing pressure with marine reserves might make the reefs more resilient to these regional pressures, but alien invaders will remain a dominant feature in the system. Therefore, a more realistic conservation target might be the preservation or restoration of ecosystem functions rather than the original native biodiversity.

AB Despite extensive research on the topic, it has been difficult to reach general conclusions as to the effects of climate change on morphology in wild animals: in particular, the effects of warming temperatures have been associated with increases, decreases or stasis in body size in different populations. Here, we use a fine-scale analysis of associations between weather and offspring body size in a long-term study of a wild passerine bird, the cooperatively breeding superb fairy-wren, in south-eastern Australia to show that such variation in the direction of associations occurs even within a population. Over the past 26years, our study population has experienced increased temperatures, increased frequency of heatwaves and reduced rainfall - but the mean body mass of chicks has not changed. Despite the apparent stasis, mass was associated with weather across the previous year, but in multiple counteracting ways. Firstly, (i) chick mass was negatively associated with extremely recent heatwaves, but there also positive associations with (ii) higher maximum temperatures and (iii) higher rainfall, both occurring in a period prior to and during the nesting period, and finally (iv) a longer-term negative association with higher maximum temperatures following the previous breeding season. Our results illustrate how a morphological trait may be affected by both short- and long-term effects of the same weather variable at multiple times of the year and that these effects may act in different directions. We also show that climate within the relevant time windows may not be changing in the same way, such that overall long-term temporal trends in body size may be minimal. Such complexity means that analytical approaches that search for a single best' window for one particular weather variable may miss other relevant information, and is also likely to make analyses of phenotypic plasticity and prediction of longer-term population dynamics difficult.

AB Understanding how and why biodiversity is structured across the globe has been central to ecology, evolution, and biogeography even before those disciplines took their modern forms. Three global-scale patterns in particular have been the focus of research and debate for decades: latitudinal gradients in species richness (richness decreases with increasing latitude), body size (body size increases with increasing latitude in endotherms; Bergmann's rule), and geographic range size (range size increases with increasing latitude; Rapoport's rule). Despite decades of study, the generality and robustness of these trends have been debated, as have their underlying causes. Here we investigate latitudinal gradients in species richness, body size, and range size in the world's turtles (Testudines), and add more evidence that these rules do not seem to apply across all taxa. We show that turtle diversity actually peaks at 25 degrees north, a highly unusual global pattern. Turtles also fail to follow Bergmann's Rule, and may show the converse (larger at lower latitudes), though trends are weak. Turtles also show a complex relationship between latitude and range size that does not directly follow Rapoport's rule. Body size and geographic range size are significantly correlated, and multiple abiotic and biotic variables help explain the relationships between latitude and species diversity, body size, and range size. Although we show that turtles do not strictly follow some classic biogeographical rules, we also call for further in-depth research to investigate potential causal mechanisms for these atypical patterns.

AB Recently, major advances in the climate-zooplankton interface have been made some of which appeared to receive much attention in a broader audience of ecologists as well. In contrast to the marine realm, however, we still lack a more holistic summary of recent knowledge in freshwater. We discuss climate change-related variation in physical and biological attributes of lakes and running waters, high-order ecological functions, and subsequent alteration in zooplankton abundance, phenology, distribution, body size, community structure, life history parameters, and behavior by focusing on community level responses. The adequacy of large-scale climatic indices in ecology has received considerable support and provided a framework for the interpretation of community and species level responses in freshwater zooplankton. Modeling perspectives deserve particular consideration, since this promising stream of ecology is of particular applicability in climate change research owing to the inherently predictive nature of this field. In the future, ecologists should expand their research on species beyond daphnids, should address questions as to how different intrinsic and extrinsic drivers interact, should move beyond correlative approaches toward more mechanistic explanations, and last but not least, should facilitate transfer of biological data both across space and time.

The model extends previous work modeling grazing as a predator-prey relationship. Attention is given to profit maximizing decisions when growing season precipitation is unknown. Comparisons are made across results from a model that utilizes constant growing season precipitation in all years. Results suggest that optimal stocking rates and profitability decrease in climate change scenarios with increased precipitation variability as compared to the historical stochastic weather scenario.

   BEHAVIOR
AB Novel concepts and tools to promote progress in grazing science and management need to incorporate heterogeneity and nonlinear scaling of spatially and temporally distributed ecological interactions such as diet selection, defoliation, and plant growth. Traditional grazing management factors are number of animals, species and category of animals, spatial distribution of forage demand, and temporal distribution of forage demand. These traditional methods have been based on a paradigm that is static, assumes equilibrium conditions, and does not consider scaling issues, neither in time nor in space. Three related issues that can contribute to the progress in the understanding and management of grazing systems are spatial heterogeneity, event-driven dynamics, and scaling effects. Spatial heterogeneity of species and defoliation determine pasture stability by modulating competition and response to heterogeneous defoliation. When pasture species are well mixed, livestock are less able to select their preferred diet. When species are separated into larger and more easily identifiable patches, the selected diet approaches the preferred one. Simultaneously, patchiness in pasture components and redistribution of nutrients by grazing can lend global compositional stability to grass-clover pastures. Grazing at high animal density can be studied using the paradigm of event-driven dynamics. Several mechanisms suggest that grazing systems should have allometric spatial and temporal scaling in addition to the well-recognized allometric scaling of food requirements with body mass. Grazing system performance should scale allometrically with pasture size because both resource distribution and animal movements frequently have fractal properties. As pasture size increases, fewer hierarchical levels of grazing behavior are constrained, and the new spatial patterns introduce nonlinearity in the response to pasture size. Operant conditioning of foraging behavior, conditioned aversions, plant spatial pattern, pasture size and shape, timing and duration of grazing periods, and number of animals are discussed as precision tools to manage grazing systems.

AB Aim This study aims to evaluate the relative importance of birds, small mammals, and ants as seed predators at a semi-arid site in northern Chile.
   Location Northern Chile, in Parque Nacional Bosque Fray Jorge (30degrees41' N, 71degrees40' W, c. 80 m elevation).
   Methods We studied the relative abilities of birds, small mammals, and ants to find and remove millet seeds either singly (i.e. background seed removal) or in bulk. Single seeds were set in shallow depressions in Plexiglas trays which were established in long and arbitrary transects, and were available either to birds (diurnally) or small mammals (nocturnally) or were covered by hardware cloth and therefore available only to ants. Bulk removal was evaluated with seeds in Petri dishes that also were established in long and arbitrary transects, and trays were either open diurnally (birds) or nocturnally (small mammals); a third set of trays was covered with hardware cloth cages to excluded vertebrates, and ants were given access to Petri dishes with twigs that were arranged across the edge of the dishes. All experiments lasted four days and nights, and trays and dishes were checked and replenished as needed in the morning and evening. In the former study vertebrate consumption was determined as the mean number of seeds removed from trays (within a given transect) minus the number removed from ant-only trays. Because ants were rarely seen in vertebrate access Petri dishes, however, we did not correct consumption there. Treatments were compared using repeated measures mixed model analysis of variance. In addition to evaluating patterns within this community, we compared our results against those obtained in similar studies in various arid regions.
   Results Diurnal seed consumption was significantly greater than nocturnal seed consumption, which in turn was significantly greater than consumption by ants. Diurnal consumption was highly seasonal, evidently corresponding to the seasonal arrival and departure of migratory birds. In general, South American sites exhibit much lower levels of seed predation than sites in the northern hemisphere, but removal at our site appears to be much greater and more strongly avian-dominated than at other sites in South America. Our results are consistent with predictions based on a hypothesis relating precipitation to seed predictability.
   Main conclusions Both birds and small mammals were much more important seed consumers at our site than elsewhere in South America, whereas ants have been relatively unimportant at all South American sites studied to date. Although the dominant seed consumers differ across sites, overall levels of seed removal appear similar in South America and Australia, and substantially lower than reported from sites in the northern hemisphere and Africa.

AB Several recent studies suggest that community composition can take on alternate, apparently stable, states. For the most part, these studies are observational in nature and have not shown that alternate states arise from the order of species arrival during community assembly. Previous studies also provide little insight into the mechanisms that create alternate states, especially when direct species interactions, rather than environmental feedback, control their formation. We conducted experiments in identical physical environments to show that differences in the sequence of community assembly can create alternate species compositions that persist for many generations. Assembly sequence determined whether experimental food webs contained a single intraguild predator, or two intraguild predators. When the intraguild predator, Blepharisma americanum, became established in communities before the introduction of Tetraltymena vorax, combined effects of resource depletion and intraguild predation prevented the establishment of Tetrahymena. In contrast, when Tetrahymena preceded Blepharisma, both species frequently coexisted. Supporting experiments describe the exploitative competitive abilities of both intraguild predators, document the population dynamics of each species in less complex community modules, and determine the ability of Tetrahymena to invade Blepharisma cultures in the absence of competing prey. These results show that both competition and predation contribute to the formation of two alternate community states and confirm that one stable state resists transformation to the other.

AB Wyeomyia smithii mosquitoes distribute their eggs across available oviposition sites (water-holding pitcher plant leaves) of varying quality.  I experimentally examined responses to three components of site quality:  conspecific larval density, larval density of the pitcher plant midge, Metriocnemus knabi, and pitcher size.  Responses to larval treatments were complex and apparently suboptimal.  Although mosquito larval performance is better in leaves with fewer conspecific and more midge larvae, females did not lay more eggs in such pitchers.  Instead, more eggs were laid in experimental pitchers containing either midge or mosquito larvae, but fewer eggs in pitchers with neither or both.  More eggs were laid in larger pitchers, which tend to accumulate more resources and dry out less often.  Therefore, although the oviposition decisions made were suboptimal, they were better than random.

ID MATING SYSTEM; EGG SIZE; BIRDS; SURVIVAL; BEHAVIOR; MATE
AB We studied the clutch-size distribution of Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus in 1991 and 1992 and tested three hypotheses for determination of clutch-size: egg-formation ability of females, incubation ability of parents and nest predation. Variation in clutch-size was small: 71 out of 74 clutches had three eggs (coeff. var. = 7%). Females spent more time foraging (51 +/- 6%) pre-laying and during egg-laying than their mates (39 +/-5%). However, we concluded that egg-formation was not constrained by food availability because 77% and 100% of clutches were initiated before the peaks of prey density and of prey mass, respectively. Furthermore, the number of clutches initiated and completed over time was unrelated to prey density. By experimentally reducing and enlarging clutches, we found that enlarged clutches of four eggs took longer to hatch (24.8 +/- 0.9 days) than control clutches of three (21.6 +/- 0.7 days). Eggs of enlarged clutches also lost weight more slowly during incubation in both years compared with control clutches. No difference was found in the incubation behaviour or weight loss of parents between reduced, control and enlarged clutches. We found no evidence to support the nest predation hypothesis, since neither the proportion of nests predated nor the number of chicks hatched was different between reduced, control and enlarged clutches. The results of this study are most consistent with the incubation ability hypothesis, although the parental ability hypothesis has remained untested.

AB Grasslands are the predominant forage source for grazing animals and cover more of the Earth's land than any other major vegetation type. Their values are not always recognised, and conversion to other uses is continuing at a high rate leading to greater environmental and socio-economic problems. Overgrazing is one of the main drivers of productivity decline of grasslands, reflecting the pressures from excessive human populations and a demand for food. Some 20% of the world's grasslands are in a severely degraded state; others have suffered shifts to less-desirable species. Biodiversity and greenhouse gas production have also been particular concerns. Estimates of productivity change all show a decline over recent decades, yet animal numbers continue to increase, particularly in the developing world. This paper critically reviews the projected demands for livestock products, driven largely by human population growth; the current health of the world's grasslands and how current livestock systems that depend on land conversion and overexploitation of grassland are inappropriate and need to be improved. Central to this argument is that small holders in the developing world will be responsible for a large amount of the future red meat production, and this can be achieved through more efficient livestock production systems using lower stocking rates. The Australian sheep industry is provided as an example of how livestock production and reduced environmental impacts can be achieved with improved efficiency. Changes will require smallholders to transition to a competitive, market-oriented livestock industry, which will provide challenges.

AB Regime shifts are difficult-to-reverse transitions that occur when an ecosystem reorganizes around a new set of self-reinforcing feedbacks. Regime shifts are predicted to occur when the intensity of some exogenous driver variable, such as temperature, annual harvest rate, or nutrient addition rate, gradually approaches and crosses a threshold value, initiating a transition to an alternative state. However, many driver variables now change rapidly as presses or pulses, not gradually, requiring new conceptual frameworks for understanding and predicting regime shifts. We argue that identifying and controlling regime shifts in response to presses and pulses will require a greater focus on the duration, not just the intensity, of changes in driver variables. In ecosystems with slower dynamics, transitions to an alternative state can take years to decades and as a result, a driver press with an intensity capable of resulting in a regime shift over long time spans may fail to cause a regime shift when applied for shorter durations. We illustrate these ideas using simulations of local-scale alternative stable state models and preliminary evidence from long-term grazing and eutrophication experiments. The simulations also suggest that small changes in the duration of driver presses or pulses can determine whether an ecosystem recovers to its original state. These insights may extend to larger scales. In spatially extended simulations that included patchiness, spatial heterogeneity, and spatial connectivity, all patches recovered to their original state after shorter presses. However, once press duration exceeded a threshold, growing proportions of the landscape shifted to an alternative state as press duration increased. We observed similar patchy transitions in a catchment-scale experiment that reinstated frequent fires approximately halfway through a regime shift from grassland to shrubland, initiated by fire suppression. In both the local-and larger-scale models, the threshold duration needed to elicit regime shifts decreased as press intensity increased or when factors counteracting regime shifts weakened. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that conceptualizing regime shifts as an interactive function of the intensity and duration of driver changes will increase understanding of the varying effects of driver presses, pulses, and cycles on ecosystem dynamics.

AB Bacteria play important roles in mineral weathering and soil formation. However, few reports of mineral weathering bacteria inhabiting subsurfaces of soil profiles have been published, raising the question of whether the subsurface weathering bacteria are fundamentally distinct from those in surface communities. To address this question, we isolated and characterized mineral weathering bacteria from two contrasting soil profiles with respect to their role in the weathering pattern evolution, their place in the community structure, and their depth-related changes in these two soil profiles. The effectiveness and pattern of bacterial mineral weathering were different in the two profiles and among the horizons within the respective profiles. The abundance of highly effective mineral weathering bacteria in the Changshu profile was significantly greater in the deepest horizon than in the upper horizons, whereas in the Yanting profile it was significantly greater in the upper horizons than in the deeper horizons. Most of the mineral weathering bacteria from the upper horizons of the Changshu profile and from the deeper horizons of the Yanting profile significantly acidified the culture media in the mineral weathering process. The proportion of siderophore-producing bacteria in the Changshu profile was similar in all horizons except in the Bg2 horizon, whereas the proportion of siderophore-producing bacteria in the Yanting profile was higher in the upper horizons than in the deeper horizons. Both profiles existed in different highly depth-specific culturable mineral weathering community structures. The depth-related changes in culturable weathering communities were primarily attributable to minor bacterial groups rather than to a change in the major population structure.

AB Landscape sustainability can be considered in terms of order and disorder, where order implies causality, well-defined boundaries and predictable outcomes, while disorder implies uncertain causality, shifting boundaries and often-unpredictable outcomes. We address the interplay of order and disorder in social-ecological landscapes (SELs) using spatiotemporal analysis of entropy-related indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time-series. These indices can provide insights for complex systems analysis for the evaluation of adaptive capacity in SELs. In particular, our overarching aim is to help interpret what an increase of order/disorder means with regards to SELs and the underlying drivers and causes of conditions in SELs. The approach can be used to increase spatially explicit anticipatory capability in environmental science and natural resource management based on how the system has responded to stress in the past. Such capability is crucial to address SEL adaptive capacity and for sustainable planning given that surprises may increase as a consequence of both climate change and multiple interacting anthropogenic stressors. These advancements should greatly contribute to the application of spatial resilience strategies in general, and to sustainable landscape planning in particular, and for the spatially explicit adaptive comanagement of ecosystem services.

AB We evaluated the predictive ability of a one-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model across multiple temporal scales using wavelet analysis and traditional goodness-of-fit metrics. High-frequency in situ automated sensor data and long-term manual observational data from Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, were used to parameterize, calibrate, and evaluate model predictions. We focused specifically on short-term predictions of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and phytoplankton biomass over one season. Traditional goodness-of-fit metrics indicated more accurate prediction of physics than chemical or biological variables in the time domain. This was confirmed by wavelet analysis in both the time and frequency domains. For temperature, predicted and observed global wavelet spectra were closely related, while observed dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence spectral characteristics were not reproduced by the model for key time scales, indicating that processes not modeled may be important drivers of the observed signal. Although the magnitude and timing of physical and biological changes were simulated adequately at the seasonal time scale through calibration, time scale-specific dynamics, for example short-term cycles, were difficult to reproduce, and were relatively insensitive to the effects of varying parameters. The use of wavelet analysis is novel to aquatic ecosystem modeling, is complementary to traditional goodness-of-fit metrics, and allows for assessment of variability at specific temporal scales. In this way, the effect of processes operating at distinct temporal scales can be isolated and better understood, both in situ and in silico. Wavelet transforms are particularly well suited for assessment of temporal and spatial heterogeneity when coupled to high-frequency data from automated in situ or remote sensing platforms.

AB Studies on dietary functional responses in large herbivores are traditionally conducted by following individual animals. The method is very time-consuming, and hence, typically provides only a narrow array of forage species compositions. Here we use a range level approach to look at moose (Alces alces) selectivity for and utilization of forage species in relation to availability in both summer and winter. We compare 12 Norwegian ranges representing a large scale gradient in plant communities. The most important forage species in the diet were birches (Betula spp., comprising 43% of all trees browsed in summer and 27% in winter), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia, 25% of trees browsed in summer, 37% in winter), and bilberry (Vaccinum myrtillus, 42% of herbaceous epidermal fragments in summer feces). Selectivity for birches was positively related to its availability and negatively related to availability of rowan, Salix spp., and aspen (Populus tremula) together (all more selected for than birches). Multiple regression models including availability of several forage species were thus superior to single-species models in explaining the diet content of main forage plants. Selectivity for birches was also stronger in summer than in winter, while the opposite pattern was found for rowan. The finding is relevant for our evaluation of the quality of summer and winter ranges, and hence, their relative influence on population productivity. Our study underlines the need to incorporate species composition of available forage when quantifying dietary functional responses in selective herbivores such as moose. Furthermore, care should be taken when extrapolating data on moose diet across ranges or seasons.

AB Although the planktonic community of coral reefs is dominated by picoplankton (e.g. the cyanobacterium Synechococcus), it was long believed to play only a marginal role in pelagic-benthic coupling, as its minute size (0.2 to 2.0 mu m) and negligible sinking rate render if target), unavailable for the filter-feeding reef benthos. However, scleractinian corals have been shown to continuously release mucus that functions as an efficient trap and important carrier for particulate matter within the reef ecosystem. This study investigates the trapping potential of coral mucus for picoplankton in the laboratory and in the field, Freshly released mucus of Fungia corals already contained background levels of pelagic and/or associated synechococcoid cyanobacteria (1.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)). Mesocosm experiments in flow-through tanks revealed up to 46-fold picoplankton enrichment in aged Mucus aggregates, while laboratory experiments with rotated chambers confirmed the pelagic source of these mucus enrichments. Addition of coral mucus resulted in a significant increase in clearance rates (32 to 52% h(-1)) of the initial Synechococcus spp. population compared to clearance found in non-mucus chambers (6 to 18%, h(-1)). Drilling mucus aggregates originating from Acropora corals collected in situ exhibited high Synechococcus enrichment (up to 4.6 x 10(6) cells ml(-1)) compared to the surrounding seawater (2.1 +/- 0.8 x 10(4) cells ml(-1)), indicating efficient picoplankton enrichment by 2 orders of magnitude. The ensuing rapid sedimentation (0.5 to 1 cm s(-1)) of enriched aggregates highlights the importance of coral mucus as a so far overlooked vector enhancing the flux of pelagic picoplankton to the coral reef benthos.

AB Livestock effects on plant communities through overgrazing (desertification) should affect the structure and functioning of semarid rangeland communities. We measured plant, granivorous ant and rodent communities and rates of seed removal by rodents and ants in grazed (by livestock) and ungrazed desert grasslands as well as mesquite and creosotebush shrublands to test hypotheses on the effects of grazing and desertification on ecosystem structure and functioning. In desert grasslands grazing reduced the cover of perennial grasses, particularly the dominant Bouteloua eriopoda, but the cover of forbs and shrubs did not differ between treatments. One species of perennial grass, Dasyochloa pulchellum increased in grazed grasslands compared with grassland exclosures. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that grazing caused desert grasslands to shift in community structure towards the shrublands. There were more seed harvesting ant and rodent species in the creosotebush shrublands than in the grasslands and mesquite shrublands. Grazing had no effect on the diversity of ants or rodents within grasslands, and detrended correspondence analysis revealed no clear trends in granivorous ant community structure in the grazed and unsated grasslands or the mesquite and creosotebush shrublands. Ants removed more seeds than did rodents in the grassland sites but rodents removed more seeds than did ants in the creosotebush sites and seed removal rates by rodents and ants were the same in the mesquite sites. Our data support the hypothesis that livestock grazing leads to a shift from grassland to shrubland in the Chihuahuan Desert, with associated changes in the structure and functioning of faunal communities. Because grasslands support few species and lo iv densities of rodents, seed harvesting ants are the most important granivores in these desert grasslands. On a larger scale, we therefore hypothesize that the observed dominance of rodents as seed harvesters in the Chihuahuan desert is a function of the desertification of desert grasslands to shrublands by livestock, and that associated feedback effects may complicate the regeneration of degraded communities.

AB Very little systematic information has been collected on the diets of Australian rodents in arid and semiarid regions. The information that is available is restricted generally to short periods of sampling and small sample sizes. Here we review the diets of 15 extant and one extinct species of Australian desert rodents, and provide new results of dietary analyses for (1) Leggadina forresti, Pseudomys desertor and Rattus villosissimus from the Simpson Desert, south-western Queensland, (2) P. albocinereus and P. bolami from the western goldfields of Western Australia, and (3) Notomys alexis, P. desertor and P. hermannsburgensis from the Tanami Desert, Northern Territory. Overwhelmingly, omnivory is the predominant dietary strategy, with most species (11) taking substantial amounts of invertebrate, seed and green plant material. Of the other five species, four can be considered herbivores and one a granivore. Of the four herbivores, however, one is extinct (Leporillus apicalis), one is restricted to an offshore island (Lep. conditor), while another (P. fieldi) is classified as a herbivore from a diet sample of four individuals only. Similarly, P. occidentalis is classified as a granivore on the basis of dietary sampling of two individuals alone. These findings indicate that omnivory, over and above any other dietary strategy including granivory, is predominant among rodents inhabiting Australian deserts.

AB In 1978, Mares and Rosenzweig assessed seed removal rates by granivores at a site in the northern Monte desert of Argentina, and concluded that granivory in South America is 'much depressed'. In this study, spatial and temporal patterns of seed removal by small mammals, ants, and birds in the central Monte desert were analysed, and results compared with data available from other arid zones of the world. Ants were found to be the most important granivores in spring-summer, while birds were more important in autumn-winter. No differences were found in seed removal rates between microhabitats in winter, but in the summer both ants and birds removed more seeds from under the canopy of shrubs and trees than from exposed microhabitats. The impact of ants appeared to be lower in South America than in other continents, but removal by birds at the study site was only exceeded in North America, and removal by mammals only in North America and South Africa. Results indicate that granivory in South America is not abnormally depressed. Instead, current data suggest that seed removal in North America is exceptionally high, and that low levels are actually the norm for most arid zones.

AB The larval life history characteristics of a population of wood frogs in Michigan (MI) is examined using complementary field and laboratory studies, and the results are compared to previously studied populations in Maryland (MD) and Virginia (VA). Dip-netted samples of tadpoles in populations from ponds in MI reveal that MI tadpoles grow faster, are larger at all stages including metamorphic climax, and have shorter larval periods than populations in either MD or VA. The developmental rates of MI, MD, and VA larvae did not differ in the laboratory. The faster developmental time of MI populations in the field must result from environmental factors rather than genetic differences between populations or from a complex gene x environment interaction. Michigan larvae had higher growth rates and were significantly larger at all developmental stages, including metamorphosis, than larvae from either MD or VA when raised under identical laboratory conditions. Thus a portion of the observed differences in growth rates and metamorphic size observed in the field must result from genetic differences. Michigan larvae also responded differently to the effects of population density than MD and VA larvae. Developmental time was negatively correlated with population density for MD and VA larvae, whereas population density had no effect on developmental time for MI larvae. Michigan larvae were, however, more sensitive to the effects of population density on metamorphic body size, particularly at the low density treatments. The observed geographic patterns in larval development are hypothesized to result from differences in the pattern of food production among ponds.

AB Five decades ago, a landmark paper inSciencetitledThe Cave Environmentheralded caves as ideal natural experimental laboratories in which to develop and address general questions in geology, ecology, biogeography, and evolutionary biology. Although the 'caves as laboratory' paradigm has since been advocated by subterranean biologists, there are few examples of studies that successfully translated their results into general principles. The contemporary era of big data, modelling tools, and revolutionary advances in genetics and (meta)genomics provides an opportunity to revisit unresolved questions and challenges, as well as examine promising new avenues of research in subterranean biology. Accordingly, we have developed a roadmap to guide future research endeavours in subterranean biology by adapting a well-established methodology of 'horizon scanning' to identify the highest priority research questions across six subject areas. Based on the expert opinion of 30 scientists from around the globe with complementary expertise and of different academic ages, we assembled an initial list of 258 fundamental questions concentrating on macroecology and microbial ecology, adaptation, evolution, and conservation. Subsequently, through online surveys, 130 subterranean biologists with various backgrounds assisted us in reducing our list to 50 top-priority questions. These research questions are broad in scope and ready to be addressed in the next decade. We believe this exercise will stimulate research towards a deeper understanding of subterranean biology and foster hypothesis-driven studies likely to resonate broadly from the traditional boundaries of this field.

AB Regime shifts in lake ecosystems can occur in response to both abrupt and continuous climate change, and the imprints they leave in paleolimnological records allow us to investigate and better understand patterns and processes governing ecological changes on geological time scales. This synthesis investigates paleolimnological records that display apparent regime shifts and characterizes the shifts as either smooth, threshold-like or bistable. The main drivers behind the shifts are also explored: direct climate influence on lakes, climate influence mediated through the catchment, lake ontogenetic processes and/or anthropogenic forcing. This framework helps to elucidate the relationship between driver and regime shift dynamics and the type of imprint that the associated regime shifts leaves in sediment records. Our analysis of the limited sites available (22 sites) show that smooth regime shifts are characterized with forcing and response variables acting on similar time scales, whereas regime shifts that demonstrate a threshold like response or a hysteresis response occur on shorter time scales than changes in drivers. The temporal resolution of the record, a common concern in paleo records, limits identification of the timing and rate of the regime shifts. When detected, past regime shifts offer rich opportunities to understand ecosystem responses to climate and other changes and to evaluate the mean state and natural variability of lake ecosystems on time scales of decades to millennia. There are a number of remaining challenges in understanding regime shifts and ecosystem dynamics in a paleolimnological perspective including lack of an appropriate temporal resolution and ecosystem feedback mechanisms. Combining paleoecology with contemporary studies can help clarify the scale of regime shifts and to distinguish patterns in ecosystem changes from natural variability.

AB Alternative stable states in ecology have been well studied in isolated, well-mixed systems. However, in reality, most ecosystems exist on spatially extended landscapes. Applying existing theory from dynamic systems, we explore how such a spatial setting should be expected to affect ecological resilience. We focus on the effect of local disturbances, defining resilience as the size of the area of a strong local disturbance needed to trigger a shift. We show that in contrast to well-mixed systems, resilience in a homogeneous spatial setting does not decrease gradually as a bifurcation point is approached. Instead, as an environmental driver changes, the present dominant state remains virtually 'indestructible', until at a critical point (the Maxwell point) its resilience drops sharply in the sense that even a very local disturbance can cause a domino effect leading eventually to a landscape-wide shift to the alternative state. Close to this Maxwell point the travelling wave moves very slow. Under these conditions both states have a comparable resilience, allowing long transient co-occurrence of alternative states side-by-side, and also permanent co-existence if there are mild spatial barriers. Overall however, hysteresis may mostly disappear in a spatial context as one of both alternative states will always tend to be dominant. Our results imply that local restoration efforts on a homogeneous landscape will typically either fail or trigger a landscape-wide transition. For extensive biomes with alternative stable states, such as tundra, steppe and forest, our results imply that, as climatic change reduces the stability, the effect might be difficult to detect until a point where local disturbances inevitably induce a spatial cascade to the alternative state.

AB In this article, we develop a unifying framework for the understanding of spatial vegetation patterns in heterogeneous landscapes. While much recent research has focused on self-organised vegetation the prevailing view is still that biological patchiness is mostly due to top-down control by the physical landscape template, disturbances or predators. We suggest that vegetation patchiness in real landscapes is controlled both by the physical template and by self-organisation simultaneously, and introduce a conceptual model for the relative roles of the two mechanisms. The model considers four factors that control whether vegetation patchiness is emerged or imposed: soil patch size, plant size, resource input and resource availability. The last three factors determine the plant-patch size, and the plant-to-soil patch size ratio determines the impact of self-organisation, which becomes important when this ratio is sufficiently small. A field study and numerical simulations of a mathematical model support the conceptual model and give further insight by providing examples of self-organised and template-controlled vegetation patterns co-occurring in the same landscape. We conclude that real landscapes are generally mixtures of template-induced and self-organised patchiness. Patchiness variability increases due to sourcesink resource relations, and decreases for species of larger patch sizes.

AB To determine how climate factors influence age, body size and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in the Mediterranean region, we generated data on age and body size of the European Treefrog, Hyla arborea, in three Turkish populations with a latitudinal gradient. We estimated age structure (total n = 154), using skeletochronology. Mean body size of both sexes was smaller in a southern population (Antalya) than in northern populations (Canakkale and Rize) with female-larger SSD in the northern populations. A positive correlation was found between age and body size in each sex of all the populations, save the Antalya females. Since amphibian growth is reduced after maturity but continues towards the asymptotic size, interpopulation size differences may partly be explained by differences in longevity with four years in Antalya and five years in the other two populations. Comparing age and body size in three Turkish populations with those in three different populations (Greece, Switzerland and Germany) from the literature, there was a trend of South-to-North increase in body size with increased latitude and decreased temperature and aridity. The same trend occurred also in age structure (e.g., age at maturity/first reproduction, longevity). These results suggest that a difference in age structure between populations is a main factor for the geographic variation in body size of this species.

AB The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) regulates melanogenesis in mammals within the mammalian melanocyte and the hair follicle. Common variations (polymorph isms) in the MC1R gene are associated with normal differences in skill and hair colour. So far, a unique MC1R allele (E+) has been identified in European wild boar (Sus scrofa scrofa), associated with the wild-type coat colour (variable shades of brown) that is not found in any of the domestic breeds. In addition, a series of alleles found in pigs, some of which observed only in particular breeds, have been proposed as markers in breed traceability systems. The current study is an attempt to detect possible hybrids between wild boars and domestic pig breeds as well as to identify races of pig that are not purebred. For this purpose, wild boars were analysed against Large White pigs, applying the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. A high percentage (16.7%) of hybrids was detected within a breeding station compared with the percentage of hybrids within the populations of free-ranging wild boar (5.0%). These results should be taken into consideration for future restocking operations to avoid the chance of outbreeding depression, which is more intense when local Populations are introgressed by gene pools from domesticated, usually inbred, animals.

AB 1. The efficacy of protected areas for wildlife management is largely dependent on appropriate design. It is therefore crucial that the distribution of target species is well understood.
   2. The Banks Peninsula Marine Mammal Sanctuary (BPMMS) was designed to protect Hector's dolphins from bycatch in gillnets. However, the Banks Peninsula dolphin population is likely to be still declining, partly due to continued bycatch outside the boundaries of the BPMMS.
   3. A three year series of aerial line-transect surveys around Banks Peninsula was carried out to investigate seasonal changes in distribution of Hector's dolphins out to 20 nautical miles (37 km) from the coast.
   4. Dolphin sightings were concentrated close to shore in shallow water in summer, but were more evenly distributed throughout the study area in winter. A greater proportion of dolphins were sighted outside the 4 nautical miles (7.4km) offshore boundary of the BPMMS in winter (mean=56%) than in summer (mean=19%) (G=88.25, df=1, P<0.001).
   5. Partial Mantel tests revealed the effects of distance offshore and depth on dolphin occurrence while controlling for spatial autocorrelation and multicollinearity within the data. Distance offshore had the strongest and most consistent effect on dolphin presence, while depth had a strong effect in summer only.
   6. It is proposed that restrictions on gillnetting around Banks Peninsula must be extended in order to reduce bycatch of Hector's dolphins to a sustainable level, and that a new offshore boundary of the BPMMS would be best defined by distance from the coast.

AB As part of a conservation initiative, captive-bred individuals of the endangered European mink Mustela lutreola were released to a Baltic island 'sanctuary', Hiiumaa Island (Estonia), and their survival was monitored over eight years. Altogether, 54 released mink were equipped with radio-collars between 2000 and 2003 and their survival and causes of death were studied as a function of sex, age, housing conditions before release and number of generations in captivity. Mortality was greatest (similar to 50%) during 1-1.5 months following release. The survival of males was significantly higher than that of females (25% decline in 21 days, and 10 days, for males and females, respectively). Releasing pregnant females appeared to be an unsuccessful strategy. There was no evidence that the number of generations for which the lineage of the released individuals had been bred in captivity had any effect on survival. The main cause of death was other carnivores and raptors, although this broad categorization may conceal a diversity of fatal scenarios.
   We recommend for the future that the European mink being prepared for release should be maintained in large naturalistic enclosures beforehand, that a preponderance of females should be released, and that the indications that younger animals make better candidates for release should be investigated.

AB Long-distance dispersal (LDD) may contribute disproportionately to species persistence in fragmented landscapes, non-native invasions, and range shifts in response to climate change. However, direct data on LDD are extremely limited, leaving us with little understanding of why it occurs. I used six years of mark-recapture data on the stream salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus to test theoretical predictions of how variation in habitat quality affects LDD. Frequency of LDD was quantified using the kurtosis of yearly movement distributions from recaptured animals in a 1-km headwater stream. Temporal and spatial variation in habitat quality were quantified with spatially explicit data on the body condition and dispersion of individuals throughout the study stream. Using information-theoretic model selection criteria, I found that LDD increased during periods of low average body condition and low spatial variation in body condition. Consistent with basic theory, my results indicate that temporal variation in habitat quality is critical to initiating dispersal, and that LDD increases when animals must move farther to encounter higher-quality habitat. This suggests that information on how habitat quality varies in time and space can be useful for predicting LDD. More broadly, this study highlights the value of direct data on animal movement for testing dispersal theory.

AB Global warming and other anthropogenic changes to the environment affect many aspects of biology and have often been invoked as causing body size changes in vertebrates. Here we examine a diverse set of carnivore populations in search of patterns in body size change that could reflect global warming (in accord with Bergmann's rule).
   Global.
   We used > 4400 specimens representing 22 carnivore species in 52 populations collected over the last few decades to examine whether size changed with collection date when geography and sex are accounted for. We then examined several factors related to global warming, body mass, diet, and the attributes of the different datasets, to see whether they affect the standardized slope (beta) of the size versus time regression.
   Six of 52 populations we examined show a significant effect of year of collection on body size at the 0.05 probability level. The response of size to global warming does not reflect spatial patterns of size variation, nor do diet or body mass affect tendency of populations to change in body size. Size changes are no more pronounced in populations that have been sampled more recently. However, change, where it occurs, is rapid.
   There may be a tendency in the literature to report only cases where recent changes are prevalent. Although in our data only a minority of populations show body size changes, we may see changes accelerating in the future in response to more drastic climatic changes and other anthropogenic changes.

AB 1. Through analyses of a 34-year record of phytoplankton, zooplankton and physicochemical parameters from Lake Kinneret, Israel, we show that distinct and persistent phytoplankton assemblage states occurred from winter to summer.
   2. The most obvious characteristic of these states was the presence or absence of a spring bloom of the dinoflagellate, Peridinium gatunense.
   3. Analyses of the data within the framework of the alternative states model revealed a possible complex triggering mechanism, and system hysteresis.
   4. A change in zooplankton biomass and body size coincident with changes in predation pressure associated with the collapse of the Kinneret Bleak, Acanthobrama terraesanctae, fishery appeared to be the 'slow changing' variable in the context of the alternative states model. Alternative phytoplankton states were only possible after this variable crossed a threshold in 1993-94, following the collapse of the fishery.
   5. When alternative states were possible, some physicochemical parameters and the structure of the zooplankton assemblage appeared to control which phytoplankton state emerged in a given year. In years without a P. gatunense bloom, important physicochemical parameters in winter included low NO3 loading, high water temperature, high water level, a deeper thermocline, low transparency, high concentrations of NO3 and Cl in the epilimnion, and low concentration of epilimnetic total phosphorus. In addition, the cladoceran Chydorus sphaericus and adults of the copepod Mesocyclops ogunnus were observed in winter in years without a bloom.
   6. Zooplankton biomass and body size of some taxa have recovered since the 1993-94 collapse of the fishery, yet incidence of both phytoplankton states in Lake Kinneret was still possible. Within the framework of the alternative states model, this suggests that the slow changing variable threshold where alternative states became possible is different from the threshold where alternative states will no longer be possible. In other words, the system is characterised by a hysteresis.

AB 1. The functional response of post-dispersal seed predators (house mouse, Mus musculus) to absolute densities of southern beech seed (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) was studied in laboratory and field trials. House mice showed a Type II (hyperbolic) functional response to seed availability and this was not modified by the presence of an alternative food source.
   2. Maximum daily intake rate of beech seeds during field trials averaged 1042 seeds mouse(-1). This is sufficient to provide house mice with both the energy and protein required for growth and reproduction.
   3. We explicitly incorporated the functional response into the numerical response of house mice to beech seed, measured for field populations monitored in a New Zealand beech forest. House mice showed a strong numerical response to beech seed intake rate that was modified by some density-dependent mechanism(s).
   4. We developed a model that simulated seedfall, house mouse population growth and seed reserve depletion over one year. We found that the previously reported decline in house-mouse populations in beech forests during spring and summer is likely to be related to spring beech seed germination that renders seed no longer available as a food source for house mice.
   5. From our simulation model it does not appear that house-mouse populations can completely eat-out beech seed reserves prior to germination in a year of large seedfall. 'Masting' behaviour in New Zealand native beech trees is therefore sufficient to satiate an eruptive population of an exotic mammalian omnivore, despite the lack of a long co-evolutionary interaction.

AB 1. Pollinators typically visit more flowers on plants with larger floral displays, which should present such attractive plants with significant pollen transport losses.
   2. Many-flowered plants with hermaphrodite flowers might reduce the costs of attractiveness by encouraging fewer sequential flower visits by pollinators. One mechanism that accomplishes this is to produce variable nectar rewards, which will cause risk-averse foragers to leave the plant after visiting fewer flowers.
   3. We test the prediction that within-plant variability in nectar production rate increases with the relative number of open flowers on a plant. A field survey of nine herbaceous angiosperm species native to Alberta, Canada revealed a significant positive correlation between nectar variability (measured as standard deviation) and the size of the floral display within species. This relationship existed over and above the null expectation of a positive correlation between mean and SD.
   4. Our results suggest that multiflowered plants might maximize the male fitness returns associated with a plant's attraction status (determined by relative display size), by taking advantage of risk-averse foraging by their pollinators.

AB In this paper we emphasize the role of pollinator perception and decision-making processes in mediating floral nectar distribution strategies. Since pollinator choice behavior is guided by how the pollinator perceives and evaluates floral rewards, we hypothesize that plants have evolved strategies that maximize their perceived profitability, through pollinator cognition-mediated coevolution. We focus on two classes of cognitive phenomena, context-dependent evaluations and risk-sensitivity. These phenomena are of interest to psychologists and biologists. Our paper is an attempt to show the value of cross-disciplinary exchange of theories and ideas. A review of the ecology literature suggests that pollinators evaluate variability in nectar volume in proportion to the mean, and thus choice behavior is guided by the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) of the distribution. This functional relationship is predicted by Weber's law, which describes a wide range of psychophysical phenomena. Simulations show that this phenomenon also affects how pollinators perceive skewed nectar distributions. Cognition-mediated coevolution theory should be a fruitful approach to understanding the evolution of pollinator-plant interactions.

AB We trained barn owls to fly over 2-ha field enclosures containing populations of Gerbillus allenbyi. Each 2-ha plot was divided into two equal parts by a fence with gates allowing easy passage of the gerbils. We varied the number of gerbils in the enclosure and the number of owl flights on each side of the dividing fence. Gerbil foraging activity responded within two hours to the difference in number of owl flights over the subplots. The greater the difference, the more the gerbils shifted their foraging to the subplot with fewer flights. Gerbils did not reduce their total foraging effort but redistributed it between subplots. In the absence of owl flights, gerbils divided their foraging effort equally between the matched subplots. Thus, they appear to seek an ideal free distribution in the two halves of each plot. Therefore, based on the gerbils' distribution of activity in the presence of different numbers of owl flights over the two subplots we estimated the shapes and slopes of the gerbil victim isoclines in the middle and right hand side of the 'gerbil-activity vs number of owl flights' state space. The isoclines were parallel straight lines with slope equal to -0.57. We believe this to be the first estimate of a victim isocline for a population of vertebrates in the field.
   Using the isodar method of Morris, we also determined that the fitness cost of each additional gerbil, i.e., per capita intraspecific competition among the G. allenbyi, is constant. It does not depend on either owl flight frequencies or G. allenbyi densities. The isodar also shows that the fitness cost of added owl flights does not vary with G. allenbyi population densities.

AB Trade-offs are central to life history theory, yet few studies have examined how geographic variation in trade-offs can lead to geographic variation in life history characters. I examined whether or not trade-offs for future fecundity or offspring survivorship could explain why tropical birds lay smaller clutches than their temperate relatives. I studied a tropical population (in Monteverde, Costa Pica) of the House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), a species that ranges in average clutch size from 6 in the temperate zone to 3.5 in the tropics. Three years of brood manipulation experiments showed weak effects of brood size on both future fecundity and offspring survivorship. Females that raised broods enlarged by two nestlings laid subsequent clutches, in the same breeding season, that were one-third of an egg smaller than those of females that did not raise enlarged first broods. Clutches in the year following brood manipulation were about a half an egg smaller for females raising enlarged broods than for females raising control or reduced broods. However, brood manipulation had no effect on male or female survivorship in any year of the study, despite the observation that both sexes increased their foraging rate to compensate for rearing larger broods. In two of three years, House Wrens were able to raise enlarged broods just as successfully as control and reduced broods, as measured by fledgling mass and survivorship of nestlings and fledglings. In one year, nestlings in enlarged broods hedged lighter and had lower fledgling survival than those in control or reduced broods. Predation of broods was unrelated to brood size, so food limitation appeared to be the mechanism causing the trade-off between brood number and offspring production. The pattern in tropical House Wrens is similar to that found in many studies of temperate passerines: in most years, brood sizes larger than the modal brood size appear to produce the most offspring. Thus, the same mechanism that controls dutch size in temperate birds may be at work in the tropics, but the level at which clutch size is controlled is lower in tropical birds, resulting in smaller clutches.
   A population model based on demographic parameters measured in the study population showed that the trade-off for offspring survivorship had a greater influence on fitness than the trade-off for future fecundity. Also, the clutch size strategy accruing the highest fitness depended on temporally varying conditions for reproduction. A strategy of laying 5-6 eggs had higher fitness than laying smaller clutches in years when conditions were favorable for reproduction, but clutch sizes of 3-4 (the observed clutch sizes in Monteverde) were most productive during less favorable years. Depending on the frequency of favorable years, House Wrens may be responding to a ''bad-years effect'' by lowering variance in reproductive success to maximize fitness over the long term. Alternatively, tropical birds may lay fewer eggs so that they can invest more care in each offspring, enhancing the chance that their offspring will survive and compete successfully in social contests for breeding territories. This offspring-quality hypothesis is supported by the observation that tropical House Wrens devote more time to the different stages of the reproductive cycle than do temperate House Wrens.

AB This study was undertaken to provide an estimate of the functional response curve of the moose during winter.  The functional response consists of two components:  the intake rate while foraging and the time available for food searching.  In generalist herbivores an interaction may exist between those two components, because the quality of food eaten (expressed as digestibility) may limit the period available for grazing.  Thus, variation in intake rate while foraging in relation to food availability may give a biased estimate of functional response in such animals.
   We studied the relationship between the different components of functional response during winter for a generalist browser, the moose Alces alces, by comparing the intake rates of free-ranging individuals foraging on three Norwegian winter ranges of different quality.  The intake rate was determined by collecting feces defecated during a 24-h period by radiocollared individuals.  The amount of food eaten was found by multiplying the dry mass of feces with the inverse of the digestibility of the twigs eaten during that period.
   No relationship was found between intake rate and either snow depth or temperature.
   Body mass accounted for a large proportion of the variance in intake rates.  The slope in the regression of intake rate on body mass (b = 0.73) was close to the one expected from Kleiber's law.  However, when calves and adults were analyzed separately, a significant allometric relationship was found only for the calves.
   The intake rates of both age groups increased linearly with resource availability.  This relationship also remained after accounting for the effects of body mass in a multiple-regression analysis.  The intake rate also increased with the digestibility of the twigs eaten.  However, twig digestibility was closely correlated with resource abundance in the present data set, so the separate effects of quality and quantity were difficult to estimate.
   In the present data set no significant relationship appeared between resource availability and the time used for foraging.  Thus, the functional response of winter-foraging moose was linearly related to the resource availability.  However, we suggest that the quality of the food also should be included in the computation of functional response curves of large herbivores.  Consequently, the functional response should be described in three dimensions as a function of quality and quantity of the food resources.

AB The study of insular systems has a long history in ecology and biogeography. Island plants often differ remarkably from their noninsular counterparts, constituting excellent models for exploring eco-evolutionary processes. Trait-based approaches can help to answer important questions in island biogeography, yet plant trait patterns on islands remain understudied. We discuss three key hypotheses linking functional ecology to island biogeography: (i) plants in insular systems are characterized by distinct functional trait syndromes (compared with noninsular environments); (ii) these syndromes differ between true islands and terrestrial habitat islands; and (iii) island characteristics influence trait syndromes in a predictable manner. We are convinced that implementing trait-based comparative approaches would considerably further our understanding of plant ecology and evolution in insular systems.

AB AimIdentifying traits that enhance the success of animals in unhospitable climates helps to understand biogeographical patterns and to predict the consequences of climatic changes. On temperate mountains, traits that increase cold performance potentially allow species to colonize higher elevations. We first tested the importance of morphological traits for the cold performance of bees. Second, we assessed the relevance of these traits for species distributional patterns by analysing intraspecific and interspecific trait shifts along elevational gradients.
   LocationNational Park Berchtesgaden, Germany; Wurzburg, Germany.
   MethodsWe determined thermal activity thresholds by measuring signs of immobility along temperature gradients under laboratory conditions and related them to morphometric traits. We sampled bee communities at 34 sites along an elevation gradient in the northern Alps, measured for all species morphometric traits and thermal activity limits in the field, and analysed how trait measures changed with elevation within and across species.
   ResultsLaboratory and field experiments revealed that bees with larger body size, longer hair and relatively short wings tolerated lower temperatures before reaching immobility and started being active in the field at lower temperatures than small, short-haired and long-winged species. In correspondence to these results, we found that morphometric traits increased (body size, hair length) or decreased (relative wing length) with increasing elevation in communities and, in case of body size, also within species.
   Main conclusionsResults of laboratory and field experiments and their reflectance in community- and species-level trends of morphological traits along elevational gradients underscore the adaptive nature of large body size, long hair and short wings for bees' thermal performance. Morphological traits expanding lower thermal limits probably contribute to the fitness of bees in cold environments and may simultaneously be under selection in a warming world.

AB There has been a growing interest in whether established ecogeographical patterns, such as Bergmann's rule, explain changes in animal morphology related to climate change. Bergmann's rule has often been used to predict that body size will decrease as the climate warms, but the predictions about how body size will change are critically dependent on the mechanistic explanation behind the rule. To investigate change in avian body size in western North America, we used two long-term banding data sets from central California, USA; the data spanned 40 years (19712010) at one site and 27 years (19832009) at the other. We found that wing length of birds captured at both sites has been steadily increasing at a rate of 0.0240.084% per year. Although changes in body mass were not always significant, when they were, the trend was positive and the magnitudes of significant trends were similar to those for wing length (0.0400.112% per year). There was no clear difference between the rates of change of long-distance vs. short-distance migrants or between birds that bred locally compared to those that bred to the north of the sites. Previous studies from other regions of the world have documented decreases in avian body size and have used Bergmann's rule and increases in mean temperature to explain these shifts. Because our results do not support this pattern, we propose that rather than responding to increasing mean temperatures, avian body size in central California may be influenced by changing climatic variability or changes in primary productivity. More information on regional variation in the rates of avian body size change will be needed to test these hypotheses.

AB Using museum specimens, we studied recent changes in skull size of the American marten Martes americana, in continental Alaska. In Alaska, global warming has resulted in milder winters that may contribute to an improved food supply in the wild. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that body size of the marten had increased during the second half of the 20th century, in response to global warming. We found that skull size, and by implication body size, increased significantly during the second half of the 20th century, possibly due to an improved food supply and/or lower metabolic demands in winter. Improved food availability in winter may result from the improved nutritional conditions for prey, and/or from increased access to prey resulting from a longer snow-free season. Longitude had a significant positive effect on skull size and a significant negative effect on teeth size. In Alaska, the climate is milder along the western coast and becomes harsher inland. Hence, the milder climate was associated with larger body size providing further support for our prediction that body size of the American marten was influenced by food availability and reduced energy expenditure. The negative relationship between longitude and teeth size may indicate a trend towards a larger prey in inland marten populations, but we have no data to support or refute this hypothesis.

AB Darwin was an early exponent of the importance of 'occasional means of dispersal' in accounting for the present-day distribution of plants and animals. This study examined the implications of capture on the water surface of meltwater and seawater for the local and long-range dispersal of Antarctic springtails. Individuals of the maritime Antarctic collembolan Cryptopygus antarcticus, were floated on tap water and seawater at 0, 5 and 10 degrees C. LT(50)s on seawater were 34 (10 degrees C), 65 (5 degrees C) and 75 (0 degrees C) days. On tap water, LT(50)s were 69 (10 degrees C), 126 (5 degrees C) and 239 (0 degrees C) days. Less than 20% escaped from the water surface. A significantly greater proportion of springtails moulted on tap water and viable offspring were produced on both tap water and seawater. Comparison across treatments of survival of moulting and non-moulting individuals found significantly greater survival in moulting animals for three of the treatment combinations. It is suggested that moult exuviae facilitate survival on the water film through the simultaneous provision of a flotation aid and a source of nourishment - that is, an 'edible raft'. A separate experiment measuring changes in haemolymph osmolality over time on tap water and seawater at 2 and 5 degrees C found significant differences in all treatments. Causes of mortality are discussed in relation to osmoregulatory failure and starvation.

AB During the winter and spring of 2002 and 2003, we used time-integrated fertilization assays to monitor sperm availability in three populations of the green sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis in Maine: a naturally occurring population of > 40,000 urchins and two smaller groups (< 1,000) of transplanted urchins isolated from other aggregations. Episodes of sperm release coincided in two populations 10 km apart, suggesting that urchins were responding to a widespread environmental signal. We observed significant lunar periodicity in sperm release events for both of these populations. However, extensive spawning as shown by fertilization rates near 100% and a dramatic drop in gonad mass only occurred in the large natural population around the onset of thermal stratification and the spring phytoplankton bloom. By contrast, in the two small populations we observed low fertilization rates and little or no change in gonad mass. We speculate that a subset of males in these populations responded to a common external spawning signal, but that mass spawning is more likely to occur in large, dense populations where sperm concentrations reach high enough levels to trigger spawning in less responsive urchins.

AB Patterns of size variation in insular mammals have been used to support the claim that mammals have a single optimal body size. This hypothesis enjoys wide support, despite having been questioned on both theoretical and empirical grounds. It is claimed that species of optimal size maintain the highest population densities. Therefore these species are thought to inhabit the smallest islands, where larger and smaller species are generally absent. We sought such a pattern by testing how area affects the body sizes of the largest and smallest carnivore species on islands. Using data on carnivores from 322 islands, we found that the sizes of carnivores on small islands tend to be close to the order's mode. Furthermore, we found that the size distribution of carnivore species that inhabit islands resembles that of those whose range is entirely continental. We conclude that insular carnivores provide no support for theories proposing a single optimal size, and we suspect such theories are also flawed on theoretical grounds.

AB We analyzed a data set accumulated over a 12-year period subsequent to the catastrophic disturbance of a rain forest by a hurricane. We analyzed the data to determine whether observed trajectories correspond to expectations from an equilibrium or nonequilibrium model of community structure. The equilibrium case, implying a single basin of attraction, suggests that trajectories should become ever more similar over time. The nonequilibrium case, implying multiple basins of attraction, suggests the opposite. The data from this particular forest, located on the eastern seaboard of Nicaragua, strongly support the multiple basin hypothesis, and thus the nonequilibrium model.

AB Myths, metaphors, and social norms that facilitate collective action and understanding of restoration dynamics serve as foundations for ecological restoration. The experience of the White Mountain Apache Tribe demonstrates how such cultural foundations can permeate and motivate ecological restoration efforts. Through interviews with tribal cultural advisors and restoration practitioners, we examined how various traditions inform their understanding of restoration processes. Creation stories reveal the time-honored importance and functions of water bodies within the landscape, while place names yield insights into their historical and present conditions. Traditional healing principles and agricultural traditions help guide modem restoration techniques. A metaphor of stability illustrates how restoration practitioners see links among ecological, social, and personal dimensions of health. These views inspire reciprocal relationships focused on caretaking of sites, learning from elders, and passing knowledge on to youths. Woven together, these cultural traditions uphold a system of adaptive management that has withstood the imposition of non-indigenous management schemes in the 20(th) century, and now provides hope for restoring health and productivity of ecosystems through individual and collective efforts. Although these traditions are adapted to the particular ecosystems of the Tribe, they demonstrate the value of understanding and promoting the diverse cultural foundations of restoration.

AB 1. We analysed the vulnerability of a number of cladoceran species (Bosmina longirostris, B. fatalis, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Ceriodaphnia reticulata, Daphnia ambigua and D. pulex) to predation by Mesocyclops leuckarti in the laboratory.
   2. The prey species represented a wide range of body size, morphology, and swimming behaviour. To compare vulnerability, we measured the efficiency of capture and ingestion of each prey species by Mesocyclops. We also measured the rate at which prey were damaged in attacks by Mesocyclops.
   3. Mesocyclops preyed effectively on Diaphanosoma and small juvenile Ceriodaphnia but not on Bosmina or Daphnia. Observations suggested that various defence mechanisms, including protruding structures and swimming behaviour and speed, are important in determining prey vulnerability.
   4. The body size of Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia seems to be important, because larger animals were better able to escape Mesocyclops attacks. Attacks by Mesocyclops often caused fatal damage, however, even to large Daphnia.

AB Fishing affects seabed habitats worldwide. However, these impacts are not uniform and are affected bythe spatial and temporal distribution of fishing effort, and vary with the habitat type and environment in which they occur. Different fishing methodologies vary in the degree to which they affect the seabed. Towed bottom-fishing gears and hydraulic harvesting devices re-suspend the upper layers of the sedimentary habitat and hence re-mobilize contaminants and fine particulate matter into the water column. The ecological significance of these fishing effects has not yet been determined.
   Structurally complex habitats (e.g. sea-grass meadows, biogenic reefs) and those that are relatively undisturbed by natural perturbations (e.g. deep-water mud substrata) are more adversely affected by fishing than unconsolidated sediment habitats that occur in shallow coastal waters. Structurally complex and stable habitats also have the longest recovery trajectories in terms of the re-colonization of the habitat by the associated fauna.
   Comparative studies of areas of the sea bed that have experienced different levels of fishing activity demonstrate that chronic fishing disturbance leads to the removal of high-biomass species that are composed mostly of emergent seabed organisms. These organisms increase the topographic complexity of the seabed and have been shown to provide shelter for juvenile fishes, reducing their vulnerability to predation. Conversely, scavengers and small-bodied organisms, such as polychaete worms, dominate heavily fished areas. Such a change in habitat may lead to changes in the composition of the resident fish fauna. Fishing also has indirect effects on habitat through the removal of predators that control bio-engineering organisms such as algal-grazing urchins on coral reefs. However, such effects are only manifested in those systems in which the linkages between the main trophic levels are confined to less than ten species.
   Management regimes that aim to incorporate both fisheries and habitat conservation objectives can be achieved through the appropriate use of a number of approaches, including total and partial exclusion of towed bottom fishing gears, and seasonal and rotational closure techniques. Different management regimes can only be formulated and tested once objectives and criteria for seabed habitats have been defined.

AB The allocation of parental investment is a potential source of conflict within broods whenever offspring are able obtain differential access to the parental resource. Unlike the provisioning of food, parental antipredator behavior is usually considered a resource that benefits all offspring simultaneously. In the thornbug treehopper (Umbonia crassicornis), offspring form aggregations in exposed positions on host-plant stems. They are subject to intense predation, and maternal defense is their primary means of protection. I examined the distribution of risk within these offspring groups, using natural variation in the outcome of more than 500 predation attempts (324 recorded on videotape) by vespid wasps (Pseudopolybia compressa) on 18 U. crassicornis aggregations. I found three influences on an individual offspring's risk of predation. The first was the presence of a defending female: as expected, offspring were much more likely to survive contact with a wasp if the female was present than if the female had disappeared. The second influence was position relative to other offspring: when wasps were successful in removing an individual, they almost always removed it from the edge of the group. The third influence was distance from the female: the closer an offspring was to the female at the time it was contacted by a wasp, the higher its likelihood of survival. The distribution of risk is determined largely by the behavior of defending females and the prey-searching behavior of wasps. The nature of risk within these aggregations sets the stage for two forms of sibling rivalry: selfish herd behavior and competition for access to maternal defense. It also raises the question of how a parent should allocate defense among offspring when it is unable to defend them all simultaneously.

AB A study of the structure of the fish community associated with a vermetid reef at Shiqmona, Israel, revealed the highest fish biodiversity (36 species) of any habitat along the Mediterranean coast of Israel. Despite the prevalence of fish of Erythrean origin in the Levantine littoral, the benthic fish community at the site is entirely autochthonous. The families richest in members were the Blenniidae and the Gobiidae. Eighteen species are benthic, sixteen supra-benthic and two pelagic.

AB Shrub species of southern Californian coastal sage scrub recruit seedlings immediately after fire but also recruit in unburned coastal sage scrub stands and annual grasslands. We examined the influence of natural disturbances other than fire on shrub seedling establishment, especially the role of small-scale disturbance. Our goals were to determine: (1) whether seedling recruitment is associated with gaps in grassland, scrub, and grassland-scrub ecotones; (2) the identity of gap-creating agents; (3) the influences of biotic (vertebrates and ants) and abiotic (late spring moisture) disturbances on seedling establishment; and (4) whether disturbance effects vary spatially, both among and within (gap vs, nongap microsites) the three zones. We censused natural seedlings and vegetation gaps monthly in belt transects for two growing seasons and also measured seed banks at three 16-yr-old sites of adjacent grassland and coastal sage scrub. We initiated factorial experiments at one site to determine effects of animals, gaps, and late spring moisture on seed and seedling numbers. Gap-creating agents varied among the three zones, but seedlings were associated with gaps in each. Animals, especially small mammals, were important in creation and maintenance of gaps. Animal effects varied among but not within zones. Small mammals positively affected seedling recruitment in the grassland (germination on pocket gopher mounds) and negatively affected seed numbers of species with larger and multiple-seeded propagules in the ecotone and scrub; they created and/or maintained gaps in all three zones. Late spring moisture did not play an important role in shrub seedling recruitment in any zone. Because coastal sage shrub seedlings lose transpiring surfaces during drought, they may be less vulnerable than evergreen mediterranean shrubland species to the variability in both annual and seasonal extent of rainfall that is typical of mediterranean climates.

AB Present knowledge of feeding tactics and behaviour, food composition and consumption, and feeding strategies of planktonic cyclopoid copepods is synthesized. Planktonic freshwater cyclopoids consume both plant and animal food. Predatory feeding is highly selective: prey species differ in their size, defense structures, the distance at which they are recognized by the cyclopoid, defensive behaviour when attacked, and their occurrence in the same space as the predator. Within a prey species, cyclopoids select for smaller individuals. The impact of cyclopoid predation on the other zooplankton may be an important source of mortality. However, algal material is consumed to a large extent by the adult and later developmental stages and is a necessary food source for the youngest stages, which have to compete with other planktonic herbivores. Some implications of these food requirements for life strategies of planktonic cyclopoid species in the seasonally changing environments are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Dissimilatory acetate-oxwidizing sulfate-reducing bacteria were enriched from hypersaline sediments of the Great Salt Lake (Utah, USA) in a synthetic medium. Three mesophilic rod-shaped strains were isolated from deep-agar dilution series, and one strain (GSL-Ac1) was chosen for further studies, Strain GSL-Acl showed a high degree of salt tolerance (up to 13% NaCl and 4.5% MgCl2 . 6H(2)O), but displayed optimum growth with only 1-2% NaCl in the medium. 16S rDNA sequencing placed GSL-Acl in the genus Desulfobacter. On the basis of DNA-DNA hybridization studies and physiological differences, we describe strain GSL-Acl as a new species, Desulfobacter halotolerans sp. nov. Strain GSL-Acl showed the highest NaCl-tolerance reported for any member of the genus Desulfobacter.

LA English
DT Article
ID FEMALE FLOWERS; MIMICRY
AB In the predominantly monoecious genus Begonia, pollen is the only floral reward to pollinators.  To investigate the hypothesis that female Begonia flowers attract pollinators by mimicking male flowers, we studied floral display and pollinator behavior in a population of the protandrous perennial herb Begonia involucrata at Monteverde, Costa Rica.  The stigmas of the female flowers are bicornute and dark yellow, strongly resembling the anthers of male flowers.  The petaloid sepals of male flowers are somewhat larger than those of female flowers, but the number of open flowers does not differ between male- and female-phase inflorescences.  Both male and female inflorescences have a sweet odor.
   Trigona grandipennis, the most frequent flower visitor in the study population, consistently showed a strong preference for male-phase inflorescences; on average, individual male inflorescences received 3.4-9.6 (median 7.2) times as many visits as female inflorescences during five different observation periods.  Moreover, visits to male flowers lasted about ten times longer than visits to female flowers (mean 29.8 versus 2.6 seconds).  Although visits to female flowers were infrequent and brief, fruit set averaged 76 percent and seed set 57 percent.  A hand-pollination experiment indicated that seed set was pollen limited (1.4 times higher after supplemental pollination), but that fruit set was not.  Taken together, the striking similarity in male and female flower display, the selective pollinator behavior, and the relatively high levels of fruit and seed set support the hypothesis that the rewardless female flowers of B. involucrata mimic male flowers and are pollinated by deceit.

AB (1) A physiologically based mechanistic model of the dynamic interaction between plants and animals is used to consider the role of differences in growth rate between plant species, and of selective grazing by animals, in the stability of plant species in a continuously grazed mixture, and so the long-term consequences of different intensities of grazing on the composition of the sward and diet.
   (2) The model provides a means to apply a detailed account of plant physiology in controlling the availability of food resources (prey) in analyses of predator-prey interactions in grassland.
   (3) The model confirms that mixtures are intrinsically unstable. In the absence of a mechanism in either species to escape grazing, one which possesses a physiological advantage is shown progressively to dominate the mixture. Where the advantage is a simple one, the mixture tends to a monoculture of that species at all intensities of grazing. But, where the advantaged species is also the preferred species, the intensity of grazing is shown to determine which species dominates the mixture.
   (4) The model suggests that stable mixtures may arise when either species can escape grazing to some extent. Under these circumstances, the otherwise advantaged species takes the brunt of variations in the intensity of grazing.
   (5) The model is used to consider the sustainability of differences in composition between the diet and sward. At high intensities of grazing, the composition of the diet is shown to be more a reflection of differences in growth rate between plant species than of the preferences of grazing animals. It is also shown that, because of its adverse impact on vegetation dynamics, the long-term consequence of a preference for one species in the diet is that there may be less of that species in the diet (both as a proportion and as an amount) than if there had been less preference for it or a preference against it. The implications of these analyses for the biological interpretation of field data are discussed.

AB Bergmann's rule is a widely-accepted biogeographic rule stating that individuals within a species are smaller in warmer environments. While there are many single-species studies and integrative reviews documenting this pattern, a data-intensive approach has not been used yet to determine the generality of this pattern. We assessed the strength and direction of the intraspecific relationship between temperature and individual mass for 952 bird and mammal species. For eighty-seven percent of species, temperature explained less than 10% of variation in mass, and for 79% of species the correlation was not statistically significant. These results suggest that Bergmann's rule is not general and temperature is not a dominant driver of biogeographic variation in mass. Further understanding of size variation will require integrating multiple processes that influence size. The lack of dominant temperature forcing weakens the justification for the hypothesis that global warming could result in widespread decreases in body size.

AB Although once thought to be devoid of biology, recent studies have identified salt deposits as oases for life in the hyperarid Atacama Desert. To examine spatial patterns of microbial species and key nutrient sources, we genomically characterized 26 salt crusts from three sites along a fog gradient. The communities are dominated by a large variety of Halobacteriales and Bacteroidetes, plus a few algal and Cyanobacterial species. CRISPR locus analysis suggests the distribution of a single Cyanobacterial population among all sites. This is in stark contrast to the extremely high sample specificity of most other community members. Only present at the highest moisture site is a genomically characterized Thermoplasmatales archaeon (Marine Group II) and six Nanohaloarchaea, one of which is represented by a complete genome. Parcubacteria (OD1) and Saccharibacteria (TM7), not previously reported from hypersaline environments, were found at low abundances. We found no indication of a N-2 fixation pathway in the communities, suggesting acquisition of bioavailable nitrogen from atmospherically derived nitrate. Samples cluster by site based on bacterial and archaeal abundance patterns and photosynthetic capacity decreases with increasing distance from the ocean. We conclude that moisture level, controlled by coastal fog intensity, is the strongest driver of community membership.

TI An Intercontinental Analysis of Climate-Driven Body Size Clines in

AB Climatic gradients impose clinal selection on animal ecological and physiological performance, often promoting geographic body size clines. Bergmann's rule predicts that body size increases with decreasing environmental temperatures given the need to retain body-heat through adjustments of body-mass-to-surface-area ratio. This prediction generally holds for endotherms, but remains controversial for ectotherms. An alternative interpretation, the 'resource rule', suggests that food abundance, primary productivity and precipitation (which, unlike temperature, do not necessarily correlate with geography), drive body size clines. We investigate geographic variation in body size within 65 species of lizards and snakes (squamates) based on an intercontinental dataset (6,500+ specimens belonging to 56 Israeli species, and multiple populations of nine Liolaemus species from Argentina and Chile). Bergmann's rule is only rarely supported by our data (in four species, 6 %), whereas six species (9 %) follow its converse (hence, it is unsupported in 94 % of cases). Similarly, size increases with resource abundance in only 12 species (18 %). Therefore, although neither of the rules is supported, factors suggested by the resource rule are better predictors of body size than temperature. Surprisingly, we show that some measures of the extent of a species' climatic envelope do not affect the likelihood of it showing a size-climate relationship. We conclude that negative size-temperature associations are an exception rather than a generality among squamates.

AB A molecular biological analysis of Icelandic volcanic rocks of different compositions and glassiness revealed the presence of Actinobacteria as an abundant phylum. In outcrops of basaltic glass they were the dominant bacterial phylum. A diversity of Actinobacteria were cultured from the rocks on rock-agar plates showing that they are capable of growing on rock-derived nutrient sources and that many of the taxa identified by molecular methods are viable, potentially active members of the community. Laboratory batch-culture experiments using a Streptomyces isolate showed that it was capable of enhancing the release of major elements from volcanic rocks, including weathered basaltic glass, crystalline basalt and komatiite, when provided with a carbon source. Actinobacteria of a variety of other sub-orders were also capable of enhancing volcanic rock weathering, measured as Si release. However, most strains did not significantly increase the weathering of the silica-rich rock, obsidian. These data show that Actinobacteria can contribute to volcanic rock weathering and, therefore, the carbonate-silicate cycle. Given their ancient lineage, it is likely they have played a role in rock weathering for over two billion years.

AB It is well accepted that the shape of the dispersal kernel, especially its tail, has a substantial effect on the genetic structure of species. Theory predicts that dispersal by fat-tailed kernels reshuffles genetic material, and thus, preserves genetic diversity during colonization. Moreover, if efficient long-distance dispersal is coupled with random colonization, an inverse isolation effect is predicted to develop in which increasing genetic diversity per colonizer is expected with increasing distance from a genetically variable source. By contrast, increasing isolation leads to decreasing genetic diversity when dispersal is via thin-tailed kernels. Here, we use a well-established model group for dispersal biology (peat mosses: genus Sphagnum) with a fat-tailed dispersal kernel, and the natural laboratory of the Stockholm archipelago to study the validity of the inverse isolation hypothesis in spore-dispersed plants in island colonization. Population genetic structure of three species (Sphagnum fallax, Sphagnum fimbriatum and Sphagnum palustre) with contrasting life histories and ploidy levels were investigated on a set of islands using microsatellites. Our data show (phi(st)', amova, IBD) that dispersal of the two most abundant species can be well approximated by a random colonization model. We find that genetic diversity per colonizer on islands increases with distance from the mainland for S.fallax and S.fimbriatum. By contrast, S.palustre deviates from this pattern, owing to its restricted distribution in the region, affecting its source pool strength. Therefore, the inverse isolation effect appears to hold in natural populations of peat mosses and, likely, in other organisms with small diaspores.

AB At present, stakeholders wishing to develop land use and management change scenarios at the landscape scale and to assess their corresponding impacts on water quality, biodiversity and economic performance, must examine the output of a suite of separate models. The process is not simple and presents a considerable deterrent to making such comparisons and impedes the development of more sustainable, multifunctional landscapes. To remedy this problem, we developed the Landscapes Toolkit, an integrated modelling framework that assists natural resource managers, policy-makers, planners and local communities explore options for sustainable landscape development. The Landscapes Toolkit links spatially-explicit disciplinary models, to enable integrated assessment of the water quality, biodiversity and economic outcomes of stakeholder-defined land use and management change scenarios. We use the Tully-Murray catchment in the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia as a case study to illustrate the development and application of the Landscapes Toolkit. Results show that the Landscapes Toolkit strikes a satisfactory balance between the inclusion of component models that sufficiently capture the richness of some key aspects of social-ecological system processes and the need for stakeholders to understand and compare the results of the different models. The latter is a prerequisite to making more informed decisions about sustainable landscape development. The flexibility of being able to add additional models and to update existing models is a particular strength of the Landscapes Toolkit design. Hence, the Landscapes Toolkit offers a promising modelling framework for supporting social learning and adaptive management through participatory scenario development and evaluation as well as being a tool to guide planning and policy discussions at the landscape scale.

AB Carbon to chlorophyll a (C:Chl) ratios, assimilation numbers (A.N.) and turnover times of natural populations of individual species and taxonomic groups were extracted from a long-term database of phytoplankton wet-weight biomass, chlorophyll a concentrations, and primary production in Lake Kinneret, Israel. From a database spanning more than a decade, we selected data for samples dominated by a single species or taxonomic group. The overall average of C:Chl was highest for cyanophytes and lowest for diatoms, while chlorophytes and dinoflagellates showed intermediate values. When converting chlorophyll a to algal cellular carbon this variability should be taken into account. The variability in C:Chl within each phylum and species (when data were available) was high and the variability at any particular sampling date tended to be greater than the temporal variability. The average chlorophyll a-normalized rate of photosynthetic activity of cyanophytes was higher and that of the dinoflagellates lower than that of other phyla. Turnover time of phytoplankton, calculated using primary productivity data at the depth of maximal photosynthetic rate, was longest in dinoflagellates and shortest in cyanophytes, with diatoms and chlorophytes showing intermediate values. The more extreme C:Chl and turnover times of dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria in comparison with chlorophytes and diatoms should be taken into consideration when employed in ecological modeling.

AB Current paradigms of reservoir ontogeny suggest that water-level fluctuations may increase sedimentary nutrient release, causing long-term eutrophication of water bodies formed by dryland flooding. Less is known of the changes in nutrient status following conversion of natural lakes into reservoirs. Here, we use historical hydrological and limnological data and paleolimnological records of sedimentary P accumulation to evaluate changes in nutrient storage in Lake Kinneret, Israel since similar to1860. Impoundment in 1932 increased water level fluctuations and altered seasonal hydrologic patterns in the lake. Geochemical analysis of sediment deposits indicated that bulk sediment and P accumulation rates in the central lake increased >600% following dam installation (1930s), draining of Lake Hula wetlands (1951-1957), and diversion of surface water outflow (1964 to present). Further, comparison of sedimentary P stratigraphies with long-term chemical records showed that the period of maximum P deposition corresponds to observed increases in whole-lake and in hypolimnetic P content, as well as epilimnetic biological changes indicative of ongoing eutrophication. Together, these patterns suggest that hydrologic management of natural lakes can increase sedimentary nutrient flux under circumstances where lake volume and water levels become more variable.

AB A number of studies show that predators can depress prey growth rates by inducing reductions in foraging activity, but the size of this non-lethal effect is quite variable. Here I investigate how prey density and resource productivity may alter the extent to which predators depress the growth rates of their prey. Theory predicts that when resources are overgrazed, an increase in predation risk will have little net effect on individual food intake because the decline in foraging effort will be offset by an increase in resource level. Thus, the non-lethal effects of predators on prey growth rates should depend upon prey density and resource productivity in a predictable manner, with the growth penalty imposed by predators being strongest when resources are undergrazed and weakest when resources are overgrazed. I tested this hypothesis by manipulating predation risk, prey density, and nutrient additions in a mesocosm experiment with the pulmonate snail Helisoma trivolvis. Refuge use by snails was 45% higher in the presence of caged crayfish than in their absence. Snail growth rates were reduced, on average, by 24% in the presence of caged crayfish. However, the magnitude of the growth penalty exacted by crayfish depended on snail density and nutrient additions. When snails were stocked at high density and nutrient additions were low, growth suppression was just 2.6%. At the other extreme, when snails were at low density and nutrient additions were high, growth suppression was 44.6%. Thus, the non-lethal effects of predators on prey growth depend on environmental context, illustrating an important link between individual traits and system-level properties.

AB Phylogenetic analyses of 15 strains representing 8 taxa of Dunaliella (D. salina, D. bardawil, D. pseudosalina, D. tertiolecta, D. parva, D. viridis, D. peircei and D. lateralis) belonging to both subgenera and all sections of the genus were carried out using the sequences of the nuclear rDNA spacers (internal transcribed spacer [ITS-1 + ITS-2]). The ITS data agreed with the traditional data in that D. lateralis (from subgenus Pascheria) is only distantly related to the seven taxa of the subgenus Dunaliella. The ITS data also supported the monophyly of the subgenus Dunaliella. Within the subgenus Dunaliella, sequence data resolved five phylogenetic groups; some isolates of A parva and D. salina separated into different clades containing other species. For example, D. parva UTEK 1983 (section Dunaliella) grouped with D. viridis CONC 002 (section Virides); the former has more nucleotides in common with D. viridis (93.2% similarity) than to its conspecifics (85.6% similarity). Likewise, the strains of D. parva CCMP 362 and CCAP 19/9 (section Dunaliella), the three strains of D. tertiolecta (section Tertiolectae), and the one strain of D. peircei (section Peirceinae) formed a strong phylogenetic clade (99%-100% support). Dunaliella salina UTEX 200 is more closely related to D. pseudosalina CONC 010 than to its conspecifics (95% similarity), even though the two taxa differ markedly physiologically. The results revealed that D. parva UTEX 1983 has been misidentified and should be renamed as D. viridis. Similarly, the strains of D. parva CCAP 19/9 and CCMP 362 and the strain UTEX 2192 of D. peircei should be renamed as D. tertiolecta. More physiological and molecular work needs to be done to elucidate the correct taxonomic position of D. salina UTEX 200 and D. pseudosalina CONC 010. Finally, the high ITS sequence variability found among the various strains of D. salina underlines the importance of further work to elucidate the species status in this complex taxon.

AB Dendropoma maxima (Vermetidae, Mollusca) is the largest member of a conspicuous group of sessile gastropods Living in shallow tropical and temperate reefs. In the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, individuals of D. maxima live in tubes embedded in the carbonate framework of the reef flat at densities of 11.1 +/- 6.3 m(-2). They secrete mucus nets extending similar to 10 cm around the individuals. The sticky nets billow under the turbulent action of impinging waves and indiscriminately trap suspended particles. The nets are withdrawn at regular intervals and consumed. Net retraction frequency (NRF), as determined by time-lapse video in the laboratory and in the field, appears to be related to particle availability with significant differences between day (1.35 +/- 0.16 hauls h(-1)) and night (2.39 +/- 0.44 hauls h(-1)), corresponding to differences in the availability of phyto- and zooplankton. With each net load, the snail consumes 10.43 +/- 0.99 mug chlorophyll a. Zooplankton accounts for about the same amount of ingested food as phytoplankton, the bulk of which is ingested during the night. Community ingestion amounts to 0.9 +/- 0.5 g C m(-2) d(-1), showing that mucus-net feeding by D. maxima traps plankton at rates comparable to other sessile suspension feeders in the same coral reefs.

AB We used trained barn owls to introduce a controlled predation threat to two species of gerbil, Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum in a system of 2-ha, sandy-substrate field enclosures in the Negev Desert, Israel. Using the principles of optimal density-dependent habitat selection, we estimated several coefficients of population interaction focusing on G. allenbyi. G. allenbyi exhibits strong intraspecific competition. In the absence of owls, G. pyramidum competes with it (alpha = -0.35). We estimated the slope of the G. allenbyi victim isocline to be -0.60. The competitive effect of G. pyramidum disappeared in the presence of owl, although the intraspecific competition remained. Our results indicated that in the presence of owls, the threat of predation overwhelms the cost of interspecific competition.

AB The population dynamics of the chemolithoautotrophic nitrifiers Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi were studied in gnotobiotic microcosms fed with ammonium in response to the presence or absence of the emergent macrophyte Glyceria maxima and the heterotrophic denitrifying bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis. By subjecting the plants to different day lengths, the effect of possibly limiting factors (i.e. oxygen and ammonium) on the interactions between the nitrifiers and denitrifying bacterium could be analysed. The presence of the plant had no effect on the growth of nitrifiers suggesting that, in addition to radial oxygen loss from the roots, other non-plant sources of oxygen (e.g. diffusion from the water layer) were important for nitrification. Potential nitrifying activities were suppressed by G. maxima due to ammonium uptake by the plants. Elongation of the day length in combination with the presence of G. maxima led to an increase in the number of P. chlororaphis. The presence of P. chlororaphis suppressed the growth of N. winogradskyi, but the growth of N. europaea and the potential nitrifying activities were not significantly affected. Potential denitrifying activities were stimulated by the plant, but showed no correlations with nitrifier activities or numbers. Apparently ammonium, and not oxygen, was the limiting factor for nitrification in the root zone of G. maxima. However, when the plant did not deplete the ammonium pool, P. chlororaphis could repress the nitrifiers indicating the latter's poor competitive status with respect to oxygen when the presence of root exudates allows for heterotrophic oxygen consumption.

AB Standard exploiter-victim models assume an instantaneous connection between foraging and population dynamics. However, in nature this connection is inevitably time-delayed: it takes time to convert food into offspring. R. Arditi and L. R. Ginzburg proposed that this time delay implies ratio-dependent exploitation. Models with ratio-dependent exploitation predict that primary productivity has no impact on food chain length and that the standing crop of all trophic levels increases linearly with increasing primary productivity. Conversely, the traditional victim-dependent models imply that food chain length increases with increasing primary productivity and that only top trophic levels and trophic levels that are an even number of links below the top respond positively to increasing primary productivity. We study the impact of time-delayed numerical responses on predator isoclines, and we do not find support of the theoretical arguments of Arditi and Ginzburg. We also review data on biomass patterns in plants and herbivores, which seem to support the predictions of the victim-dependent model.

AB An important challenge in several disciplines is to understand how sudden changes can propagate among coupled systems. Examples include the synchronization of business cycles, population collapse in patchy ecosystems, markets shifting to a new technology platform, collapses in prices and in confidence in financial markets, and protests erupting in multiple countries. A number of mathematical models of these phenomena have multiple equilibria separated by saddle-node bifurcations. We study this behaviour in its normal form as fast-slow ordinary differential equations. In our model, a system consists of multiple subsystems, such as countries in the global economy or patches of an ecosystem. Each subsystem is described by a scalar quantity, such as economic output or population, that undergoes sudden changes via saddle-node bifurcations. The subsystems are coupled via their scalar quantity (e.g. trade couples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling moves the locations of their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which sudden changes can propagate: they can cascade (one causing the next), or they can hop over subsystems. The latter is absent from classic models of cascades. For an application, we study the Arab Spring protests. After connecting the model to sociological theories that have bistability, we use socioeconomic data to estimate relative proximities to tipping points and Facebook data to estimate couplings among countries. We find that although protests tend to spread locally, they also seem to 'hop' over countries, like in the stylized model; this result highlights a new class of temporal motifs in longitudinal network datasets.

AB Vegetation in semideserts often self-organizes into spatial patterns. On gentle slopes, these typically consist of stripes of vegetation running parallel to the contours, separated by stripes of bare ground. The Klausmeier model is one of the oldest and most established of a number of mathematical models for this "banded vegetation." The model is a system of reaction-diffusion-advection equations. Under the standard nondimensionalization, one of its dimensionless parameters (v) reflects the relative rates of water flow downhill and plant dispersal and is therefore very large. This paper is the fifth and last in a series in which the author provides a detailed analytical understanding of the existence and form of pattern solutions (periodic travelling waves) of the Klausmeier model, to leading order as v -> infinity. The problem is a very rich one because the underlying mathematics depends fundamentally on the way in which the migration speed c scales with.. This paper concerns the case 1 - O(c) and c - o(v(1/2)) as v -> infinity. The author derives leading order expressions for the curves bounding the parameter region giving patterns, and for the pattern forms in this region. An important consequence of this is leading order formulae for the maximum and minimum rainfall levels for which patterns exist. The author demonstrates via numerical simulations that a decrease in rainfall through the minimum level for patterns causes a transition to full-blown desert that cannot be reversed by increasing the rainfall again.

AB Context. The expansive grassland biome is one of the most extensively transformed in South Africa, yet no strategy for monitoring its integrity is in place. A grassland health program, incorporating different ecosystem levels, was recently initiated. The suitability of three taxonomic groups as indicators has been tested so far: vegetation (by calculating an ecological index value, El), insects (using the South African grassland scoring system, SAGraSS) and small mammals (this study). All of these methods aim to be rapid and easy to perform. Whereas SAGraSS still needs further refinement, several factors already indicate the importance of including small mammal community parameters in integrity assessments.
   Aims. This contribution reports on more than 12 years of results from various studies on small mammals in the Free State Grasslands, with the aim of exploring the utility of small mammal survey for assessment of ecosystem integrity.
   Methods. The hypothesis was based on the outcomes of several short-term studies conducted in the grassland biome. Combining all previous results, this paper re-evaluates the parameters of trap success, species richness, diversity, evenness and individual species as bio-indicators.
   Key results. By combining data from many sites and years, the effect of seasonal and inter-annual variations in habitat and population parameters was diminished, and a more general picture of small mammal community structure revealed. New insights were gleaned into the status of several indicator species. By providing a summary of small mammal community parameter scores and indices, the study establishes a benchmark for future small mammal assessments and monitoring. To be effective, small mammal surveys in the grassland biome of southern Africa should be carried out in autumn and early winter.
   Conclusions. This study suggests that small mammal species richness and diversity decline with habitat degradation; that the generalist rodent Mastomys coucha dominates community numbers at low ecological integrity; that the number of specialist species increases towards ecological climax; and that specific species act as indicators during the successional process.
   Implications. This study should benefit the monitoring, conservation and management of grassland ecosystems, make environmental impact assessments more effective, and identify new topics for ecological research.

AB We compiled and analyzed long-term data, including chemical, physical and phytoplankton community data, for the Lake Biwa ecosystem from 1962 to 2003. Analyses on environmental data indicate that Lake Biwa had experienced intensified eutrophication (according to total phosphorus concentration) in the late 1960s and returned to a less eutrophic status around 1985, and then exhibited rapid warming and thus increased water column stability since 1990. Total phytoplankton cell volume largely followed the trend of total phosphorus concentration, albeit short-term fluctuations existed. However, phytoplankton community shifted dramatically in response to those changes of environmental states. These shifts were cause by changes in trophic status driven by phosphorus loadings and physical properties in the water column driven by warming. Moreover, most phytoplankton species did not show a strong linear correlation with environmental variables, suggesting nonlinear transitions among different states.

AB Mitochondrial DNA sequences were used to investigate phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships among Australian freshwater shrimp from the genus Caridina H. Milne Edwards, 1837 (Atyidae) and congeners from potential source populations throughout the Indo-West Pacific region. Numerous Australian taxa have close evolutionary relationships with non-Australian taxa from locations throughout the region, indicating a diverse origin of the Australian freshwater fauna. This implies many colonisations to or from Australia over a long period, and thus highlights the surprising adeptness of freshwater shrimp in dispersal across ocean barriers and the unity of much of the region's freshwater biota. Interestingly, a study on Australia's other main genus of atyid shrimp, Paratyar Miers, 1882, inferred only a single colonisation. A number of potential species radiations within Australia were also identified. This agrees with patterns detected for a large number of Australian freshwater taxa, and so implies a vicariant explanation due to the development of colder, dryer climates during the late Miocene/early Pliocene.

AB Acris crepitans is a small, semiaquatic member of the treefrog family Hylidae. Much recent attention has been paid to this species because of reports of population declines and malformations, yet few Works have considered the skeletal anatomy of this common North American frog. Herein, we provide a detailed description of the morphology and adult ontogeny of the skeleton of A. crepitans, and discuss novel morphologies, interesting postmetamorphic developmental patterns, and intraspecific skeletal variation. The reduced amount of adult ossification, as well as several novel morphologies present in this species, are consistent with patterns of miniaturization seen in other anurans. For example, the skull is poorly ossified, but most of the cranial cartilages are heavily mineralized, the nasal bones are fused to endochondral ossification of the tectum nasi, the palatines are reduced, and the prootics and exoccipitals are not fused to one another (although the prootics are well-developed and ornamented). In addition, several specimens exhibit abnormalities, which might indicate that: (1) the population was under an acute malformation outbreak, (2) a high incidence of small skeletal malformations is normal in this species, (3) the population is under stress because of habitat fragmentation, (4) there is environmental deterioration in the region where the specimens were collected, and/or (5) the species is now showing signs of decline in southern Missouri. Regardless of the cause, it is clear that further examination of skeletal variability in A. crepitans, including ossification patterns and the frequency of abnormalities, is warranted.

   SYSTEMS; PLANT COMMUNITY; BLACK MESA; DISTURBANCE
AB Plant community structure is often the result of interactions between succession, disturbance, and dispersal. While some disturbances may be highly stochastic (e.g., flooding or landslides), other types of disturbance are closely linked to the current successional state of the community (e.g., fire or herbivory). For example, when herbivores preferentially feed on early successional species they may generate conditions favorable for these species and thus create a positive feedback. Positive feedbacks may create multiple stable equilibria within plant communities. We demonstrate the presence of these positive feedbacks using experiments conducted in a restored California grassland. We found that pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) preferentially forage in areas dominated by annual species, and gopher foraging activity increases the abundance of annual plants. We use a Markov chain model to identify how the foraging behavior, dispersal behavior, and population dynamics of territorial herbivores can structure a plant community across multiple spatial-scales. The model is loosely based on the biology of pocket gophers, though it is general enough to be applicable to other territorial herbivores with foraging preferences. We find that a foraging preference for early successional species can generate multiple plant communities that persist within a herbivore's territory. If juveniles are selective when searching for territories during their dispersal phase, then herbivores can also generate persistent and distinct plant communities over larger spatial scales. In this case, fixed regions of the landscape. may become occupied by herbivores for long periods (many herbivore generations) and be composed of a range of successional plant species, whereas the remaining landscape is abandoned by herbivores and becomes dominated by late successional species. This structuring of the landscape occurs even though we assume that the entire landscape is intrinsically identical.

AB In many plant species with unisexual flowers, the female flowers lack pollinator rewards and are pollinated by visitors who mistake the female flowers for rewarding male flowers. Here we present the results of observations and experiments designed to investigate pollinator discrimination and its consequences for female reproductive success in two monoecious Begonia species pollinated by deceit. Male and female flowers of B. urophylla are similar in shape, but female flowers are smaller than male flowers, while in B. tonduzii, male and female flowers have strikingly different shapes, but their petaloid tepals are similar in total area. Flower visitors displayed marked discrimination against the rewardless female flowers of both species, Seven bee species were observed on B. urophylla, and for all species taken together the relative visitation rate to male flowers was 8.6 times that to female flowers. The bee Trigona fulviventris accounted for 95% of all visits to B. tonduzii and visited male flowers 15.4 times as often as female flowers. The flower visitors of B, urophylla varied significantly in their degree of discrimination against female flowers, with visitation rates to male flowers 3.7-21.8 times those to female flowers. The two most abundant flower visitors displayed the greatest discrimination against female flowers and, although they comprised nearly 54% of all visits, were responsible for only 15% of all visits to female flowers. Thus, the relative abundance of different flower visitors on B. urophylla is a poor predictor of pollinator importance.
   In both species the inflorescence sex ratio was male-biased early in the season and female-biased later. Hand-pollination experiments revealed that fruit set in B. tonduzii was pollinator limited both during peak and late flowering, with supplemental pollination having its greatest effect late in the season when male flowers were rare. In contrast, fruit set was only weakly affected by supplemental hand-pollination in B. urophylla. The significant pollinator limitation observed in B. tonduzii and the lack of it in B, urophylla are consistent with our observation that the visitation rate to female flowers was much higher in B. urophylla than in B. tonduzii, which was due in part to the lower level of pollinator discrimination against female flowers of B. urophylla. Our finding that female reproductive success is limited by pollinator visitation in B. tonduzii indicates an opportunity for the evolution of increased resemblance between male and female flowers in this species.

AB In the guild of scavenger ants in the Mediterranean habitats studied, there was a separation of prey on the basis of size: small species took small food items, and large ants collected large items. Nevertheless, some species enlarged their range of prey sizes through social mechanisms: Aphaenogaster senilis through recruitment in relatively small retrieval groups and subsequent cooperative carrying, and the small dominant species (Pheidole pallidula, Tapinoma nigerrimum, Tetramorium semilaeve) through mass recruitment and subsequent prey dissection. Individually foraging and group-recruiting species were more likely to suffer prey interference and loss when grey were larger, whereas mass-recruiting species showed the opposite pattern, losing fewer prey to opportunistic species as prey size increased. These small ants recruited large numbers of workers on very large prey and dominated them before the other species could dissect and carry them to their nests. Each species displayed only one of these strategies, and, thus, prey size was the main factor determining the success of each strategy. Large subordinate species increased exploitation of very large prey by foraging when the three mass-recruiting species were not active, whereas the three small dominant species increased the exploitation of medium-sized and large items by foraging at night, when the diurnal large species were absent. These dominant mass-recruiting species, however, did not differ from each other in respect to prey size and activity period.

AB Coral bleaching refers to the loss of symbiotic algae by host corals, or to the loss of pig mentation by the algae themselves, causing corals to appear white or ''bleached.'' Some corals may regain algae or pigmentation and survive, but when bleaching is severe the host coral dies. Coral bleaching events have increased dramatically in the last two decades, and coral reefs throughout the world have been extensively degraded as a result. This article reviews coral bleaching for investigators working in the field of toxicology and environmental health, a group of scientists not normally exposed to this issue. Several environmental stressors have been correlated with bleaching, including fluctuations in sea surface temperatures and salinity, increased sedimentation, increased solar radiation, and contaminants such as oil and herbicides. Molecular mechanisms of bleaching are only beginning lo be investigated and are thus far poorly understood. Toxicologists have the potential to make significant contributions toward understanding anthropogenic aspects of coral bleaching and elucidating molecular mechanisms of this important environmental problem.

AB An isolate of the filamentous cyanobacterium Microcoleus sp. was obtained from black mangrove aerial root (pneumatophore) and inoculated onto young mangrove seedlings to evaluate N-2-fixation and root-colonization capacities of the bacterium under in vitro conditions in closed-system experiments. N-2 fixation (acetylene reduction) gradually increased with lime and reached its peak 5 days after inoculation. Later, it decreased sharply. The level of N-2 fixation in the presence of the plant was significantly higher than the amount of nitrogen fixed by a similar quantity of cyanobacteria on a N-free growth medium. The main feature of this root colonization was the gradual production of a biofilm in which the cyanobacterial filaments were embedded. Visible biofilm production increased with time until it completely covered the entire root system of the plant. The in-and-out movement of cyanobacterial filaments from the biofilm probably allows colonization of uncolonized portions of the root several days after the initial inoculation. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report of the artificial inoculation of cyanobacteria on marine mangroves.

AB Two coexisting gerbil species, Gerbillus allenbyi (26 g) and G. pyramidum (40 g), exhibit shared-preference optimal habitat selection. In a mosaic of stabilized sands and semistabilized dunes, both species primarily prefer the semistabilized-dune habitat. We hypothesized that foraging benefit, due to the lower amount of loess in the semistabilized dunes, is the underlying cause for this preference. We tested this by measuring foraging efficiencies (giving-up density of seeds) in both manipulated foraging substrates (sand and loess) and natural habitats (semistabilized dunes, stabilized sands, and loess plateau). We also compared harvest rates on sand and loess. We used the loess substrate and loess plateau habitat to exaggerate the effect of loess on the gerbils' foraging behavior. Regarding foraging substrate, gerbils had significantly higher foraging efficiencies on sand in the field. They also had significantly higher harvest rates on sand in the laboratory. Regarding habitats, both species were more efficient in semistabilized dunes than in stabilized sands or loess plateau. Additional results suggested that the area surrounding a foraging patch had an important role in predator avoidance. We concluded that the semistablized-dune habitat allowed gerbils to forage more efficiently in a patch, because it is easier to dig for seeds in the sandy substrate found there, and because gerbils enjoyed lower predatory risk traveling to and from the seed patch. The results supported the hypothesis that foraging benefit is the basis of the shared-preference habitat selection of the gerbil species.

AB Aim The aim was to determine how reptile populations respond to anthropogenic habitat modification and determine whether species traits and environmental factors influence such responses.
   Location Global.
   Time period 1981-2018.
   Major taxa studied Squamata.
   Methods We compiled a database of 56 studies reporting how habitat modification affects reptile abundance and calculated standardized mean differences in abundance (Hedges' g). We used Bayesian meta-analytical models to test whether responses to habitat modification depended on body size, clutch size, reproductive mode, habitat specialization, range size, disturbance type, vegetation type, temperature and precipitation.
   Results Based on 815 effect sizes from 376 species, we found an overall negative effect of habitat modification on reptile abundance (mean Hedges' g = -0.43, 95% credible intervals = -0.61 to -0.26). Reptile abundance was, on average, one-third lower in modified compared with unmodified habitats. Small range sizes and small clutch sizes were associated with more negative responses to habitat modification, although the responses were weak and the credible intervals overlapped zero. We detected no effects of body size, habitat specialization, reproductive mode (egg-laying or live-bearing), temperature or precipitation. Some families exhibited more negative responses than others, although overall there was no phylogenetic signal in the data. Mining had the most negative impacts on reptile abundance, followed by agriculture, grazing, plantations and patch size reduction, whereas the mean effect of logging was neutral.
   Main conclusions Habitat modification is a key cause of reptile population declines, although there is variability in responses both within and between species, families and vegetation types. The effect of disturbance type appeared to be related to the intensity of habitat modification. Ongoing development of environmentally sustainable practices that ameliorate anthropogenic impacts is urgently needed to prevent declines in reptile populations.

AB Short-scale interactions yield large-scale vegetation patterns that, in turn, shape ecosystem function across landscapes. Fairy circles, which are circular patches bare of vegetation within otherwise continuous landscapes, are characteristic features of semiarid grasslands. We report the occurrence of submarine fairy circle seascapes in seagrass meadows and propose a simple model that reproduces the diversity of seascapes observed in these ecosystems as emerging from plant interactions within the meadow. These seascapes include two extreme cases, a continuous meadow and a bare landscape, along with intermediate states that range from the occurrence of persistent but isolated fairy circles, or solitons, to seascapes with multiple fairy circles, banded vegetation, and "leopard skin" patterns consisting of bare seascapes dotted with plant patches. The model predicts that these intermediate seascapes extending across kilometers emerge as a consequence of local demographic imbalances along with facilitative and competitive interactions among the plants with a characteristic spatial scale of 20 to 30 m, consistent with known drivers of seagrass performance. The model, which can be extended to clonal growth plants in other landscapes showing fairy rings, reveals that the different seascapes observed hold diagnostic power as to the proximity of seagrass meadows to extinction points that can be used to identify ecosystems at risks.

AB Since landscape attributes show different patterns at different spatial extents, it is fundamental to identify how the relation between landscape structure and plant species diversity at local scale varies with scale. Then, it is fundamental to assess the appropriate extent at which landscape factors affect plant species richness at the locarscale. To investigate this relation, data on plant species richness of forest communities at plot scale were extracted from a large data set and landscape metrics were calculated around the same plots for a range of extents (250-3000 m). Then, multiple regression models and variance partitioning techniques were applied to assess the amount of variance explained by the landscape metrics on plant species richness for a range of extents. In general, we found that increasing extent of the surrounding landscape analyzed, improved the strength of relationship between the landscape metrics and the properties of plant communities at plot scale. The medium-large extent was most informative as it combined a decent total variance explained with high variance explained by the pure fractions of complexity, fragmentation and disturbance and the minimum of collinearity. In conclusion, we found that it is possible and beneficial to identify a specific extent, where the redundancy in the predictor variables is minimized and the explanatory power of the pure fractions (or single groups) maximized, when examining landscape structure effects on local plant species richness.

AB Context Urbanisation is often regarded as a major threat to global biodiversity. Although wildlife is frequently affected by urbanisation, some species may actually benefit from it. Bats are among the commonest wild mammals in human-modified areas, and some species seem particularly well suited to exploit urban habitats where they find roosting and foraging opportunities.
   Aims We investigated habitat selection around roosts of synurbic Kuhl's pipistrelles, Pipistrellus kuhlii, in Italy.
   Methods We measured the effects of the amount of urban habitat on bat reproductive timing and success in human-modified environments.
   Key results We found that P. kuhlii selects roosts surrounded by areas featuring urban habitats, especially those subject to urban development. Colonies in cities and suburbs advanced parturition time and produced more pups than those in rural areas. Permanent water sources and artificial lights in the surrounding habitats also seemed to favour the species reproductive success, particularly in developing urban areas.
   Conclusions Our results showed that this bat benefits from urbanisation and provided new insights on the effects of this major process on animal ecology and conservation in urban environments.
   Implications Although the ecological flexibility and positive response to urbanisation of P. kuhlii may help explain its recent range expansion, the role of climate change as a potential driver of this process has yet to be tested.

AB Freshwater fish are a highly threatened group and recovery of these threatened species is an increasingly difficult ecological and social challenge. There are many different on-ground recovery actions available to managers, but no synthesis of what, how or why these recovery actions have been deployed. The present paper reviews 428 reported on-ground recovery actions from a survey of practitioners of threatened freshwater-fish recovery in Australia. Recovery actions were grouped into 12 categories, with the most commonly utilised recovery categories being harvest control, translocation, habitat enhancement and stock enhancement. Major drivers of recovery actions were general conservation concern, recovery plans and emergency responses. The number of recovery actions grew significantly in the decade beginning 2000 as the impacts of prolonged drought in south-eastern Australia intensified. In all, 58% of recovery actions occurred in the Murray-Darling Basin, although this region holds only 27% of the 74 listed threatened freshwater fish in Australia. Few or no recovery actions were reported for many species, and few actions occurred in northern or western parts of the country. More than 80% of recovery actions reportedly had some form of monitoring. The diversity of management interventions is reviewed, and patterns and issues are identified to guide future recovery efforts.

AB Fucoid assemblages dominated by Pelvetia canaliculata, Fucus spiralis, F. vesiculosus, and Ascophyllum nodosum located at two sites on the central coast of Asturias (northern Spain) were sampled monthly in 1977. Repeating the same sampling methodology, a resurvey was done in 2007 to detect changes in the abundances of the species using the previous data as a baseline. Annual net primary production was lower for all the species in 2007, and there were differences in the timing of maximum biomass for P. canaliculata and F. vesiculosus, as well as a shortening of the growth period in 2007. Associated fauna also differed between dates. Higher abundances of Gibbula spp. occurred in 2007, whereas littorinid species densities in the upper intertidal were reduced in that year. As a result, the fucoid-grazers balance changed, with P. canaliculata and particularly F. vesiculosus, being the assemblages most sensitive to change. Observed modifications were not merely fluctuations in the biomass patterns of these species, but also responses to increases in air temperature and sea surface temperature and to a shift in the frequency and seasonality of upwelling episodes. Other long-term abiotic fluctuations not directly related to global warming should also be considered as possible drivers for these changes.

AB This paper provides a synthesis of current knowledge on phytoplankton production, seasonality, and stratification in tropical African lakes and considers the effects of nutrient enrichment and the potential impacts of climate warming on phytoplankton production and composition. Tropical African lakes are especially sensitive to climate warming as they experience wide fluctuations in the thermocline over a narrow range of high water temperatures. Recent climate warming has reduced phytoplankton biomass and production in the lakes. A decline in the production of palatable chlorophytes and an increase in cyanobacteria has led to reduced zooplankton production and a consequent decline in fish stocks, all of which can be associated with the elevated water temperatures. This indicates that even moderate climate warming may destabilise phytoplankton dynamics in tropical African lakes, thereby reducing water quality and food resources for planktivorous fish, with consequent negative impacts on human livelihoods.

AB Fine-scale paleocommunity dynamics were studied in a short (similar to 16 m) section in the Middle Miocene (Badenian Stage) of the Central Paratethys, which consists of siliciclastic, pelitic, and sandy-to-gravely shallow-water deposits. Two basal, coarsening- and shallowing-upward parasequences of a late highstand systems tract are separated by a third-order sequence boundary from the deepening-upward basal part of a transgressive systems tract at the top of the section. Benthic faunas in this succession are primarily autochthonous and storm-influenced, level-bottom assemblages, but a distinct oyster-vermetid boundstone occurs near the base of the transgressive systems tract. Additionally, three tempestitic shell beds were included, which were found out of sequence in an associated basinal setting; their faunal content relates them closely to the fine-grained deepest parts of the transgressive systems tract. Ordination of species and samples using detrended correspondence analysis and analysis of similarity suggest that two basic benthic assemblages can be distinguished. The oyster-vermetid boundstone is tied to a unique set of environmental conditions and indicates a major environmental change at the sequence boundary. The faunal assemblage in the boundstone shows a weak gradient into the pelitic (deeper and quiet-water) level-bottom assemblage, which in turn is characterized by strong overlaps with the fauna of sandy (shallower and more agitated) habitats. Therefore it is concluded that the benthic assemblages in the studied section belong to the same basic metacommunity, which was not seriously affected by the strong facies changes at the sequence boundary and at the flooding surfaces. Moreover, the species in the studied benthic assemblages reacted to changes in the environment by habitat tracking.

AB Loss of genetic diversity and increased population differentiation from source populations are common problems associated with translocation programmes established from captive-bred stock or a small number of founders. The bridled nailtail wallaby is one of the most endangered macropods in Australia, having been reduced to a single remnant population in the last 100 years. A translocated population of bridled nailtail wallabies was established using animals sourced directly from the remnant population (wild-released) as well as the progeny of animals collected for a captive breeding programme (captive-bred). The aims of this study were to compare genetic diversity among released animals and their wild-born progeny to genetic diversity observed in the remnant population, and to monitor changes in genetic diversity over time as more animals were released into the population. Heterozygosity did not differ between the translocated and remnant population; however, allelic diversity was significantly reduced across all released animals and their wild-born progeny. Animals bred in captivity and their wild-born progeny were also significantly differentiated from the source population after just four generations. Wild-released animals, however, were representative of the source population and several alleles were unique to this group. Both heterozygosity and allelic diversity among translocated animals decreased over time with the additional release of captive-bred animals, as no new genetic stock was added to the population. Captive breeding programmes can provide large numbers of animals for release, but this study highlights the importance of sourcing animals directly from remnant populations in order to maintain genetic diversity and minimise genetic drift.

AB This article aims to review 1) the major and most frequent human-induced physical disturbances and their consequences on coral reef habitats using a multi-scale approach, and 2) the scale-related indicators and conceptual aspects used to detect and measure the effects of these physical impacts. By physical disturbances, we mean direct perturbations that lead to the destruction/erosion of the carbonate framework. Human-induced direct physical disturbances are numerous from coastal development, tourism, harvesting, accidents and nuclear/weapon testing. Since methods for monitoring and measuring indicators are generally scale-implicit, coral reefs are first presented according to different ecological-spatial scales of organization, from colony to region (colony, reefscape, reef zone. whole reef, island and region). In this way, it is easier to link a couple (habitat, disturbance) to their potential indicators and to the descriptors they target. Three classes of descriptors, related to the response of the living, component of coral reef ecosystem, are considered here: stony coral, reef fishes and the human uses. A synthesis of the different options for coral habitat assessments is proposed. We sort them according to their objectives (monitor, initial status or improvement of knowledge), their specificities (identification or not of a specific disturbances) and their scale of investigation (small, meso- or large scales). Usually, the majority of the indicators of human-induced disturbances are non-specific. They reveal that something is happening but not the actual causality and can only detect differences across time or space. A major weakness lies in the difficulty in deconvoluting the signals from a conjunction of stressors occurring at different scales. As such, a hierarchical concept of disturbances in coral reefs would be the next logical step to enhance our capabilities in monitoring and forecasting coral reefs status.

AB Spatial and temporal heterogeneity is a major factor structuring communities and contributing to coexistence of the species they contain. In this study we examine a critical aspect of environmental heterogeneity that is assumed to promote coexistence in two gerbil species of the Western Negev Desert. Previous studies assumed that temporal partitioning, in activity time, is the result of daily redistribution of seeds that the dominant species is the first to utilize while the sub-ordinate and efficient species is being pushed to use the later and poorer part of the night. We tested the assumption that daily afternoon winds generating spatial and temporal heterogeneity in seed availability by the redistribution of sand and seeds. This was done by comparing plots experiencing normal wind condition with manipulated plots where wind action was diminished by a shade-cloth fence. Our results show that considerable amount of sand and seeds are redistributing regularly on a time scale of a single day. Our results also show that gerbil foraging behavior is strongly related to the pattern of the redistribution dynamics of the seeds. When we prevented redistribution of seeds, gerbil foraging activity was reduced considerably. However, both seed redistribution and gerbil activity did not change much on control plots. Furthermore, the two gerbil species responded differently to the reduction in seed redistribution. The larger Gerbillus pyramidum was shown to be more sensitive to the reduction than the smaller G. a. allenbyi. Daily variability in the availability of seed resources is probably the niche axis which, together with the trade-off in foraging efficiency of the species, forms the mechanism for the coexistence of the two gerbil species in the semi-stabilized sands.

   OUTPUT
AB The optimal trade-off between offspring size and number can depend on details of the mode of reproduction or development. In marine organisms, broadcast spawning is widespread, and external coats are a common feature of spawned eggs. Egg jelly coats are thought to influence several aspects of fertilization and early development, including the size of the target for sperm, fertilization efficiency, egg suspension time, polyspermy, embryo survival, and fecundity. These costs and benefits of investment in jelly result in trade-offs that can influence optimal reproductive allocation and the evolution of egg size. I develop an optimization model that sequentially incorporates assumptions about the function of egg coats in fertilization. The model predicts large variation in coat size and limited variation in ovum size under a broad range of conditions. Heterogeneity among spawning events further limits the range of ovum sizes predicted to evolve under sperm limitation. In contrast, variation in larval mortality predicts a broad range of optimal ovum sizes that more closely reflects natural variation among broadcast-spawning invertebrates. By decoupling physical and energetic size, egg coats can enhance fertilization, maintain high fecundity, and buffer the evolution of ovum size from variation in spawning conditions.

AB Limnologists have long recognized the importance of predation in freshwater communities. The majority of study of predator effects has involved vertebrate predators, with emphasis on planktivorous fish. Documented effects of planktivorous fish have been so dramatic that manipulations of their populations are seen by many as potential tools in lake management. However, the success of such manipulations is often less than desired due to the ubiquitous complexity of food webs and the pervasiveness of compensatory responses to food web manipulation. Recently, enormous effort has been applied to the Lake Kinneret pelagic food web in effort to reduced the abundance of the planktivorous Kinneret bleak Acanthobrama terraesanctae and thereby increase the biomass of herbivorous zooplankton in the hopes of increasing water clarity. We compared potential predation pressure on Lake Kinneret herbivorous zooplankton by bleak and the other major zooplankton predators in the lake, the cyclopoid copepods Mesocyclops ogunnus and Thermocyclops dybowskii. We found that, despite having much lower biomass, cyclopoid copepods accounted for a greater portion of the predation mortality on herbivorous zooplankton than bleak. Our results suggest that reductions in predation pressure by bleak will not yield subsequent increases in herbivorous zooplankton biomass. Rather, reductions in bleak predation pressure may allow for increases in cyclopoid copepod abundance and thereby a net increase in predation pressure on herbivorous zooplankton.

ID GROWTH
AB Black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) seedlings (n=555) were grown from field-collected propagules for 3 months in a new type of terrestrial nursery. They were grown in clusters of five plants, and then they were transplanted to a clear-cut zone in a lagoon fringed by a mangrove forest at Laguna de Balandra, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Survival and plant development of transplants were monitored at 6-monthly intervals for 2 years. After 1 month, the survival of seedlings was 96%, later stabilizing at approximately 77%. After 24 months, 74% of the plants were still alive. The best cluster, showing maximum growth under mangrove swamp conditions in this arid zone, was a two-plant cluster. The lagoon has a low natural regeneration rate of 48 plants per 350 m(2) per 6 years of monitoring. This study shows the feasibility of restoring destroyed arid-coast lagoons with black mangroves.

AB The potential of two perennial species (Larrea divaricata and Stipa tenuis) to colonize different soil microsites was analyzed in the Patagonian Monte shrubland. We hypothesize that the short-lived grass S. tenuis is more able to colonize the soil of microsites beneath vegetation patches where N-fertility is higher than those in bare soil, while the long-lived shrub L. divaricata colonizes different soil microsites irrespective of their N fertility. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to evaluate the emergence and survival of both species in different soil microsites at different water, inorganic N and seed densities. In all cases soil microsites were seed limited since the addition of viable seeds increased seedling emergence. Both species showed, however, different abilities to emerge and survive in different soil microsites. Microsites of bare soil were more favourable for seedling emergence and survival of L. divaricata than those beneath vegetation patches, independent of their water status. This ability of L. divaricata can not be explained on the basis of increased water or N availability, but probably because of lower salt content of bare soil. The addition of inorganic N reduced the survival of L. divaricata in both microsites but increased individual plant performance. The emergence and survival of S. tenuis was not different in both types of soil microsites but the addition of inorganic N increased seedling emergence and plant biomass. According to these results, emergence and plant performance of S. tenuis may be promoted during humid years by increased concentration of inorganic N. Since N mineralization occurs at a higher rate in soil microsites beneath vegetation patches than in those of bare soil, higher plant performance and probably establishment of S. tenuis is to be expected. These results are consistent with an existing conceptual model of plant dynamics under various grazing intensities in the Patagonian Monte shrubland based on previous field observations.

AB This study describes patterns of geographic variation in morphometric characters of the green toad, Bufo viridis, in the western part of its distribution, including the Italian Peninsula and the islands of Sardinia and Corsica. The causes of this variation were investigated by comparing observed patterns of interpopulational differences to hypothesized factors derived from climatic and geographic variables, through the use of canonical correlation analysis and partial Mantel tests. Among-population differences in morphometric characters include both size and shape. Island populations were found to have larger body sizes than mainland populations, and there was an association between climatic factors and morphological characters. Partial Mantel tests carried out on a number of possible causal hypotheses, both climatic and geographic, suggest that a large portion of this association should be interpreted as a spurious effect of genetic isolation between island and mainland populations and of the limiting effect of geographic distance in determining gene now.

AB Coral reefs are highly complex systems characterized by mostly nonlinear relationships between biotic and abiotic components. Traditional models of reef dynamics often require unavailable data and precision, which limits their success and usefulness. We tested a new approach in coral reef modeling with fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic has been applied successfully in modeling highly nonlinear systems in engineering, decision support systems, and ecology. As part of an integrated coastal zone management model, we constructed a coral reef model that predicts changes in coral cover and diversity under anthropogenic stress, namely nutrient enrichment and increased sedimentation. The model reflects our current knowledge of the fringing reefs of Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. The seven input variables used were dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate, suspended particulate matter, maximum colony size, substratum available for colonization, coral cover, and coral diversity. Each variable was divided into three triangular fuzzy sets reflecting low, medium, and high values. For each of the 2187 possible input combinations we estimated cover and diversity after 10 years. We consulted experts with a thorough knowledge of the local reef system and have automatically accounted for interactions between the variables described above. The model clearly shows how increases in nutrient and sediment inputs affect coral cover and diversity. Although the model can be refined continuously, it appears to reflect accurately the current knowledge of reef dynamics, making a beneficial contribution to education, management, and science.

AB 1, We tested the hypothesis that the ability of parents to raise viable offspring limits clutch size in the greater snow goose (Anser caerulescens atlanticus L.), a precocial bird.
   2. We manipulated clutch size by exchanging complete clutches between pairs of nests to increase or decrease the clutch size by zero (control), one, two or three eggs in 314 nests over 2 years.
   3, Pre-fledging survival of goslings increased in enlarged broods and decreased in reduced broods compared to control. Consequently, enlarged broods fledged more offspring and the reverse was true for reduced broods.
   4. Size and mass of goslings near fledging was also higher in enlarged broods than in control, which suggests that offspring quality was also enhanced by the manipulation. This is contrary to the common trade-off between offspring numbers and quality.
   5, Large families were dominant over smaller ones in feeding sites, which could explain the increased survival and growth of enlarged bloods.
   6, Our results suggest that the ability to raise young does not limit clutch size in this species and that parents could be more successful(i.e. increase both the number and quality of their offspring) by laying more eggs. However, the time required to lay additional eggs reduces the viability of all offspring and may explain why females do not lay more eggs.

AB This paper represents a brief review of three processes operating on coral reefs and the results of studies of a fourth process, and how those results may be applied to the benefit of humankind. The areas are reef regeneration processes; bioerosion; dispersal, recruitment and biogeography of corals; and chemical ecology and natural products chemistry of reef organisms. Possible future directions for research will also be considered in each area. Regarding reef regeneration processes, coral reefs are degrading rapidly on a global scale due to over-fishing, fishing techniques causing habitat destruction, deforestation, mass mortalities of key reef species, nutrient enrichment and sedimentation. Seeding of reefs with the larvae of corals and other key reef organisms, such as echinoids, may help to promote and enhance reef regeneration in the future. Such techniques will be made possible by studies of the embryology, larval ecology, dispersal and recruitment processes, and related local physical oceanographic processes. Regarding bioerosion, both internal and external bioerosion are affected by grazers and predators. Bioerosion is also affected by nutrient enrichment, as shown through correlative studies (Great Barrier Reef) and studies of opportunity (Kaneohe Bay). Ongoing experiments such as ENCORE will help to answer questions about the role of dissolved nutrients in enhancing internal bioerosion. Questions still remain, however, regarding the role of particulates in promoting internal bioerosion and the resultant weakening of and negative growth in the reef framework. Regarding dispersal, recruitment and the biogeography of corals, it is now known that most species of coral reproduce via broadcasting, although there appear to be proportionally more brooders in the Caribbean than in the western Pacific. Differential extinctions in the western Pacific vs. the western Atlantic have contributed to the biogeographic distribution of corals we observe today and the concentric isoclines of species diversity in numerous reef organisms in the western Pacific. The role of reproductive mode in contributing to these patterns is, however, still not understood. Investigations into the roles of different larval longevities and reproductive modes may help us answer questions regarding their differential distribution and the potential effects of major perturbations such as global warming on future distributions. With respect to the chemical ecology of alcyonacean octocorals (soft corals), four functions have been determined thus far for secondary metabolites in this group, antipredation, anti-competition (allelopathy), anti-fouling, and enhancement of reproductive success. Investigations of alcyonacean reproduction has revealed that it may be necessary fur several secondary metabolites to be present simultaneously before a function may be realized or fully manifested. This raises questions regarding the manner in which novel compounds are tested by medical laboratories for bioactivity using a single compound. Simultaneously testing of multiple compounds derived from a single organism may be necessary in the future to reveal potential valuable synergistic bioactivity. Also, some novel secondary metabolites may have other valuable commercial applications, as is the case with the UV-absorbing compounds of corals and other reef organisms found on the Great Barrier Reef. In order to avoid overlooking medically or commercially valuable functions of these compounds, broader testing may be necessary.

AB A biogeochemical traverse is presented for a juvenile benthic mat covering the depth profile of an artificially stratified and eutrophicated hypersaline heliothermal pond with known gradients of temperature, salinity, pH, and light transmission. It can be shown that visual mat development depends primarily on temperature and salinity as main environmental steering variables whose increase with depth goes along with the attenuation and final disappearance of a visible microbial film in the pond's hypolimnic compartment. Recorded biogeochemical parameters (C(org) content, cell numbers, chlorophyll-a content) evidently reflect, as either biomass- or productivity-related index functions, the visually perceptible growth gradient of the microbial ecosystem along the pond slope. The observed coincidence of maxima in these index functions with maxima in deltaC-13org clearly identifies high rates of primary productivity as the agent ultimately responsible for the generation of isotopically heavy (C-13-enriched) biomass in these and related environments. Extreme demands placed on the local feeder pool of dissolved inorganic carbon by high rates of primary productivity entertained by the mat-forming microbenthos obviously give rise to severe CO2 limitation, enforcing the operation of a diffusion-(supply-)limited assimilatory pathway with an isotopically indiscriminate metabolization of the available CO2 resources.

AB A range of indicators have been proposed for identifying the elevated risk of critical transitions in ecosystems. Most indicators are based on the idea that critical slowing down can be inferred from changes in statistical properties of natural fluctuations and spatial patterns. However, identifying these signals in nature has remained challenging. An alternative approach is to infer changes in resilience from differences in standardized experimental perturbations. However, system-wide experimental perturbations are rarely feasible. Here we evaluate the potential to infer the risk of large-scale systemic transitions from local experimental or natural perturbations. We use models of spatially explicit landscapes to illustrate how recovery rates upon small-scale perturbations decrease as an ecosystem approaches a tipping point for a large-scale collapse. We show that the recovery trajectory depends on: (1) the resilience of the ecosystem at large scale, (2) the dispersal rate of organisms, and (3) the scale of the perturbation. In addition, we show that recovery of natural disturbances in a heterogeneous environment can potentially function as an indicator of resilience of a large-scale ecosystem. Our analyses reveal fundamental differences between large-scale weak and local-scale strong perturbations, leading to an overview of opportunities and limitations of the use of local disturbance-recovery experiments.

AB The current study aimed to isolate and identify japonica rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Dongjin) root-associated rhizobacteria and to investigate their ability to solubilize silicate, produce indole acetic acid (IAA), promote plant growth, and encourage silicon (Si) uptake and deposit in plants. A single bacterial isolate was selected on the basis of its silica-solubilizing ability and IAA production. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate identified it as Burkholderia eburnea CS4-2. Burkholderia eburnea CS4-2 produced high amounts of IAA at pH 8. When combined with silica fertilization, soil inoculation with CS4-2 promoted all growth attributes over those of the water-treated (control) and insoluble silica-fertilized plants. Microscopic observations also demonstrated a significant difference in the Si deposits on the leaf epidermis of rice plants under different treatments, indicating that more Si was deposited in plants fertilized with both B. eburnea CS4-2 and insoluble silica than in either insoluble silica-fertilized or water-treated plants. Inductively coupled plasma spectrometry analysis confirmed the same trend of Si concentration in whole-plant biomass of the rice that received the same treatments, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that B. eburnea CS4-2 has the ability to produce IAA under high-pH conditions, solubilize silicate, and promote plant growth.

AB Landscape-scale patterns of vegetation occur worldwide at interfaces between semiarid and arid climates. They are important as potential indicators of climate change and imminent regime shifts and are widely thought to arise from positive feedback between vegetation and infiltration of rainwater. On gentle slopes the typical pattern form is bands (stripes), oriented parallel to the contours, and their wavelength is probably the most accessible statistic for vegetation patterns. Recent field studies have found an inverse correlation between pattern wavelength and slope, in apparent contradiction with the predictions of mathematical models. Here I show that this "contradiction" is based on a flawed approach to calculating the wavelength in models. When pattern generation is considered in detail, the theory is fully consistent with empirical results. For realistic parameters, degradation of uniform vegetation generates patterns whose wavelength increases with slope, whereas colonization of bare ground gives the opposite trend. Therefore, the empirical finding of an inverse relationship can be used, in conjunction with climate records, to infer the historical origin of the patterns. Specifically, for the African Sahel my results suggest that banded vegetation originated by the colonization of bare ground during circa 1760-1790 or since circa 1850.

AB Two-phase plant communities with an engineer conforming conspicuous patches and affecting the performance and patterns of coexisting species are the norm under stressful conditions.
   To unveil the mechanisms governing coexistence in these communities at multiple spatial scales, we have developed a new point-raster approach of spatial pattern analysis, which was applied to a Mediterranean high mountain grassland to show how Festuca curvifolia patches affect the local distribution of coexisting species.
   We recorded 22 111 individuals of 17 plant perennial species. Most coexisting species were negatively associated with F. curvifolia clumps. Nevertheless, bivariate nearest-neighbor analyses revealed that the majority of coexisting species were confined at relatively short distances from F. curvifolia borders (between 0-2 cm and up to 8 cm in some cases).
   Our study suggests the existence of a fine-scale effect of F. curvifolia for most species promoting coexistence through a mechanism we call 'facilitation in the halo'. Most coexisting species are displaced to an interphase area between patches, where two opposite forces reach equilibrium: attenuated severe conditions by proximity to the F. curvifolia canopy (nutrient-rich islands) and competitive exclusion mitigated by avoiding direct contact with F. curvifolia.

AB Dryland vegetation frequently shows self-organized spatial patterns as mosaic-like structures of sources (bare areas) and sinks (vegetation patches) of water runoff and sediments with variable interconnection. Good examples are banded landscapes displayed by Mulga in semiarid Australia, where the spatial organization of vegetation optimizes the redistribution and use of water (and other scarce resources) at the landscape scale. Disturbances can disrupt the spatial distribution of vegetation causing a substantial loss of water by increasing landscape hydrological connectivity and consequently, affecting ecosystem function (e.g., decreasing the rainfall-use efficiency of the landscape). We analyze (i) connectivity trends obtained from coupled analysis of remotely sensed vegetation patterns and terrain elevations in several Mulga landscapes subjected to different levels of disturbance, and (ii) the rainfall-use efficiency of these landscapes, exploring the relationship between rainfall and remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Our analyses indicate that small reductions in the fractional cover of vegetation near a particular threshold can cause abrupt changes in ecosystem function, driven by large nonlinear increases in the length of the connected flowpaths. In addition, simulations with simple vegetation-thinning algorithms show that these nonlinear changes are especially sensitive to the type of disturbance, suggesting that the amount of alterations that an ecosystem can absorb and still remain functional largely depends on disturbance type. In fact, selective thinning of the vegetation patches from their edges can cause a higher impact on the landscape hydrological connectivity than spatially random disturbances. These results highlight surface connectivity patterns as practical indicators for monitoring landscape health.

AB How the combination of positive and negative species interactions acts to drive community dynamics is a fundamental question in ecology. Here we explore one aspect of this question by expanding the theory of predator-mediated coexistence to include the potential role of facilitation between the predator and inferior competitor. To motivate and illustrate our simple model, we focus on sea-urchin-algae interactions in temperate rocky reef systems and incorporate recruitment facilitation, a common characteristic of marine systems. Specifically, the model represents sea urchin grazing on macroalgae, macroalgal competition with crustose coralline algae (CCA), and facilitation of sea urchin recruitment to CCA. These interactions generate alternative stable states, one dominated by macroalgae and the other by urchins, which do not occur when recruitment facilitation of urchins to CCA is ignored. Therefore, recruitment facilitation provides a possible mechanism for alternative kelp forest and urchin barren states in temperate marine systems, where storm events or harvesting of urchins or their predators can drive switches between states that are difficult to reverse. In systems with such dynamics, spatial management such as no-take marine reserves may play a crucial role in protecting community structure by increasing the resilience to shifts between states.

AB Small fishes in seasonally flooded environments such as the Everglades are capable of spreading into newly flooded areas and building up substantial biomass. Passive drift cannot account for the rapidity of observed population expansions. To test the 'reaction-diffusion' mechanism for spread of the fish, we estimated their diffusion coefficient and applied a reaction-diffusion model. This mechanism was also too weak to account for the spatial dynamics. Two other hypotheses were tested through modeling. The first-the 'refuge mechanism'-hypothesizes that small remnant populations of small fishes survive the dry season in small permanent bodies of water (refugia), sites where the water level is otherwise below the surface. The second mechanism, which we call the 'dynamic ideal free distribution mechanism' is that consumption by the fish creates a prey density gradient and that fish taxis along this gradient can lead to rapid population expansion in space. We examined the two alternatives and concluded that although refugia may play an important role in recolonization by the fish population during reflooding, only the second, taxis in the direction of the flooding front, seems capable of matching empirical observations. This study has important implications for management of wetlands, as fish biomass is an essential support of higher trophic levels. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB An important issue concerning the introduction of non-indigenous organisms into local populations is the potential of the introduced individuals to spread and interfere both demographically and genetically with the local population. Accordingly, the potential of spatial dispersal among introduced individuals compared with local individuals is a key parameter to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of populations after an introduction event. In addition, if the variance in dispersal rate and distance is linked to individual characteristics, this may further affect the population dynamics. We conducted a large-scale experiment where we introduced 123 house sparrows from a distant population into 18 local populations without changing population density or sex ratio. Introduced individuals dispersed more frequently and over longer distances than residents. Furthermore, females had higher probability of dispersal than males. In females, there was also a positive relationship between the wing length and the probability of dispersal and dispersal distance. These results suggest that the distribution and frequency of introduced individuals may be predicted by their sex ratio as well as their phenotypic characteristics.

AB This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of the effects that oil pollution has on scleractinian corals. A review of results obtained in laboratory as well as in field conditions are given and suitable management tools are discussed. Studies made in the 1970s and 1980s presented conflicting results regarding the impacts of oil on coral physiology, but later results confirmed the detrimental effect of oil on corals. The world's coral reefs are severely threatened by an array of factors, one of which is oil pollution. More laboratory and field work with current oils and dispersants is urgently needed in order to update our knowledge in this field and reduce impacts in case of a major oil spill on coral reefs.

AB The relationship between chlorophyll a (Chl a) and primary productivity (PP) the uppermost water layer and the water column-based (0-15 in) integral values of those variables were examined using measurements taken in Lake Kinneret (Israel) from 1990 to 2003. In 81% of all Chl a profiles examined, the distribution was fairy uniform within the entire 0-15 in water column, and 12.3% of instances showed a prominent subsurface maximum, when the lake phytoplankton was dominated by the dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense. Chl a can be reliably estimated by remote sensing techniques in the productive and turbid water of Lake Kinneret, since Chl a concentration at surface layers can be extrapolated to the entire water column. Light vertical attenuation coefficient average for wave lengths from 400 to 700 nm, K-d, ranged from 0.203 to 1.954 m(-1) and showed high degree of temporal variation. The maximal rate of photosynthetic efficiency, P-B(OP), [average 3.16 ( +/- 1.50)], ranged from 0.25 to 8.85 mg C m(-3) h(-1) mg Chl a(-1). Using measured data of Chl a, P-B(opt). and light as an input, a simple depth-integrated PP model allowed plausible simulation of PP. However. a lack of correlation between photosynthetic activity and temperature (or other variable with remotely sensed potential) renders the use of models that require input of photosynthetic efficiency to calculate integrated PP of little value in the case of productive and turbid Lake Kinneret.

AB This paper mainly addresses the description and interpretation of different reef-building assemblages recognised within an early Messinian reef complex recently discovered along the eastern margin of the Apulia Platform (Salento Peninsula, southern Italy), It is the first Late Miocene reef recorded for the 'Adriatic region' and its location partly changes boundaries of coral reef distribution during this time in the Mediterranean. The Messinian reef complex (Novaglie Formation) is interpreted as a succession of fringing reefs accommodated in palaco-reentrances or palaeoembayments of the original Messinian rocky shore and overlying discordantly the underlying Cretaceous to Oligocene units. It consists of a discontinuous reef tract and associated clinostratified fore-reef slope. Relatively precise dating of the reef complex has been achieved using benthic foraminifera and ostracods associations. Three main different reef-building assemblages have been recognised: (1) Halimeda bioherms (2) Porites reef and (3) vermetid-microbial 'trottoirs'. Each assemblage is described in detail according to its architecture and structure (setting, shape, quantitative estimation of the framework density), biotic components (taxonomic composition and relative abundance of the reef-builders, growth form, associated fauna), and intra-reef sediment (texture and fabric). Palaeoecologic analysis, based on physical observation within the margin-slope of the reef complex and in comparison with present-day analogues and their ecological demands, indicates that distribution and vertical succession of the three different reef assemblages are strictly depth-related, suggesting an ecological replacement consequent on small relative sea-level changes (fourth order), closely comparable with those already indicated for the early Messinian. Special attention is given to the remarkable abundance of vermetids that, together with microbial crusts, formed scattered 'trottoirs' along the shoreline. Vermetid occurrences have been extensively cited in the literature for the Late Miocene of the Mediterranean but poorly studied in detail. Here, their palaeoecologic significance is emphasised, indicating that these organisms can be used as reliable palacobathymetric and palaeoclimatic indicators. Regarding the Miocene of the Mediterranean. development of vermetid-microbial 'reefs', so far recorded for the Messinian, is preferentially associated with low-diversity coral reefs and is interpreted as being mainly controlled by climatic constraints.

AB 1. Connell's (1978) intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) has been proposed as one explanation of why diversity is often highest at intermediate levels of disturbance. We used a model phytoplankton responses to environmental change (PROTECH) to investigate the validity of this hypothesis.
   2. In a simulated phytoplankton assemblage of eight species, we found that the relationship between the increased intensity of a single forcing event and diversity was described by a positively skewed curve.
   3. A progressive increase in forcing frequency introduced a sharp decrease in diversity at a threshold frequency. However, the highest diversity values were found at an intermediate frequency of disturbance.
   4. We described the shape of this breakpoint response as like a 'cliff' and reconcile it with multiple stable-point theory. It is argued that the IDH should possibly be represented by this 'cliff' relationship, which may be applied to (or encourage the re-examination of) many previous studies.

AB The purpose of the present paper is to review recent theoretical developments in food intake modelling applied to animal science and ecology. The models are divided into those that have been developed for intensive agricultural systems, and those which consider more extensive systems and natural systems. For the most part the present paper discusses models that predict the food intake of herbivores. The mechanisms of each model are discussed, along with a brief mention of the experimental support for the most popular models. We include a discussion of models that approach the study of food intake behaviour from an evolutionary perspective, and suggest that lifetime models are especially useful when food intake carries an intrinsic cost. These long timescale evolutionary models contrast with the more common food intake models, whose timescale is usually much shorter. We conclude that the 'eating to requirements' model highlights an important food intake mechanism that provides an accurate predictive tool for intensive agricultural systems. The mechanisms of food intake regulation in extensive systems are less certain, and closer links between the ideas of animal science and ecology will be helpful for improving our understanding of food intake regulation.

AB During the last three decades, intensive industrialization along the head of the Gulf of Aqaba has adversely affected the shallow water community, including the fringing coral reef. The main factors in this biodegradation and species extinction appear to be domestic and industrial effluents, dust from fertilizers from the harbor-loading station, and oil spills. In the last decade, tourism became a major negative factor, especially at the flat Coral Reserve. The most prominent result of this deterioration is the depletion of the soft-bottom communities, with a serious decline in macro-infauna, such as echinoderms and some gastropod molluscs, and the dominance of nematodes and polychaetes on the polluted sites. The decline is also documented in the intertidal Tetraclita-Cellana community, which disappeared along with accompanying species. This has also been observed in the Coral Reserve. A similar decline is also seen in tidal fish populations of blennies, gobies, and singnathids. Pollution in the Coral Reserve has also adversely affected the dominant branching coral species, destroying most of these, thus causing the almost complete disappearance of symbiotic fish species, such as Dascyllus aruanus, Gobiodon spp., Paragobiodon spp., and Pseudochromis olivaceus, that formerly sheltered in these corals. Data are provided on the endangered species of the flat littoral, including the Coral Reserve. It is suggested that only direct and immediate prevention of land-borne pollutants can halt the collapse of the littoral coral communities and, thus, enable their regeneration.

AB 1. This study describes techniques and models for identifying the distribution of grazing by domestic animals in large (> 100 km2) rangeland paddocks in arid central Australia. It also examines the relationship between grazing distribution and the characteristics of the vegetation cover.
   2. Models of grazing distribution and resultant defoliation through time use the inverse Gaussian distribution function. Additional model components describe the effects of natural decline in cover over time and the effect of past grazing on the spatial distribution of palatable species.
   3. Models are calibrated using remotely sensed vegetation cover data derived from Landsat MSS and closely reflect observed animal distributions.
   4. Fitted models show systematic variations with observed plant species composition and the amount of forage present.

AB The understanding of the determinants of small mammal community structure in arid and semi-arid ecosystems is of importance, both in the light of the role that small mammals play, and the impact of livestock grazing on the flora of these systems. In a study aimed at identifying these determinants, small mammal assemblages and environmental features were quantified at six localities (a gradient of floristic structure, with constant annual rainfall) across the southern Karoo, South Africa. Stepwise variable regression indicated that small mammal diversity was correlated with plant and rock cover, as well as plant cover and horizontal foliage diversity at intermediate heights (40-60 cm). Initially, small mammal diversity increased with increasing plant cover, but decreased at cover levels greater than 30%. This relationship is similar to that found in other desert systems, although the peak in diversity found here is at higher levels of plant cover than found previously. I suggest that this higher peak may be owing to the lack of reliance on granivory by these animals, which are relatively omnivorous. This model may therefore explain the conflicting reports on the impact of livestock grazing on desert small mammals, with small mammal diversity decreasing with grazing below the peak, and increasing with grazing above the peak.

AB Temperature often affects maternal investment in offspring. Across and within species, mothers in colder environments generally produce larger offspring than mothers in warmer environments, but the underlying drivers of this relationship remain unresolved. We formally evaluated the ubiquity of the temperature-offspring size relationship and found strong support for a negative relationship across a wide variety of ectotherms. We then tested an explanation for this relationship that formally links life-history and metabolic theories. We estimated the costs of development across temperatures using a series of laboratory experiments on model organisms, and a meta-analysis across 72 species of ectotherms spanning five phyla. We found that both metabolic and developmental rates increase with temperature, but developmental rate is more temperature sensitive than metabolic rate, such that the overall costs of development decrease with temperature. Hence, within a species' natural temperature range, development at relatively cooler temperatures requires mothers to produce larger, better provisioned offspring.

AB Processes limiting the distribution and abundance of plants are directly linked to landform characteristics. The relationships between soil characteristics and dominant xerophytes were assessed in the major landforms in the hyper-arid deserts of the Northern Emirates (NE) of the United Arab Emirates, northeast of the Arabian Peninsula. Dominant and co-dominant perennial plants were recorded in a total of 1058 stands in 13 landforms. Soil texture, electrical conductivity (EC) and pH were assessed in each stand. Two methods of multivariate analysis (TWINSPAN and DCA) classified the landforms into four groups, each with specific indicator(s) species. Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordination showed positive correlations of the halo-xerophytic shrubs along a gradient of EC. Zygophyllum qatarense and Salsola drummondi showed the highest correlation with soil salinity. The psammophytic species Cyperus conglomeratus and the shrubby Calotropis procera and Calligonum comosum are correlated along gradients of high sand content, high pH, and low EC. Acacia tortilis is correlated with increasing silt and clay and it prefers soils with low EC. The grasses Penni setum divisum and Panicum turgidum are located around the middle of the soil texture, pH and EC gradients. The associations between A. tortilis and other species, e.g. C. comosum, Prosopis cineraria, and S. drummondi, were correlated along gradients of silt and clay. More perennials were associated with both the keystone trees A. tortilis and Prosopis juliflora, but the association was more for the first, compared to the latter species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Natural selection often results in profound differences in body shape among populations from divergent selective environments. Predation is a well-studied driver of divergence, with predators having a strong effect on the evolution of prey body shape, especially for traits related to escape behavior. Comparative studies, both at the population level and between species, show that the presence or absence of predators can alter prey morphology. Although this pattern is well documented in various species or population pairs, few studies have tested for similar patterns of body shape evolution at multiple stages of divergence within a taxonomic group. Here, we examine morphological divergence associated with predation environment in the livebearing fish genus Brachyrhaphis. We compare differences in body shape between populations of B. rhabdophora from different predation environments to differences in body shape between B. roseni and B. terrabensis (sister species) from predator and predator free habitats, respectively. We found that in each lineage, shape differed between predation environments, consistent with the hypothesis that locomotor function is optimized for either steady swimming (predator free) or escape behavior (predator). Although differences in body shape were greatest between B. roseni and B. terrabensis, we found that much of the total morphological diversification between these species had already been achieved within B. rhabdophora (29% in females and 47% in males). Interestingly, at both levels of divergence we found that early in ontogenetic development, females differed in shape between predation environments; however, as females matured, their body shapes converged on a similar phenotype, likely due to the constraints of pregnancy. Finally, we found that body shape varies with body size in a similar way, regardless of predation environment, in each lineage. Our findings are important because they provide evidence that the same source of selection can drive similar phenotypic divergence independently at multiple divergence levels.

AB Questions
   Do spatial and temporal patterns of encroachment of Pinus contorta and Abies grandis in a montane meadow suggest strong biotic controls on the invasion process?
   Location
   Forest-meadow mosaic, 1350 m a.s.l., Cascade Range, Oregon, US.
   Methods
   We combined spatial point pattern analysis, population age structures, and a time-series of stem maps to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of conifer invasion over a 200-yr period in three plots totaling 4 ha.
   Results
   Trees established during two broad, but distinct periods (late 1800s, then at much greater density in the mid-1900s). Recent invasion was not correlated with climatic variation. Abies grandis dominated both periods; P. contorta established at lower density, peaking before A. grandis. Spatially, older (>= 90 yr) P. contorta were randomly distributed, but older A. grandis were strongly clumped (0.2-20 m). Younger (< 90 yr) stems were positively associated at small distances (both within and between species), but were spatially displaced from older A. grandis, suggesting a temporal shift from facilitation to competition. Establishment during the 1800s resulted in widely scattered P. contorta and clumps of A. grandis that placed most areas of meadow close to seed sources permitting more rapid invasion during the mid-1900s. Rapid conversion to forest occurred via colonization of larger meadow openings - first by shade-intolerant P. contorta, then by shade-tolerant A. grandis - and by direct infilling of smaller openings by A. grandis.
   Conclusions
   In combination, spatial and temporal patterns of establishment suggest an invasion process shaped by biotic interactions, with facilitation promoting expansion of trees into meadows and competition influencing subsequent forest development. Once invasion is initiated, tree species with different life histories and functional traits can interact synergistically to promote rapid conversion of meadow to forest under a broad range of climatic conditions.

AB 1. Certain classes of change in the characteristics of an ecosystem, labelled regime shifts, have been observed in marine and freshwater ecosystems world-wide. Few tools, however, have been offered to detect and identify regime shifts in time-series data.
   2. We use a novel approach based on tools taken from the world of statistics, and econometrics to examine the occurrence of a regime shift in the predatory zooplankton population of Lake Kinneret, Israel. The tools are a free-knot spline mean function estimation method and a Markov-switching vector autoregression model.
   3. Our approach detected, with high probability, the occurrence of a regime shift in the zooplankton population in the early to mid-1990s. This was in-line with expectations based on similar events observed in the lake.
   4. The suggested approach is a step forward from existing approaches in that it does not require any pre-determent of threshold values but rather relies on a hidden underlying stochastic process that yields probabilities of regime shifts. Thus, it can therefore be applied without introducing any prior biases into the analysis. The approach is, therefore, an objective method in detecting the likely occurrence of a regime shift.

AB Background The unique, black, hypersaline mud mined from the Dead Sea shores is extensively used in mud packs, masks, and topical body and facial treatments in spas surrounding the lake, and in cosmetic preparations marketed worldwide, but little is known about its antimicrobiological properties.
   Methods We performed detailed microbial and chemical analysis of Dead Sea mineral mud compounded in dermatological and cosmetic preparations.
   Results Using conventional bacteriological media (with or without salt augmentation), we found surprisingly low numbers of colony-forming microorganisms in the mud. The highest counts (up to 20,000 colonies per gram, mostly consisting of endospore-forming bacteria) were obtained on sheep blood agar. Test microorganisms (i.e. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans) rapidly lost their viability when added to the mud. Zones of growth inhibition were observed around discs of Dead Sea mud placed on agar plates inoculated with Candida or with Propionibacterium, but not with Staphylococcus or Escherichia. The effect was also found when the mud was sterilized by gamma irradiation. Using S-35-labeled sulfate as a tracer, bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction could be demonstrated at a low rate (0.13 +/- 0.03 nmol/cm(3).d).
   Conclusion The antibacterial properties of Dead Sea mud are probably owing to chemical and/or physical phenomena. Possible modes of antimicrobial action of the mud in relation to its therapeutic properties are discussed.

AB In this note we compare two mathematical models of foraging that reflect two competing theories of animal behavior: optimizing and robust satisficing. The optimal-foraging model is based on the marginal value theorem (MVT). The robust-satisficing model developed here is an application of info-gap decision theory. The info-gap robust-satisficing model relates to the same circumstances described by the MVT. We show how these two alternatives translate into specific predictions that at some points are quite disparate. We test these alternative predictions against available data collected in numerous field studies with a large number of species from diverse taxonomic groups. We show that a large majority of studies appear to support the robust-satisficing model and reject the optimal-foraging model.

AB A photographic analysis was conducted at five shallow reef sites (5-6 in) at Eilat (northern Red Sea) to study changes in live coral cover during a 2-year period. Logit regression analysis showed that levels of total oxidized nitrogen (TON; NO2 + NO3) and the presence of SCUBA divers were significant explicative variables of coral partial mortality, while sedimentation rate was not significant. Sites exposed to mean TON levels above 0.4 muM TON showed significantly lower live stony coral cover and abundance per m(2), and higher partial mortality of coral colonies than sites exposed to lower TON. These findings may be useful in establishing limits for TON levels at Eilat, but must be interpreted with caution due to the complexity of nutrient dynamics in coral reefs, the uncertainty of the effects of nutrients on coral physiological processes, and the possibility of interactions among multiple coral stressors.

AB Although striking regime shifts have been observed in marine systems, mechanistic explanations for these. phenomena remain scarce. Here, we review studies of regime shifts in lakes and compare them to what has been found in marine systems to explore the extent to which lakes can be viewed as microcosms for studying essential ecosystem feedbacks in marine systems. We conclude that despite obvious differences, which have been discussed by several authors, lakes are in fact quite similar to oceans in many aspects. In particular, similar mechanisms may be involved in causing alternative attractors (and thus a tendency to show occasional regime shifts) in both systems. A striking similarity exists between the mechanisms that may have caused massive marine anoxic events in the distant past, and the shift of many deep lakes to a mode of anoxic phosphorus recycling. Biotic interactions are relatively poorly understood in the oceans. However, based on what we know from lakes, we expect competitive interactions and diffuse multi-species interactions to be a common cause of alternative attractors in marine communities. In addition, overexploitation traps are an obvious cause of multiple attractors to be expected in the oceans. These should not be limited to direct effects of human overexploitation. Shifts between overexploited and under-exploited states may happen at various trophic levels. Finally, we conclude from observed patterns and theoretical results that implications of alternative attractors will be quite different in benthic and open ocean systems. Benthic regime shifts might happen easily but can be relatively local. By contrast, open ocean shifts might not arise so easily but tend to be impressive in magnitude and scale when they happen.

AB 1. The incubation-limitation hypothesis states that clutch size in shorebirds is constrained by the ability to. incubate more than four eggs successfully. In order to test predictions from this hypothesis, clutches of northern lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) were here experimentally increased and reduced by one egg at the onset of incubation. Parental behaviour, incubation time, hatching synchrony, egg viability, hatching success and body condition of hatchlings was compared with unmanipulated clutches.
   2. Nest desertion and egg breakage was not observed in any of the experimental nests, showing that clutch enlargement did not alter the parental behaviour adversely.
   3. There were no differences among the experimental groups in male and female attentiveness, but the total nest attentiveness was lower in reduced clutches than in the other clutch sizes; nor did the parents' frequency of nest visits differ between clutch sizes.
   4. Enlarged clutches were incubated longer than controls and reduced clutches. There were, however, no significant differences among clutch sizes in partial or total clutch predation rates. Hatchability of the eggs (proportion of eggs hatching of those present in nests at the end of incubation) was marginally lower in the enlarged clutches (92.5% vs. 100% in the two other groups).
   5. Contrary to predicted, hatching success was highest in enlarged clutches. The numbers of hatched eggs calculated from Mayfield estimates of daily nest and egg survival rates were 0.93, 2.10 and 3.14 in three-, four- and five-egg clutches, respectively.
   6. When controlling for egg volume, mean body mass of newly hatched chicks was lower in clutches with five eggs than in other nests.
   7. We suggest that the lowered body condition of chicks could outweigh the benefits of laying five instead of four eggs in northern lapwings. Future studies of the selective mechanisms of clutch size in shorebirds should not only focus on the number of young that hatch, but also their quality.

AB I investigated the effects of display size and flowering phenology on fruit set in Aucuba japonica, an understory dioecious shrub pollinated by opportunistic insects. Natural variations in display size, flowering phenology, and fruit set were monitored in 1997. A hand-pollination experiment was also conducted to check whether pollen limitation was a factor in fruit set in the field. Increases in floral display size did not affect fruit set; the proportion of flowers that set fruit was almost constant irrespective of the total number of flowers per inflorescence, the total number of inflorescences per plant, and the total number of flowers per plant. The hand-pollination experiment showed that fruit set was not pollen limited despite the low mating probability that resulted from the combination of dioecism and the species' dependence on opportunistic pollinators. This was due, in part, to the fact that female flowers did not have a predetermined period of receptivity, but instead remained receptive until they received pollen. In contrast, flowering phenology did affect fruit set. Fruit set was most abundant when male and female flowering was most abundant. This suggests there was some degree of pollen limitation during the part of the flowering season when male flowers were scarce.

AB The impact of environmental conditions on the relative importance of competitive and facilitative interactions and their responses to shoot density was studied in four boreal forest bryophytes. Increased density is believed to have both a positive effect, by increasing water retention, and a negative effect, by reducing light availability. Mortality of shoot apices, offshoot production, and rates of biomass increase of both individual shoots and whole colonies were recorded in experimental monospecific, known-density colonies of Dicranum majus, Plagiochila asplenioides, Ptilium crista-castrensis, and Rhyridindelphus loreus under controlled relative humidity (four levels) and irradiance (two levels). A phenomenological model was developed, and predictions were made about the responses to increased density under different humidity and resource (light) levels. Mortality was low, but offshoot production generally decreased with density. The effects of density on growth rates varied among species and environmental conditions. As predicted, in dry environments under the high light level, growth rates of D. majus and R. loreus peaked at an intermediate density at which the positive effects of a close packing of shoots balanced the increased competition for light. In humid or dark environments, the relationships between growth rates and density were mostly monotonic and negative. Growth rates of P. crista-castrensis decreased with density under most environmental conditions, whereas density was not shown to have an effect on growth rates of P. asplenioides. The results show that relatively high light levels, compared to those found in their natural spruce forest habitat, are necessary for aggregation to facilitate growth of these bryophytes. Thus, our results indicate that competition for light, rather than a low water availability, limits the performance of individual shoots in colonies of these bryophytes under a wide range of densities and humidity conditions.

AB David Lack proposed that parental feeding ability ultimately limited clutch size in bird species in which the young were dependent upon their parents for food. However, many species can raise broods that are larger than their normal clutch size. Based on nine years of experimental results from an individually marked population of Eastern Kingbirds (Tyrannus tyrannus) breeding in central New York (USA), I test six hypotheses that have been proposed as explanations for why birds fail to lay larger, seemingly more productive clutch sizes. I modified brood sizes by adding or removing 1-2 nestlings when broods were 1-3 d old and then documented the effects of brood size and manipulated brood size on nestling size and survivorship, offspring recruitment, adult survival, and future adult reproduction. Most first clutches of the season held three eggs (62% of 503 clutches), but the proportion of young to hedge did not vary with brood size (1-5 young), and as a result, broods of five were the most productive. Lack's basic food-limitation model was thus rejected. Although nestling mass and ninth-primary length at fledging declined with brood size, offspring survival during the immediate 10-12 d period after fledging was unrelated to nestling mass or lengths of the tarsus or ninth primary. The findings that the underweight young in broods of four and five did not suffer disproportionate mortality and that they were just as likely to appear as recruits in future years led to a rejection of the extended version of Lack's food-limitation model.
   Comparisons of annual variation in the relationship between productivity and brood size showed that productivity increased with brood size in eight of nine years (significant in six years). Thus, high temporal stochastic variation in conditions for rearing young (the "bad-years" hypothesis) is unlikely to explain the relatively small clutch size of kingbirds. Predictions of two other hypotheses that predict asymmetrically low survivorship of young in large broods (the "cliff-edge" and "brood-parasitism" hypotheses) were also rejected. On the other hand, evidence suggested that females individualize clutch size such that each female lays a clutch that matches her individual feeding ability.
   Although fledgling production was not adversely affected by experimental increases in brood size, most enlarged broods lost young during the 10-12 d immediately after fledging. Thus, enlarged broods ultimately produced no more independent young than did control broods that began with the same number of eggs, Fledgling deaths were not related to nestling mass or size, and recruitment was independent of manipulations. Survival and fecundity costs of reproduction also existed for females. Male survival (68%) was independent of the number of young that had been raised (0-5 young), and future breeding efforts were not compromised by elevated effort in the past year. However, females that raised broods of five were less likely to return to breed in the following year (42%) than were females that raised 2-4 young (62%). Among the survivors, females that raised enlarged broods in the preceding year also experienced more hatching failure and fledged fewer young than females that raised reduced broods in the preceding year. I suggest that costs of reproduction probably set the ultimate limit to clutch size in Eastern Kingbirds. I did not test the hypothesis that high rates of nest predation favor the evolution of small clutch size, but given that predators destroyed similar to 50% of nests each year, it is also likely that nest predation has contributed to the evolution of the current clutch size of kingbirds. Whether a female produces a clutch of three or four eggs is probably determined by individual differences in parental ability, which may be related to either intrinsic properties of the female or territory quality.

AB 1. Daphnia lumholtzi is a subtropical, Old World species which is rapidly spreading throughout reservoirs in the southern U.S.A. It was first recorded in Lake Texoma (Oklahoma-Texas) in September 1991.
   2. Southern U.S. reservoirs typically have strong spatial and temporal gradients in temperature, conductivity, turbidity and in the distribution of organisms. Therefore, the present experiments examined the reproductive and moulting rates, and survival of D. lumholtzi in relation to extremes of food concentration, temperature, conductivity and turbidity.
   3. Increases in temperature (range 15-29 degrees C) and decreases in turbidity (range = 0.6-470 NTU) increased reproductive and moulting rates, whereas food concentration only affected the rate of reproduction, while conductivity had no effects. Survival was affected only by temperature.
   4. Daphnia lumholtzi tolerates high temperatures (27-30 degrees C) at which other cladocerans in Lake Texoma disappear. Therefore, D. lumholtzi may exploit resources in midsummer, when there are few potential competitors.

AB Late-nesting birds frequently have a lower reproductive success than early-nesting ones. This could be a consequence of seasonal variations in environmental conditions or because Bate-nesting parents an of lower quality than early-nesting ones. We tested the hypothesis that a difference between early and late parents: in their ability to raise viable offspring could explain the seasonal decline in offspring growth and survival in the Greater Snow Goose Anser caerulescens atlanticus, a species with self-feeding precocial young. Over two years, se exchanged complete clutches between early and late parents, to change the hatching dart: experienced by parents. We exchanged eggs between 164 experimental nests, whose hatching dates differed by 0 to 9 days ((x) over bar = 3 days). We detected no seasonal effect on survival rate in the sample of experimental nests, but there was a seasonal decline of growth rate. When delaying or advancing hatching, the fostered goslings grew respectively slower or faster compared to the parents' original hatching date, indicating that variations in environmental conditions are responsible for seasonal variation of growth. However, growth of experimental goslings did not differ from unmanipulated goslings hatched at the same date, indicating that parental duality did not contribute to seasonal variations of growth rate. We conclude that the seasonal variation in reproductive success is not caused by a difference in parental quality between early and late nesters, but mostly by environmental factors directly related to the date df the season.

AB A 10-year sheep grazing experiment was conducted in southern Patagonia to test the hypothesis that high stocking rates would promote transitions from open grasslands to dwarf shrublands. Treatments included three stocking rates and an exclosure. Total aerial vegetation cover grew in all treatments, but especially under low stocking rates and exclosure. Short grasses and herbaceous dicots increased significantly in these last treatments. Bunchgrasses increased under low stocking rates, but decreased in the exclosure. Cover of dwarf shrubs did not change in any treatment. Diversity of the community, measured in Shannon-Wiener and species richness index, increased in the exclosure, and species richness was reduced under high stocking rates. Transitions were explored by means of PCA. While all treatments moved along the axes of the multivariate space, we detected no thresholds and found no indications of having induced transitions to alternate states with the grazing treatments imposed.
   The open grasslands at our experimental site could be considered stable states induced by a century of domestic grazing, and they withstood 10 years of grazing at 0.60 sheep ha(-1) without unfavourable transitions. Even though, loss of palatable species and diversity could indicate that moderate, variable stocking rates (average 0.40 sheep ha(-1)) would be closer to 'sustainable' in the long-term. Vegetation seems to retain the ability to build up cover and diversity after a stocking rate reduction. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB The controversy over whether wolves (Canis lupus) can regulate ungulate numbers is difficult to assess, owing to data limitations, relaxation of predator control, and the fact that current predator-prey theory was developed from the study of invertebrate populations. A ratio-dependent predator-prey model appears to be supported by data on predation on ungulates, and the data indicate that wolves have a significant impact on numbers of moose (Alces alces), and thus can exert a regulatory effect on that species.

AB A simple mathematical model has been formulated to model a simple rotational grazing system of two fields, where a mob of animals is grazed first in one field, then the other By using linear functions for the rate of herbage mass accumulation and for the rate of animal herbage intake, this system may be solved explicitly to yield expressions for (1) the total intake per animal over the time period, and (2) the total remaining herbage after grazing.
   Regarding the swap over time as an optimal control variable, these expressions can be optimized. The results are analysed for various initial conditions, including stocking rate, initial biomass in each field, and field area.
   Comparisons are made with continuous grazing. Extensions to the model are discussed.

AB Increasing food production is essential to meet the future food demand of a growing world population. In light of pressing sustainability challenges such as climate change and the importance of the global livestock system for food security as well as GHG emissions, finding ways to increasing food production sustainably and without increasing competition for food crops is essential. Yet, many unknowns relate to livestock grazing, in particular grazing intensity, an essential variable to assess the sustainability of livestock systems. Here, we explore ecological limits to grazing intensity (GI; i.e. the fraction of net primary production consumed by grazing animals) by analysing the role of seasonality in natural grasslands. We estimate seasonal limitations to GI by combining monthly net primary production data and a map of global livestock distribution with assumptions on the length of nonfavourable periods that can be bridged by livestock (e.g. by browsing dead standing biomass, storage systems or biomass conservation). This allows us to derive a seasonality-limited potential GI, which we compare with the GI prevailing in 2000. We find that GI in 2000 lies below its potential on 39% of the total global natural grasslands, which has a potential for increasing biomass extraction of up to 181 MtC/yr. In contrast, on 61% of the area GI exceeds the potential, made possible by management. Mobilizing this potential could increase milk production by 5%, meat production by 4% or contribute to free up to 2.8 Mio km(2) of grassland area at the global scale if the numerous socio-ecological constraints can be overcome. We discuss socio-ecological trade-offs, which may reduce the estimated potential considerably and require the establishment of sound monitoring systems and an improved understanding of livestock system's role in the Earth system.

AB Theory suggests that gradual environmental change may erode the resilience of ecosystems and increase their susceptibility to critical transitions. This notion has received a lot of attention in ecology in recent decades. An important question receiving far less attention is whether ecosystems can cope with the rapid environmental changes currently imposed. The importance of this question was recently highlighted by model studies showing that elevated rates of change may trigger critical transitions, whereas slow environmental change would not. This paper aims to provide a mechanistic understanding of these rate-induced critical transitions to facilitate identification of rate sensitive ecosystems. Analysis of rate sensitive ecological models is challenging, but we demonstrate how rate-induced transitions in an elementary model can still be understood. Our analyses reveal that rate-induced transitions 1) occur if the rate of environmental change is high compared to the response rate of ecosystems, 2) are driven by rates, rather than magnitudes, of change and 3) occur once a critical rate of change is exceeded. Disentangling rate-induced transitions from classical transitions in observations would be challenging. However, common features of rate-sensitive models suggest that ecosystems with coupled fast-slow dynamics, exhibiting repetitive catastrophic shifts or displaying periodic spatial patterns are more likely to be rate sensitive. Our findings are supported by experimental studies showing rate-dependent outcomes. Rate sensitivity of models suggests that the common definition of ecological resilience is not suitable for a subset of real ecosystems and that formulating limits to magnitudes of change may not always safeguard against ecosystem degradation.

AB The stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH) predicts that the balance of plant-plant interactions shifts along abiotic environmental gradients, with facilitation becoming more frequent under stressful conditions. However, recent studies have challenged this perspective, reporting that positive interactions are, in some cases, more common at the intermediate level of environmental severity gradients. Here, we test whether and how neighbour effects by Silene acaulis cushions vary along a 700m wide altitudinal transect, in relation to cushion morphological traits and environmental severity. Field measurements along the gradient, within and outside cushions, included (i) species richness and cover of coexisting vascular plants; (ii) cushion morphology; (iii) above- and below-ground microclimate; and (iv) soil quality. We used the relative interaction index to decouple neighbour trait effects and environmental severity effects on plant diversity at different elevations. The ability of the cushion plant to facilitate heterospecifics shifts considerably along the elevation gradient, being greatest at the intermediate level. On the other hand, Silene morphological traits steadily change along the gradient, from lax, soft and flat-shaped cushion habits at low elevation to tightly knit and dome-shaped habits at high elevation. Cushion morphological changes are associated with mitigating effects on microclimate, indicating that cushions effectively act as a heat-trap at medium and high elevations, while at low elevations the soft and flat cushions avoid excessive heat accumulation by tight coupling with the surrounding atmosphere. At the upper end of the gradient, cushion cespitose-pulvinate compactness and high stem density appear to be critical traits in modulating the net effect of plant-plant interaction, since the space available for hosting other vascular species is considerably reduced. In conclusion, this work provides a mechanistic link between plant morphological traits, associated biogenic microclimate changes and variation in net plant-plant interactions along the explored severity gradient. Our findings support an alternative conceptual model to SGH, with plant facilitation collapsing at the upper extreme of the abiotic stress gradient.

AB Chinese white dolphins (Sousa chinensis) inhabiting shallow coastal waters are vulnerable to impacts from human activities in the near shore waters. This study examined the population of Chinese white dolphins occurring off the coast of Zhanjiang in the northern South China Sea. A total of 492 Chinese white dolphins were identified, 176 of which were photographed on more than one occasion. The Zhanjiang Chinese white dolphin population is isolated from populations of conspecifics along the Guangdong coast. It is composed of approximately 1485 individuals (95% CI 5 1371-1629; SE 5 63.8), with estimates of mean representative range and core area of 168.51 and 44.26 km(2), respectively. The high site fidelity and long-term residence of Chinese white dolphins in the study area are well established. A review of all available data indicates that based on what is currently known, the Zhanjiang Chinese white dolphin population is the second largest of the species and genus in the world. However, the recent industrial boom along the Zhanjiang coast has increased concerns regarding the conservation of the Zhanjiang Chinese white dolphin population. We recommend the designation of a national nature reserve as a most urgent measure for protecting Chinese white dolphins in Zhanjiang waters.

AB The effectiveness of fauna reintroduction programs has been limited by the availability of source animals and the lack of follow up monitoring to assess whether viable populations have been successfully established, particularly in terms of conserving genetic diversity. Here we present genetic assessment of the translocation of golden bandicoots (Isoodon auratus) from a large source population on Barrow Island off the north-west coast of Western Australia to two other island sites and a mainland fenced enclosure. We assessed the genetic diversity of animals translocated to each site and their wild-born progeny, and whether wild-born animals showed evidence of genetic bottlenecks or genetic drift from the source population. Encouragingly, we found no significant loss of genetic diversity in any of the wild-born populations compared to the source population and no significant increase in inbreeding or relatedness amongst wild-born individuals compared to founder populations two years post-translocation. However, we detected an approximately 10-fold reduction in effective population size between founding and wild-born populations. We found no apparent differentiation between wild-born populations and the original source population, or between wild-born animals and their respective founders. Population viability modeling predicts that each of the translocated populations is susceptible to loss of genetic diversity over time. Taken together these results suggest that the golden bandicoot reintroduction program has been initially successful as a result of large founding sizes and high reproductive rates; however, ongoing augmentation will be required to prevent genetic erosion and maintain evolutionary potential in the long-term.

AB The influence of a cement plant that incinerates industrial waste on the air quality of a region in the province of Cordoba, Argentina, was assessed by means of biomonitoring studies (effects of immission) and atmospheric dispersion (effects of emission) of PM10 with the application of the ISC3 model (Industrial Source Complex) developed by the USEPA (Environmental Protection Agency). For the biomonitoring studies, samples from the epiphyte plant Tillandsia capillaris Ruiz & Pay. f. capillaris were transplanted to the vicinities of the cement plant in order to determine the physiological damage and heavy metal accumulation (Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb). For the application of the ISC3 model, point and area sources from the cement plant were considered to obtain average PM10 concentration results from the biomonitoring exposure period. This model permitted it to be determined that the emissions from the cement plant (point and area sources) were confined to the vicinities, without significant dispersion in the study area. This was also observed in the biomonitoring study, which identified Ca, Cd and Pb, pH and electric conductivity (EC) as biomarkers of this cement plant. Vehicular traffic emissions and soil re-suspension could be observed in the biomonitors, giving a more complete scenario. In this study, biomonitoring studies along with the application of atmospheric dispersion models, allowed the atmospheric pollution to be assessed in more detail. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Predation can cause morphological divergence among populations, while ontogeny and sex often determine much of morphological diversity among individuals. We used geometric morphometrics to characterize body shape in the livebearing fish Brachyrhaphis rhabdophora to test for interactions between these three major shape-determining factors. We assessed shape variation between juveniles and adults of both sexes, and among adults for populations from high- and low-predation areas. Shape differed significantly between predation regimes for all juveniles regardless of sex. As males grew and matured into adults, ontogenetic shape trajectories were parallel, thus maintaining shape differences in adult males between predation environments. However, shape of adult females between predation environments followed a different pattern. As females grew and matured, ontogenetic shape trajectories converged so that shape differences were less pronounced between mature females in predator and nonpredator environments. Convergence in female body shape may indicate a trade-off between optimal shape for predator evasion versus shape required for the livebearing mode of reproduction.

AB Woody vegetation, as an ecosystem engineer, can modulate the landscape such that the levels of resources in its vicinity undergo positive and negative changes as far as the herbaceous vegetation is concerned. To better understand how these processes play out in a semi-arid ecosystem, we examined resource modulation by woody vegetation, and the response of herbaceous vegetation to that modulation, at a fine spatial scale. Experimental manipulations were employed to separate the positive and negative effects of water, light and seed dispersal in determining herbaceous species density and biomass in three patch types within and adjacent to the shrub (core, periphery and open). We synthesized our results into a multilayered landscape diversity (MLLD) model. Woody vegetation creates distinct multilayered resource patches at its core and periphery which do not correspond to the dichotomous structural pattern of shrub canopy versus intershrub background. The combined effect of these multilayered resource patches had higher herbaceous species density (8.2 vs. 4.0 species 400 cm(-2)) and herbaceous biomass (5.4 vs. 1.0 g 400 cm(-2)) in the periphery than in the core (3-yr averages). The periphery's net positive effects are due to enhancement of soil properties (water infiltration depth of 11.1 cm at periphery vs. 8.1 cm at core), while the core's net negative effects are due to modulation of seed (seed abundance per seed trap of 44.2 at periphery vs. 3.0 at core) and light availability (PAR transmittance of 41.9 % at periphery vs. 16.5 % at core) by the shrub canopy. Thus, when examined at this fine spatial resolution, woody vegetation has both net positive and net negative effects on herbaceous vegetation. Analysis of our results by means of the MLLD model emphasizes the importance of examining the landscape at the spatial scale of the modulated resources and of recognizing different patch types and their differing effects on herbaceous vegetation.

AB The success of seedling establishment of desert plants is determined by seedling emergence response to an unpredictable precipitation regime. Sand burial is a crucial and frequent environmental stress that impacts seedling establishment on sand dunes. However, little is known about the ecological role of seed mucilage in seedling emergence in arid sandy environments. We hypothesized that seed mucilage enhances seedling emergence in a low precipitation regime and under conditions of sand burial. In a greenhouse experiment, two types of Artemisia sphaerocephala achenes (intact and demucilaged) were exposed to different combinations of burial depth (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 mm) and irrigation regimes (low, medium and high, which simulated the precipitation amount and frequency in May, June and July in the natural habitat, respectively). Seedling emergence increased with increasing irrigation. It was highest at 5 mm sand burial depth and ceased at burial depths greater than 20 mm in all irrigation regimes. Mucilage significantly enhanced seedling emergence at 0, 5 and 10 mm burial depths in low irrigation, at 0 and 5 mm burial depths in medium irrigation and at 0 and 10 mm burial depths in high irrigation. Seed mucilage also reduced seedling mortality at the shallow sand burial depths. Moreover, mucilage significantly affected seedling emergence time and quiescence and dormancy percentages. Our findings suggest that seed mucilage plays an ecologically important role in successful seedling establishment of A. sphaerocephala by improving seedling emergence and reducing seedling mortality in stressful habitats of the sandy desert environment.

AB The main objective of this study was to determine to what extent grazing pressure and timing modulate the seasonal progression of herbage quality in hilly Mediterranean grassland systems. The study was conducted during six consecutive years between 2003 and 2008 at the Karei Deshe experimental farm, in eastern Galilee, Israel, dominated by rich hemicryptophytic grassland. Treatments included two different grazing intensities, heavy and moderate, with 1.1 and 0.55 cows ha-1, respectively, and management that included a continuous and a seasonal stocking system that was divided at both intensities into early and late grazing. Herbage samples were analysed for digestibility, crude protein, neutral detergent fibre and acid detergent fibre contents. Significant differences in herbage quality were found between seasons and years. Herbage quality was significantly higher in paddocks grazed continuously or early in the season. Herbage quality increased with increasing grazing intensity as younger herbage and continued re-growth were maintained during the green season. The greater difference between herbage qualities was found at the peak of the growing season. The significant differences found in herbage quality emphasize the importance of the decision-making process aimed at improving cattle grazing management in Mediterranean rangelands and its consequences for the sustainability of the system.

AB A survey was conducted in an 11-year recovery mobile dune (RMD11) and a 20-year recovery mobile dune (RMD20), in Horqin Sandy Land, Northern China, to determine plant distribution at the mobile dune scale and its relevance to soil properties and topographic features. The results showed that (1) vegetation cover and species number increased from dune top to bottom in the restoration process of mobile dune; (2) the average value of soil organic C, total N, pH, relative height of sampling site, very fine sand content and soil water contents (40-60 and 60-80 cm) of RMD11 were less than that of RMD20, respectively, and there were significant differences (P < 0.05) between the two dunes; (3) soil resources were redistributed by shrub restoration and relative height of sampling site on dune. The distribution of sand pioneer plant, Agriophyllum squarrosum, was positively related to the relative height of sampling site and soil water content, while that of other herbaceous plants was positively related to soil nutrients in the restoration process of mobile dune. These results suggest that at mobile dune scale, plant distributions are determined by a combination of soil properties and topographic feature. Much effort should be made to preserve the interdune lowland and to improve the level of soil nutrients on mobile dune.

AB We reported a special type of lamination formed in the sediments of Lake Xiaolongwan, northeastern China. The lamination consists of light- and brown-colored laminate couplets in the thin sections. The brown-colored layer is composed mainly of dinoflagellate cysts. The grey-colored layer consists of other organic and siliceous matter (plant detritus, diatoms, chrysophyte cysts) and clastics. Preliminary sediment trap results show that a distinct peak of dinocyst flux occurred in November. The dinocyst flux maximum also corresponds to the peaks of diatom flux and chrysophyte stomatocyst flux. These suggest that "red tide blooms" occur in this freshwater lake. We speculate that the dinocyst flux maximum could be related to autumn overturn due to increased nutrients, and the availability of cysts for germination from the lake bottom. Additionally, it may also reflect increasing dissolved organic matter after leaf fall. An independent chronology derived from Cs-137 and (210) Pb shows a good agreement with counted laminations. From the sediment trap data and the independent chronology data, the dinocyst microlaminae appear to be annually laminated, and probably could be called dinocyst varves. Although vegetative (thecate stage) cells of Peridinium volzii and Ceratium furcoides are found in the water samples, it is not possible to relate the dinocysts to these two dinoflagellate species. Based on morphological and ecological analyses, we suggested that they have affinities with species of Peridinium (sensu lato), most probably to P. inconspicuum. Detailed investigations should be carried out to understand the red tide history in this freshwater lake. Annually laminated dinocyst microlayers in freshwater and marine sediments not only provide an uncommon archive for understanding the history of red tides and harmful algal blooms, and why and how certain species periodically bloom over several thousands years, but also provide important records of paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic changes at seasonal to annual resolution.

AB 1. Among small animals dispersal parameters are mainly obtained by traditional methods using population studies of marked individuals. Dispersal studies may underestimate the rate and distance of dispersal, and be biased because of aggregated habitat patches and a small study area. The probability of observing long distance dispersal events decreases with distance travelled by the organisms. In this study a new approach is presented to solve this methodological problem.
   2. An extensive mark-release-recapture programme was performed in an area of 81 km(2) in southern Sweden. To estimate the required size of the study area for adequate dispersal measures we examined the effect of study area size on dispersal distance using empirical data and a repeated subsampling procedure. In 2003 and 2004, two species of diurnal burnet moths (Zygaenidae) were studied to explore dispersal patterns.
   3. The longest confirmed dispersal distance was 5600 m and in total 100 dispersal events were found between habitat patches for the two species. The estimated dispersal distance was strongly affected by the size of the study area and the number of marked individuals. For areas less than 10 km(2) most of the dispersal events were undetected. Realistic estimates of dispersal distance require a study area of at least 50 km(2).
   4. To obtain adequate measures of dispersal, the marked population should be large, preferably over 500 recaptured individuals. This result was evident for the mean moved distance, mean dispersal distance and maximum dispersal distance.
   5. In general, traditional dispersal studies are performed in small study areas and based on few individuals and should therefore be interpreted with care. Adequate dispersal measures for insects obtained by radio-tracking and genetic estimates (gene flow) is still a challenge for the future.

AB [1] Positive feedbacks between vegetation and soil moisture may induce, in arid ecosystems, the emergence of two alternative stable states, corresponding to bare and completely vegetated soil. A new analytical model is developed to investigate this behavior and to study the effects of interannual rainfall variability on the dynamics of bistable ecosystems. When dichotomic Markov noise is used to account for the effect of random rainfall fluctuations, the long-term dynamics of the system can be investigated through an analytical solution of the model. It is found that in a broad class of bistable ecosystems, random rainfall fluctuations may induce an ordered state in the dynamics, i.e., by turning the bistable deterministic system into a stochastic system with only one statistically stable state. This effect is enhanced by increases in noise intensity, whereas the stochastic dynamics become bistable (i.e., the noise-induced ordered state disappears) as the noise intensity decreases below a critical (nonnull) value. This effect of noise-induced stability is found in association with an enhancement of ecosystem resilience, indicating that the likelihood of catastrophic shifts to the desert state decreases as the noise intensity increases.

AB In desert environments the main input to the seed bank of many succulents is the seed rain through zoochory while high levels of granivory by rodents, birds and ants are the main cause of subsequent losses. In the patchy environment of arid lands the characteristics of both processes may vary between habitats causing differences in the recruitment of new genets. To test this hypothesis we used populations of the desert cactus Opuntia rastrera which has different recruitment rates in the two adjacent habitats where it grows. In Opuntia-dominated scrublands (nopaleras, density ca. 4,000 plants/ha) 1 seedling out of 7,000,000 seeds establish, whereas in grasslands (density ca. 100 plants/ha) this ratio is 1:20,000. From 1996 until 1998 the seed rain, seed removal by granivores and seed abundance in the soil were monitored in both habitats. Results showed striking differences in the dynamics of the seed bank of both habitats. Seed rain was 8.5 times bigger in nopaleras than in grasslands. In nopaleras most seeds were removed by rodents while the quantities of seeds removed by rodents, birds and ants in grasslands were similar. One year after dispersal (the time necessary to break seed dormancy) only 6% of original nopalera seeds and 12% of grassland seeds remained. After germination trials only 1% (ca. 15,000 seeds/ha) and 2% (ca. 2,500 seeds/ha) respectively were viable. These differences in the effective seed bank (6 times bigger in nopaleras) can not explain the differences in genet recruitment (which is several orders of magnitude bigger in grasslands). Apparently the between habitat difference in nurse plant availability and in rodent density (which inflict a strong hervibory upon seedlings) can explain the differences in genet recruitment. It is speculated that this between habitat difference in genet recruitment suggests that the species evolved in less extreme environments (e. g. grasslands) than desert scrublands which, in turn, are colonised due to the singular ability of O. rastrera for vegetative propagation.

Three cladocerans (Ceriodaphnia cornuta, Moina micrura, Diaphanosoma excisum), one calanoid copepod (Heliodiaptomus viduus), and one cyclopoid copepod (Mesocyclops thermocyclopoides) were studied. Filtered seston (45 mu m mesh) from a local pond was used for food. Two food concentrations were employed: (1) 10 mu g chlorophyll l(-1) (ca 0.25 mg Cl-1), and (2) 50 mu g chlorophyll l(-1) (ca 1.25 mg Cl-1). Food levels and water temperature (22.5, 27.5, and 32.5 degrees C) used, roughly covered the ranges found in the reservoir. Although all the three growth parameters were often affected to some degree by temperature and food, the quantitative response of the species differed. Also, the species reacted differently to the three possible interactions (i.e. food x temperature, food x instar, and temperature x instar). This contributed to the overall differences in the species responses. For the cladocerans, instar durations were always affected by temperature. The food did not affect the duration time of the adults and that of the combined juvenile instars, the latter except in one case significantly. For the two copepods food level affected the duration times of naupliar and copepodite instars, but the effect of temperature was only significant for H. viduus. The development times observed for H. viduus were extraordinary long compared with values reported in the literature for other tropical calanoids. This suggests that food conditions in our culture were adversely affecting its growth rates.

AB Mammalian herbivores are known to be extremely selective when foraging, but little is known about the mechanisms governing the selection of patches and, at a finer scale, individual plants. Visual examination and direct sampling of the vegetation have previously been suggested, but olfactory cues have seldom been considered. We examined the use of olfactory cues by foraging African elephants, Loxodonta africana, and asked whether they use plant odours to select specific patches or plants when making feeding decisions. Scent-based choice experiments between various preferred and nonpreferred plants were conducted across two spatial scales (between plants and between patches). We used coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of headspace extracts of volatile organic compounds emitted by the different plant species to explore similarities among the overall odour profiles of each species. We found that elephants selected their preferred plant species across both spatial scales, probably using differences in plant odour profiles. The ability to differentiate between plant odours allowed elephants to reduce their search time by targeting preferred plant species both within a feeding station and between patches. This suggests that olfactory cues probably play an important role in driving herbivore foraging decisions across multiple spatial scales. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Context The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) lives in remarkably close proximity to humans in the degraded and prey-depleted landscapes in Tigray in northern Ethiopia, predominantly feeding on human organic waste.
   Aims We sought to provide an estimate of spotted hyena abundance at garbage dumps and open agricultural areas across Tigray.
   Methods We used 28 calling stations, including 12 at garbage dumps and 16 in open agricultural areas located in nine randomly selected urban districts across Tigray. We also used 65 randomly placed calling stations in three districts to establish spotted hyena abundance in Tigray. We also collected 610 scat samples during wet (n=134) and dry season (n=476) so as to identify diet.
   Key results A total of 398 hyenas responded, including 356 hyenas at garbage dumps and 42 hyenas in open agricultural areas. The response at the garbage dumps was significantly higher. Approximately 2525 hyenas were estimated from 65 calling stations in three districts. There was no statistically significant difference in the diet of hyena between wet and dry seasons for any food item. Frequency occurrence of prey remains of donkeys and cattle were dominant, followed by human, goat and sheep, respectively.
   Key conclusions We infer that a very large hyena population persists in unprotected areas of Tigray in northern Ethiopia, where they concentrate around urban waste dumps at night for scavengeable food resources, mainly originating from slaughterhouse waste of livestock.
   Implications We suggest promotion of nature-based ecotourism of this exceptional coexistence of hyenas and humans in Ethiopia. We raise questions about local hyena social structure, movement, home-range, activity pattern and the implications for human-hyena coexistence.

AB We use the context of dryland vegetation to study a general problem of complex pattern-forming systems: multiple pattern-forming instabilities that are driven by distinct mechanisms but share the same spectral properties. We find that the co-occurrence of two Turing instabilities when the driving mechanisms counteract each other in some region of the parameter space results in the growth of a single mode rather than two interacting modes. The interplay between the two mechanisms compensates for the simpler dynamics of a single mode by inducing a wider variety of patterns, which implies higher biodiversity in dryland ecosystems.

AB Insect macroecology and conservation biogeography studies are disproportionately scarce, especially in the Neotropics. Dung beetles are an ideal focal taxon for biodiversity research and conservation. Using distribution and body size data on the ecologically important Phanaeini, the best-known Neotropical dung beetle tribe, we determined elevational patterns of species richness, endemism, body size, and elevational range in Bolivia, specifically testing Bergmann's and Rapoport's rule. Richness of all 39 species and of 15 ecoregional endemics showed a hump-shaped pattern peaking at 400 m, but overall declined strongly with elevation up to 4000 m. The relationship between endemic and total species richness appeared to be curvilinear, providing only partial support for the null hypothesis that species-rich areas are more likely to be centers of endemism by chance alone. An elevational increase in the proportion of ecoregional endemics suggests that deterministic factors also appear to influence endemism in the Andes. When controlling for the effect of area using different species-area relationships, the statistically significant richness peak became more pronounced and shifted upslope to 750 m. Larger species did not have higher elevational mid-points, and mean body size decreased significantly with elevation, contradicting Bergmann's rule. Rapoport's rule was supported: species with higher elevational mid-points had broader elevational ranges, and mean elevational range increased significantly with elevation. The elevational decrease of phanaeine richness is in accordance with studies that demonstrated the combined influence of temperature and water availability on species diversity, but also is consistent with niche conservatism. For invertebrates, confirmation of Rapoport's and refutation of Bergmann's rule appear to be scale-invariant general patterns. Analyses of biogeographic patterns across elevational gradients can provide important insights for identifying conservation priorities. Phanaeines with narrow elevational ranges on isolated low-elevation mountains in eastern Bolivia are at greatest climate-change related extinction risk from range-shift gaps and mountaintop extinctions.

AB Tree-grass coexistence is broadly observed in tropical savannas. Recent studies indicate that, in arid savannas, such coexistence is stable and related to water availability. The role of different factors (from niche separation to demographic structure) has been explored. Nevertheless, spatial mechanisms of water-vegetation interactions have been rarely taken into account, despite their well-known importance for vegetation distribution. Here, we introduce a spatial model including tree and grass biomass dynamics, together with soil and surface water dynamics. We consider two water-vegetation feedbacks. Grasses increase water infiltration into the soil, while tree shadow limits evaporation, and both mechanisms increase soil water availability, leading to positive feedbacks. The infiltration feedback can also lead to spatial pattern formation. Despite the fact that trees and grasses compete for the same resource, namely water, we observe stable coexistence as a possible model outcome. The system displays a complex behavior, with multiple stable states and possible catastrophic shifts between states, e.g., patterned grassland, bare soil and forest. In our model, coexistence is always linked with multi-stability and spatial pattern formation, driven by grass infiltration feedback. Given such complex model solutions, we expect that, under real conditions, heterogeneities and disturbances, acting on the multi-stable states, may further foster coexistence.

AB The hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) was implemented to model and analyze population dynamics of the different phytoplankton phyla (chlorophyta, bacillariophyta, cyanophyta and dinophyta) in relation to physical, chemical, and biological determinants and their combinations in a large lake. Biweekly measurements over a 12-year period were used as input. The validation of models obtained with HEA showed the best results for bacillariophyta and dinophyta resulting in coefficients of determination (r(2)) between the modeled and measured data of 0.54-0.79 and 0.29-0.76 for these phyla, respectively, suggesting good predictability of their dynamics. The lowest adequacy of HEA models was found for cyanophyta (r(2) of 0.28-0.46). Models that combined physical, chemical and biological inputs scored highest, whilst zooplankton-based models scored lowest in all experiments and indicated that top-down control of algal biomass could have only secondary effect. The input sensitivity analysis was used for testing the best phytoplankton models with threshold values determining high or low algal biomass and inhibitory-excitatory effects of specific parameters. Wavelets were tested to analyze two extreme cases of dinophyta dynamics in years of its exceptionally high and low developments to gain insights into lag times between the exert of key factor and algae response. Lag times extracted from daily interpolated data of highly correlated inputs of dinophyta in 1998 varied between 2 and 4 days. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Human adults tend to avoid risk. In behavioral economic studies, risk aversion is manifest as a preference for sure gains over uncertain gains. However, children tend to be less averse to risk than adults. Given that many of the brain regions supporting decision-making under risk do not reach maturity until late adolescence or beyond it is possible that mature risk-averse behavior may emerge from the development of decision-making circuitry. To explore this hypothesis, we tested 5- to 8-year-old children, 14- to 16-year-old adolescents, and young adults in a risky-decision task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquisition. To our knowledge, this is the youngest sample of children in an fMRI decision-making task. We found a number of decision-related brain regions to increase in activation with age during decision-making, including areas associated with contextual memory retrieval and the incorporation of prior outcomes into the current decision-making strategy, e.g., insula, hippocampus, and amygdala. Further, children who were more risk-averse showed increased activation during decision-making in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. Our findings indicate that the emergence of adult levels of risk aversion co-occurs with the recruitment of regions supporting decision-making under risk, including the integration of prior outcomes into current decision-making behavior. This pattern of results suggests that individual differences in the development of risk aversion may reflect differences in the maturation of these neural processes.

AB This study investigated the effects of a fully protected marine reserve on commercially valuable scallops and benthic habitats in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran, United Kingdom. Dive surveys found the abundance of juvenile scallops to be greater within the marine reserve than outside. A novel multivariate approach, based upon neural networks and generalised linear models, revealed the greater abundance of juveniles to be related to the greater presence of macroalgae and maerl within the reserve boundaries. This complex habitat appeared to have positively encouraged spat settlement. In contrast, the density of adult scallops did not differ between the two treatments, possibly due to the short duration of protection. However, the age, size and biomass of adult scallops were significantly greater within the reserve. Overall, this study suggests that the newly created marine reserve is already providing benefits which are flowing back to species targeted by fisheries, emphasising the importance of marine reserves in ecosystem-based management of fisheries.

AB The dynamics of phreatophyte vegetation are strongly coupled to those of the shallow phreatic aquifers from which phreatophytes extract water. Vegetation is able to influence the depth of the water table, which, in turn, can induce stress in vegetation. These interactions are likely to affect the composition and structure of phreatophyte plant communities, as well as their successional dynamics. Despite the environmental and economical value of many wetland plant ecosystems around the world, the impact of vegetation-water table interactions on ecosystem succession and interspecies competition in phreatophyte plant communities remains poorly understood. This study develops a minimalistie modelling framework to investigate the dynamics of two phreatophyte species, and their interactions with the water table. In spite of its simplicity, the model exhibits a remarkable variety of dynamical behaviors, especially when the water table depth is forced by external drivers. It is shown that, even when one of the two species is dominant with respect to the other, these two species can coexist showing periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics. Moreover, in the presence of a random environmental forcing, noise-induced coexistence may emerge. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a series of grazer-gradient and dilution microcosm experiments, we compared grazing and nutrient mineralization by naturally co-existing crustacean and microzooplankton assemblages from mesoeutrophic Lake Kinneret. Across two distinct seasonal plankton assemblages, microzooplankton dominated both phytoplankton and bacteria grazing and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization. Mass-specific ingestion rates by microzooplankton were,20 times higher than ingestion rates of crustaceans. Although most carbon ingested by microzooplankton was in the form of bacteria, microzooplankton inflicted substantially higher mortalities (both in absolute terms and relative to maximum potential growth rates) on both phytoplankton and bacteria compared with crustaceans. Mass-specific P and N excretion rates were also higher (by 70 and 50 times, respectively) than crustacean excretion rates. These results suggest that microzooplankton grazing and nutrient mineralization are driving forces affecting bacteria and phytoplankton dynamics, playing important roles in carbon and nutrient transfer to upper trophic levels even in pelagic freshwater systems containing abundant crustaceans.

AB The occurrence and concentration of microcystins were analysed in sestonic samples from seven water reservoirs in the Madrid region (Spain) between July and November in two consecutive years (2002 and 2003). The data collected indicate that microcystins were present on several occasions in both years in all the reservoirs studied. The months of maximum risk for cyanotoxin occurrence were July, September and October, when Microcystis typically dominated the phytoplankton community. Four of the seven reservoirs exhibited conspicuous blooms, three of which were toxic. Of the samples in 2002 and 2003, 45% and 70%, respectively, contained microcystins (Mc). In four of the reservoirs, microcystin concentrations were higher than the WHO recommended limit for drinking water (1 mu g Mc1(-1)) and, in one of the reservoirs (Santillana), its concentration, was extremely high (up to 70 mu g Mc1(-1)). Concentrations above 1 mu g Mc1(-1) were found during several months in this reservoir. Mc/chl a ratios in net-concentrated samples ranged from 0.0002 to 2.24 mu g Mc (mu g chl a)(-1) with a mean value of 0.31 mu g Mc (mu g chl a)(-1). From the data obtained we can conclude that M. aeruginosa is the main producer of microcystins in freshwaters from the Madrid region.

AB The interdisciplinary study of human-environment interactions is becoming increasingly important around the world. Long-term experimental manipulations that combine approaches from both the ecological and social sciences could play an important role in the study of human-environment feedbacks in cities. The inclusion of in situ human subjects in this research is vital, as it facilitates more accurate scientific models and might produce social benefits such as increasing public trust in scientists. Within a landscape experiment, human subjects may alter experimental conditions to suit their needs, imitating the rapidly changing environmental conditions in cities. In response, researchers adjust explanatory models in a process which could be called "adaptive experimentation". These ideas are illustrated by a description of a proposed experiment in the Phoenix metropolitan area, where residential landscaping will be manipulated and the feedbacks between ecological processes and the activities of resident humans studied.

AB Numerous ecosystems, ranging from coral reefs, and forests to deserts and lakes have been shown to possess alternative stable states. This phenomenon has obvious important implications for management, as it may imply unexpected collapse of the system and large resistance to restoration efforts. In this paper we show that alternative attractors also have important consequences from the technical modelers' point of view. Performing a Monte-Carlo uncertainty analysis with an existing individual-based simulation model for macrophyte growth, we found that the uncertainty in the model results may be remarkably high under some conditions, We demonstrate that this high uncertainty is caused by the alternative stable states of the model: if the noise on the parameters exceeds a critical threshold, the model uncertainty can increase steeply, due to switches to the other equilibrium. Such amplification of sensitivity is restricted to certain regions of the parameter space and depends on the initial state of the model. In the vicinity of catastrophical bifurcation points, uncertainty approaches infinity as even tiny parameter changes may cause a switch to the other equilibrium. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB A study from June 1990 to October 1992 revealed that the pelagic zooplankton community of Lake Mikri Prespa consists of 45 invertebrate species (28 Rotifera, 11 Cladocera, 6 Copepoda and 1 mollusc). It includes A. steindachneri, an endemic calanoid of the Western Balkans. Half of the species are first records for the lake. The total abundance and biomass ranged from 61 to 905 ind l(-1) and 58 to 646 mu g l(-1), respectively. Seasonal fluctuations agreed with the PEG-model. Copepods prevailed throughout the year. The species composition and seasonal variability were affected by temperature-dependent food conditions, competition and predation. These factors induced a seasonal succession which involved a replacement of larger species or individuals by smaller ones during summer. The cladoceran population, as a whole, was characterised by small size classes of the species present, probably due to fish predation. An examination of the horizontal distribution showed that, although seasonal variability was the same at all stations sampled, the central station showed higher abundance. Inshore-offshore diel migrations of juvenile fish is considered to account for this uneven distribution. Shannon's diversity index ranged from 0.98 to 2.95 and evenness from 0.3 to 0.9. Both were influenced by temperature.

AB The distribution of niches in resource space and the niche patterns of a 13 species community of Middle Asian desert rodents were studied by use of discriminant function analysis. Nineteen quantitative parameters of the environment (soil structure and vegetation), measured at 600 sample plots within twentyfour one ha grids, were considered. The first three canonical axes of resource space account for 83% of the variance; the first axis represents a general landscape gradient from sand to clay soils, the second axis reflects a gradient of increasing productivity, and the third axis reflects a gradient of increasing protectability of the environment. The distribution of niches in resource space is not even; there are two distinct spatial guilds consisting of psammophilous and sclerophilous species. There is a negative correlation between niche position (distance from species centroid to the center of the resource space) and maximal population biomass. At the same time there are no correlations between the niche breadth and the niche position due to the absence of species with really broad niches. Rodent biomass increases along the productivity axis and reaches a peak in the middle part of the substrate axis. Rodent species diversity increases along the substrate axis from sand to clay soils. Changes of species diversity along productivity axis have humpshaped patterns. Maximum species diversity was recorded at low level of productivity on the sandy soils and shifted to intermediate levels of productivity on sandy-loam and clay soils.

AB A growing demand for sustainable energy has led to an increase in construction of offshore windfarms. Guishan windmill farm will be constructed in the Pearl River Estuary, China, which sustains the world's largest known population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis). Dolphin conservation is an urgent issue in this region. By using passive acoustic monitoring, a baseline distribution of data on this species in the Pearl River Estuary during pre-construction period had been collected. Dolphin biosonar detection and its diel, lunar, seasonal and tidal patterns were examined using a Generalized Linear Model. Significant higher echolocation detections at night than during the day, in winter-spring than in summer-autumn, at high tide than at flood tide were recognized. Significant higher echolocation detections during the new moon were recognized at night time. The diel, lunar and seasonal patterns for the echolocation encounter duration also significantly varied. These patterns could be due to the spatial-temporal variability of dolphin prey and illumination conditions. The baseline information will be useful for driving further effective action on the conservation of this species and in facilitating later assessments of the effects of the offshore windfarm on the dolphins by comparing the baseline to post construction and post mitigation efforts.

AB The current integrity of the planet is being stressed beyond its biological capacity, and understanding urban landscapes is more important now than ever. A major landmark in human-planetary evolution was reached recently with a majority of people now living in cities, and rural-to-urban migration is predicted to continue into the next century. Landscape change associated with exponential population growth poses major challenges to coupled human and natural systems. Although some progress has been made, to date there exist no 'ideal' instrument for achieving sustainability on neither regional nor local scales. Because there is limited applied evidence investigating landscape form (e.g. configuration) and population dynamics (e.g. population density) with measures of sustainability, this research area requires further investigation. Using Human Wellbeing Index (HWI) and Ecosystem Wellbeing Index (EWI) from Robert Prescott-Allen's The Wellbeing of Nations: A Country-by-Country Index of Quality of Life and the Environment, a macroscale empirical study was created to further understand sustainable urban development across 33 European countries. Exploratory spatial data analysis was utilized to illustrate Wellbeing clusters across the study area, and spatially enabled regression methods were employed to create regional sustainable urbanization models for explaining Wellbeing indices. With population density, two urban class configuration metrics (e.g. COHESION, PD) were found significant at explaining both HWI and EWI. Between 2000 and 2006, changes in urban morphology and population density were also assessed for 31 of the aforementioned 33 European countries. Findings suggest that conventional urbanization processes will continue to disconnect socioeconomic welfare from life-supporting ecosystem services.

AB There is a vast literature on the behavioural effects of partial reinforcement in Pavlovian conditioning. Compared with animals receiving continuous reinforcement, partially rewarded animals typically show (a) a slower development of the conditioned response (CR) early in training and (b) a higher asymptotic level of the CR later in training. This phenomenon is known as the partial reinforcement acquisition effect (PRAE). Learning models of Pavlovian conditioning fail to account for it. In accordance with the incentive salience hypothesis, it is here argued that incentive motivation (or 'wanting') plays a more direct role in controlling behaviour than does learning, and reward uncertainty is shown to have an excitatory effect on incentive motivation. The psychological origin of that effect is discussed and a computational model integrating this new interpretation is developed. Many features of CRs under partial reinforcement emerge from this model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Localized structures have been observed in many spatially extended systems of either biological, chemical, or physical nature. Here, we study experimentally front pinning and dissipative localized structures in a delayed optical system based on a bistable semiconductor laser with optoelectronic feedback. We observe that many of the concepts known to apply to spatially localized structures also apply in this context, with specificities related to the lack of reversibility symmetry. Numerical simulations based on purely prototypical modeling reproduce very well the experimental findings, which indicates that the results do not depend on the specific physical system under consideration, but are, on the contrary, very generic features of time delayed systems.

AB In this study, we explore the feasibility of using bioinspired robotics to influence the behaviour of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), a social freshwater fish species that is extensively studied for the ecological issues associated with its diffusion in non-native environments. Specifically, in a dichotomous choice test, we investigate the behavioural response of small shoals of mosquitofish to a robotic fish inspired by mosquitofish in its colouration, shape, aspect ratio, and locomotion. Our results indicate that the swimming depth and the aspect ratio of the robotic fish are both determinants of mosquitofish preference. In particular, we find that mosquitofish are never attracted by a robotic fish whose colouration and shape are inspired by live subjects and that the degree of repulsion varies as a function of the swimming depth and the aspect ratio.

AB Constraints on locomotion could be an important component of the cost of reproduction as carrying an increased load associated with eggs or developing fetuses may contribute to decreased locomotor performance for females across taxa and environments. Diminished performance could increase susceptibility to predation, yet the mechanism(s) by which gravidity and pregnancy affect locomotion remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that morphology, hydrodynamics and kinematics were altered during pregnancy, providing a mechanism for diminished locomotor performance in two near-term pregnant (10 days pre-parturition) bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Near-term pregnancy resulted in a 51 +/- 14% increase in frontal surface area, coinciding with dramatic increases in drag forces while gliding. For example, pregnant females encountered 80 N of drag at 1.7 m s(-1) whereas that magnitude of drag was not encountered until speed doubled for females 18 months post-parturition. Indeed, drag coefficients based on frontal surface area were significantly greater during pregnancy (C-d,C-F=0.22 +/- 0.04) than at 18 months post-parturition (C-d,C-F=0.09 +/- 0.01). Pregnancy also induced a gait change as stroke amplitude and distance per stroke were reduced by 13 and 14%, respectively, compared with non-pregnant periods (1-24 months post-parturition). This was concomitant with a 62 and 44% reduction in mean and maximum swim speeds, respectively, during the pregnancy period. Interestingly, attack speeds of known predators of dolphins surpass maximum speeds for the pregnant dolphins in this study. Thus, pregnant dolphins may be more susceptible to predation. This study demonstrates unequivocally that changes in morphology, hydrodynamics and kinematics are associated with diminished performance during pregnancy in dolphins.

AB Using 2 yr of field data on the abundances of live and dead planktonic copepod nauplii and Acartia tonsa copepodites from the lower Chesapeake Bay, we evaluated the accuracy of calculated mortality rates and modeled population dynamics. Copepod mortality rates were estimated from field data both before and after removal of carcasses from abundance values, resulting in significantly different mortality rates. After removing carcasses, instantaneous mortality rates for nauplii varied from <0.01 d(-1) to a maximum of 0.35 d(-1) (in August 2009), and for A. tonsa copepodites from <0.01 d(-1) in winter to 0.5 d(-1) or higher in summer. A simple model was used to evaluate the effect of both uncorrected and corrected mortality rate estimates on A. tonsa population dynamics. Model predictions more closely matched field observations when parameterized with corrected mortality rates, indicating the importance of the abundances of live and dead organisms for field studies in zooplankton ecology. We used the same field dataset to estimate the predatory and non-predatory components of mortality. Non-predatory mortality comprised an aver age of 25% of total mortality for nauplii, and 12% of total mortality for A. tonsa copepodites. Predatory mortality alone was insufficient to keep the A. tonsa population size under control during the growing season (from June to October), demonstrating the importance of non-predatory mortality for A. tonsa in the lower Chesapeake Bay.

AB Classical models of phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction show that with nutrient enrichment such systems may abruptly shift from limit cycles to stable phytoplankton domination due to zooplankton predation by planktivorous fish. Such models assume that planktivorous fish eat only zooplankton, but there are various species of filter-feeding fish that may also feed on phytoplankton. Here, we extend these classical models to systematically explore the effects of omnivory by planktivorous fish. Our analysis indicates that if fish forage on phytoplankton in addition to zooplankton, the alternative attractors predicted by the classical models disappear for all realistic parameter settings, even if omnivorous fish have a strong preference for zooplankton. Our model also shows that the level of fish biomass above which zooplankton collapse should be higher when fish are omnivorous than when fish are zooplanktivorous. We also used the model to explore the potential effects of the now increasingly common practice of stocking lakes with filter-feeding fish to control cyanobacteria. Because omnivorous filter-feeding fish forage on phytoplankton as well as on the main grazers of phytoplankton, the net effect of such fish on the phytoplankton biomass is not obvious. Our model suggests that there may be a unimodal relationship between the biomass of omnivorous filter-feeding fish and the biomass of phytoplankton. This implies that to manage for reductions in phytoplankton biomass, heavy stocking or strong reduction of such fish is best.

AB The millions of conserved biological specimens that are stored upon the shelves of Natural History Museums across the world constitute a capital of biological information that is becoming increasingly accessible to students of various disciplines. Most students have taken measures of body size and shape of preserved museum specimens to test various elements of ecological and evolutionary theory. One possible hazard of using morphological measurements of museum specimens is that fixation and preservation may deform bodies or body parts, but most researchers implicitely assume that the magnitude of conservation-induced distortions are insufficient to jeopardize their analyses. However, no study to our knowledge has clearly quantified those possible distortions. In this study, we have measured 17 morphological variables on a set of 65 green iguanas (Iguana iguana), starting shortly after their death and then repeatedly over a two month period, a period during which they were fixated and preserved. Our aims were (1) to quantify and compare the deformation in different morphometrics frequently used in evolutionary studies; (2) to determine the amount of temporal variation that can be attributed to reader variability; and (3) to build conversion equations that should improve the reliability of morphological comparisons of life and conserved specimens. Conserved lizards revealed major reduction in snout vent length and body weight. Changes in other measured traits are more subtle, but persistent. These facts disturb analyses when using relative measurements, especially when comparing (often small) intraspecific differences or even morphological differences within populations in a temporal frame. We urge caution in using museum specimens as direct proxies for living organisms in ecological and taxonomic studies.

AB Many factors, both biotic and abiotic, impede the success of reintroductions. Among these is the difficulty that small populations have in surviving and thriving. For many species of animals and plants, populations at low density or of small size suffer from a weak or even a negative growth rate, either of which increases their extinction risk; this is called the Allee effect. As reintroductions are almost invariably characterized by small propagule sizes, the importance of the Allee effect must be considered in order to assess its potential impact on the probability of success in reintroductions. In this paper, we highlight the ubiquity of the Allee effect, the importance of this process as predicted by theoretical models, and its potential role in the failure of previous reintroduction attempts. We emphasize that although previous reintroduction programs have shown that release size is paramount to the success of reintroductions, no link has yet been formally demonstrated between Allee effects and reintroduction success. We encourage researchers in ecology to further investigate the role of the Allee effect on the probability of reintroduction success, using available data on comparable processes such as invasive species and the propagation of biological control agents where possible. We also urge biodiversity managers to consider this potential impediment to the survival, increase, and spread of small groups of reintroduced individuals in conservation programs.

AB The rate of chick growth in high-latitude breeding shorebirds is rapid, but little is known about the effect of chick mass, growth, and brood movements on subsequent brood survival. To address these topics, we monitored chick growth patterns, daily brood movements, and survival of Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska. We assessed the effect of chick age, mass, and hatch date on brood survival using Program MARK. We mapped brood locations daily, and compared brood movement patterns between successful and unsuccessful broods. Younger chicks survived at lower rates and moved shorter distances than older chicks. The overall probability of one or more chicks from a brood surviving to 15 days of age was 0.73 +/- 0.05 SE. Brood survival declined seasonally, and broods with heavier chicks survived at higher rates than those with lighter chicks. On average, successful broods fledged 1.7 +/- 0.1 SE chicks. Rate of chick growth was intermediate between those of high arctic and temperate-breeding shorebirds, and chick mass at hatching declined seasonally. Western Sandpiper brood survival was lowest when chicks were young, spatially clumped, and unable to maintain homeothermy, probably because young chicks were more vulnerable to both complete depredation events and extreme weather. Our data suggest that larger, older chicks are able to avoid predators by being spatially dispersed and highly mobile; thermal independence, achieved after approximately day five, enables chicks to better endure prolonged periods of cold and low food availability.

AB Aim This paper examines body size variation in both recent and Quaternary populations of the Japanese field mouse Apodemus argenteus in order to assess the relative effects on body size of climate change, isolation and competitive interactions with its congeneric A. speciosus. Both temporal (since the Last Glacial Maximum, LGM) and spatial (over the Japanese archipelago) scales are considered.
   Location The small field mouse is widespread in Japan, and the specimens examined were collected from 10 localities on islands of widely differing area (from 4 km(2) to 230,510 km(2)) and at latitudes ranging from 30.3degrees N to 45.1degrees N.
   Methods The effects of geographical factors such as latitude and island area on the size variation of A. argenteus were investigated, using the lower incisor size. In addition, the size of some specimens from two Quaternary localities was compared with the size of the extant specimens. Evolutionary rates of size change since the LGM were calculated in darwins. Hutchinson size ratios were used to examine the pattern of variation of the size segregation between the two Japanese field mice, A. argenteus and A. speciosus, in relation to time and space.
   Results There was a negative relationship between size and latitude among living A. argenteus populations. In addition, there was no effect of island area on body size, especially at higher latitudes. At lower latitudes, A. argenteus were larger on smaller islands, although this trend was not statistically significant. Quaternary specimens of A. argenteus were smaller in size than their living representatives. The interspecific size ratio between the two Japanese Apodemus was larger on smaller islands and at higher latitudes, and there has been a decrease in the size ratio between the two Apodemus since the LGM. Lastly, in accordance with the theory of character displacement, the small A. argenteus was larger in allopatry than in sympatry, whereas the large A. speciosus was smaller in allopatry than in sympatry.
   Main conclusions These results indicate that A. argenteus does not conform to Bergmann's rule or to the island rule. The variation in size for the small Japanese field mouse at both spatial and temporal scales may be related to climate change, with an additional effect of competition with the large field mouse, especially on smaller islands. The size convergence between the two Japanese Apodemus observed over the last 21,000 years may be explained by the diminution of available food resources due to the reduction of land mass areas following the LGM. It may also be the result of an evolution towards an optimal body size; a hypothesis previously proposed to explain the evolution of body size in island mammals. Lastly, the evolutionary rates of body size calculated for A. argenteus since the LGM are typical of rates calculated for other Quaternary mainland mammals, thus suggesting that the evolution in this species was not particularly rapid, as is often thought for island mammals.

AB Despite potential advantages of artificial reefs in areas where natural coral reefs have degraded, relatively little research has been undertaken in Eilat to improve our understanding of the major factors governing the development of reef biota. We report on the first study in a series aimed at increasing our knowledge of the effects of morphology, substrate type, and location on the succession of reef organisms. The development of stony corals and fish communities associated with two types of constructions was examined, which were both made of aggregates of limestone rocks: one randomly aggregated (RA) reef comprising relatively small rocks and an orderly aggregated (OA) reef composed of relatively big rocks. Communities were censused every 4-6 months for more than 4 years, with a final coral census being taken after 100 months. The OA reef attracted significantly more fish species and a higher number of individuals than the RA reef, and reached its carrying capacity faster (30 months versus 50 months). In contrast, number of reef-building corals on the RA reef was significantly higher (in terms of both species and colonies) than on the OA reef, and the plateau was not even reached after 100 months. We conclude that in the Gulf of Aqaba, (1) for recreational purposes, small reefs (of a few cubic metres) may serve as attractive sites because they support relatively rich fish communities, (2) larger rocks, larger interstices and larger reef size induce higher species richness and greater numbers of fish, and (3) structural complexity, as measured by fractal dimension, is an important factor for the development of reef-building corals.

AB Temporal variability in population density has been shown to increase with increasing length of a study. This has serious implications for ecological studies and suggests that obtaining an objective measure of temporal variability may not be possible. To test this hypothesis more generally, I calculated inter-annual variability, using the standard deviation of the logarithm of annual mean population density (STD(log D)), for 70 populations of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish which have been sampled over 10 to 51 consecutive yr in lakes around the world. STD(log D) fluctuates most widely during the first 3-6 yr of a study, but these changes do not necessarily represent long-term trends in temporal variability. Median changes in STD(log D) over time are small (<< 0.l unit, even over a logarithmic time scale) and decrease as more years are included in the analysis. The inter-annual variability of most freshwater populations appears to reach an asymptotic value. Several populations, however, show an alternation of plateaux and of sudden increases in STD(log D), suggesting that the asymptotic values found in most populations may be temporary and may not extrapolate beyond the temporal scale of this study (10-50 yr). Overall, the increases in inter-annual variability are expected to be small(<0.l units, on average, per 25 yr). The pattern and the magnitude of these changes did not differ significantly between algae, zooplankton and fish, and were similar to those reported for birds and mammals. Increases in temporal variability may only be important for questions addressed over long periods of time.

AB We studied body size (erytra length) and leg length variation in seven tenebrionid species along a rainfall and environmental gradient from the Ramon erosion cirque (Israel). Body size was not correlated with altitude in three species, while four species demonstrated changes in body size with altitude. Three species decreased their body size along the altitudinal gradient, whereas Sepidium dathan demonstrated the opposite trend. The pattern of variation of body size along the altitudinal gradient in Adesmia metallica Erodius edomitus and Zophosis complanata may be explained by ambient temperature rather than productivity variation. Neither elevation nor species abundance affected variance in body size of any species. Femur length changed significantly along the altitudinal gradient in A. metallica only. Both males and females had relatively longer legs in low elevations and relatively shorter legs in high elevations. Individuals with the longest legs were recorded on soils with low clay and high rock and gravel content. The texture of the soil had no noticeable effect on the leg length of all other beetle species. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB Deserts are, by definition, environmentally similar, and this has lead to hypotheses of convergence in the properties of desert biotic communities as well as the components of these communities. There is considerable evidence for convergence in some characteristics of desert biota, ranging from plant growth forms to the well-known bipedal, nocturnal rodents. One area that has received considerable attention has been granivory by desert rodents, largely because of the effort focused on the North American desert heteromyids, and also because the process of granivory has far-reaching ramifications for desert plant communities. Specific tests for convergence in the impact of rodents as granivores, by means of bait-removal experiments, however, have shown that the high levels of seed removal by rodents in the North American deserts differs from that of rodents in the South American, Australian and South African deserts, where ants are the most important seed harvesters. The only studies to measure the impact of rodents on desert seed fluxes confirm these patterns, with rodents consuming up to 86% of seed production in North American deserts, but less than 1% of seed production in South African deserts. A review of dietary data for desert rodents confirms these trends, with little evidence for the presence of granivores in deserts besides those of North America. A variety of hypotheses have attempted to explain these variations in desert rodent granivory. These include recent extinctions of granivores, that seed burial, low soil nutrients and/or limiting seed production prevented the radiation of granivorous small mammals, and that particular deserts are too young or too recently colonised by rodents for granivorous rodents to have evolved. However, none of these hypotheses are supported by available evidence. Alternative hypotheses suggesting that climate variability may have precluded the development of specialised granivores need to be tested. In particular, more data are needed to confirm these patterns of granivory, and gain an understanding of the effects of Pleistocene and recent desert climate variability on seed production. An alternative perspective suggests that the presence of the heteromyid rodents may explain the high levels of granivory by small mammals in North American deserts. The variability in granivory by small mammals between deserts suggests that deserts will also differ in terms of anti-granivore adaptations of plants, seed fluxes and the mechanisms whereby small mammals coexist.

AB Nitrification is simulated in existing water quality models by multiplying the rate with the attenuation factors for water temperature and dissolved oxygen. The effect of pH, substrates and bacteria is mostly neglected. Moreover, the two-step nitrification is simplified to a one-step process. The aim of this study is to investigate the kinetics of two-step nitrification and to simulate this process. Consequently, the importance of considering the effect of pH, substrate and bacteria in nitrification modelling of river basins is emphasized. For this, an experiment was performed on water taken from the Tay Ninh River in Vietnam. The results show a low actual ammonium oxidation rate in the water column of the river. The ammonium oxidation is completely inhibited at pH 5 while the nitrite oxidation is strongly inhibited at pH 8.5. In comparison to the ammonium oxidizers (AOB), the nitrite oxidizers (NOB) are rarely inhibited at low pH. Numerical simulation of the experiment delivered ammonium oxidation rates k(A) and nitrite oxidation rates k(N) for different pH values. The k(A) for pH values lower than 6 is very low. It increases rapidly as the pH increases from 6 to 6.5. We also found out that pH values of 7.5 and 7 are optimal for the activity of AOB and NOB, respectively. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the effect of pH, substrate and bacteria on the nitrification research in river basins. In doing so, nitrification can be simulated more realistically and sustainable water management can be carried out more successfully. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Biological leaching of rare earth elements (REEs) from low-grade ores and mine tailings represents a potentially cost-effective green technology for REE recovery, yet the specific mechanisms of such biological process, especially by common rock-dwelling actinobacteria, remain unclear. In this study, we performed laboratory bioleaching experiments to understand the rates and mechanisms of REE bioleaching. Four actinobacterial strains, including two isolates from REE-rich rocks and two from surrounding red soil, were found to have the capability of bioleaching REEs from a bastnaesite-bearing rock and bastnaesite. Bastnaesite is one member of a REE mineral family REE(CO3) F, where REE is dominated by Ce, La or Y. In a nutrient-rich growth medium, bioleached total REE concentration ranged from 56 to 342 mu g/L. In an oligotrophic medium, only one strain (Streptomyces sp.) grew in the presence of the bastnaesite-bearing rock and bastnaesite, and leached as much as 548 mu g/L total REEs. The leaching efficiency of total REEs, defined as the amounts of leached REEs relative those present in the rock was 0.008-0.08%, which should be underestimated due to new REE-bearing mineral precipitation and/or sorption of leached REEs to residual rock and cell surfaces. These bioleached REE concentrations were higher than those leached by abiotic methods under a similar pH condition, suggesting that pH was not the only factor in REE bioleaching. Additional experiments demonstrated that these four actinobacterial strains secreted various organic acids, complexing ligands, and siderophores as dominant agents to extract REEs from bastnaesite-bearing rock. Some of the leached REEs were observed to accumulate on cell surfaces. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that REEs were leached primarily from primary REE mineral bastnaesite. Our results suggest that microorganisms have a potential to selectively bioleach and recover certain REEs from low-grade ores and mine tailings.

   MethodsWe conducted a factorial multi-species experiment in which seeds and seedlings of five beneficiary species were sown in the presence and absence of three pioneer tree species. Beneficiary species performance was monitored for different ontogenetic stages.
   ResultsWe found evidence of species-specific facilitation in which the intensity and outcome of the interactions between nurse and beneficiary species varied depending on species identity. Additionally, for most combinations of nurse and beneficiary species, ontogenetic shifts from positive to neutral or negative interactions were observed with increasing beneficiary age.
   ConclusionsWe provide experimental evidence that nurse and beneficiary species identity simultaneously influence the balance between facilitation and competition. Our results suggest that ontogenetic shifts may be a widespread phenomenon in semi-arid ecosystems. We discuss that a key mechanism explaining these findings is the match between what nurse species offer and what beneficiary species require in terms of resources and conditions. As a consequence, different nurse species tend to favour or inhibit unique sets of beneficiary species beneath their canopies. We argue that species-specific facilitation is an overlooked mechanism promoting -diversity during community succession.

AB Changes in animal body size have been widely reported as a correlate of contemporary climate change. Body size affects metabolism and fitness, so changing size has implications for resilience, yet the climatic factors that drive size variation remain poorly understood. We test the role of mean and extreme temperature, rainfall, and remotely sensed primary productivity (NDVI) as drivers of body size in a sedentary, semi-arid Australian passerine, Ptilotula (Lichenostomus) penicillatus, over 23 years. To distinguish effects due to differential growth from changes in population composition, we analysed first-year birds and adults separately and considered climatic variation at three temporal scales (current, previous, and preceding 5 years). The strongest effects related to temperature: in both age classes, larger size was associated with warmer mean temperatures in the previous year, contrary to Bergmann's Rule. Moreover, adults were larger in warmer breeding seasons, while first years was larger after heatwaves; these effects are more likely to be mediated through size-dependent mortality, highlighting the role of body size in determining vulnerability to extinction. In addition to temperature, larger adult size was associated with lower primary productivity, which may reflect a trade-off between vegetative growth and nectar production, on which adults rely. Finally, lower rainfall was associated with decreasing size in first year and adults, most likely related to decreased food availability. Overall, body size increased over 23 years, strongly in first-year birds (2.7%) compared with adults (1%), with size outcomes a balance between competing drivers. As rainfall declined over time and productivity remained fairly stable, the temporal increase in body size appears largely driven by rising mean temperature and temperature extremes. Body size responses to environmental change are thus complex and dynamic, driven by effects on growth as well as mortality.

AB Bergmann's Rule (i.e., the tendency of body size to increase with decreasing environmental temperature) was originally explained by a mechanism that is unique to endotherms. Nevertheless, geographic variation of body size of ectotherms, including snakes, is increasingly studied, and some claim that the rule should apply to ectotherms, or to thermoregulating ectotherms. Such studies usually focus on assemblages or on species in a region, but mostly ignore species' ecological and biological traits when seeking biogeographic patterns. We examined the relationship between environmental temperatures and body size of 146 Australian snake species. We examined this relationship while considering the effects of ecological traits (activity time and habitat use), climatic variables which are thought to influence snake body size, and shared ancestry. Our finding suggest that Bergmann's Rule is not a valid generalization across species of Australian snakes. Furthermore, ecological traits greatly influence the relationship between snake body size and environmental temperature. Body size of fossorial species decreases with environmental temperature, whereas body size of nocturnal, surface active species increases. Body size of diurnal, surface active species is not related to environmental temperature. Our results indicate that lumping all species in a clade together is misleading, and that ecological traits profoundly affect the geographic variation of snake body size. Though environmental temperature generally does not exert a strong selective force on snake body size, this relationship differs for taxa exhibiting different ecological traits.

AB Most benthic invertebrates broadcast their gametes into the sea, whereupon successful fertilization relies on the complex interaction between the physics of the surrounding fluid flow and the biological properties and behavior of eggs and sperm. We present a holistic overview of the impact of instantaneous flow processes on fertilization across a range of scales. At large scales, transport and stirring by the flow control the distribution of gametes. Although mean dilution of gametes by turbulence is deleterious to fertilization, a variety of instantaneous flow phenomena can aggregate gametes before dilution occurs. We argue that these instantaneous flow processes are key to fertilization efficiency. At small scales, sperm motility and taxis enhance contact rates between sperm and chemoattractant-releasing eggs. We argue that sperm motility is a biological adaptation that replaces molecular diffusion in conventional mixing processes and enables gametes to bridge the gap that remains after aggregation by the flow.

AB Standard species used in ecological risk assessment are chosen based on their sensitivity to various toxicants and the ease of rearing them for laboratory experiments. However, this mostly overlooks the fact that species in the field that may employ variable life-history strategies, which may have consequences concerning the vulnerability of such species to exposure with contaminants. We aimed to highlight the importance of copepods in ecology and to underline the need to include freshwater copepods in ecotoxicology. We carried out a literature search on copepods and Daphnia in ecology and ecotoxicology to compare the recognition given to these two taxa in these respective fields. We also conducted a detailed analysis of the literature on copepods and their current role in ecotoxicology to characterize the scale and depth of the studies and the ecotoxicological information therein. The literature on the ecology of copepods outweighed that in ecotoxicology when compared with daphnids. Copepods, like other zooplankton, were found to be sensitive to toxicants and important organisms in aquatic ecosystems. The few studies that were conducted on the ecotoxicology of copepods mainly focused on marine copepods. However, very little is known about the ecotoxicology of freshwater copepods. To enable a more realistic risk higher tier environmental risk assessment, we recommend considering freshwater copepods as part of the hazard assessment process. This could include the establishment of laboratory experiments to analyse the effects of toxicants on copepods and the development of individual-based models to extrapolate effects across species and scenarios.

AB Aim Long-distance dispersal is important for plant population dynamics at larger spatial scales, but our understanding of this phenomenon is mostly based on computer modelling rather than field data. This paper, by combining field data and a simulation model, quantifies the fraction of the seed of the alien species Heracleum mantegazzianum that needs to disperse over a long distance for successful invasion.
   Location Central Europe, Czech Republic.
   Methods To assess the role of random dispersal in long-term population dynamics of the studied species, we combined longitudinal data covering 50 years of the invasion of this plant from its very start, inferred from a series of aerial photographs of 60-ha plots, with data on population dynamics at a fine scale of 10-m(2) plots.
   Results A simulation model based on field data indicates that the fraction of seed that is dispersed from source plants not described by the short-distance dispersal kernel ranges from 0.1 to 7.5% of the total seed set. The fraction of long-distance dispersed seed that provides the best prediction of the observed spread was significantly negatively correlated with the percentage of habitats suitable for invasion.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate that the fraction of seeds that needed to be dispersed over long distances to account for the observed invasion dynamics decreased with increasing proportion of invasible habitats, indicating that the spatial pattern of propagule pressure differs in landscapes prone to invasion. Long-distance dispersal is an important component of the population dynamics of an invasive species even at relatively small scales.

AB Mucus released by scleractinian corals can act as an important energy and nutrient carrier in coral reef ecosystems, and a distinct isotopic signature would allow following the fate of this material. This study investigates the natural C and N stable isotopic signatures of mucus released by four scleractinian coral genera (Acropora, Fungia, Pocillopora and Stylophora) in comparison with those of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) in seawater of a Northern Red Sea fringing coral reef near Aqaba, Jordan. The natural delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of coral mucus differed significantly from seawater POM for the majority of seasonal comparisons, but were inappropriate for explicit tracing of mucus in the coral reef food web. Thus, a labeling technique using stable isotope tracers (C-13 and N-15) was developed that produced delta C-13 values of up to 122 +/- A 5aEuro degrees (mean +/- A SE) and delta N-15 of up to 2,100 +/- A 151aEuro degrees in mucus exuded by Fungia corals. C-13 and N-15-enriched compounds were rapidly (within 3 h) and light-dependently transferred from the endosymbiotic zooxanthellae to the mucus-producing coral host. The traceability of N-15-labeled mucus was examined by evaluating its uptake and potential utilization by epizoic acoelomorph Waminoa worms naturally occurring on a range of scleractinian coral taxa. This tracer experiment resulted in uptake of coral mucus by the coral-associated acoelomorphs and further demonstrated the possibility to trace stable isotope-labeled coral mucus by revealing a new trophic pathway in coral reef ecosystems.

AB This paper presents seasonal in situ monitoring data on benthic coverage and coral-algae interactions in high-latitude fringing reefs of the Northern Red Sea over a period of 19 months. More than 30% of all hermatypic corals were involved in interaction with benthic reef algae during winter compared to 17% during summer, but significant correlation between the occurrence of coral-algae interactions and monitored environmental factors such as temperature and inorganic nutrient availability was not detected. Between 5 and 10-m water depth, the macroalgae Caulerpa serrulata, Peyssonnelia capensis and filamentous turf algae represented almost 100% of the benthic algae involved in interaction with corals. Turf algae were most frequently (between 77 and 90% of all interactions) involved in interactions with hermatypic corals and caused most tissue damage to them. Maximum coral tissue loss of 0.75% day(-1) was observed for Acropora-turf algae interaction during fall, while an equilibrium between both groups of organisms appeared during summer. Slow-growing massive corals were more resistant against negative algal influence than fast-growing branching corals. Branching corals of the genus Acropora partly exhibited a newly observed phenotypic plasticity mechanism, by development of a bulge towards the competing organism, when in interaction with algae. These findings may contribute to understand the dynamics of phase shifts in coral reefs by providing seasonally resolved in situ monitoring data on the abundance and the competitive dynamic of coral-algae interactions.

AB The probability of seed consumption by surface-dwelling predators depends on the duration of seed exposure on the soil surface. We investigated seed burial using painted ceramic beads as surrogate seeds. Fifty beads of three size classes each were applied to small arenas within crop fields and their fates were followed from August to October. New sets of beads were applied as soon as most beads had disappeared from the soil surface. Bead availability on the soil surface declined immediately after placement, and then declined steadily over time, with increased loss during rain and management practices. Smaller beads were incorporated into the soil/litter matrix more easily than larger beads. Bead burial differed considerably among crop environments, with more burial in forage crops (red clover, lucerne) than in row crops (soyabean, maize). The fact that seed availability differed among crop environments suggests that it can be manipulated to maximise predation risk.

TI The effect of prey density on foraging mode selection in juvenile

AB 1. In many species, individuals will alter their foraging strategy in response to changes in prey density. However, previous work has shown that prey density has differing effects on the foraging mode decisions of ectotherms as compared with endotherms. This is likely due to differences in metabolic demand; however, the relationship between metabolism and foraging mode choice in ectotherms has not been thoroughly studied.
   2. Juvenile lumpfish Cyclopterus lumpus forage using one of two modes: they can actively search for prey while swimming, or they can 'sit-and-wait' for prey while clinging to the substrate using a ventral adhesive disk. The presence of these easily distinguishable foraging modes makes juvenile lumpfish ideal for the study of foraging mode choice in ectotherms.
   3. Behavioural observations conducted during laboratory experiments showed that juvenile lumpfish predominantly use the 'cling' foraging mode when prey is abundant, but resort to the more costly 'swim' mode to seek out food when prey is scarce. The metabolic cost of active foraging was also quantified for juvenile lumpfish using swim-tunnel respirometry, and a model was devised to predict the prey density at which lumpfish should switch between the swim and cling foraging modes to maximize energy intake.
   4. The results of this model do not agree with previous observations of lumpfish behaviour, and thus it appears that juvenile lumpfish do not try to maximize their net energetic gain. Instead, our data suggest that juvenile lumpfish forage in a manner that reduces activity and conserves space in their limited aerobic scope. This behavioural flexibility is of great benefit to this species, as it allows young individuals to divert energy towards growth as opposed to activity. In a broader context, our results support previous speculation that ectotherms often forage in a manner that maintains a minimum prey encounter rate, but does not necessarily maximize net energy gain.

AB Predation risk influences the duration of offspring development in many species where embryos develop from externally shed eggs. Surprisingly, such predator-mediated effects on offspring development have rarely been explored in live-bearers. In this paper, we use the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a live-bearing freshwater fish, to test whether the duration of brood retention (the time from mating to parturition) is influenced by experimental changes in the perceived level of predation. Because the swimming performance of female guppies is impaired during late pregnancy, we predicted that females would withhold broods for shorter periods when they are exposed to cues that signal a heightened risk of predation on adults rather than on juveniles. We therefore simulated increased risk of predation on adults by using a combination of pike-shaped models (resembling natural predators that prey on adult guppies) and 'alarm substances' derived from the skin extracts of adult conspecific females. Our results revealed that, under simulated predation risk, female guppies produced broods significantly more quickly than their counterparts assigned to a control group where predator cues were absent. A subsequent evaluation of offspring swimming performance revealed a significant positive association between neonate swimming speeds and the duration of brood retention, suggesting that by accelerating parturition, females may produce offspring with impaired locomotor skills. These findings, in conjunction with similar results from other live-bearing species, suggest that the conditions experienced by gestating females can generate significant variation in the timing of offspring development with potentially important implications for offspring fitness.

AB 1. The carrying capacity of a site for migratory water birds, expressed in bird-days, can be of particular conservation value. Several attempts have been made to model this carrying capacity using ideal free distribution models such as, for instance, depletion models, in which the distribution is fully determined by exploitative competition.
   2. In the tests of depletion models carried out so far, no alternative models were compared; rather, one specific model was tested. We tested whether bird-days were more in accordance with birds depleting the food resource (a1) until a critical food density which just enabled survival or (a2) until a threshold food density which renders the site as profitable as an alternative site; and birds (b1) satisfying their daily requirements or (b2) maximizing daily intake.
   3. We studied Bewick's swans feeding on below-ground tubers of fennel pondweed in one part of an autumn staging site. In most years between 1995 and 2005, we measured tuber biomass densities around September, November and March, and counted swans daily during their stopover in October.
   4. The best fit between observed and predicted bird-days was obtained by assuming that the swans were maximizing their daily intake and depleting the tubers until a threshold biomass density (which yielded the same energetic return as the alternative food source after accounting for a small part of the initial tuber biomass being out of reach of the swans). Also in line with daily intake maximization, the daily feeding time did not differ from 10 h day(-1), the value predicted for Bewick's swans based on their feeding costs.
   5. Our results suggests that the applicable model to calculate carrying capacity may depend strongly on whether birds use a site to stopover or to winter, because it determines whether the birds are more likely to use a threshold or critical food density, and to behave as energy maximizers or satisficers.

AB We construct a novel individual-based random-walk model to assess how predicted global climate change might affect the dispersal rates of a temperate insect. Using a novel approach we obtained accurate field measurements of daily movements for individuals over time to parameterize our model. Males were found to move significantly further on average than females. Significant variation in movement was evident among individuals; the most dispersive individuals moved up to five (females) and seven (males) times as far on average as the least dispersive individuals. Mean relative daily movement of both males and females were exponentially related to maximum daily temperature recorded within the grass sward. Variability, both within and among individuals, in relative daily movement was incorporated into the model using gamma probability distributions. Resultant dispersal functions for seasonal movement are predicted to be highly leptokurtic, which agrees well with observations from the field. Predictions of the model suggest that for populations at the polewards edge of the current range an increase of 3-5 degrees C in daily maximum temperature may increase the proportion of long-distance dispersers (those characterized as comprising the top 0.1 % of furthest dispersing individuals under local conditions experienced during the 1963-1990 period) by up to 70%.

AB We assessed seed preference in four species of sparrows that are common to the central Monte desert of Argentina. Our hypotheses are that (1) sparrows always prefer grass over forb seeds and (2) different species of sparrows show the same preferences when consuming seeds. We presented seeds from eight species of plants (four grasses and four forbs) in both choice and nonchoice experiments. In general, sparrow species preferred grass over forb seeds, though one of them (Rufous-collared Sparrow [Zonotrichia capensis]) included one forb species (Parthenium hysterophorus) among its preferred seed items. Among grass seeds, sparrows avoided or showed less preference for the tiny seeds of Sporobolus cryptandrus, which suggests that seed weight may affect seed choice among grasses. Avoidance of most forb species, by contrast, could not be associated with seed size, probably because of the presence of unpalatable or toxic compounds in forb seeds. Experimental evidence suggests that the main feeding pressure of sparrows is clearly directed to grass seeds, which coincides with reported information on bird diet. Results support assertions that sparrows can cause a negative effect on the composition and abundance of grass seeds in the soil seed-bank, a necessary condition for birds in playing a significant role on grass population dynamics in the central Monte desert of Argentina.

AB The influence of the intensity of land use on small mammals in the ecoregion Nama Karoo, Namibia was investigated within the biodiversity programme BIOTA. Changes in species diversity and abundance were investigated across a fence separating heavily grazed communal and lightly grazed government owned rangeland. Assessing and monitoring of the small mammal populations were done seasonally from 2001-2003 on each of 2ha plots by using capture-mark-recapture methods. In total, 311 individuals representing nine species were caught within 5760 trap nights. Species richness, total abundance, species diversity and settlement was lower in the overgrazed area. The most abundant species were the Gerbillinae, Gerbillurus vallinus and Tatera leucogaster. T leucogaster did not occur in the overgrazed area. Due to the loss of grass cover, smaller bush diversity, bush encroachment and smaller arthropod abundance in the overgrazed area, changes in the small mammal community were most likely caused by the loss of food resources, available dew, disruption of habitat structures, cover and shelter and by increased predation risk. Only the 'desert' species, G vallinus, was favoured by the degraded land. It is also obvious that the uncontrolled grazing in the communal lands has affected the biodiversity and the regeneration potential, thus leading to land degradation.

AB To bridge the gaps between restoration as a science and as a practice, restoration ecology has to broaden its scope toward transdisciplinarity in close cooperation with landscape ecologists and other holistic environmentally oriented scientists, professionals, practitioners, and stakeholders. For restoration, the ongoing transdisciplinary scientific revolution has opened new insights to cope with the complex bio-hydro- and human-ecological network relations. The Total Human Ecosystem (THE), integrating humans with all other organisms and their total environment at the highest level of the global hierarchy, should become the unifying holistic paradigm for all synthetic "eco-disciplines." These should link ecological knowledge, wisdom, and ethics with their scientific and professional expertise from the natural and social sciences and the humanities. As the tangible matrix for all organisms, including humans, our industrial Total Human Landscape is the concrete spatial and functional system of the THE. It forms a closely interlaced network of solar energy-powered natural and seminatural biosphere landscapes and fossil energy-powered urban and agro-industrial technosphere landscapes. The self-organizing and self-creative restoration capacities of biosphere landscapes are driven by mutually amplifying auto- and cross-catalytic feedback loops, but the rapidly expanding technosphere landscapes are driven by destabilizing "run-away" feedback loops. To prevent a global breakdown and to ensure the sustainable future for both humankind and nature, these positive feedbacks have to be counteracted by restraining, cultural feedbacks of environmental planning and management, conservation, and restoration. As the theme of this special issue alludes to, this template should become an integral part of an urgently needed sustainability revolution, to which the transdisciplinary landscape restoration could contribute its important share.

AB There has been widespread concern that reduction in density of broadcast spawners by a fishery can have severe effects on reproduction. As fishing decreases density, fertilization efficiency declines, so that reproduction declines more rapidly than indicated by density, producing an Allee effect. However, this potentially precipitous decline in reproduction with declining density or stock size is not well understood at the population level. We used a simple deterministic model of the reproductive dynamics of a broadcast spawning invertebrate to show that the abrupt threshold often proposed as the form of this Allee effect is possible only when individuals are evenly spaced, and when sperm dispersal distribution is a constant out to a specified distance. When the spatial distribution is random and the sperm dispersal distribution is either Gaussian or exponential, fertilization success is linear up to 100%; thus, zygote production is quadratic up to this density. As the width of the dispersal function decreases, fertilization reaches 100% at higher densities, so that it may be beyond the highest density experienced by the population. In that case, zygote production is functionally linear. We then used a simulation model to assess the effects of aggregative behavior and stochastic variability in spatial patterns. We compared narrow and broad sperm dispersal distributions that were based on empirically determined fertilization of the green sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, under two flow regimes. Zygote production exhibited a gradual nonlinear Allee effect as density decreased for the broader gamete dispersal distribution, but a functionally linear relationship with a much lower slope for the narrower sperm dispersal distributions. Increasing aggregation increased the slope of both fertilization and zygote production vs. density at the origin, but they remained linear for the narrower distribution. High interannual variability in zygote production due to different spatial configurations suggested that the geometric mean of recruitment is a better indicator of population consequences than the arithmetic mean, and it displays a sharper threshold than the arithmetic mean. Our results imply that potential Allee effects at low density in broadcast spawning populations rarely exhibit threshold behavior, and that these Allee effects may be too weak to be detected in stock-recruitment relationships.

AB A major cause of the steep declines of American oyster (Crassostrea virginica) fisheries is the loss of oyster habitat through the use of dredges that have mined the reef substrata during a century of intense harvest. Experiments comparing the efficiency and habitat impacts of three alternative gears for harvesting oysters revealed differences among gear types that might be used to help improve the sustainability of commercial oyster fisheries. Hand harvesting by divers produced 25-32% more oysters per unit of time of fishing than traditional dredging and tonging, although the dive operation required two fishermen, rather than one. Per capita returns for dive operations may nonetheless be competitive with returns for other gears even in the short term if one person culling on deck can serve two or three divers. Dredging reduced the height of reef habitat by 34%, significantly more than the 23% reduction caused by tonging, both of which were greater than the 6% reduction induced by diver hand-harvesting. Thus, conservation of the essential habitat and sustainability of the subtidal oyster fishery can be enhanced by switching to diver hand-harvesting. Management schemes must intervene to drive the change in harvest methods because fishermen will face relatively high costs in making the switch and will not necessarily realize the long-term ecological benefits.

AB The characteristics of foreduries created in a municipal management program on a developed barrier island are evaluated to identify how landforms used as protection structures can be natural in appearance and function yet compatible with human values. Shoreline management zones include a naturally evolving, undeveloped segment: a noneroding, developed segment; eroding and noneroding segments of an "improved beach" where dunes have been built by artificial nourishment: and a privately built, artificially nourished dune on the shoreline of an inlet.A disastrous storm in 1962 resulted in an aggressive program for building dunes using sand fences, vegetation plantings, purchase of undeveloped lots, and sediment backpassing to maintain beach widths and dune elevations. The present nourished and shaped foredune in the improved beach is higher, wider, and closer to the berm crest than the natural dune. Restricted inputs of aeolian sand keep the surface flat and poorly vegetated, A stable section of this engineered shore has a wider beach, and sand fences have created a higher foredune with greater topographic diversity. The cross shore zonation of vegetation here is more typical of natural dunes, but the environmental gradient is much narrower. The privately built dune is low, narrow, and located where it could not be created naturally. Foreshore and aeolian sediments in the undeveloped segment and the improved beach are similar in mean grain size (0.16-0.21 mm) and sorting (0.31-0.39phi), but sediment on the surface of the nourished dune is coarser (28.1% gravel) with a more poorly sorted sand fraction (1.30phi) representing lag elements on the deflation surface. Willingness to enhance beaches and dunes for protection has reduced insurance premiums and allowed the municipality to qualify for funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to replace lost sediment, thus placing an economic value on dunes. Success of the management program is attributed to: (i) timing property-purchase and dune-building programs to periods immediately after storms (causing residents to accept high dunes that restrict access or views); (ii) instituting a vigorous education program (reminding residents of hazards during nonstorm periods); (iii) maintaining control over local sediment supplies (to keep pace with erosion and create new shoreline environments) (iv) investing private and municipal economic resources in landforms (qualifying them for external funds for replacement); and (v) maintaining, augmenting, or simply tolerating biodiversity and natural processes (retaining a natural heritage).

AB The structure and ultrastructure of the nectaries of the monoecious species Ecballium elaterium were studied. Large differences in size and structure of the nectaries were observed in the two genders of flowers, those of the staminate Rowers being much larger and more developed than those of the pistillate flowers. The latter do not secrete measurable amounts of nectar. In the nectariferous cells; especially of the staminate flowers, numerous plasmodesmata are present. The pre-nectar originating in the phloem is stored in the plastids of the nectariferous cells primarily as starch grains. The nectar appears to be exuded from the nectary via modified stomata. Very small insects of the order Hemiptera were found to dwell inside the flowers of the two genders, but in different numbers; their number in the staminate flowers was more than twice that in the pistillate flowers. These insects may take part in the process of pollination. (C) 2000 Annals of Botany Company.

AB N-2 fixation (nitrogenase activity), primary production, and diazotrophic community composition of stromatolite mats from Highborne Cay, Exuma, Bahamas, were examined over a 2-year period (1997-1998). The purpose of the study was to characterize the ecophysiology of N-2 fixation in modern marine stromatolites. Microbial mats are an integral surface component of these stromatolites and are hypothesized to have a major role in stromatolite formation and growth. The stromatolite mats contained active photosynthetic and diazotrophic assemblages that exhibited temporal separation of nitrogenase activity (NA) and photosynthesis. Maximal NA was detected at night. Seasonal differences in NA and net O-2 production were observed, photosynthetic activity and the availability of reduced organic carbon appear to be the key determinants of NA. Additions of the de novo protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol did not inhibit NA in March 1998, but greatly inhibited NA in August 1998. Partial sequence analysis of the nifH gene indicates that a broad diversity of diazotrophs may be responsible for NA in the stromatolites.

AB Previously it was found that the expression of selected heat-shock proteins is upregulated in corals after exposure to elevated temperature. We published that HSPs are suitable markers in sponges to monitor the degree of environmental stress on these animals. In the present study the heat-shock proteins (HSPs) with a molecular weight of 90 kDa have been selected to prove their potential usefulness as biomarkers under controlled laboratory conditions and in the field. The studies have been performed with the octocoral Dendronephthya klunzingeri from which the cDNA coding for HSP90 was cloned first. The expression of the HSP90 gene is upregulated by thermal stress; treatment of the animals for 2 h at 4 degrees C below or above the ambient temperature resulted in a >4.5-fold higher steady-stare level of the respective mRNA. Also animals taken from stressed locations in the field showed an increased expression. The amount of HSP90 protein in D. klunzingeri was found to be strongly increased under thermal stress, or exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl (congener 118), but not after treatment with cadmium. Field studies revealed that samples taken from a nonstressed area have a low level of HSP90, but those collected from locations at which the corals are under physical stress (sedimentation through landfilling) show a high expression of HSP90. It is concluded that the chaperone HSP90 might become a suitable biomarker to monitor environmental stress on corals. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In 1992 the flora and vegetation of an area of linear sand dunes at Nizzana, western Negev desert, Israel, was investigated. Seven different plant communities were found and a vegetation map of the research area was produced. The plant communities were distinguished by only the dominating perennial species. Nevertheless, the results of the study indicate, that also annual species may be suitable as a tool to distinguish between desert plant communities.
   The results suggest, that the most important environmental factor determining patterns of plant distribution in the Nizzana research site is the structure and dynamics of the soil-surface. Vegetation cover was lowest in highly stable areas with hard surface crust or a high amount of fines in the soil (playas) and on the mobile dune tops. Highest plant cover was found at the dune bases and in areas which had been used for cultivation in former times. Mean species richness per unit area was lowest on the dune tops and highest in the interdune areas with more or less stable surface crust. Absolute number of species found was highest for the playas and lowest on the dune-tops.
   As most of the plant communities described for the research site are restricted to areas which are characterized by a certain surface stability it is discussed to regard some of the vegetation units as succession stages in a process of continuing stabilization of the dunes.
