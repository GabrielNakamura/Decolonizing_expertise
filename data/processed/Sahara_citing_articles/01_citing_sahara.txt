AB Pollinators are a key component of global biodiversity, providing vital ecosystem services to crops and wild plants. There is clear evidence of recent declines in both wild and domesticated pollinators, and parallel declines in the plants that rely upon them. Here we describe the nature and extent of reported declines, and review the potential drivers of pollinator loss, including habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens, alien species, climate change and the interactions between them. Pollinator declines can result in loss of pollination services which have important negative ecological and economic impacts that could significantly affect the maintenance of wild plant diversity, wider ecosystem stability, crop production, food security and human welfare.

AB Savannas occur where trees and grasses interact to create a biome that is neither grassland nor forest. Woody and gramineous plants interact by many mechanisms, some negative (competition) and some positive (facilitation). The strength and sign of the interaction Varies in both time and space, allowing a rich array of possible outcomes but no universal predictive model. Simple models of coexistence of trees and grasses, based on separation in rooting depth, are theoretically and experimentally inadequate. Explanation of the widely observed increase in tree biomass following introduction of commercial ranching into savannas requires inclusion of interactions among browsers, grazers, and fires, and their effects on tree recruitment. Prediction of the consequences of manipulating tree biomass through clearing further requires an understanding of how trees modify light, water, and nutrient environments of grasses. Understanding the nature of coexistence between trees and grass, which under other circumstances are mutually exclusive or unequal partners, yields theoretical insights and has practical implications.

AB There is an urgent need in aquaculture to develop microbial cona ol strategies, since disease outbreaks are recognized as important constraints to aquaculture production and trade and since the development of antibiotic resistance has become a matter of growing concern. One of the alternatives to antimicrobials in disease control could be the use of probiotic bacteria as microbial cona ol agents. This review describes the state of the art of probiotic research in the culture of fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and live food, with an evaluation of the results obtained so far. A new definition of probiotics, also applicable to aquatic environments, is proposed, and a detailed description is given of their possible modes of action, i.e., production of compounds that are inhibitory toward pathogens, competition with harmful microorganisms for nutrients and energy, competition with deleterious species for adhesion sites, enhancement of the immune response of the animal, improvement of water quality, and interaction with phytoplankton. A rationale is proposed for the multistep and multidisciplinary process required for the development of effective and safe probiotics for commercial application in aquaculture. Finally, directions for further research are discussed.

AB Connectivity, or the exchange of individuals among marine populations, is a central topic in marine ecology. For most benthic marine species with complex life cycles, this exchange occurs primarily during the pelagic larval stage. The small size of larvae coupled with the vast and complex fluid environment they Occupy hamper Our ability to quantify dispersal and connectivity. Evidence from direct and indirect approaches using geochemical and genetic techniques suggests that populations range front fully open to hilly closed. Understanding the biophysical processes that contribute to observed dispersal patterns requires integrated interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate high-resolution biophysical modeling and empirical data. Further, differential postsettlement survival of larvae may add complexity to measurements of connectivity. The degree to which populations self recruit or receive subsidy from other populations has consequences for a number of fundamental ecological processes that affect population regulation and persistence. Finally, a full understanding of population connectivity has important applications for management and conservation.

AB This paper is the first global study of the extent to which fire determines global vegetation patterns by preventing ecosystems from achieving the potential height, biomass and dominant functional types expected under the ambient climate (climate potential).
   To determine climate potential, we simulated vegetation without fire using a dynamic global-vegetation model. Model results were tested against fire exclusion studies from different parts of the world. Simulated dominant growth forms and tree cover were compared with satellite-derived land- and tree-cover maps.
   Simulations were generally consistent with results of fire exclusion studies in southern Africa and elsewhere. Comparison of global 'fire off' simulations with landcover and treecover maps show that vast areas of humid C-4 grasslands and savannas, especially in South America and Africa, have the climate potential to form forests. These are the most frequently burnt ecosystems in the world. Without fire, closed forests would double from 27% to 56% of vegetated grid cells, mostly at the expense of C-4 plants but also of C-3 shrubs and grasses in cooler climates.
   C-4 grasses began spreading 6-8 Ma, long before human influence on fire regimes. Our results suggest that fire was a major factor in their spread into forested regions, splitting biotas into fire tolerant and intolerant taxa.

AB Although it is generally acknowledged that invasions by exotic plant species represent a major threat to biodiversity and ecosystem stability, little attention has been paid to the potential impacts of these invasions on nutrient cycling processes in the soil. The literature on plant-soil interactions strongly suggests that the introduction of a new plant species, such as an invasive exotic, has the potential to change many components of the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), water, and other cycles of an ecosystem. I have reviewed studies that compare pool sizes and flux rates of the major nutrient cycles in invaded and noninvaded systems for invasions of 56 species. The available data suggest that invasive plant species frequently increase biomass and net primary production, increase N availability, alter N fixation rates, and produce litter with higher decomposition rates than co-occurring natives. However, the opposite patterns also occur, and patterns of difference between exotics and native species show no trends in some other components of nutrient cycles (for example, the size of soil pools of C and N). In some cases, a given species has different effects at different sites, suggesting that the composition of the invaded community and/or environmental factors such as soil type may determine the direction and magnitude of ecosystem-level impacts. Exotic plants alter soil nutrient dynamics by differing from native species in biomass and productivity, tissue chemistry, plant morphology, and phenology. Future research is needed to (a) experimentally test the patterns suggested by this data set; (b) examine fluxes and pools for which few data are available, including whole-site budgets; and (c) determine the magnitude of the difference in plant characteristics and in plant dominance within a community that is needed to alter ecosystem processes. Such research should be an integral component of the evaluation of the impacts of invasive species.

AB There is increasing interest in developing better predictive tools and a broader conceptual framework to guide the restoration of degraded land. Traditionally, restoration efforts have focused on re-establishing historical disturbance regimes or abiotic conditions, relying on successional processes to guide the recovery of biotic communities. However, strong feedbacks between biotic factors and the physical environment can alter the efficacy of these successional-based management efforts. Recent experimental work indicates that some degraded systems are resilient to traditional restoration efforts owing to constraints such as changes in landscape connectivity and organization, loss of native species pools, shifts in species dominance, trophic interactions and/or invasion by exotics, and concomitant effects on biogeochemical processes. Models of alternative ecosystem states that incorporate system thresholds and feedbacks are now being applied to the dynamics of recovery in degraded systems and are suggesting ways in which restoration can identify, prioritize and address these constraints.

ID LARVAL DISPERSAL; CARIBBEAN CORAL; LOCAL RETENTION; RECRUITMENT
AB Defining the scale of connectivity, or exchange, among marine populations and determining the factors driving this-exchange are pivotal to our understanding of the population dynamics, genetic structure, and biogeography of many coastal species. Using a high-resolution biophysical model for the Caribbean region, we report that typical larval dispersal distances of ecologically relevant magnitudes are on the scale of only 10 to 100 kilometers for a variety of reef fish species. We also show the importance of the early onset of active larval movement mediating the dispersal potential. In addition to self -recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems. The results reveal distinct regions of population isolation based on larval dispersal that also correspond to genetic and morphological clines observed across a range of marine organisms.

AB The future of humanity depends on whether or not we have a vision to guide our transition toward sustainability, on scales ranging from local landscapes to the planet as a whole. Sustainability science is at the core of this vision, and landscapes and regions represent a pivotal scale domain. The main objectives of this paper are: (1) to elucidate key definitions and concepts of sustainability, including the Brundtland definition, the triple bottom line, weak and strong sustainability, resilience, human well-being, and ecosystem services; (2) to examine key definitions and concepts of landscape sustainability, including those derived from general concepts and those developed for specific landscapes; and (3) to propose a framework for developing a science of landscape sustainability. Landscape sustainability is defined as the capacity of a landscape to consistently provide long-term, landscape-specific ecosystem services essential for maintaining and improving human well-being. Fundamentally, well-being is a journey, not a destination. Landscape sustainability science is a place-based, use-inspired science of understanding and improving the dynamic relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being in changing landscapes under uncertainties arising from internal feedbacks and external disturbances. While landscape sustainability science emphasizes place-based research on landscape and regional scales, significant between landscape interactions and hierarchical linkages to both finer and broader scales (or externalities) must not be ignored. To advance landscape sustainability science, spatially explicit methods are essential, especially experimental approaches that take advantage of designed landscapes and multi-scaled simulation models that couple the dynamics of landscape services (ecosystem services provided by multiple landscape elements in combination as emergent properties) and human well-being.

AB Invasion ecology has been criticised for its lack of general principles. To explore this criticism, we conducted a meta-analysis that examined characteristics of invasiveness (i.e. the ability of species to establish in, spread to, or become abundant in novel communities) and invasibility (i.e. the susceptibility of habitats to the establishment or proliferation of invaders). There were few consistencies among invasiveness characteristics (3 of 13): established and abundant invaders generally occupy similar habitats as native species, while abundant species tend to be less affected by enemies; germination success and reproductive output were significantly positively associated with invasiveness when results from both stages (establishment/spread and abundance/impact) were combined. Two of six invasibility characteristics were also significant: communities experiencing more disturbance and with higher resource availability sustained greater establishment and proliferation of invaders. We also found that even though 'propagule pressure' was considered in only similar to 29% of studies, it was a significant predictor of both invasiveness and invasibility (55 of 64 total cases). Given that nonindigenous species are likely introduced non-randomly, we contend that 'propagule biases' may confound current paradigms in invasion ecology. Examples of patterns that could be confounded by propagule biases include characteristics of good invaders and susceptible habitats, release from enemies, evolution of 'invasiveness', and invasional meltdown. We conclude that propagule pressure should serve as the basis of a null model for studies of biological invasions when inferring process from patterns of invasion.

AB Ecosystem services, the benefits that people obtain from ecosystems, are a powerful lens through which to understand human relationships with the environment and to design environmental policy. The explicit inclusion of beneficiaries makes values intrinsic to ecosystem services; whether or not those values are monetized, the ecosystem services framework provides a way to assess trade-offs among alternative scenarios of resource use and land- and seascape change. We provide an overview of the ecosystem functions responsible for producing terrestrial hydrologic services and use this context to lay out a blueprint for a more general ecosystem service assessment. Other ecosystem services are addressed in our discussion of scale and trade-offs. We review valuation and policy tools useful for ecosystem service protectiou and provide several examples of land management using these tools. Throughout, we highlight avenues for research to advance the ecosystem services framework as an operational basis for policy decisions.

AB We suggest that relatively few species attributes are of overriding importance to the structure of benthic marine algal communities and that these are often shared among taxonomically distant species. Data from the western North Atlantic, eastern North Pacific and Caribbean suggest that patterns in algal biomass, diversity and dominance are strikingly convergent when examined at a functional group level relative to the productivity and herbivore-induced disturbance potentials of the environment. We present a simple graphical model that provides a way to predict algal community composition based on these two environmental axes. This predictability stems from algal functional groups having characteristic rates of mass-specific productivity, thallus longevity and canopy height that cause them to ''behave'' in similar ways. Further, herbivore-induced disturbances have functionally similar impacts on most morphologically and anatomically similar algae regardless of their taxonomic or geographic affinities. Strategies identified for marine algae parallel those of a terrestrial scheme with the addition of disturbance-tolerant plants that characteristically coexist with and even thrive under high levels of disturbance. Algal-dominated communities, when examined at the functional group level, appear to be much more temporally stable and predictable than when examined at the species level.

AB Although research on the role of competitive interactions during community assembly began decades ago, a recent revival of interest has led to new discoveries and research opportunities. Using contemporary coexistence theory that emphasizes stabilizing niche differences and relative fitness differences, we evaluate three empirical approaches for studying community assembly. We show that experimental manipulations of the abiotic or biotic environment, assessments of trait-phylogeny-environment relationships, and investigations of frequency-dependent population growth all suggest strong influences of stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences on the outcome of plant community assembly. Nonetheless, due to the limitations of these approaches applied in isolation, we still have a poor understanding of which niche axes and which traits determine the outcome of competition and community structure. Combining current approaches represents our best chance of achieving this goal, which is fundamental to conceptual ecology and to the management of plant communities under global change.

TI Improving indicator species analysis by combining groups of sites
SO OIKOS
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSOCIATIONS; FIDELITY; CLASSIFICATION; COEFFICIENT; VEGETATION
AB Indicator species are species that are used as ecological indicators of community or habitat types, environmental conditions, or environmental changes. In order to determine indicator species, the characteristic to be predicted is represented in the form of a classification of the sites, which is compared to the patterns of distribution of the species found at the sites. Indicator species analysis should take into account the fact that species have different niche breadths: if a species is related to the conditions prevailing in two or more groups of sites, an indicator species analysis undertaken on individual groups of sites may fail to reveal this association. In this paper, we suggest improving indicator species analysis by considering all possible combinations of groups of sites and selecting the combination for which the species can be best used as indicator. When using a correlation index, such as the point-biserial correlation, the method yields the combination where the difference between the observed and expected abundance/frequency of the species is the largest. When an indicator value index (IndVal) is used, the method provides the set of site-groups that best matches the observed distribution pattern of the species. We illustrate the advantages of the method in three different examples. Consideration of combinations of groups of sites provides an extra flexibility to qualitatively model the habitat preferences of the species of interest. The method also allows users to cross multiple classifications of the same sites, increasing the amount of information resulting from the analysis. When applied to community types, it allows one to distinguish those species that characterize individual types from those that characterize the relationships between them. This distinction is useful to determine the number of types that maximizes the number of indicator species.

AB 1 Savanna ecosystems are characterized by the codominance of two different life forms: grasses and trees. An operational understanding of how these two different life forms coexist is essential for understanding savanna function and for predicting its response to future environmental change.
   2 The existing model, which proposes that grasses and trees coexist by a separation of rooting niches, is not supported by recent empirical investigations. Our aim was to define an alternative mechanism of grass-tree coexistence in savanna ecosystems. The model we have built concentrates on life history-disturbance interactions between grasses and trees.
   3 The model demonstrates coexistence for a wide range of environmental conditions, and exhibits long periods of slow decline in adult tree numbers interspersed with relatively infrequent recruitment events. Recruitment is controlled by rainfall, which limits seedling establishment, and fire, which prevents recruitment into adult size classes. Decline in adult tree numbers is the result of continuing, but low levels, of adult mortality. Both aspects of the dynamics are consistent with an established non-equilibrium mechanism of coexistence (the storage effect).
   4 A sensitivity analysis indicated that data on tree resprouting ability, stem growth rates and the relationship between seedling establishment and wet season drought are essential for predicting both the range of conditions for which coexistence is possible and the response of savanna ecosystems to environmental change.
   5 Our analysis suggests that understanding grass-tree interactions in savanna requires consideration of the long-term effects of life history-disturbance interactions on demography, rather than the fine-scale effects of resource competition on physiological performance.

AB Herbivory by domestic and wild ungulates is a major driver of global vegetation dynamics. However, grazing is not considered in dynamic global vegetation models, or more generally in studies of the effects of environmental change on ecosystems at regional to global scale. An obstacle to this is a lack of empirical tests of several hypotheses linking plant traits with grazing. We, therefore, set out to test whether some widely recognized trait responses to grazing are consistent at the global level. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant trait responses to grazing, based on 197 studies from all major regions of the world, and using six major conceptual models of trait response to grazing as a framework. Data were available for seven plant traits: life history, canopy height, habit, architecture, growth form (forb, graminoid, herbaceous legume, woody), palatability, and geographic origin. Covariates were precipitation and evolutionary history of herbivory. Overall, grazing favoured annual over perennial plants, short plants over tall plants, prostrate over erect plants, and stoloniferous and rosette architecture over tussock architecture. There was no consistent effect of grazing on growth form. Some response patterns were modified by particular combinations of precipitation and history of herbivory. Climatic and historical contexts are therefore essential for understanding plant trait responses to grazing. Our study identifies some key traits to be incorporated into plant functional classifications for the explicit consideration of grazing into global vegetation models used in global change research. Importantly, our results suggest that plant functional type classifications and response rules need to be specific to regions with different climate and herbivory history.

AB Endemism and species richness are highly relevant to the global prioritization of conservation efforts in which oceanic islands have remained relatively neglected. When compared to mainland areas, oceanic islands in general are known for their high percentage of endemic species but only moderate levels of species richness, prompting the question of their relative conservation value. Here we quantify geographic patterns of endemism-scaled richness ("endemism richness'') of vascular plants across 90 terrestrial biogeographic regions, including islands, worldwide and evaluate their congruence with terrestrial vertebrates. Endemism richness of plants and vertebrates is strongly related, and values on islands exceed those of mainland regions by a factor of 9.5 and 8.1 for plants and vertebrates, respectively. Comparisons of different measures of past and future human impact and land cover change further reveal marked differences between mainland and island regions. While island and mainland regions suffered equally from past habitat loss, we find the human impact index, a measure of current threat, to be significantly higher on islands. Projected land-cover changes for the year 2100 indicate that land-use-driven changes on islands might strongly increase in the future. Given their conservation risks, smaller land areas, and high levels of endemism richness, islands may offer particularly high returns for species conservation efforts and therefore warrant a high priority in global biodiversity conservation in this century.

AB We reviewed empirical data and hypotheses derived from demographic, optimal foraging, life-history, community, and biogeographic theory for predicting the sensitivity of species to habitat fragmentation. We found 12 traits or trait groups that have been suggested as predictors of species sensitivity: population size; population fluctuation and storage effect; dispersal power; reproductive potential; annual survival; sociality; body size; trophic position; ecological specialisation, microhabitat and matrix use; disturbance and competition sensitive traits; rarity; and biogeographic position. For each trait we discuss the theoretical justification for its sensitivity to fragmentation and empirical evidence for and against the suitability of the trait as a predictor of fragmentation sensitivity. Where relevant, we also discuss experimental design problems for testing the underlying hypotheses. There is good empirical support for 6 of the 12 traits as sensitivity predictors: population size; population fluctuation and storage effects; traits associated with competitive ability and disturbance sensitivity in plants; microhabitat specialisation and matrix use; rarity in the form of low abundance within a habitat; and relative biogeographic position. Few clear patterns emerge for the remaining traits from empirical studies if examined in isolation. Consequently, interactions of species traits and environmental conditions must be considered if we want to be able to predict species sensitivity to fragmentation. We develop a classification of fragmentation sensitivity based on specific trait combinations and discuss the implications of the results for ecological theory.

AB Plant invasion potentially alters ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. However, the overall direction and magnitude of such alterations are poorly quantified.
   Here, 94 experimental studies were synthesized, using a meta-analysis approach, to quantify the changes of 20 variables associated with C and N cycles, including their pools, fluxes, and other related parameters in response to plant invasion.
   Pool variables showed significant changes in invaded ecosystems relative to native ecosystems, ranging from a 5% increase in root carbon stock to a 133% increase in shoot C stock. Flux variables, such as above-ground net primary production and litter decomposition, increased by 50-120% in invaded ecosystems, compared with native ones. Plant N concentration, soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations were 40, 30 and 17% higher in invaded than in native ecosystems, respectively. Increases in plant production and soil N availability indicate that there was positive feedback between plant invasion and C and N cycles in invaded ecosystems.
   Invasions by woody and N-fixing plants tended to have greater impacts on C and N cycles than those by herbaceous and nonN-fixing plants, respectively. The responses to plant invasion are not different among forests, grasslands, and wetlands. All of these changes suggest that plant invasion profoundly influences ecosystem processes.

AB Though the distribution of global vegetation can generally be predicted from climate, grasslands are an exception. C-4 grassy biomes cover vast areas that are warm enough and wet enough to support closed forests. The extent of this climate mismatch has been revealed by physiologically based global vegetation simulations and by large empirical data sets. Reasons for the existence of grassy biomes have long been debated, polarized into bottom-up (resources) or top-down (fire,herbivory) arguments. Recent studies indicate that both are important, especially in suppressing woody recruits. Grasses are formidable competitors below ground, create highly flammable fuels, and can support large herbivore densities. The net effect on trees is rare and episodic recruitment of adults in tree-fall gaps. The implication is that ecosystem structure and function depend on demographic transitions. Tree cover is increasing and grass/forest boundaries are changing. These changes can have large feedbacks to the earth-atmosphere system. Though progress has been made, there is still great uncertainty in predicting the future of C-4 grassy biomes.

AB AimsVegetation classification consistent with the Braun-Blanquet approach is widely used in Europe for applied vegetation science, conservation planning and land management. During the long history of syntaxonomy, many concepts and names of vegetation units have been proposed, but there has been no single classification system integrating these units. Here we (1) present a comprehensive, hierarchical, syntaxonomic system of alliances, orders and classes of Braun-Blanquet syntaxonomy for vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen, and algal communities of Europe; (2) briefly characterize in ecological and geographic terms accepted syntaxonomic concepts; (3) link available synonyms to these accepted concepts; and (4) provide a list of diagnostic species for all classes.
   LocationEuropean mainland, Greenland, Arctic archipelagos (including Iceland, Svalbard, Novaya Zemlya), Canary Islands, Madeira, Azores, Caucasus, Cyprus.
   MethodsWe evaluated approximately 10000 bibliographic sources to create a comprehensive list of previously proposed syntaxonomic units. These units were evaluated by experts for their floristic and ecological distinctness, clarity of geographic distribution and compliance with the nomenclature code. Accepted units were compiled into three systems of classes, orders and alliances (EuroVegChecklist, EVC) for communities dominated by vascular plants (EVC1), bryophytes and lichens (EVC2) and algae (EVC3).
   ResultsEVC1 includes 109 classes, 300 orders and 1108 alliances; EVC2 includes 27 classes, 53 orders and 137 alliances, and EVC3 includes 13 classes, 24 orders and 53 alliances. In total 13448 taxa were assigned as indicator species to classes of EVC1, 2087 to classes of EVC2 and 368 to classes of EVC3. Accepted syntaxonomic concepts are summarized in a series of appendices, and detailed information on each is accessible through the software tool EuroVegBrowser.
   ConclusionsThis paper features the first comprehensive and critical account of European syntaxa and synthesizes more than 100yr of classification effort by European phytosociologists. It aims to document and stabilize the concepts and nomenclature of syntaxa for practical uses, such as calibration of habitat classification used by the European Union, standardization of terminology for environmental assessment, management and conservation of nature areas, landscape planning and education. The presented classification systems provide a baseline for future development and revision of European syntaxonomy.

AB Invasive alien species (IAS) threaten human livelihoods and biodiversity globally. Increasing globalization facilitates IAS arrival, and environmental changes, including climate change, facilitate IAS establishment. Here we provide the first global, spatial analysis of the terrestrial threat from IAS in light of twenty-first century globalization and environmental change, and evaluate national capacities to prevent and manage species invasions. We find that one-sixth of the global land surface is highly vulnerable to invasion, including substantial areas in developing economies and biodiversity hotspots. The dominant invasion vectors differ between high-income countries (imports, particularly of plants and pets) and low-income countries (air travel). Uniting data on the causes of introduction and establishment can improve early-warning and eradication schemes. Most countries have limited capacity to act against invasions. In particular, we reveal a clear need for proactive invasion strategies in areas with high poverty levels, high biodiversity and low historical levels of invasion.

AB Feedback between plants and the soil is frequently invoked on the basis of evidence of mutual effects. Feedback can operate through pathways involving soil physical properties, chemical and biogeochemical properties and processes, and biological properties, including the community composition of the microbiota and soil fauna. For each pathway, we review the mechanistic basis and assess the evidence that feedback occurs. We suggest that several properties of feedback systems (for example, their complexity, specificity, and strength relative to other ecological factors, as well as the temporal and spatial scales over which they operate) be considered. We find that the evidence of feedback is strongest for plants growing in extreme environments and for plant-mutualist or plant-enemy interactions. We conclude with recommendations for a more critical appraisal of feedback and for new directions of research.

AB Thirty years ago, Thorson (1966; Neth J Sea Res 3;267-293) calculated that juvenile mortality in marine bivalves could exceed 98.6%. Subsequently, juvenile mortality rates have been assumed to be high and to influence the evolution of life history traits. However, there have been no attempts to establish whether high juvenile mortality is common or to determine if interspecific trends in juvenile mortality exist. To address this issue, we reviewed 30 studies of age-specific mortality among bivalves, gastropods, barnacles, ascidians, bryozoans and echinoderms. High juvenile mortality is widespread among benthic marine invertebrates, with 20 of the 30 studies reporting levels of juvenile mortality >90%. Mortality is particularly high during the first moments of juvenile life, and can exceed 30% during the first day. Pooling survivorship data from all species revealed a general trend, with survivorship decreasing exponentially during the first days or weeks of juvenile life until, by the age of 4 mo, virtually all cohorts were reduced to <20% of their initial numbers; mortality remained low thereafter. We suggest that extreme vulnerability at the onset of juvenile life is a shared trait that is largely responsible for the survivorship trend. Natural variation within this trend would be largely due to variation in intensity of mortality factors. Predation and desiccation are well-documented causes of juvenile mortality, but the current lack of data on factors such as ultraviolet radiation, diseases, and 'internal' causes (energy depletion, developmental and physiological defects) precludes a ranking of factors as selective pressures. Methods used to quantify juvenile mortality vary considerably in the level of resolution they can achieve within the early juvenile period. Studies of early juvenile mortality should ideally monitor the fate of individuals from the onset of juvenile life, using sampling intervals less than or equal to 1 d. Mapping and imaging techniques can provide accurate results for sessile organisms, whereas mark and recapture can be effective for motile animals with limited dispersal. Early juvenile mortality has been shown to influence population abundance and distribution as well as community structure. Juvenile mortality is also expected to be an important determinant of age at maturity, but only among species maturing within 4 mo of postlarval life since mortality remains low after the age of 4 mo. A compilation of data on age at first reproduction in 92 species revealed a bimodal grouping of species: 22% of species maturing within 45 d after beginning juvenile life, and 60% maturing after at least 1 yr. The influence of juvenile mortality on age at maturity will differ substantially among these 2 groups and will therefore not be equal or directly comparable among all species, Given the magnitude of early juvenile mortality and the similarities in mortality patterns across diverse taxa and habitats, a better understanding of early juvenile mortality should help researchers to understand how population parameters are regulated and help elucidate the significance of traits that characterize populations and species.

AB Based on data from 233 Danish lakes, enclosure experiments, full-scale experiments and published empirical models we present evidence that top-down control is more important in shallow lakes than in deep lakes, excepting lakes with a high abundance of submerged macrophytes. The evidence in support is: (1) That at a given epilimnion total phosphorus concentration (TP) the biomass of fish per m(2) is independent of depth, which means that biomass per m(3) is markedly higher in shallow lakes. (2) That the biomass of benthic invertebrates is higher in shallow lakes, which means that the benthi-planktivorous fish are less dependent on zooplankton prey than in deep lakes. By their ability to shift to zooplankton predation their density can remain high even in periods when zooplankton is scarce and they can thereby maintain a potentially high predation pressure on zooplankton. (3) That the possibilities of cladocerans to escape predation by vertical migration are less. (4) That the zooplankton:phytoplankton mass ratio per m(2) is lower and presumably then also the grazing pressure on phytoplankton. (5) That nutrient constraints appear to be weaker, as evidenced by the fact that at a given annual mean TP, summer TP is considerably higher in shallow lakes, especially in eutrophic lakes lacking submerged macrophytes. (6) That negative feedback on cladocerans by cyanobacteria is lower as cyanobacterial dominance is less frequent in shallow lakes and more easily broken (at least in Northern temperate lakes), and (7) That top-down control by benthi-planktivorous fish is markedly reduced in lakes rich in submerged macrophytes because the plants serve as a refuge for pelagic cladocerans and encourage predatory fish at the expense of prey fish. We conclude that manipulation of fish and submerged macrophytes may have substantial impact on lake ecosystems, in particular in shallow eutrophic lakes. On the contrary, if the conditions for more permanent changes in plant abundance or fish community structure are lacking the feed-back mechanisms that endeavour a return to the original turbid state will be particularly strong in shallow lakes.

AB Exotic species have become increasingly significant management problems in parks and reserves and frequently complicate restoration projects. At the same time there may be circumstances in which their removal may have unforeseen negative consequences or their use in restoration is desirable. We review the types of effects exotic species may have that are important during restoration and suggest research that could increase our ability to set realistic management goals. Their control and use may be controversial; therefore we advocate consideration of exotic species in the greater context of community structure and succession and emphasize areas where ecological research could bring insight to management dilemmas surrounding exotic species and restoration. For example, an understanding of the potential transience of exotics in a site and the role particular exotics might play in changing processes that influence the course of succession is essential to setting removal priorities and realistic management goals. Likewise, a greater understanding of the ecological role of introduced species might help to reduce controversy surrounding their purposeful use in restoration. Here we link generalizations emerging from the invasion ecology literature with practical restoration concerns, including circumstances when it is practical to use exotic species in restoration.

AB 1. Shrub encroachment has been widely observed in savanna regions. This study analysed the causes of shrub encroachment in the lowveld savanna of north-eastern Swaziland, southern Africa, and highlighted management regimes that can be used to reduce or prevent it.
   2. The rates and dynamics of shrub encroachment were quantified for the period 1947-90 using aerial photographs, and for 1997 using a ground survey. Five similar areas with different land-use histories were compared to investigate the relative importance of fire, herbivory, rainfall, soil type and shrub density in driving shrub dynamics.
   3. In the study area as a whole, shrub cover increased from a mean of 2% in 1947 to 31% in 1990. Dichrostachys cinerea accounted for most of the increase in cover, contributing 81% to total shrub cover during 1997. Shrub cover was strongly correlated with shrub density and weakly negatively correlated with toe cover.
   4. Shrub encroachment varied across land-use fence lines. The key determinants of shrub dynamics were grazing, through its negative effect on fire frequency and an interaction between drought frequency and high shrub cover. Browsing pressure had a significant but minor impact on dynamics, while soil type had no significant effect. High grazing pressures through their effect on fire frequency were critical throughout the study period in promoting shrub encroachment, while the interaction between drought and high shrub cover produced declines in the later stages. Browsing had an impact on encroachment only in the early stages.
   5. Frequent fires, facilitated by low grazing pressures, were capable of preventing shrub encroachment. When coupled with drought, frequent fires could reduce high shrub densities.
   6. As cover and density were strongly correlated, it can be inferred from the negative correlation between change in cover (density) and initial cover (density) that the rate of shrub encroachment was cover (density)-dependent and that there was a shrub equilibrium of 40% cover, approximating to 2400 plants ha(-1). Shrub population growth was driven by events (fire, drought) as well as continuous agents (density dependence, mean browsing and grazing pressure).
   7. Bush encroachment can be reversed by a combination of management (frequent fires) and climatic events (drought). The implications for savanna management are discussed.

SO NATURE

DT Article
ID DYNAMICS; INTERNET
AB Resilience, a system's ability to adjust its activity to retain its basic functionality when errors, failures and environmental changes occur, is a defining property of many complex systems(1). Despite widespread consequences for human health(2), the economy(3) and the environment(4), events leading to loss of resilience-from cascading failures in technological systems(5) to mass extinctions in ecological networks(6)-are rarely predictable and are often irreversible. These limitations are rooted in a theoretical gap: the current analytical framework of resilience is designed to treat low-dimensional models with a few interacting components(7), and is unsuitable for multi-dimensional systems consisting of a large number of components that interact through a complex network. Here we bridge this theoretical gap by developing a set of analytical tools with which to identify the natural control and state parameters of a multi-dimensional complex system, helping us derive effective one-dimensional dynamics that accurately predict the system's resilience. The proposed analytical framework allows us systematically to separate the roles of the system's dynamics and topology, collapsing the behaviour of different networks onto a single universal resilience function. The analytical results unveil the network characteristics that can enhance or diminish resilience, offering ways to prevent the collapse of ecological, biological or economic systems, and guiding the design of technological systems resilient to both internal failures and environmental changes.

AB Larvae have been difficult to study because their small size limits our ability to understand their behavior and the conditions they experience. Questions about larval transport focus largely on (a) where they go [dispersal] and (b) where they come from [connectivity]. Mechanisms of transport have been intensively studied in recent decades. As our ability to identify larval sources develops, the consequences of connectivity are garnering more consideration. Attention to transport and connectivity issues has increased dramatically in the past decade, fueled by changing motivations that now include management of fisheries resources, understanding of the spread of invasive species, conservation through the design of marine reserves, and prediction of climate-change effects. Current progress involves both technological advances and the integration of disciplines and approaches. This review focuses on insights gained from physical modeling, chemical tracking, and genetic approaches. I consider how new findings are motivating paradigm shifts concerning (1) life-history consequences; (2) the openness of marine populations, self-recruitment, and population connectivity; (3) the role of behavior; and (4) the significance of variability in space and time. A challenge for the future will be to integrate methods that address dispersal on short (intragenerational) timescales such as elemental fingerprinting and numerical simulations with those that reflect longer timescales such as gene flow estimates and demographic modeling. Recognition and treatment of the continuum between ecological and evolutionary timescales will be necessary to advance the mechanistic understanding of larval and population dynamics.

AB I present dispersal distances for 44 species with data on propagule duration (PD) for 40 of these. Data were combined with those in Shanks et al. (2003; Ecol. Appl. 13: S159-S169), providing information on 67 species. PD and dispersal distance are correlated, but with many exceptions. The distribution of dispersal distances was bimodal. Many species with PDs longer than I day dispersed less than 1 km, while others dispersed tens to hundreds of kilometers. Organisms with short dispersal distances were pelagic briefly or remained close to the bottom while pelagic. Null models of passively dispersing propagules adequately predict dispersal distance for organisms with short PDs (< 1 day), but overestimate dispersal distances for those with longer PDs. These models predict that propagules are transported tens of kilometers offshore; however, many types remain within the coastal boundary layer where currents are slower and more variable, leading to lower than predicted dispersal. At short PDs, dispersal distances estimated from genetic data are similar to observed. At long PDs, genetic data generally overestimate dispersal distance. This discrepancy is probably due to the effect of rare individuals that disperse long C distances, thus smoothing genetic differences between populations. Larval behavior and species' life-history traits can play a critical role in determining dispersal distance.

AB The South Brazilian grasslands occupy some 13.7 million ha and support very high levels of biodiversity. This paper reviews the current state of ecological knowledge on South Brazilian Campos and of threats and challenges associated with their conservation. The principal factors shaping grassland physiognomy and diversity are discussed, and information is presented on diversity of plant species; best estimates suggest that 3000-4000 phanerophytes occur in the South Brazilian grasslands. It is argued that, despite their high species richness, Campos vegetation is not adequately protected under current conservation policies. In the past three decades, approximately 25% of the grassland area has been lost due to land use changes, and this trend continues. However, representation of Campos grasslands in conservation units is extremely low (less than 0.5%), and the management in most of these is inadequate to preserve the grasslands, as grazing and fire are important factors for their persistence. In conclusion, the following urgent needs are identified: (1) to create more conservation units in different regions, including different grassland types throughout southern Brazil, (2) to develop proper management strategies where grasslands are subject to shrub encroachment and forest expansion, (3) to conduct research on biodiversity and ecological processes in the Campos region and (4) to raise public awareness of the value and vulnerability of this vegetation type.

AB When animals can choose from a range of feeding options, often those options with a higher energetic gain carry a higher risk of predation. This paper analyses the optimal trade-off between food and predation. We are primarily interested in how an animal's decisions and its state change over time. Our models are very general. They can be applied to growth decisions, such as choice of habitat, in which case we might consider how the state variable size changes over an animal's lifetime. Equally our models are applicable to short-term foraging decisions, such as vigilance level, in which case we might consider how energy reserves vary over a day. We concentrate on two cases: (i) the animal must reach a fixed state, its fitness depending on when this is attained; (ii) the animal must survive to a fixed time, its fitness depending on its final state.
   In case (i) minimization of mortality per unit increase of state is optimal under certain baseline conditions. In case (ii) behaviour is constant over time under baseline conditions (the 'Risk-spreading Theorem'). We analyse how these patterns are modified by complicating factors, e.g. time penalties, premature termination of the food supply, stochasticity in food supply or in metabolic expenditure, and state-dependence in the ability to obtain food, in metabolic expenditure and in predation risk. From this analysis we obtain a variety of possible explanations for why an animal should reduce its intake rate over time (i.e. show satiation). We show how -earlier work can be viewed as special cases of our results.

AB Ecosystems and landscapes around the world have become increasingly domesticated through urbanization. Cities have been the engines of socioeconomic development but also the centers of major environmental problems since the industrial revolution. Numerous studies have shown that our urban ecosystems and landscapes are on an unsustainable trajectory. Global sustainability depends critically on cities, and urban ecology can and needs to play a key role in the transition toward sustainability. In this paper, I review different definitions and perspectives of urban ecology, discuss major advances and key issues, and propose a framework to help move the field forward. After almost 90 years of development, urban ecology has evolved into a truly transdisciplinary enterprise that integrates ecological, geographical, planning, and social sciences. The most salient thrust of current research activities in the field is the emerging urban sustainability paradigm which focuses on urban ecosystem services and their relations to human well-being. While urbanization is complex in many ways, we do know a lot about its patterns, processes, and effects. More specifically, we know a great deal about urban growth patterns in space and time, the underlying drivers and mechanisms, and myriad effects of urbanization on biodiversity, ecological processes, and ecosystem services. Compared to their ancient counterparts, contemporary cities tend to be bigger in physical size and ecological footprint, faster in growth rate in terms of both population and urbanized land, and more irregular in landscape composition and configuration. As coevolving human-environment systems, cities are spatially heterogeneous, complex adaptive systems. As such, the dynamic trajectory of cities can never be fully predicted or controlled, but can and should be influenced or guided in more desirable directions through planning and design activities that are based on urban ecological knowledge and sustainability principles.

AB The Humboldt Current System (HCS) is one of the most productive marine ecosystems on earth. It extends along the west coast of South America from southern Chile (similar to 42 degrees S) up to Ecuador and the Galapagos Islands near the equator. The general oceanography of the HCS is characterised by a predominant northward flow of surface waters of subantarctic origin and by strong upwelling of cool nutrient-rich subsurface waters of equatorial origin. Along the coast of northern and central Chile, upwelling is localised and its occurrence changes from being mostly continuous (aseasonal) in northern Chile to a more seasonal pattern in southern-central Chile. Several important upwelling centres along the Chilean coast are interspersed with long stretches of coast without or with sporadic and less intense upwelling. Large-scale climatic phenomena (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) are superimposed onto this regional pattern, which results in a high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, complicating the prediction of ecological processes along the Chilean coast. This limited predictability becomes particularly critical in light of increasing human activities during the past decades, at present mainly in the form of exploitation of renewable resources (fish, invertebrates and macroalgae). This review examines current knowledge of ecological processes in the HCS of northern and central Chile, with a particular focus on oceanographic factors and the influence of human activities, and further suggests conservation strategies for this high-priority large marine ecosystem. Along the Chilean coast, the injection of nutrients into surface waters through upwelling events results in extremely high primary production. This fuels zooplankton and fish production over extensive areas, which also supports higher trophic levels, including large populations of seabirds and marine mammals. Pelagic fisheries, typically concentrated near main upwelling centres (20-22 degrees S, 32-34 degrees S, 36-38 degrees S), take an important share of the fish production, thereby affecting trophic interactions in the HCS. Interestingly, El Nino (EN) events in northern Chile do not appear to cause a dramatic decline in primary or zooplankton production but rather a shift in species composition, which affects trophic efficiency of and interactions among higher-level consumers. The low oxygen concentrations in subsurface waters of the HCS (oxygen-minimum zone, OMZ) influence predator-prey interactions in the plankton by preventing some species from migrating to deeper waters. The OMZ also has a strong effect on the bathymetric distribution of sublittoral soft-bottom communities along the Chilean coast. The few long-term studies available from sublittoral soft-bottom communities in northern and central Chile suggest that temporal dynamics in abundance and community composition are driven by interannual phenomena (EN and the extent and intensity of the OMZ) rather than by intra-annual (seasonal) patterns. Macrobenthic communities within the OMZ are often dominated in biomass by sulphide-oxidising, mat-forming bacteria. Though the contribution of these microbial communities to the total primary production of the system and their function in structuring OMZ communities is still scarcely known, they presumably play a key role, also in sustaining large populations of economically valuable crustaceans.
   Sublittoral hard bottoms in shallow waters are dominated by macroalgae and suspension-feeder reefs, which concentrate planktonic resources (nutrients and suspended matter) and channel them into benthic food wbs. These communities persist for many years and local extinctions appear to be mainly driven by large-scale events such as EN, which causes direct mortality of benthic organisms due to lack of nutrients/food, high water temperatures, or burial under terrigenous sediments from river runoff. Historic extinctions in combination with local conditions (e.g., vicinity to upwelling centres or substratum availability) produce a heterogeneous distribution pattern of benthic communities, which is also reflected in the diffuse biogeographic limits along the coast of northern-central Chile. Studies of population connectivity suggest that species with highly mobile planktonic dispersal stages maintain relatively continuous populations throughout most of the HCS, while populations of species with limited planktonic dispersal appear to feature high genetic structure over small spatial scales. The population dynamics of most species in the HCS are further influenced by geographic variation in propagule production (apparently caused by local differences in primary production), by temporal variation in recruit supply (caused by upwelling events, frontal systems and eddies), and topographically driven propagule retention (behind headlands, in bay systems and upwelling shadows). Adults as well as larval stages show a wide range of different physiological, ecological and reproductive adaptations. This diversity in life-history strategies in combination with the high variability in environmental conditions (currents, food availability, predation risk, environmental stress) causes strong fluctuations in stocks of both planktonic and benthic resources. At present, it remains difficult to predict many of these fluctuations, which poses particular challenges for the management of exploited resources and the conservation of biodiversity in the HCS. The high spatiotemporal variability in factors affecting ecological processes and the often-unpredictable outcome call for fine-scale monitoring of recruitment and stock dynamics. In order to translate this ecological information into sustainable use of resources, adaptive and co-participative management plans are recommended. Identification of areas with high biodiversity, source and sink regions for propagules and connectivity among local populations together with developing a systematic conservation planning, which incorporates decision support systems, are. important tasks that need to be resolved in order to create an efficient network of Marine Protected Areas along the coast of northern-central Chile. Farther offshore, the continental shelf and the deep-sea trenches off the Chilean coast play an important role in bio-geochemical cycles, which may be highly sensitive to climatic change. Research in this area should be intensified, for which modern research vessels are required. Biodiversity inventories must be accompanied by efforts to foster taxonomic expertise and museum collections (which should integrate morphological and molecular information). Conservation goals set for the next decade can only be achieved with the incorporation of local stakeholders and the establishment of efficient administrative structures.
   The dynamic system of the HCS in northern-central Chile can only be understood and managed efficiently if a fluent communication between stakeholders, administrators, scientists and politician is guaranteed.

AB Desertification is a change in soil properties, vegetation or climate, which results in a persistent loss of ecosystem services that are fundamental to sustaining life. Desertification affects large dryland areas around the world and is a major cause of stress in human societies. Here we review recent research on the drivers, feedbacks, and impacts of desertification. A multidisciplinary approach to understanding the drivers and feedbacks of global desertification is motivated by our increasing need to improve global food production and to sustainably manage ecosystems in the context of climate change. Classic desertification theories look at this process as a transition between stable states in bistable ecosystem dynamics. Climate change (i.e., aridification) and land use dynamics are the major drivers of an ecosystem shift to a "desertified" (or "degraded") state. This shift is typically sustained by positive feedbacks, which stabilize the system in the new state. Desertification feedbacks may involve land degradation processes (e. g., nutrient loss or salinization), changes in rainfall regime resulting from land-atmosphere interactions (e. g., precipitation recycling, dust emissions), or changes in plant community composition (e. g., shrub encroachment, decrease in vegetation cover). We analyze each of these feedback mechanisms and discuss their possible enhancement by interactions with socio-economic drivers. Large scale effects of desertification include the emigration of "environmental refugees" displaced from degraded areas, climatic changes, and the alteration of global biogeochemical cycles resulting from the emission and long-range transport of fine mineral dust. Recent research has identified some possible early warning signs of desertification, which can be used as indicators of resilience loss and imminent shift to desert-like conditions. We conclude with a brief discussion on some desertification control strategies implemented in different regions around the world. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aim To detect centres of vascular plant endemism at a continental scale by analysis of specimen-based distributional data and to relate any pattern to environmental factors and history.
   Location Australia.
   Methods Presence of 8468 seed plant species-level taxa throughout continental Australia and Tasmania was mapped on a 1 degrees grid to visualize the pattern of species richness. This sample comprises half the known flora. Three indices of endemism were calculated but we preferred one that is unrelated to species richness, so that these two concepts could be distinguished in practice. Centres of endemism were detected by simple mapping and by spatial autocorrelation analysis (SAC). Linear regression was used to examine the relationship of the patterns of species richness and endemism to latitude, topography and climate.
   Results Both species richness and endemism vary greatly across the continent but in most cases the same centres were high in both richness and endemism. Twelve distinct centres were identified. The major centres of both diversity and endemism are south-west western Australia, the Border Ranges between New South Wales and Queensland, the Wet Tropics near Cairns, Tasmania and the Iron-McIlwraith Range of eastern Cape York Peninsula. The last centre appears to be more significant than recognized by past authors. Whether this is a true Australian centre of endemism, or is largely an outlier of the flora of Papua New Guinea, is explored. Another centre, in the Adelaide-Kangaroo Island region, has been overlooked altogether by previous authors. Regression analysis did not find a simple climatic explanation of the observed patterns. There was a suggestion that topographic variation within the 1 degrees cells may be positively correlated with endemism, which is consistent with mountainous regions functioning as refugia. One clear result is that all the major centres of endemism are near-coastal. A likely explanation is that Pleistocene expansions of the central desert have been a powerful limitation on the viability of refugia for narrowly endemic species. All the centres of endemism lie outside the estimated limits of the expanded arid zone at the last glacial maximum (18,000 yr BP). In particular, the 'Central Australian Mountain Ranges centre of plant diversity and endemism' of Boden & Given (1995) is detected as a strong centre of species richness, but not at all as a centre of endemism. This is despite good sampling of this region.
   Main conclusions Endemism can be distinguished from species richness by using an appropriate index and mapping of such indices can detect centres of endemism. This study demonstrates the value of specimen based distributional data, such as is held in state herbaria and museums.

AB Aim Woody plants were not widely considered to be important invasive alien species until fairly recently. Thousands of species of trees and shrubs have, however, been moved around the world. Many species have spread from planting sites, and some are now among the most widespread and damaging of invasive organisms. This article presents a global list of invasive alien trees and shrubs. It discusses taxonomic biases, geographical patterns, modes of dispersal, reasons for introductions and key issues regarding invasions of non-native woody plants around the world.
   Location Global.
   Methods An exhaustive survey was made of regional and national databases and the literature. Correspondence with botanists and ecologists and our own observations in many parts of the world expanded the list. Presence of invasive species was determined for each of 15 broad geographical regions. The main reasons for introduction and dissemination were determined for each species.
   Results The list comprises 622 species (357 trees, 265 shrubs in 29 plant orders, 78 families, 286 genera). Regions with the largest number of woody invasive alien species are: Australia (183); southern Africa (170); North America (163); Pacific Islands (147); and New Zealand (107). Species introduced for horticulture dominated the list (62% of species: 196 trees and 187 shrubs). The next most important reasons for introduction and dissemination were forestry (13%), food (10%) and agroforestry (7%). Three hundred and twenty-three species (52%) are currently known to be invasive in only one region, and another 126 (20%) occur in only two regions. Only 38 species (6%) are very widespread (invasive in six or more regions). Over 40% of invasive tree species and over 60% of invasive shrub species are bird dispersed.
   Main conclusions Only between 0.5% and 0.7% of the world's tree and shrub species are currently invasive outside their natural range, but woody plant invasions are rapidly increasing in importance around the world. The objectively compiled list of invasive species presented here provides a snapshot of the current dimensions of the phenomenon and will be useful for screening new introductions for invasive potential.

AB Global climate change is having devastating effects on habitat structure in coral-reef ecosystems owing to extreme environmental sensitivities and consequent bleaching of reef-building scleractinian corals. Coral bleaching frequently causes immediate loss of live coral and may lead to longer-term declines in topographic complexity. This review identifies coral cover and topographic complexity as critical and distinct components of coral-reef habitats that shape communities of coral-reef fishes. Coral loss has the greatest and most immediate effect on fishes that depend on live corals for food or shelter, and many such fishes may face considerable risk of extinction with increasing frequency and severity of bleaching. Coral loss may also have longer-term consequences for fishes that require live corals at settlement, which are compounded by devastating effects of declining topographic complexity. Topographic complexity moderates major biotic factors, such as predation and competition, contributing to the high diversity of fishes on coral reefs. Many coral-reef fishes that do not depend on live coral are nonetheless dependent on the topographic complexity provided by healthy coral growth. Ecological and economic consequences of declining topographic complexity are likely to be substantial compared with selective effects of coral loss but both coral cover and topographic complexity must be recognised as a critical component of habitat structure and managed accordingly. Urgent action on the fundamental causes of climate change and appropriate management of critical elements of habitat structure (coral cover and topographic complexity) are key to ensuring long-term persistence of coral-reef fishes.

AB 1. Government departments, environmental managers and conservationists are all facing escalating pressure to address and resolve a diversity of invasive alien species (IAS) problems. Yet much research to date is primarily concerned with quantifying the scale of the problem rather than delivering robust solutions and has not adequately addressed all stages of the invasion process, and only a few studies embrace the ecosystem approach.
   2. Three successive steps, prevention, eradication and control, form the cornerstones of recommended best practices aimed at managing IAS. The goal of such actions is the restoration of ecosystems to preserve or re-establish native biodiversity and functions.
   3. Prevention is widely promoted as being a more environmentally desirable strategy than actions undertaken after IAS establishment, yet is hindered by the difficulty in separating invasive from non-invasive alien species. Furthermore, the high number of candidate IAS, the investment required in taxonomic support and inspection capacity, and the expense of individual risk assessments may act against the net benefits of prevention. More rewarding avenues may be found by pursuing neural networks to predict the potential composition of pest assemblages in different regions and/or model introduction pathways to identify likely invasion hubs.
   4. Rapid response should be consequent on early detection but, when IAS are rare, detection rates are compromised by low occurrence and limited power to discern significant changes in abundance. Power could be increased by developing composite indicators that track trends in a suite of IAS with similar life histories, shared pathways and/or habitat preferences.
   5. The assessment of management options will benefit from an ecosystem perspective that considers the manipulation of native competitors, consumers and mutualists, and reviews existing management practices as well as mitigates other environmental pressures. The ease with which an IAS can be targeted should not only address the direct management effects on population dynamics but also indirect effects on community diversity and structure. Where the goal is to safeguard native biodiversity, such activities should take into account the need to re-establish native species and/or restore ecosystem function in the previously affected area.
   6. Synthesis and applications. A comprehensive approach to IAS management should include consideration of the: (i) expected impacts; (ii) technical options available; (iii) ease with which the species can be targeted; (iv) risks associated with management; (v) likelihood of success; and (vi) extent of public concern and stakeholder interest. For each of these issues, in addition to targeting an individual species, the management of biological invasions must also incorporate an appreciation of other environmental pressures, the importance of landscape structure, and the role of existing management activities and restoration efforts.

AB Interactions between multiple ecosystem stressors are expected to jeopardize biological processes, functions and biodiversity. The scientific community has declared stressor interactions-notably synergies-a key issue for conservation and management. Here, we review ecological literature over the past four decades to evaluate trends in the reporting of ecological interactions (synergies, antagonisms and additive effects) and highlight the implications and importance to conservation. Despite increasing popularity, and ever-finer terminologies, we find that synergies are (still) not the most prevalent type of interaction, and that conservation practitioners need to appreciate and manage for all interaction outcomes, including antagonistic and additive effects. However, it will not be possible to identify the effect of every interaction on every organism's physiology and every ecosystem function because the number of stressors, and their potential interactions, are growing rapidly. Predicting the type of interactions may be possible in the near-future, using meta-analyses, conservation-oriented experiments and adaptive monitoring. Pending a general framework for predicting interactions, conservation management should enact interventions that are robust to uncertainty in interaction type and that continue to bolster biological resilience in a stressful world.

   ABILITY; WEED; INTERFERENCE; REPLACEMENT
AB Invasive plants often appear to be more competitive than native species, but there have been few tests of this hypothesis. We reviewed published pair-wise experiments between invading and native plant species. Although the designs that have been used allow only limited inferences, the available data suggest that the effect of invasive species on native species is usually stronger than vice versa. Furthermore, mixtures of invasive and native species are generally less productive than monocultures of the native species, but not less than monocultures of the invasive species. However, the selection of invaders and natives for study has not been random, and the data could be biased towards highly competitive invaders and natives that are weaker than average competitors. We attempt to clarify confusion surrounding the concept of competitive superiority in the context of plant invasions, and we discuss the limitations of the methods that have been used to investigate competition between invasive and native species. To rigorously test the generality of the hypothesis that invaders are better competitors than natives we need to compare the effects of closely related native and invasive species on each other. We suggest that the influence of an invading species on total plant community biomass is an important clue in understanding the role of competition in a plant invasion. The role of competition in the establishment and naturalization stages of the invasion process may be very different from its role in the "outbreak" stage.

AB The flora of the south-western tip of southern Africa, the Cape flora, with some 9000 species in an area of 90 000 km(2) is much more speciose than can be expected from its area or latitude, and is comparable to that expected from the most diverse equatorial areas. The endemism of almost 70 %, on the other hand, is comparable to that found on islands. This high endemism is accounted for by the ecological and geographical isolation of the Cape Floristic Region, but explanations for the high species richness are not so easily found. The high species richness is accentuated when its taxonomic distribution is investigated: almost half of the total species richness of the area is accounted for by 33 'Cape floral clades'. These are clades which may have initially diversified in the region, and of which at least half the species are still found in the Cape Floristic Region. Such a high contribution by a very small number of clades is typical of island floras, not of mainland floras. The start of the radiation of these clades has been dated by molecular clock techniques to between 18 million years ago (Mya) (Pelargonium) and 8 Mya (Phylica), but only six radiations have been dated to date. The fossil evidence for the dating of the radiation is shown to be largely speculative. The Cenozoic environmental history of southern Africa is reviewed in search of possible triggers for the radiations, climatic changes emerge as the most likely candidate. Due to a very poor fossil record, the climatic history has to be inferred from larger scale patterns, these suggest large-scale fluctuations between summer wet (Palaeocene, Early Miocene) and summer dry climates (Oligocene, Middle Miocene to present). The massive speciation in the Cape flora might be accounted for by the diverse limitations to gene flow (dissected landscapes, pollinator specialisation, long flowering times allowing much phenological specialisation), as well as a richly complex environment providing a diversity of selective forces (geographically variable climate, much altitude variation, different soil types, rocky terrain providing many micro-niches, and regular fires providing both intermediate disturbances, as well as different ways of surviving the fires). However, much of this is based on correlation, and there is a great need for (a) experimental testing of the proposed speciation mechanisms, (b) more molecular clock estimates of the age and pattern of the radiations, and (c) more fossil evidence bearing on the past climates.

AB Submerged macrophytes are crucial for the stabilization of the clear water state in shallow, mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Especially, charophytes often play an important role because they are typically rapid colonizers and because charophyte meadows are believed to have a particularly strong positive effect on water transparency compared to other macrophytes. Several mechanisms may contribute to the impact of submerged macrophytes on the planktonic food web. In this paper, the available literature on these mechanisms is briefly reviewed and special attention is paid to the impact of charophytes on the structure and dynamics of phyto- and zooplankton communities. The paper focuses on allelopathy, and possible differences between charophytes and other macrophytes, as well as gaps in our knowledge are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Eastern deciduous forests have been invaded by two exotic species that often dominate the understory vegetation. Berberis thunbergii, a woody shrub. forms dense thickets, while Microstegium vimineum, a C-4 grass, forms continuous lawns; the two species often co-occur. We hypothesized that a variety of characteristics of the exotic species may cause soil-based ecosystem processes to change following invasion, and that such changes could establish positive feedback processes that enhance the spread of the exotic. We examined changes in soil pH, nitrogen cycling, and litter dynamics in stands infested with both species in three locations in northern New Jersey (USA). Soils directly beneath each of the two exotics had higher pH values and higher nitrification rates and often had higher net N mineralization rates than did soils beneath adjacent patches of the most common native understory shrub, Vaccinium pallidum. These differences could be replicated in the greenhouse by growing the exotics in previously uninvaded soils. Berberis litter was much higher in N concentration than was litter of the native species; it decomposed more rapidly than litter of native dominant tree species, with little or no immobilization of N. In contrast, Microstegium litter decomposed more slowly than the native species' litters, and it immobilized N. We suggest that the same change in soil-increased pH and nitrification-result from different combinations of mechanisms in the two exotic species. Both species evidently favor uptake of nitrate. which may elevate pH. However, Berberis combines large biomasses of N-rich roots with N-rich leaf litter, while Microstegium populations combines small biomasses of N-rich roots with small biomasses of N-poor litter that leave much of the surface soil with few roots. The ability to change soil functions may be an important and previously unrecognized characteristic that renders species capable of invading intact communities, while the likelihood that changes in soil functions can alter the growth of the exotics may be an important component of invasibility.

AB (1) This paper describes the survival of juvenile blackbirds according to their weight as 8-day-old nestlings.  In a 4-year study of 748 individually colour-ringed nestlings, heavy nestlings were more likely to survive to breed in the study area than lighter nestlings.
   (2) Nestlings below 35 g never survived to fledge; those above 45 g showed a linear increase in the probability of survival to independece, up to heaviest nestlings in the sample; between 35 and 45 g there was a linear, but more rapid, increase in survival prospects with weight.  The shape of the relationship between nestling weight and juvenile survival was similar in different years, through the season, and between brood sizes and age ranks within broods.
   (3) Differential mortality by nestling weight occurred from ringing to fledging, from fledging to 2 weeks after fledging (when the young are still fed by their parents and are easily located on territories), and from 2 weeks to 1 month after fledging (when the young are independent but can be difficult to locate).  However, birds that survived this period apparently had a random chance of breeding.
   (4) These findings on juvenile survival suggest that nestling weight itself influences juvenile survival, not some correlate such as brood size.
   (5) A knowledge of the shape of the relationship between nestling weight and juvenile survival allows one to measure nestling 'quality' as the probability that a nestling will survive to breed.  In practice, the probability of survival to shortly after nutritional independence might be an adequate estimate of relative probabilities of recruitment to the breeding population in many bird species.

AB Aim
   We argue that 'propagule pressure', a key term in invasion biology, has been attributed at least three distinct definitions (with usage of a related term causing additional confusion). All of the definitions refer to fundamental concepts within the invasion process, with the result that the distinct importance of these different concepts has been at best diluted, and at worst lost.
   Location
   Global.
   Methods
   We reviewed pertinent literature on propagule pressure to resolve confusion about different uses of the term 'propagule pressure' and we introduced a new term for one variant, colonization pressure. We conducted a computer simulation whereby the introduction of species is represented as a simple sampling process to elucidate the relationship between propagule and colonization pressure.
   Results
   We defined colonization pressure as the number of species introduced or released to a single location, some of which will go on to establish a self-sustaining population and some of which will not. We subsequently argued that colonization pressure should serve as a null hypothesis for understanding temporal or spatial differences in exotic species richness, as the more species that are introduced, the more we should expect to establish. Finally, using a simple simulation, we showed that propagule pressure is related to colonization pressure, but in a non-linear manner.
   Main conclusion
   We suggest that the nature of the relationship between propagule pressure and colonization pressure, as well as the efficacy of various proxy measures of each, require more detailed exploration if invasion ecology is to continue to develop into a more predictive science.

AB Many representatives of freshwater zooplankton produce at some stage in their life cycle resting stages. A variable portion of the eggs of the previous growing period will hatch at the next occasion while the remaining ones are added to a persistent egg bank, where they can remain viable for decades or longer. The importance of the study of resting eggs and egg banks in general for such different disciplines as taxonomy, ecological biogeography, paleolimnology, nature conservation, evolutionary ecology and community and population ecology is generally appreciated. The major current and expected future developments in this rapidly expanding field of research are presented here. The structure and dynamics of the egg bank are determined by the life history characteristics of the species (or local population), the hatching phenology of their resting stages, and the characteristics of the habitat. The horizontal distribution of dormant stages is generally patchy, with a greater density in the deeper and/or windward parts of a pond or lake. In sediment cores, most viable ( responsive) eggs occur in the upper centimeters, although vertical variation related to the history of fish predation or water quality occurs. The accumulation of resting stages of different species, generations and genotypes with variable regeneration niches results in a mixed egg bank with greater potential biodiversity than the active community sampled at any one moment. Through the benthic-pelagic coupling, this dormant reservoir may have considerable impact on the evolutionary potential of the organisms, the ecological dynamics of the community and the distribution of species. Egg banks can be considered the archive of the local habitat, since the pattern of changes in species assemblage and genotypes from the past up to the present reflect changes due to natural or anthropogenic impact that can be used to reconstruct evolutionary processes or even to restore the local habitat. Overlooking the egg bank as an important component of zooplankton communities may lead to erroneous interpretations in the analysis of community and population genetic structure. This review integrates technical and scientific information needed in the study of the structure and function of egg banks in zooplankton with special focus on the fascinating latest developments in the field.

AB Decadal-scale observations of marine reserves suggest that indirect effects on taxa that occur through cascading trophic interactions take longer to develop than direct effects on target species. Combining and analyzing a unique set of long-term time series of ecologic data in and out of fisheries closures from disparate regions, we found that the time to initial detection of direct effects on target species (+/-SE) was 5.13 +/- 1.9 years, whereas initial detection of indirect effects on other taxa, which were often trait mediated, took significantly longer (13.1 +/- 2.0 years). Most target species showed initial direct effects, but their trajectories over time were highly variable. Many target species continued to increase, some leveled off, and others decreased. Decreases were due to natural fluctuations, fishing impacts from outside reserves, or indirect effects from target species at higher trophic levels. The average duration of stable periods for direct effects was 6.2 +/- 1.2 years, even in studies of more than 15 years. For indirect effects, stable periods averaged 9.1 +/- 1.6 years, although this was not significantly different from direct effects. Populations of directly targeted species were more stable in reserves than in fished areas, suggesting increased ecologic resilience. This is an important benefit of marine reserves with respect to their function as a tool for conservation and restoration.

AB OCBIL theory aims to develop an integrated series of hypotheses explaining the evolution and ecology of, and best conservation practices for, biota on very old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs). Conventional theory for ecology and evolutionary and conservation biology has developed primarily from data on species and communities from young, often disturbed, fertile landscapes (YODFELs), mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. OCBILs are rare, but are prominent in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region, South Africa's Greater Cape, and Venezuela's Pantepui Highlands. They may have been more common globally before Pleistocene glaciations. Based on the premise that natural selection has favoured limited dispersability of sedentary organisms, OCBILs should have elevated persistence of lineages (Gondwanan Heritage Hypothesis) and long-lived individuals (Ultimate Self Hypothesis), high numbers of localised rare endemics and strongly differentiated population systems. To counter such natural fragmentation and inbreeding due to small population size, ecological, cytogenetic and genetic mechanisms selecting for the retention of heterozygosity should feature (the James Effect). The climatic stability of OCBILs should be paralleled by persistence of adjacent semi-arid areas, conducive to speciation (Semiarid Cradle Hypothesis). Special nutritional and other biological traits associated with coping with infertile lands should be evident, accentuated in plants, for example, through water-foraging strategies, symbioses, carnivory, pollination and parasitism. The uniquely flat landscapes of southwestern Australia have had prolonged presence of saline lakes along palaeoriver systems favouring evolution of accentuated tolerance to salinity. Lastly, unusual resiliences and vulnerabilities might be evident among OCBIL organisms, such as enhanced abilities to persist in small fragmented populations but great susceptibility to major soil disturbances. In those places where it is most pertinent, OCBIL theory hopefully lays a foundation for future research and for better informed conservation management.

AB Ecologists and evolutionary biologists are broadly interested in how the interactions among organisms influence their abundance, distribution, phenotypes, and genotypic composition. Recently, we have seen a growing appreciation of how multispecies interactions can act synergistically or antagonistically to alter the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of interactions in ways that differ fundamentally from outcomes predicted by pairwise interactions. Here, we review the evidence for criteria identified to detect community-based, diffuse coevolution. These criteria include (a) the presence of genetic correlations between traits involved in multiple interactions, (b) interactions with one species that alter the likelihood or intensity of interactions with other species, and (c) nonadditive combined effects of multiple interactors. In addition, we review the evidence that multispecies interactions have demographic consequences for populations, as well as evolutionary consequences. Finally, we explore the experimental and analytical techniques, and their limitations, used in the study of multispecies interactions. Throughout, we discuss areas in particular need of future research.

AB Leopards Panthera pardus have a catholic diet and are generally thought to prey on medium-sized ungulates; however, knowledge on which species are actually preferred and avoided is lacking, along with an understanding of why such preferences arise. Twenty-nine published and four unpublished studies of leopard diet that had relative prey abundance estimates associated with them were analysed from 13 countries in 41 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the leopard. A Jacobs' index value was calculated for each prey species in each study and the mean of these was then tested against a mean of 0 using t or sign tests for preference or avoidance. Leopards preferentially prey upon species within a weight range of 10-40 kg. Regression plots suggest that the most preferred mass of leopard prey is 25 kg, whereas the mean body mass of significantly preferred prey is 23 kg. Leopards prefer prey within this body mass range, which occur in small herds, in dense habitat and afford the hunter minimal risk of injury during capture. Consequently, impala, bushbuck and common duiker are significantly preferred, with chital likely to also be preferred with a larger sample size from Asian sites. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided, as are species that are restricted to open vegetation or that have sufficient anti-predator strategies. The ratio of mean leopard body mass with that of their preferred prey is less than 1 and may be a reflection of their solitary hunting strategy. This model will allow us to predict the diet of leopards in areas where dietary information is lacking, also providing information to assist wildlife managers and conservation bodies on predator carrying capacity and predator-prey interactions.

AB Aims We present the first global map of vascular plant species richness by ecoregion and compare these results with the published literature on global priorities for plant conservation. In so doing, we assess the state of floristic knowledge across ecoregions as described in floras, checklists, and other published documents and pinpoint geographical gaps in our understanding of the global vascular plant flora. Finally, we explore the relationships between plant species richness by ecoregion and our knowledge of the flora, and between plant richness and the human footprint - a spatially explicit measure of the loss and degradation of natural habitats and ecosystems as a result of human activities.
   Location Global.
   Methods Richness estimates for the 867 terrestrial ecoregions of the world were derived from published richness data of c. 1800 geographical units. We applied one of four methods to assess richness, depending on data quality. These included collation and interpretation of published data, use of species-area curves to extrapolate richness, use of taxon-based data, and estimates derived from other ecoregions within the same biome.
   Results The highest estimate of plant species richness is in the Borneo lowlands ecoregion (10,000 species) followed by nine ecoregions located in Central and South America with >= 8000 species; all are found within the Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests biome. Among the 51 ecoregions with >= 5000 species, only five are located in temperate regions. For 43% of the 867 ecoregions, data quality was considered good or moderate. Among biomes, adequate data are especially lacking for flooded grasslands and flooded savannas. We found a significant correlation between species richness and data quality for only a few biomes, and, in all of these cases, our results indicated that species-rich ecoregions are better studied than those poor in vascular plants. Similarly, only in a few biomes did we find significant correlations between species richness and the human footprint, all of which were positive.
   Main conclusions The work presented here sets the stage for comparisons of degree of concordance of plant species richness with plant endemism and vertebrate species richness: important analyses for a comprehensive global biodiversity strategy. We suggest: (1) that current global plant conservation strategies be reviewed to check if they cover the most outstanding examples of regions from each of the world's major biomes, even if these examples are species-poor compared with other biomes; (2) that flooded grasslands and flooded savannas should become a global priority in collecting and compiling richness data for vascular plants; and (3) that future studies which rely upon species-area calculations do not use a uniform parameter value but instead use values derived separately for subregions.

AB 1. Ecological factors influencing prey selection by tiger Panthera tigris, leopard Panthera pardus and dhole Cuon alpinus were investigated in an intact assemblage of large mammals in the tropical forests of Nagarahole, southern India, between 1986 and 1990.
   2. Densities of large herbivores were estimated using line transects, and population structures from area counts. Carnivore diets were determined from analyses of seats (faeces) and kills. Selectivity for prey species was inferred from likelihood ratio tests comparing observed counts of seats to hypothesized seat frequencies generated from prey density estimates using parametric bootstrap simulations. Predator selectivity for size, age, sex and physical condition of prey was estimated using selection indices.
   3. Ungulate and primate prey attained a density of 91 animals km(-2) and comprised 89-98% of the biomass killed. Predators showed significant (P < 0.05) selectivity among prey species. Gaur Bos gaurus were preferred by tigers, whereas wild pig Sus scrofa were under-represented in leopard diet, and langur Presbytis entellus underrepresented in dhole diet.
   4. Tigers selected prey weighing more than 176 kg, whereas leopard and dhole focused on prey in the 30-175 kg size class. The average weights of principal prey killed by tiger, leopard and dhole were, respectively, 91.5 kg, 37.6 kg and 43.4 kg. Tiger predation was biased towards adult males in chital, sambar and wild pig, and towards young gaur. Dholes selectively preyed on adult male chital, whereas leopards did not.
   5. These findings suggest that if there is choice, large carnivores selectively kill larger prey, and non-selective predation patterns reported from other tropical forests may be the result of scarcity of large prey. Because availability of prey in the appropriate size classes is not a limiting resource, selective predation may facilitate large carnivore coexistence in Nagarahole. Community structures of large carnivores in tropical forests may be highly sensitive to natural or human-induced variations in the relative densities of different size classes of prey.

AB Ecologists have searched for general principles, or assembly rules, which determine how species combine to form communities. Two major strands of research highlight the interaction of assembly rules operating at different levels of community organisation, and within uncertain local and historical contingencies. Here, we review the literature on community assembly within the context of three principal determinants: dispersal constraints, environmental constraints and internal dynamics. This classification separates external factors (dispersal and environmental constraints) from internal processes (internal dynamics). We assert that assembly rules are general, deterministic and mechanistic, and operate on internal dynamics within the constraints imposed by the local environment and the history of species invasions. Several assembly rules have been proposed to operate within and across trophic levels, as well as on whole systems. The rules act through resource dynamics and spatial dynamics to select species or subsets of species that can coexist, and may lead to patterns of increasing biomass and non-random spatial distributions. Environmental constraints restrict species establishment and mediate interactions among successful colonists; a change in environmental constraints, either exogenous or endogenous, may drive community change. Even in systems at equilibrium, environmental constraints influence the outcome of assembly rules. Dispersal constraints determine the pool of potential colonists available at a particular time and place, and are a complex amalgam of species-specific traits, storage effects, landscape ecology, and history. The order and timing of species invasions (dispersal constraints) interact with assembly rules to produce priority effects. The directionality of community assembly may be lost if either the rate of species invasions or the rate of non-selective species extinctions exceeds the rate at which species are selected by assembly rules. The falling apart, or disassembly, of a community through breakdown of species interactions may follow different rules or a different assembly trajectory.

AB Digestion of food depends on three main factors: (i) the ingested food and the extent to which the food is susceptible to the effects of digestive enzymes, (ii) the activity of the digestive enzymes and (iii) the length of time the food is exposed to the action of the digestive enzymes. Each of these factors is affected by a multitude of secondary factors. The present review highlights the experimental results on the secondary factor, enzymatic activity and possible contribution of the fish gut microbiota in nutrition. It has been suggested that fish gut microbiota might have positive effects to the digestive processes of fish, and these studies have isolated and identified the enzyme-producing microbiota. In addition to Bacillus genera, Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Flavobacterium, Photobacterium, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Microbacterium, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, unidentified anaerobes and yeast are also suggested to be possible contributors. However, in contrast to endothermic animals, it is difficult to conclude the exact contribution of the gastrointestinal microbiota because of the complexity and variable ecology of the digestive tract of different fish species, the presence of stomach and pyloric caeca and the relative intestinal length. The present review will critically evaluate the results to establish whether or not intestinal microbiota do contribute to fish nutrition.

AB Aim To determine the functional relationships between, and the relative importance of, different driver variables (mean annual precipitation, soil properties, fire and herbivory) in regulating woody plant cover across broad environmental gradients in African savannas.
   Location Savanna grasslands of East, West and Southern Africa.
   Methods The dependence of woody cover on mean annual precipitation (MAP), soil properties (texture, nitrogen mineralization potential and total phosphorus), fire regimes, and herbivory (grazer, browser + mixed feeder, and elephant biomass) was determined for 161 savanna sites across Africa using stochastic gradient boosting, a refinement of the regression tree analysis technique.
   Results All variables were significant predictors of woody cover, collectively explaining 71% of the variance in our data set. However, their relative importance as regulators of woody cover varied. MAP was the most important predictor, followed by fire return periods, soil characteristics and herbivory regimes. Woody cover showed a strong positive dependence on MAP between 200 and 700 mm, but no dependence on MAP above this threshold when the effects of other predictors were accounted for. Fires served to reduce woody cover below rainfall-determined levels. Woody cover showed a complex, non-linear relationship with total soil phosphorus, and was negatively correlated with clay content. There was a strong negative dependence of woody cover on soil nitrogen (N) availability, suggesting that increased N-deposition may cause shifts in savannas towards more grassy states. Elephants, mixed feeders and browsers had negative effects on woody cover. Grazers, on the other hand, depressed woody cover at low biomass, but favoured woody vegetation when their biomass exceeded a certain threshold.
   Main conclusions Our results indicate complex and contrasting relationships between woody cover, rainfall, soil properties and disturbance regimes in savannas, and suggest that future environmental changes such as altered precipitation regimes, N-enrichment and elevated levels of CO2 are likely to have opposing, and potentially interacting, influences on the tree-grass balance in savannas.

AB There is growing concern that rapid environmental degradation threatens mutualistic interactions. Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment. We then identify the evolutionary factors that may make particular classes of mutualisms especially susceptible or resistant to breakdown and discuss how communities harbouring mutualisms may be affected by these evolutionary responses. We propose a template for evolutionary research on mutualism resilience and identify conservation approaches that may help conserve targeted mutualisms in the face of environmental change.

AB In this paper, we review the role of fish populations in generating ecosystem services based on documented ecological functions and human demands of fish. The ongoing overexploitation of global fish resources concerns our societies, not only in terms of decreasing fish populations important for consumption and recreational activities. Rather, a number of ecosystem services generated by fish populations are also at risk, with consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and ultimately human welfare. Examples are provided from marine and freshwater ecosystems, in various parts of the world, and include all life-stages of fish. Ecosystem services are here defined as fundamental services for maintaining ecosystem functioning and resilience, or demand-derived services based on human values. To secure the generation of ecosystem services from fish populations, management approaches need to address the fact that fish are embedded in ecosystems and that substitutions for declining populations and habitat losses, such as fish stocking and nature reserves, rarely replace losses of all services.

AB Besides a general consensus regarding the negative impact of invasive alien species in the literature, only recently has the decline of native species attributable to biological invasions begun to be quantified in many parts of the world. The cause-effect relationship between the establishment and proliferation of alien species and the extinction of native species is, however, seldom demonstrated. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies in Mediterranean-type ecosystems (MTEs) to examine: (1) whether invasion of alien plant species indeed causes a reduction in the number of native plant species at different spatial and temporal scales; (2) which growth forms, habitat types and areas are most affected by invasions; and (3) which taxa are most responsible for native species richness declines. Our results confirm a significant decline in native species richness attributable to alien invasions. Studies conducted at small scales or sampled over long periods reveal stronger impacts of alien invasion than those at large spatial scales and over short periods. Alien species from regions with similar climates have much stronger impacts, with the native species richness in South Africa and Australia declining significantly more post-invasion than for European sites. Australian Acacia species in South Africa accounted for the most significant declines in native species richness. Among the different growth forms of alien plants, annual herbs, trees and creepers had the greatest impact, whereas graminoids generally caused insignificant changes to the native community. Native species richness of shrublands, old fields and dune vegetation showed significant declines, in contrast to insignificant declines for forest habitats.

AB The long-lived diapausing eggs of zooplankton constitute an ecological and evolutionary reservoir that can impact the rate and direction of population, community, and ecosystem response to environmental change. Viable diapausing eggs are often extremely abundant and can survive in aquatic sediments for decades or longer. As the mean environment changes, the frequency of extreme conditions will likely increase, and species with prolonged diapause will be able to survive extreme years of no recruitment, whereas species lacking an egg bank will not. An altered environment may change which species have poor recruitment and even, through effects on thermal diapause cues, which species produce an egg bank. The interaction between environmental variation and generation overlap (produced by prolonged diapause) results in the maintenance of biotic diversity (both species richness and genetic variation), which forms the foundation for response to future environmental change.

AB The dispersal of individuals among marine populations is of great importance to meta-population dynamics, population persistence, and species expansion. Understanding this connectivity between distant populations is key to their effective conservation and management. For many marine species, population connectivity is determined largely by ocean currents transporting larvae and juveniles between distant patches of suitable habitat. Recent work has focused on the biophysics of marine larval dispersal and its importance to population dynamics, although few studies have evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of this potential dispersal. Here, we show how an Eulerian advection-diffusion approach can be used to model the dispersal of coral larvae between reefs throughout the Tropical Pacific. We illustrate how this connectivity can be analyzed using graph theory-an effective approach for exploring patterns in spatial connections, as well as for determining the importance of each site and pathway to local and regional connectivity. Results indicate that the scale (average distance) of dispersal in the Pacific is on the order of 50-150 km, consistent with recent studies in the Caribbean (Cowen, et al. 2006). Patterns in the dispersal graphs highlight pathways for larval dispersal along major ocean currents and through island chains. A series of critical island,stepping stones' are discovered providing potential pathways across the equatorial currents and connecting distant island groups. Patterns in these dispersal graphs highlight possible pathways for species expansions, reveal connected upstream/downstream populations, and suggest areas that might be prioritized for marine conservation efforts.

AB Management and conservation can be greatly informed by considering explicitly how environmental factors influence population genetic structure. Using simulated larval dispersal estimates based on ocean current observations, we demonstrate how explicit consideration of frequency of exchange of larvae among sites via ocean advection can fundamentally change the interpretation of empirical population genetic structuring as compared with conventional spatial genetic analyses. Both frequency of larval exchange and empirical genetic difference were uncorrelated with Euclidean distance between sites. When transformed into relative oceanographic distances and integrated into a genetic isolation-by-distance framework, however, the frequency of larval exchange explained nearly 50 per cent of the variance in empirical genetic differences among sites over scales of tens of kilometres. Explanatory power was strongest when we considered effects of multiple generations of larval dispersal via intermediary locations on the long-term probability of exchange between sites. Our results uncover meaningful spatial patterning to population genetic structuring that corresponds with ocean circulation. This study advances our ability to interpret population structure from complex genetic data characteristic of high gene flow species, validates recent advances in oceanographic approaches for assessing larval dispersal and represents a novel approach to characterize population connectivity at small spatial scales germane to conservation and fisheries management.

AB Marine reserves hold promise for maintaining biodiversity and sustainable fishery management, but studies supporting them have not addressed a crucial aspect of sustainability: the reduction in viability of populations with planktonic larvae dispersing along a coastal habitat with noncontiguous marine reserves. We show how sustainability depends on the fraction of natural larval settlement (FNLS) remaining after reserves are implemented, which in turn depends on reserve configuration and larval dispersal distance. Sustainability requires FNLS to be greater than an empirically determined minimum, Maintaining an adequate value for all species requires either a large, unlikely fraction (> 35%) of coastline in reserves, or reserves that are larger than the mean larval dispersal distance of the target species. FNLS is greater for species dispersing shorter distances, which implies reserves can lead to: (1) changes in community composition and (2) genetic selection fur shorter dispersal distance. Dependence of sustainability on dispersal distance is a new source of uncertainty.

AB This paper reviews the predictions and management implications of two current paradigms in the ecology and management of arid and semi-arid rangelands. The equilibrium model stresses the importance of biotic feedbacks such as density-dependent regulation of livestock populations and the feedback of livestock density on vegetation composition, cover and productivity. Range management under this model centres on carrying capacity, stocking rates and range condition assessment. In contrast, non-equilibrium rangeland systems are thought to be driven primarily by stochastic abiotic factors, notably variable rainfall, which result in highly variable and unpredictable primary production. Livestock populations are thought to have negligible feedback on the vegetation as their numbers rarely reach equilibrium with their fluctuating resource base. Recent studies suggest that most and and semi-arid rangeland systems encompass elements of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium at different scales, and that management needs to take into account temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity.

AB Marine reserves are a spatial approach to marine management and conservation aimed at protecting and restoring multispecies assemblages and the structure and function of marine ecosystems. We used meta-analyses of published data to address the questions of how and over what time frames marine assemblages change within no-take marine reserves as they recover from fishing and other human uses. We used 20 studies of coastal fish assemblages from 31 temperate and tropical locations, reporting abundances, and in some cases biomass, of 10-134 species from reserve and reference conditions (i.e., conditions in nearby fished sites or before reserve establishment) spanning 1-25 years of protection. Synthesis of data from these diverse sets of assemblages showed that: (1) a species' level of exploitation, trophic level, and the duration of protection through the no-take reserve explain small but significant amounts of variation in individual species responses to protection, with only species that are targeted by fishing or by aquarium trade showing overall enhanced abundances in protected areas, and increasing positive effects of protection on abundances at top trophic levels through time; (2) up to a third of species in different studies (19% on average) appeared to be negatively affected by protection, indicating that indirect effects of protection through competitive or predatory interactions may be common; and (3) variation and lags in species, responses to protection resulted in protected assemblages diverging from reference conditions, with greater proportions of total fish biomass at top trophic levels in protected compared to fished assemblages. These results indicate that marine reserves are effective in enhancing local abundances of exploited species and restoring the structure of whole communities, though these changes occur through a series of transient states and, for-some communities, over long time frames (decades). In contrast with the more predictable increases of aggregate community variables such as total abundance and biomass, individual species and community structure exhibited broad variation in their responses to protection. Marine protected areas represent multiple human-exclusion "experiments," replicated in a variety of ecosystem types and geographic locations, providing key insights on community-wide impacts of the removal of human extraction. Long-term monitoring of community trajectories in marine protected areas and modeling studies scaling up local effects to relevant spatial and temporal scales are needed to increase our ability to protect and restore whole marine systems and to set realistic targets for the conservation and restoration of specific assemblages.

AB Plant-animal mutualisms are characterized by weak or asymmetric mutual dependences between interacting species, a feature that could increase community stability. If invasive species integrate into mutualistic webs, they may alter web structure, with consequences for species persistence. However, the effect of alien mutualists on the architecture of plant - pollinator webs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the extent of mutual dependency between interacting species, as a measure of mutualism strength, and the connectivity of 10 paired plant - pollinator webs, eight from forests of the southern Andes and two from oceanic islands, with different incidences of alien species. Highly invaded webs exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded webs. This potential increase in network stability was the result of a disproportionate increase in the importance and participation of alien species in the most asymmetric interactions. The integration of alien mutualists did not alter overall network connectivity, but links were transferred from generalist native species to super-generalist alien species during invasion. Therefore, connectivity among native species declined in highly invaded webs. These modifications in the structure of pollination webs, due to dominance of alien mutualists, can leave many native species subject to novel ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

AB This paper examines the evidence for the effects of invasive alien plants in natural and semi-natural ecosystems in South Africa. Invasive alien plants are concentrated in the Western Cape, along the eastern seaboard, and into the eastern interior, but there is a shortage of accurate data on abundance within this range. Most information on site-specific impacts comes from the fynbos biome, and is generally poor for other biomes. The consequences of invasions for the delivery of ecosystem goods and services to people are, with the notable exception of their influence on water resources, inadequately studied. Our understanding of many of the broader aspects of invasion ecology needs to be enhanced, and we identify important challenges for research to address critical gaps in knowledge. Priorities for future research include the development of a predictive understanding of the rates of spread of invasive alien plants, and the development of achievable goals for ecosystem repair after clearing, including measurable criteria for assessing the success of restoration. Climate change could significantly exacerbate problems with invasive species and work is needed to accommodate plausible trajectories in planning and management frameworks. Perhaps the greatest challenge for South African ecologists is to address the twin issues of skills development and social transformation, to ensure that adequate and relevant ecological expertise is maintained to meet future research and management needs. Formal collaboration between organizations to address capacity building and educational transformation in the field of invasion ecology would represent a significant step forward.

AB The effects of fire-grazing interactions,on grass communities are difficult to identify, because fire and grazing influence each other on a landscape scale. Persistent heavy grazing can prevent the spread of fire by breaking up the grass layer. In contrast, frequent burning might inhibit the persistence of grazed patches by attracting grazers to the post-burn green flush. We explored the effect of burning on grazing activity, and the persistence of grazed patches, in a landscape-level experiment in a South African savanna.
   We created 17 grazed patches by mowing grass in a 20 In diameter plot, with an adjacent un-mown control. We used dung counts as a measure of grazer visitation, and grass height as a measure of grazing intensity, at each of the sites over a year. Nearly all mowing treatments resulted in a rapid increase in grazing activity relative to controls (on average, 4-6 times more dung was found on mown sites). Subsequent fates of the grazed patches depended on their location with respect to fire. Burned areas drew animals off nearby unburned grazed patches, which then recovered lost biomass. Patches >1.5 km from burns remained grazed short. Frequent large fires might,prevent areas of heavy grazing from persisting in the landscape, and thus limit the spread of grazing-adapted grasses.
   Spatial information on fire frequencies in the park was used to explore the influence that the "magnet effect" of fire can have on grass communities. We mapped the distribution of tall, bunch grasslands and grazing-lawn grasslands using a 1999 Landsat TM satellite image. The extent of grazing lawns was directly related to fire return interval. Areas with a fire return of <4 years had less lawn grass than would be expected from the proportions of lawn grass in the park. A logistic regression analysis, which used various environmental variables known to influence grazing, showed fire history to be an important predictor of grazing-lawn distributions.
   This work shows that, by influencing where, when, and for how long animals graze a patch, fire can influence the competitive balance between grazing-tolerant, and grazing-intolerant grass species and affect their distributions in the landscape. We discuss the implications of this research for the management of natural grazing systems and rangelands.

AB The massive scale of the 1997-1998 EL Nino-associated coral bleaching event underscores the need for strategies to mitigate biodiversity losses resulting from temperature-induced coral mortality. As baseline sea surface temperatures continue to rise, climate change may represent the single greatest threat to coral reefs worldwide. In response, one strategy might be to identify (1) specific reef areas where natural environmental conditions are likely to result in low or negligible temperature-related bleaching and mortality (i.e., areas of natural "resistance" to bleaching) and (2) reef areas where environmental conditions are likely to result in maximum recovery of reef communities after bleaching mortality has occurred (i.e., areas of natural community "resilience"). These "target areas," where environmental conditions appear to boost resistance and resilience during and after large-scale bleaching events, could then be incorporated into strategic networks of marine protected areas designed to maximize conservation of global coral reef biodiversity. Based on evidence from the literature and systematically compiled observations from researchers in the field, this paper identifies likely environmental correlates of resistance and resilience to coral bleaching, including factors that reduce temperature stress, enhance water movement, decrease light stress, correlate with physiological tolerance, and provide physical or biological enhancement of recovery potential. As a tool for identifying reef areas that are likely to be most robust in the face of continuing climate change and for determining priority areas for reducing direct anthropogenic impacts, this information has important implications for coral reef conservation and management.

AB The phenological state of vegetation significantly affects exchanges of heat, mass, and momentum between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. Although current patterns can be estimated from satellites, we lack the ability to predict future trends in response to climate change. We searched the literature for a common set of variables that might be combined into an index to quantify the greenness of vegetation throughout the year. We selected as variables: daylength (photoperiod), evaporative demand (vapor pressure deficit), and suboptimal (minimum) temperatures. For each variable we set threshold limits, within which the relative phenological performance of the vegetation was assumed to vary from inactive (0) to unconstrained (1). A combined Growing Season Index (GSI) was derived as the product of the three indices. Ten-day mean GSI values for nine widely dispersed ecosystems showed good agreement (r > 0.8) with the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also tested the model at a temperate deciduous forest by comparing model estimates with average field observations of leaf flush and leaf coloration. The mean absolute error of predictions at this site was 3 days for average leaf flush dates and 2 days for leaf coloration dates. Finally, we used this model to produce a global map that distinguishes major differences in regional phenological controls. The model appears sufficiently robust to reconstruct historical variation as well as to forecast future phenological responses to changing climatic conditions.

AB Lions Panthera leo are generally thought to prey on medium to large Ungulates. Knowledge of which species are actually preferred and which are avoided is lacking, however, as is an understanding of why such preference or avoidance may arise. An analysis of 32 studies over 48 different spatial locations or temporal periods throughout the distribution of the lion shows that it preferentially preys upon species within a weight range of 190-550 kg. The most preferred weight of lion prey is 350 kg. The mean mass of significantly preferred prey species is 290 kg and of all preferred species is 201 kg. Gemsbok, buffalo, wildebeest, giraffe and zebra are significantly preferred. Species outside the preferred weight range are generally avoided. Species within the preferred weight range that are not significantly preferred (such as roan, sable and eland) generally have features that reduce predation either morphologically (e.g. sable horns), ecologically (e.g. roan and sable occurring at low density), or behaviourally (e.g. the large herd size and increased vigilance of eland). Warthog are below the preferred weight range yet are taken in accordance with their availability and this is probably due to their sympatry with lion, their relatively slow evasion speed and their lower level of vigilance. Plots of prey preference against prey body mass follows a bell curve with a right skew that, we argue, is caused by collective hunting by lions of larger-bodied prey. Our methods can be used on all large predators and are likely to be useful in assessing competition in sympatric communities of predators, cooperative hunting and predicting predator diets. This will allow us to move beyond descriptive dietary studies to improve our predictive understanding of the mechanisms underlying predator-prey interactions.

   DYNAMICS; CONSEQUENCES; ENERGETICS; COMMUNITY; LIMPET
AB Gamete production and fertilization influence zygote production. While gamete production is correlated positively with body size, individual fertilization success may be a function of population density. Usually it is assumed that when high population density leads to reduced body size and gamete production, per capita zygote production is diminished. This field study of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum Philippi provides a test of this assumption. Three experiments were conducted to determine the effect of male spawning on fertilization success. In the first experiment, unfertilized eggs were placed in Nitex bags at three distances up and downstream from a spawning male. In the second experiment, unfertilized eggs were released and captured at three distances downstream from a sperm source. In both experiments, fertilized eggs were released and captured at three distances downstream from a sperm source. In both experiments, fertilization decreased with distance from the sperm source. The final experiment tested the influences of male size and population density on fertilization success; the effect of density was significant, but size was not. A simple model estimates the average number of zygotes produced by females of average size under different density regimes: at high population density, increased fertilization success can compensate for decreased gamete production. Small individuals at high population density may have similar per capita zygote production as large individuals at low population density. Thus, estimates of reproductive output based on body size or gamete production alone can be misleading.

AB Many nearshore fish and invertebrate populations are overexploited even when apparently coherent management structures are in place. One potential cause of mismanagement may be a poor understanding and accounting of stochasticity, particularly for stock recruitment. Many of the fishes and invertebrates that comprise nearshore fisheries are relatively sedentary as adults but have an obligate larval pelagic stage that is dispersed by ocean currents. Here, we demonstrate that larval connectivity is inherently an intermittent and heterogeneous process on annual time scales. This stochasticity arises from the advection of pelagic larvae by chaotic coastal circulations. This result departs from typical assumptions where larvae simply diffuse from one site to another or where complex connectivity patterns are created by transport within spatially complicated environments. We derive a statistical model for the expected variability in larval settlement patterns and demonstrate how larval connectivity varies as a function of different biological and physical processes. The stochastic nature of larval connectivity creates an unavoidable uncertainty in the assessment of fish recruitment and the resulting forecasts of sustainable yields.

AB Species may indirectly affect populations of other species in two basic ways. Interaction chains result from linked direct interactions between species pairs. Interaction modifications, emergent effects of a multispecies assemblage, result when a third species changes how a pair of other species interacts. Experiments and patterns of abundance in the upper zone of a rocky intertidal community provide examples of both types of indirect effects. By consuming limpets (Lottia digitalis), bird predators indirectly enhance acorn barnacle (Balanus glandula) abundance on horizontal rock benches because limpets dislodge or inadvertently consume young acorn barnacles, an example of an interaction chain. Because L. digitalis has a light-colored shell that is similar in color to barnacle shells, barnacles alter the bird-limpet interaction by changing the ability of birds to find limpets, an example of an interaction modification. Distinguishing between interaction chains and interaction modifications is important because interaction chains can be predicted with only a knowledge of pairwise species interactions while descriptions of interaction modifications require a knowledge of all species combinations involved, precluding a priori prediction. By classifying empirically determined indirect effects, the degree to which indirect effects can be predicted from a knowledge of pairwise interactions can be determined, and the mechanisms that cause interaction modifications can be identified to aid in future prediction.

AB The nations of the world have set themselves a target of reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010. Here, we propose a biodiversity intactness index (BII) for assessing progress towards this target that is simple and practical - but sensitive to important factors that influence biodiversity status - and which satisfies the criteria for policy relevance set by the Convention on Biological Diversity. Application of the BII is demonstrated on a large region ( 4 3 10 6 km 2) of southern Africa. The BII score in the year 2000 is about 84%: in other words, averaged across all plant and vertebrate species in the region, populations have declined to 84% of their presumed pre-modern levels. The taxonomic group with the greatest loss is mammals, at 71% of pre-modern levels, and the ecosystem type with the greatest loss is grassland, with 74% of its former populations remaining. During the 1990s, a population decline of 0.8% is estimated to have occurred.

AB By facilitating plant reproduction, pollinators perform a crucial ecological function that supports the majority of the world's plant diversity, and associated organisms, and a significant fraction of global agriculture. Thus, pollinators are simultaneously vital to supporting both natural ecosystems and human food security, which is a unique position for such a diverse group of organisms. The past two decades have seen unprecedented interest in pollinators and pollination ecology, stimulated in part by concerns about the decline of pollinator abundance and diversity in some parts of the world. This review synthesizes what is currently understood about the taxonomic diversity of organisms that are known to act as pollinators; their distribution in both deep time and present space; the importance of their diversity for ecological function (including agro-ecology); changes to diversity and abundance over more recent timescales, including introduction of non-native species; and a discussion of arguments for conserving their diversity.

AB Variations in Earth's orbit with periods of 10-100 thousand years (kyr) (Milankovitch oscillations) have led to recurrent and rapid climatic shifts throughout Earth's history. These cause changes in the geographical distributions of clades, which we term orbitally forced range dynamics (ORD). The magnitude of ORD varies geographically, e.g., with latitude. Climatic shifts cause extinction, splitting, and merging of gene pools and clades. They select among individuals and clades for traits enhancing the ability to survive in situ and to establish new populations. There is also nonadaptive sorting caused by the large geographical variation in ORD, as only gene pools that are in the right place when climate shifts survive. ORD lead to sorting at many levels of genealogic inclusiveness. Clades that have survived climatic shifts during at least one entire period of the longest significant Milankovitch oscillations (100 kyr), we name beta-clades. The products of more recent cladogenesis are alpha-clades, which are always nested within a beta-clade. We conclude that ORD may promote alpha-clade formation but curb rates of beta-clade formation. In areas with little ORD, where gene pools persist without going extinct or merging, clade splits and divergence may accumulate leading to high rates of beta-clade formation and beta-anagenesis (evolutionary change persisting > 100 kyr). High ORD should lead to low numbers of beta-clades, beta-clades with low levels of spatial genetic divergence, little geographical subdivision and large ranges, organisms with high vagility and low specialization, high proportions of beta-clades formed by polyploidization, and little beta-anagenesis. We predict global and interregional geographic patterns in these variables caused by differential ORD. Thus, ORD potentially explains a wide array of patterns, suggesting ORD as a fundamental factor in evolution. The vulnerability of biotas to many human activities should vary with the magnitude of ORD.

AB Energy and nutrient fluxes across habitat boundaries can exert profound direct and indirect effects on the dynamics of recipient systems. Transport from land to water is common and well studied: here. we document a less recognized process, substantial flows from water to land. On hyperarid, naturally nutrient poor islands in the Gulf of California, nutrient input via seabird guano directly increases N and P concentrations LIP to 6-fold in soils: these nutrients enrich plants. Nutrients in a long-lived cactus, a short-lived shrub, and annuals were 1.6- to 2.4-fold greater on bird versus nonbird islands. Because plant quality affects consumer growth and reproduction, we suggest that nutrient enrichment via guano ramifies to affect the entire food web on these islands.

AB 1. With the majority of people now living in urban environments, urbanization is arguably the most intensive and irreversible ecosystem change on the planet.
   2. Urbanization transforms floras through a series of filters that change: (i) habitat availability; (ii) the spatial arrangement of habitats; (iii) the pool of plant species; and (iv) evolutionary selection pressures on populations persisting in the urban environment.
   3. Using a framework based on mechanisms of change leads to specific predictions of floristic change in urban environments. Explicitly linking drivers of floristic change to predicted outcomes in urban areas can facilitate sustainable management of urban vegetation as well as the conservation of biodiversity.
   4. Synthesis. We outline how the use of our proposed framework, based on environmental filtering, can be used to predict responses of floras to urbanization. These floristic responses can be assessed using metrics of taxonomic composition, phylogenetic relatedness among species, plant trait distributions or plant community structure. We outline how this framework can be applied to studies that compare floras within cities or among cities to better understand the various floristic responses to urbanization.

AB Mutualisms structure ecosystems and mediate their functioning. They also enhance invasions of many alien species. Invasions disrupt native mutualisms, often leading to population declines, reduced biodiversity, and altered ecosystem functioning. Focusing on three main types of mutualisms (pollination, seed dispersal, and plant-microbial symbioses) and drawing on examples from different ecosystems and from species-and community-level studies, we review the key mechanisms whereby such positive interactions mediate invasions and are in turn influenced by invasions. High interaction generalization is "the norm" in most systems, allowing alien species to infiltrate recipient communities. We identify traits that influence invasiveness (e.g., selfing capacity in plants, animal behavioral traits) or invasibility (e.g., partner choice in mycorrhizas/rhizobia) through mutualistic interactions. Mutualistic disruptions due to invasions are pervasive, and subsequent cascading effects are also widespread. Ecological networks provide a useful framework for predicting tipping points for community collapse in response to invasions and other synergistic drivers of global change.

AB 1. Climate change is recognized as a major threat to the survival of species and integrity of ecosystems world-wide. Although considerable research has focused on climate impacts, relatively little work to date has been conducted on the practical application of strategies for adapting to climate change. Adaptation strategies should aim to increase the flexibility in management of vulnerable ecosystems, enhance the inherent adaptability of species and ecosystem processes, and reduce trends in environmental and social pressures that increase vulnerability to climate variability.
   2. Knowledge of the specific attributes of climate change likely to impact on species or habitats is central to any adaptive management strategy. Temperature is not the only climate variable likely to change as a result of anthropogenic increases in greenhouse gases. In some regions changes in precipitation, relative humidity, radiation, wind speed and/or potential evapotranspiration may be more marked than for temperature.
   3. Uncertainty exists in the response of species and ecosystems to a given climate scenario. While climate will have a direct impact on the performance of many species, for others impacts will be indirect and result from changes in the spatiotemporal availability of natural resources. In addition, mutualistic and antagonistic interactions among species will mediate both the indirect and direct effects of climate change.
   4. Approaches to predict species' responses to climate change have tended to address either changes in abundance with time or in spatial distribution. While correlative models may provide a good indication of climate change impacts on abundance, greater understanding is generated by models incorporating aspects of life history, intra- and interspecific competition and predation. Models are especially sensitive to the uncertainty inherent in future climate predictions, the complexity of species' interactions and the difficulties in parameterizing dispersal functions. Model outputs that have not been appropriately validated with real data should be treated with caution.
   5. Synthesis and applications. While climate impacts may be severe, they are often exacerbated by current management practices, such as the construction of sea defences, flood management and fire exclusion. In many cases adaptation approaches geared to safeguard economic interests run contrary to options for biodiversity conservation. Increased environmental variability implies lower sustainable harvest rates and increased risks of population collapse. Climate change may significantly reduce habitat suitability and may threaten species with limited dispersal ability. In these cases, well-planned species translocations may prove a better option than management attempts to increase landscape connectivity. Mathematical models, long-term population studies, natural experiments and the exploitation of natural environmental gradients provide a sound basis for further understanding the consequences of climate change.

AB Aim This study aimed to identify the 'centres of endemism' of the Chinese spermatophyte flora in order to indirectly detect the locations of past glacial refugia. The role of these areas as places for plant survival ('plant museums') and/or areas for plant evolution and speciation ('plant cradles') was also assessed.
   Location China.
   Methods Distribution patterns of 555 plant endemic taxa, taken as a representative sample of the Chinese endemic flora, were mapped on a 1 degrees X 1 degrees latitude/longitude grid. For each grid cell, species richness (total count of species) and weighted richness (down-weighting each species by the inverse of its range) were calculated. Grid cells within the top 5% of highest values of weighted richness were considered centres of endemism. Based on available information, all plant taxa included in this study were classified into palaeoendemics and neoendemics, and their distributional patterns were represented separately.
   Results Twenty areas of endemism were identified in central and southern China, roughly corresponding to mountain ranges, including the Hengduan and Daxue Mountains, the Yungui Plateau, central China Mountains, the Nanling Mountains, eastern China Mountains, and Hainan and Taiwan. Although almost all centres of endemism contained both palaeoendemic and neoendemic taxa, considerable differences in their respective numbers were recorded, with the majority of neoendemics on the eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau (Hengduan Mountains sensu lato) but more palaeoendemics towards the east.
   Main conclusions Owing to their varied topography, the mountainous regions of central and southern China have provided long-term stable habitats, which allowed palaeoendemics to persist and facilitated the process of speciation. Contrasting patterns between the palaeoendemics and neoendemics within refugia might be attributable to the geological and tectonic history of specific areas. The eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau clearly constitutes the 'evolutionary front' of China, probably as a result of the uninterrupted uplift of the plateau since the late Neogene. In contrast, the tectonic stability of central and southern China during the Tertiary may have facilitated the persistence of relict plant lineages.

AB Aim To test whether it is possible to establish a common biogeographical regionalization for plants and vertebrates in sub-Saharan Africa (the Afrotropical Region), using objective multivariate methods. Location Sub-Saharan Africa (Afrotropical Region). Methods We used 1 degrees grid cell resolution databases for birds, mammals, amphibians and snakes (4142 vertebrate species) and c. 13% of the plants (5881 species) from the Afrotropical Region. These databases were analysed using cluster analysis techniques to define biogeographical regions. A beta(sim) dissimilarity matrix was subjected to a hierarchical classification using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA). The five group-specific biogeographical regionalizations were compared against a regionalization developed from a combined database, and a regionalization that is maximally congruent with the five group-specific datasets was determined using a consensus classification. The regionalizations were interpreted against measures of spatial turnover in richness and composition for the five datasets as well as the combined dataset. Results We demonstrate the existence of seven well-defined and consistent biogeographical regions in sub-Saharan Africa. These regionalizations are statistically defined and robust between groups, with minor taxon-specific biogeographical variation. The proposed biogeographical regions are: Congolian, Zambezian, Southern African, Sudanian, Somalian, Ethiopian and Saharan. East Africa, the West African coast, and the transitions between the Congolian, Sudanian and Zambezian regions are unassigned. The Cape area in South Africa, Afromontane areas and the coastal region of East Africa do not emerge as distinct regions but are characterized by high neighbourhood heterogeneity, rapid turnover of species and high levels of narrow endemism. Main conclusions Species distribution data and modern cluster analysis techniques can be used to define biogeographical regions in Africa that reflect the patterns found in both vertebrates and plants. The consensus of the regionalizations between different taxonomic groups is high. These regions are broadly similar to those proposed using expert opinion approaches. Some previously proposed transitional zones are not recognized in this classification.

AB The Cape Floristic Region of South Africa is a global biodiversity hotspot. In 1998, a process of conservation planning began in the region that required quantitative targets for biodiversity. We combined new information and previously available data sets on biodiversity pattern and process to formulate targets for five groups of features: 102 broad habitat units (land types); locality records for 364 plant species in the family Proteaceae; locality records for 345 species of reptiles, amphibians and freshwater fish; estimated distributions and densities of 41 species of large and medium-sized mammals; and six types of spatial surrogates for ecological and evolutionary processes. We discuss our approach to formulating quantitative targets in the context of the general role of targets in conservation planning, the inadequacy of commonly used standard targets such as 10% of features or whole regions, and the uncertainties around setting targets for land types. We then describe our reasoning and methods for analysing data and identifying targets for each group of features. Our targets are not theoretical-they have been used to develop a regional conservation plan for which implementation is underway. Our targets are, however, provisional. Like any other conservation targets, they are estimates of the requirements for persistence of a region's biodiversity made within the constraints of limited information. We expect them to be improved in future reviews of appropriate targets for the Cape Floristic Region and elsewhere. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biodiversity is organised into complex ecological networks of interacting species in local ecosystems, but our knowledge about the effects of habitat fragmentation on such systems remains limited. We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales.
   There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation.
   Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and supergeneralists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we need to embed network approaches more explicitly within applied ecology in general, because they offer great potential for improving on the current species-based or habitat-centric approaches to our management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of environmental change.

AB Patterns of climate-forced range shift in the marine environment are informed by investigating the population dynamics of an ecologically important sea urchin (Centrostephanus rodgersii-Diadematidae) across its newly extended range in Tasmania (southeastern Australia). A growth model of C. rodgersii is developed allowing estimation of a sea urchin age profile and, in combination with abundance data, we correlate the sea urchin population dynamic with respect to environmental signals across the range extension region. Growth patterns did not vary across the extension region; however, there was a strong pattern of decreasing sea urchin age with increasing distance from the historic range. The sequential poleward discovery of the sea urchin, a pattern of declining age and a general poleward reduction in abundance along the eastern Tasmanian coastline are consistent with a model of range extension driven by recent change in patterns of larval dispersal. We explore this hypothesis by correlating C. rodgersii population characteristics with respect to the East Australian Current (EAC), i.e. the chief vector for poleward larval dispersal, and reveal patterns of declining sea urchin age and abundance with increasing distance from this oceanic feature. Furthermore, C. rodgersii is generally limited to sites where average winter temperatures are warmer than the cold threshold for its larval development. Potential dispersal and physiological mechanisms defining the range extension appear to be strongly coupled to the EAC which has undergone recent poleward advance and resulted in coastal warming in eastern Tasmania. Predicted climate change conditions for this region will favour continued population expansion of C. rodgersii not only via atmospheric-forced ocean warming, but also via ongoing intensification of the EAC driving continued poleward supply of larvae and heat.

AB We investigate the relative importance of stochastic and environmental/topographic effects on the occurrence of avian centres of endemism, evaluating their potential historical importance for broad-scale patterns in species richness across Sub-Saharan Africa. Because species-rich areas are more likely to be centres of endemism by chance alone, we test two null models: Model 1 calculates expected patterns of endemism using a random draw from the occurrence records of the continental assemblage, whereas Model 2 additionally implements the potential role of geometric constraints. Since Model 1 yields better quantitative predictions we use it to identify centres of endemism controlled for richness. Altitudinal range and low seasonality emerge as core environmental predictors for these areas, which contain unusually high species richness compared to other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, even when controlled for environmental differences. This result supports the idea that centres of endemism may represent areas of special evolutionary history, probably as centres of diversification.

AB Mycorrhizal fungi provide plants with a range of benefits, including mineral nutrients and protection from stress and pathogens. Here we synthesize current information about how the presence and type of mycorrhizal association affect plant communities. We argue that mycorrhizal fungi regulate seedling establishment and species coexistence through stabilizing and equalizing mechanisms such as soil nutrient partitioning, feedback to soil antagonists, differential mycorrhizal benefits, and nutrient trade. Mycorrhizal fungi have strong effects on plant population and community biology, with mycorrhizal type-specific effects on seed dispersal, seedling establishment, and soil niche differentiation, as well as interspecific and intraspecific competition and hence plant diversity.

AB A major global effort to enable cost-effective natural regeneration is needed to achieve ambitious forest and landscape restoration goals. Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large-scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental benefits at minimal cost.

AB Leaf phenology was monitored for 49 woody species (trees and tall shrubs) each month over a 2.5-year period in a humid, wet-dry tropical eucalypt savanna at Solar Village, near Darwin, Australia. In the 10 most common species, which spanned the range of phenological types, phenology was monitored every two weeks. To investigate the relationships between leaf phenology and plant water status, pre-dawn leaf water potential was monitored in eight common species every 4-6 weeks, Four main phenological types were described: (1) evergreen species, which retained full canopy throughout the year; (2) brevi- or partly deciduous species, in which the amount of canopy fell significantly, but briefly, during at least one dry season during the study period, but to levels not below 50% of full canopy; (3) semideciduous species in which canopy fell to below 50% of full canopy in each of the dry seasons; and (4) fully deciduous species, which lost all leaves during the early-mid dry season, and remained leafless for at least one month. Of these 49 species, 24% were evergreen, 20% were brevideciduous, 29% were semideciduous, and 27% were fully deciduous. Leaf fall occurred 1-2 months earlier in the dry season for the fully deciduous species than for the semideciduous species. Leaf fall in all species was coincident with the attainment of seasonal minima in leaf water potential, which were, on average, about -1.5 to -2.0 MPa in the evergreen and semideciduous species, compared with about -0.5 to -1.0 MPa in the fully deciduous species. Leaf flushing occurred throughout the dry season in the two evergreen species, with a major peak in the late dry season. In five semideciduous species and one of the fully deciduous species, leaf flushing commenced in the late dry season prior to the occurrence of any rain. In two fully deciduous species, leaf flushing occurred only after the first storms of the early wet season. There was variation in the timing of flushing, both between species within years and between years for some species. However, all species commenced leaf flushing after water potentials rose, following the attainment of seasonal minima in pre-dawn leaf water potential. Soil moisture at 1 m did not fall below permanent wilting point during the dry season; hence, reserves of soil water at the end of the dry season were sufficient to support the whole-plant rehydration that preceded leaf flushing in the absence of rain. These results are consistent with hypotheses, developed in the neotropics, that leaf phenology in trees from the wet-dry tropics is largely controlled by endogenous mechanisms.

AB Climatic fluctuations during Quaternary glaciations had a significant influence on the distribution of taxa and on their intraspecific genetic structure. In this paper, we test hypotheses on Pleistocene refugia for mountain plants in the eastern part of the European Alps derived from palaeoenvironmental and geological results, with new data on distributional patterns of 288 vascular plant endemics and molecular phylogeographies of selected species. High numbers of endemics are found in calcareous regions at the southern and the eastern border of the Eastern Alps, which remained unglaciated during the Pleistocene. The distribution of local endemic taxa in general, and of silicicolous taxa in particular, shows a clear relationship with hypothetical glacial refugia in the southern, southeastern, easternmost, and northeastern Alps. Molecular phylogeographic data from several silicicolous alpine species (Androsace alpina, Androsace wulfeniana, Eritrichium nanum, Phyteuma globulariifolium, Ranunculus glacialis, Saponaria pumila) are not completely congruent. However, all genetically defined population groups are in congruence with hypothetical refugia. In general, results from distributions of endemic taxa and data from intraspecific phylogeography are compatible with previously hypothesized refugia suggesting that refugial situations have shaped the current patterns. The combination of patterns of endemism with molecular phylogeographic data provides an efficacious approach to reveal glacial refugia in vascular plants.

AB The accumulation of plastic in the marine environment is a long-known issue, but the potential relevance of this pollution for the ocean has been recognised only recently. Within this context, microplastic fragments (<5 mm) represent an emerging topic. Owing to their small size, they are readily ingested by marine wildlife and can accumulate in the food web, along with associated toxins and microorganisms colonising the plastic. We are starting to understand that plastic biofilms are diverse and are, comparably with non-plastic biofilms, driven by a complex network of influences, mainly spatial and seasonal factors, but also polymer type, texture and size of the substratum. Within this context, we should raise the question about the potential of plastic particles to serve as vectors for harmful microorganisms. The main focus of the review is the discussion of first insights and research gaps related to microplastic-associated microbial biofilm communities.

AB To what must cities be resilient? How can cities, as complex systems, be resilient? Building a capacity for resilience might be a daunting task when one considers the multitude of components, processes, and interactions that take place within and beyond a city's physical, logical (i.e. legal), and virtual (cyber-space) boundaries. Planning for resilience to the impacts of stressors within cities requires an evaluation of the vulnerable components of cities, an understanding of the key processes, procedures, and interactions that organize these components and develop the capacity to address various structuring of components and their interactions with the ultimate goal of achieving resilience. This paper provides a deeper look at resilience in cities, proposes a conceptual resilience framework, and includes a discussion and analysis of the framework. The proposed framework is meant to serve as a more holistic approach to designing, planning, and managing for resilience by including an evaluation of cultural and process dynamics within cities as well as their physical elements.

AB Design and decision-making for marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs require prediction of MPA effects with population models. Modeling of MPAs has shown how the persistence of metapopulations in systems of MPAs depends on the size and spacing of MPAs, and levels of fishing outside the MPAs. However, the pattern of demographic connectivity produced by larval dispersal is a key uncertainty in those modeling studies. The information required to assess population persistence is a dispersal matrix containing the fraction of larvae traveling to each location from each location, not just the current number of larvae exchanged among locations. Recent metapopulation modeling research with hypothetical dispersal matrices has shown how the spatial scale of dispersal, degree of advection versus diffusion, total larval output, and temporal and spatial variability in dispersal influence population persistence. Recent empirical studies using population genetics, parentage analysis, and geochemical and artificial marks in calcified structures have improved the understanding of dispersal. However, many such studies report current self-recruitment (locally produced settlement/settlement from elsewhere), which is not as directly useful as local retention (locally produced settlement/total locally released), which is a component of the dispersal matrix. Modeling of biophysical circulation with larval particle tracking can provide the required elements of dispersal matrices and assess their sensitivity to flows and larval behavior, but it requires more assumptions than direct empirical methods. To make rapid progress in understanding the scales and patterns of connectivity, greater communication between empiricists and population modelers will be needed. Empiricists need to focus more on identifying the characteristics of the dispersal matrix, while population modelers need to track and assimilate evolving empirical results.

AB I propose that global patterns in numbers of range-restricted endemic species are caused by variation in the amplitude of climatic change occurring on time-scales of 10-100 thousand years (Milankovitch oscillations). The smaller the climatic shifts, the more probable it is that palaeoendemics survive and that diverging gene pools persist without going extinct or merging, favouring the evolution of neoendemics. Using the change in mean annual temperature since the last glacial maximum, estimated from global circulation models, I show that the higher the temperature change in an area, the fewer endemic species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and vascular plants it harbours. This relationship was robust to variation in area (for areas greater than 10(4) km(2)), latitudinal position, extent of former glaciation and whether or not areas are oceanic islands. Past climatic change was a better predictor of endemism than annual temperature range in all phylads except amphibians, suggesting that Rapoport's rule (i.e. species range sizes increase with latitude) is best explained by the increase in the amplitude of climatic oscillations towards the poles. Globally, endemic-rich areas are predicted to warm less in response to greenhouse-gas emissions, but the predicted warming would cause many habitats to disappear regionally, leading to species extinctions.

AB Concerns are being raised that microplastic pollution can have detrimental effects on the feeding of aquatic invertebrates, including zooplankton. Both small plastic fragments (microplastics, MPs) produced by degradation of larger plastic waste (secondary MPs; SMPs) and microscopic plastic spheres used in cosmetic products and industry (primary MPs; PMPs) are ubiquitously present in the environment. However, despite the fact that most environmental MPs consist of weathered plastic debris with irregular shape and broad size distribution, experimental studies of organism responses to MP exposure have largely used uniformly sized spherical PMPs. Therefore, effects observed for PMPs in such experiments may not be representative for MP-effects in situ. Moreover, invertebrate filter-feeders are generally well adapted to the presence of refractory material in seston, which questions the potential of MPs at environmentally relevant concentrations to measurably affect digestion in these organisms. Here, we compared responses to MPs (PMPs and SMPs) and naturally occurring particles (kaolin clay) using the cladoceran Daphnia magna as a model organism. We manipulated food levels (0.4 and 9 mu g C mL(-1)) and MP or kaolin contribution to the feeding suspension (<1 to 74%) and evaluated effects of MPs and kaolin on food uptake, growth, reproductive capacity of the daphnids, and maternal effects on offspring survival and feeding. Exposure to SMPs caused elevated mortality, increased inter-brood period and decreased reproduction albeit only at high MP levels in the feeding suspension (74% by particle count). No such effects were observed in either PMP or kaolin treatments. In daphnids exposed to any particle type at the low algal concentration, individual growth decreased by similar to 15%. By contrast, positive growth response to all particle types was observed at the high algal concentration with 17%, 54% and 40% increase for kaolin, PMP and SMP, respectively. When test particles comprised 22% in the feeding suspension, both MP types decreased food intake by 30%, while kaolin had no effect. Moreover, SMPs were found to homoaggregate in a concentration-dependent manner, which resulted in a 77% decrease of the ingested SMPs compared to PMPs. To better understand MP-processing in the gut, gut passage time (GPT) and evacuation rate of MPs were also assayed. SMPs and PMPs differed in their effects on daphnids; moreover, the particle effects were dependent on the MP: algae ratio in the suspension. When the MP contribution to the particle abundance in the medium changed from 1 to 4%, GPT for daphnids exposed to SMPs increased 2-fold. Our results suggest that MPs and, in particular, SMPs, have a greater capacity to negatively affect feeding in D. magna compared to naturally occurring mineral particles of similar size. Moreover, grazer responses observed in experiments with PMPs cannot be extrapolated to the field where SMPs dominate, because of the greater effects caused by the latter.

AB Understanding tropical forest succession is critical for the development of tropical forest conservation strategies worldwide, given that tropical secondary forests can be considered the forests of the future. Tropical dry forests (TDF) are among the most threatened tropical ecosystems, there are more secondary forests and forest restoration efforts that require a better understanding of successional processes. The main goal of this synthesis for this special issue on the ecology and management of tropical dry forests in the Americas is to present a summarized review of the current knowledge of the ecology and management implications associated to TDF succession. We explore specific issues associated to tropical dry forest succession with emphasis on the use of chronosequences, plant diversity and composition, plant phenology and remote sensing, pollination, and animal-plant interactions; all under the integrating umbrella of ecosystem succession. We also emphasize the need to conduct socio-ecological research to understand changes in land-use history and its effects on succession and forest regeneration of TDF. We close this paper with some thoughts and ideas associated with the strong need for an integrating dimension not considered until today: the role of cyberinfrastructure and eco-informatics as a tool to support sound conservation, management and understanding of TDF in the Americas.

AB Identifying the rates of recovery of fish in no-take areas is fundamental to designing protected area networks, managing fisheries, estimating yields, identifying ecological interactions, and informing stakeholders about the outcomes of this management. Here we study the recovery of coral reef fishes through 37 years of protection using a space-for-time chronosequence of four marine national parks in Kenya. Using AIC model selection techniques, we assessed recovery trends using five ecologically meaningful production models: asymptotic, Ricker, logistic, linear, and exponential. There were clear recovery trends with time for species richness, total and size class density, and wet masses at the level of the taxonomic family. Species richness recovered rapidly to an asymptote at 10 years. The two main herbivorous families displayed differing responses to protection, scarids recovering rapidly, but then exhibiting some decline while acanthurids recovered more slowly and steadily throughout the study. Recovery of the two invertebrate-eating groups suggested competitive interactions over resources, with the labrids recovering more rapidly before a decline and the balistids demonstrating a slower logistic recovery. Remaining families displayed differing trends with time, with a general pattern of decline in smaller size classes or small-bodied species after an initial recovery, which suggests that some species- and size-related competitive and predatory control occurs in older closures. There appears to be an ecological succession of dominance with an initial rapid rise in labrids and scarids, followed by a slower rise in balistids and acanthurids, an associated decline in sea urchins, and an ultimate dominance in calcifying algae. Our results indicate that the unfished "equilibrium'' biomass of the fish assemblage > 10 cm is 1100-1200 kg/ha, but these small parks (< 10 km(2)) are likely to underestimate prehuman influence values due to edge effects and the rarity of taxa with large area requirement, such as apex predators, including sharks.

AB Recent efforts to clear invasive plants from the fynbos of South Africa forces managers to think about how N-2-fixing invasives have altered ecosystem processes and the implications of these changes for community development. This study investigated the changes in nitrogen (N) cycling regimes in fynbos with the invasion of Acacia saligna, the effects of clear-cutting acacia stands on soil microclimate and N cycling, and how altered N resources affected the growth of a weedy grass species. Litterfall, litter quality, soil nutrient pools, and ion exchange resin (IER)-available soil N were measured in uninvaded fynbos, intact acacia, and cleared acacia stands. In addition, a bioassay experiment was used to ascertain whether the changes in soil nutrient availability associated with acacia would enhance the success of a weedy grass species. Acacia plots had greater amounts of litterfall, which had higher concentrations of N. This led to larger quantities of organic matter, total N, and IER-available N in the soil. Clearing acacia stands caused changes in soil moisture and temperature, but did not result in differences in IER-available N. The alteration of N availability by acacias was shown to increase growth rates of the weedy grass Ehrharta calycina, suggesting that secondary invasions by nitrophilous weedy species may occur after clearing N-2-fixing alien species in the fynbos. It is suggested that managers use controlled burns, the addition of mulch, and the addition of fynbos seed after clearing to lower the levels of available N in the soil and initiate the return of native vegetation.

AB The diversity of vascular plants is very Unevenly distributed across the globe. The five centres that reach species richness of more than 5,000 spp./10,000 km(2) (Costa Rica-Choco, Atlantic Brazil. Tropical Eastern Andes, Northern Borneo, New Guinea) cover only 0.2% of the terrestrial surface. On the other hand approximately 18,500 spp. are endemic to these centres which represent 6.2% of all vascular plant species. A world map of vascular plant richness is presented based on an extensively expanded data base (more than 3,300 species richness figures lot different regions of the world) and a refined methodology. Most of the global centres are located in mountainous regions within the humid tropic,. where suitable climatic conditions and high levels of geodiversity, i.e., the diversity of abiotic conditions. coincide. A complete review of most prominent climatic. geologic. and floristic features of the 20 centres of phytodiversity with more than 3,000 spp./10,000 km(2) is presented.

AB Although invasive alien species (IAS) are a major threat to biodiversity, human health, and economy, our understanding of the factors controlling their distribution and abundance is limited. Here, we determine how environmental factors, land use, life-history traits of the invaders, residence time, origin, and human usage interact to shape the spatial pattern of invasive alien plant species in South Africa. Relationships between the environmental factors and the extrinsic and intrinsic attributes of species were investigated using RLQ analysis, a multivariate method for relating a species-attribute table to an environmental table by way of a species presence/absence table. We then clustered species according to their position on the RLQ axes, and tested these groups for phylogenetic independence. The first three axes of the RLQ explained 99% of the variation and were strongly related to the species attributes. The clustering showed that, after accounting for environmental factors, the spatial pattern of IAS in South Africa was driven by human uses, life forms, and reproductive traits. The seven clusters of species strongly reflected geographical distribution, but also intrinsic species attributes and patterns of human use. Two of the clusters, centered on the genera Acacia and Opuntia, were phylogenetically non-independent. The remaining clusters comprised species of diverse taxonomic affinities, but sharing traits facilitating invasion in particular habitats. This information is useful for assessing the extent to which the potential spread of recent introductions can be predicted by considering the interaction of their biological attributes, region of origin, and human use.

AB Marine-microorganisms have become an important point of study in the search for novel microbial products. Today, both academic and industrial interest in marine microorganisms is on the rise, in part-because of the growing number of unique, biologically active secondary metabolites reported from marine bacteria. Our ability to assess the biosynthetic potential of marine bacteria, however, is inevitably coupled to our basic understanding of their biology. This review summarizes the chemical discoveries and biological activities reported from marine bacteria and focuses upon several microbiological topics as they relate to natural product discovery, including the distributions, diversity, and culturability of marine bacteria, as well as the role of symbiotic bacteria in the production of substances previously ascribed to other sources.

AB This paper reviews field methods for estimating and monitoring the abundance of terrestrial carnivores that do not involve capture. Effective methods of monitoring abundance are important tools for the management and conservation of many species. The development of methods for carnivores presents particular challenges, as they are often secretive and widely dispersed. Nevertheless, a variety of approaches based on direct observations and quantification of field signs have been employed. These techniques are described in relation to carnivore ecology and resource implications, and the advantages and deficiencies of each are discussed with reference to case studies.

AB Bush encroachment has been recognised in southern Africa since the late nineteenth century. Our review of 23 studies showed that the rate of woody cover change has ranged from -0.131 to 1.275% y(-1). Encroachment was most rapid on small protected areas, intermediate under commercial tenure, and slowest under communal tenure and large, natural environments with mega-herbivores present. Several drivers of bush encroachment, which interact and change over time, have been proposed. Fires, for example, were actively suppressed during the early twentieth century. However, rainfall interacts with fire and the rate of woody increase under fire exclusion is linearly related to mean annual rainfall. A reduction in browsing herbivores from the nineteenth century would have had a positive cumulative effect on woody cover whilst an increase in grazing herbivores would have reduced the competitive effect of grasses. Encroachment was most rapid during the high rainfall, mid-1970s, which followed the 1960s drought when cattle numbers were at their peak, and the grass layer was degraded. Increasing atmospheric [CO2] and climate change have emerged as important drivers in the recent literature. Bush encroachment depends on the interplay of history, environment, management and vegetation, recognition of which is essential for containing encroachment.

AB Semi-natural habitats provide essential resources for pollinators within agricultural landscapes and may help maintain pollination services in agroecosystems. Yet, whether or not pollinators disperse from semi-natural habitat elements into the adjacent agricultural matrix may to a large extent depend on the quality of this matrix and the corresponding pollinator-specific life history traits. To investigate the effects of matrix quality on the distance decay of wild bees and hoverflies, six transects along vegetated field tracks originating at a large semi-natural main habitat and leading into the adjacent agricultural matrix were established in the Wetterau Region, central Hesse, Germany. Species richness of wild bees did not change with distance from the main habitat in landscapes with sufficient grassland cover in the surrounding landscape, but significantly declined when semi-natural grasslands where scarce and isolated in the adjacent agricultural matrix. Abundance of wild bees declined with distance regardless of matrix quality. Species richness of hoverflies did not decline with increasing distance in any landscape. Abundance even increased with distance to the main habitat independently of matrix quality. Thus, our data show that taxa of the pollinator guild may perceive landscapes quite differently. Because of their differing dispersal modes and resource requirements as compared to wild bees, hoverflies may play an important role in maintaining pollination services in agricultural landscapes unsuitable for bee species. Our results highlight the need for considering these taxon-specific differences when predicting the effect of landscape structure on pollinators.

AB The accurate classification and mapping of individual trees at species level in the savanna ecosystem can provide numerous benefits for the managerial authorities. Such benefits include the mapping of economically useful tree species, which are a key source of food production and fuel wood for the local communities, and of problematic alien invasive and bush encroaching species, which can threaten the integrity of the environment and livelihoods of the local communities. Species level mapping is particularly challenging in African savannas which are complex, heterogeneous, and open environments with high intra-species spectral variability due to differences in geology, topography, rainfall, herbivory and human impacts within relatively short distances. Savanna vegetation are also highly irregular in canopy and crown shape, height and other structural dimensions with a combination of open grassland patches and dense woody thicket - a stark contrast to the more homogeneous forest vegetation. This study classified eight common savanna tree species in the Greater Kruger National Park region, South Africa, using a combination of hyperspectral and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived structural parameters, in the form of seven predictor datasets, in an automated Random Forest modelling approach. The most important predictors, which were found to play an important role in the different classification models and contributed to the success of the hybrid dataset model when combined, were species tree height; NDVI; the chlorophyll b wavelength (466 nm) and a selection of raw, continuum removed and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) bands. It was also concluded that the hybrid predictor dataset Random Forest model yielded the highest classification accuracy and prediction success for the eight savanna tree species with an overall classification accuracy of 87.68% and KHAT value of 0.843.

AB The structure of rocky intertidal communities may be influenced by large-scale patterns of productivity. In this study we examine the in situ rates of production by intertidal epilithic microalgae (chlorophyll a production per unit area per month), intertidal nutrient concentrations (nitrates, nitrites, phosphates and silicates), and standing stocks of different functional-form groups of macroalgae around the South African coast, and their relationships to consumer biomass. Clear gradients of in situ intertidal primary production and nutrient concentrations were recorded around the South African coast, values being highest on the west coast, intermediate on the south and lowest on the east coast. Primary production by intertidal epilithic microalgae was correlated with nutrient availability and could also be related to nearshore phytoplankton production. The dominance patterns of different functional forms of macroalgae changed around the coast, with foliose algae prevalent on the west coast and coralline algae on the east coast. However, overall macroalgal standing stocks did not reflect the productivity gradient, being equally high on the east and west coasts, and low in the south. Positive relationships existed between the average biomass of intertidal invertebrate consumers (grazers and filter-feeders) and intertidal productivity, although only the grazers were directly ''connected'' to in situ production by epilithic intertidal microalgae. The maximum body size of a widely distributed limpet, Patella granularis, was also positively correlated with level of in situ primary production. The maximal values of biomass attained by intertidal filter-feeders were not related to intertidal primary production, and were relatively constant around the coast. At a local scale, filter-feeder biomass is known to be strongly influenced by wave action. This implies that the local-scale water movements over-ride any effects that large-scale gradients of primary production may have on filter-feeders. The large-scale gradient in intertidal productivity around the coast is thus strongly linked with grazer biomass and individual body size, but any effect it has on filter-feeder biomass seems subsidiary to the local effects of wave action.

AB Resource intensification models that have been posited for prehistoric California predict decreases in foraging efficiency during the late Holocene. Using implications of the fine-grained prey model of optimal foraging theory, I derive an index of the efficiency of vertebrate prey choice from the relative abundances of large- and small-sized prey items. I then test the intensification models with late Holocene mammalian faunas from San Francisco Bay shellmounds. Dramatic linear decreases in the relative frequency of artiodactyls compared to the smaller sea otters (Enhydra lutris) throughout the occupational histories of particular localities strongly support the resource intensification models. The declines in artiodactyl abundances are not correlated with late Holocene climatic indices developed for this region, with changes in the seasonal use of shellmounds, or with technological innovations. An intra- and interregionally consistent pattern in declining abundances of large mammals in environmentally distinct regions throughout California suggests that resource depression driven by human predators may be the single most important cause of the declines. These patterns have far-reaching implications concerning the long-term human role in structuring prehistoric ecosystems. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc.

AB Biological control strategies that mere developed for orchards and forests have had Limited success in controling pests in annual crop systems (ACSs). In this paper I will argue that an accurate characterization of the habitat template of ACSs will be a key feature for developing new strategies of biological control for held crops. I argue that ACSs are ''predictably ephemeral'' habitats that present a selective environment that is different from that commonly envisioned for disturbed or early successional habitats. By drawing on examples from natural ecosystems that are predictably ephemeral, I characterize the types of life cycles and life-history traits that are common in insects that thrive in these types of environments. ''Fugitive'' or ''colonizing'' species that evolve in unpredictably disturbed environments usually allocate resources to numerous dormant or vagile propagules at the expense of parental survival. In contrast, many insects that exploit predictably ephemeral habitats respond to disturbance by dispersing to permanent refugia where they delay reproduction, overwinter, and then recolonize the following year. I refer to this strategy as ''cyclic colonization'' and document its ubiquity in natural and agroecosystems. Cyclic colonizers typically exhibit between-generation developmental flexibility in life-history traits. In many species, ''establishment generations'' have small or no wings, are behaviorally sedentary, grow rapidly, reproduce at an early age, and have high fecundities. In contrast, ''over-wintering generations'' are well adapted for dispersal to and from permanent habitats (long wings, behavioral tendency for flight, reproductively immature) and for winter survival. Cyclic colonizers are not, necessarily ''r-selected,'' but rather have generations that alternate between relatively r- and K-selected life-history traits. Cyclic colonization explicitly relies on spatial heterogeneity, and therefore, effective biological control strategies in ACSs must include a landscape ethic that provides an abundance of permanent habitats that can act as reservoirs for indigenous and introduced enemies. The development of an optimal agricultural landscape for biological control in ACSs will require a metapopulation approach that focuses on annual cycles of colonization between permanent refugia and a patchwork of crop fields. Finally, given the ubiquity of cyclic colonization in ACSs, it seems that effective biological control will depend on an increased information base about the seasonal cycles, dispersal behavior, and overwintering ecology of indigenous and introduced natural enemies.

AB The pun in the above title reflects two points. First, marine life cycles commonly include a dispersive juvenile stage that is moved about by ocean currents. This stage often is the predominant, or only, means of dispersal that connects spatially disjunct populations. As a consequence, details of dispersal likely play a critical role in determining the effectiveness of marine reserves as a management and conservation tool. Curiously, however (and this is the second point of the title), although dozens of models for marine reserves now exist, few actually account explicitly for larval dispersal. Moreover, those that do include dispersal, do so almost exclusively by considering it to be a nondirectional spreading process (diffusion), ignoring the effects of directional transport by currents (advection). Here we develop a population dynamical model for marine organisms with relatively sedentary adults whose larvae are transported in a simple flow field with both diffusive spreading and directional characteristics. We find that advection can play a dominant role in determining the effectiveness of different reserve configurations. Two of the most important consequences are.: (1) with strong currents, multiple reserves can be markedly more effective than single reserves of equivalent total size; and (2) in the presence of strong currents, reserves can significantly outperform traditional, effort-based management strategies in terms of fisheries yield,, and do so with less risk. These results suggest that successful reserve design may require considerable new efforts to examine explicitly the role of dispersal of young.

AB The last few decades have seen rapid proliferation of hard artificial structures (e.g., energy infrastructure, aquaculture, coastal defences) in the marine environment: ocean sprawl. The replacement of natural, often sedimentary, substrata with hard substrata has altered the distribution of species, particularly non-indigenous species, and can facilitate the assisted migration of native species at risk from climate change. This has been likened to urbanization as a driver of global biotic homogenization in the marine environment the process by which species invasions and extinctions increase the genetic, taxonomic, or functional similarity of communities at local, regional, and global scales. Ecological engineering research showed that small-scale engineering interventions can have a significant positive effect on the biodiversity associated with artificial structures, promoting more diverse and resilient communities on local scales. This knowledge can be applied to the design of multifunctional structures that provide a range of ecosystem services. In coastal regions, hybrid designs can work with nature to combine hard and soft approaches to coastal defence in a more environmentally sensitive manner. The challenge now is to manage ocean sprawl with the dual goal of supporting human populations and activities, simultaneously strengthening ecosystem resilience using an ecosystem-based approach.

AB 1 The relative roles of climate and management for driving changes in woody cover in savannas over the past century are the subject of active debate. Perspectives arising from short-term, small-scale, local experiments are rarely tested over larger scales and longer time frames.
   2 Regression analysis and aerial photography were used to assess the relative importance of land-use history (fire and grazing), rainfall and initial woody cover (woody cover at the beginning of a sample period relative to the range of woody cover expressed within a land type) in accounting for rates of change in overstorey and understorey cover between the 1940s and 1990s in central Queensland, Australia. Analyses included 279 site-period combinations representing five semi-arid eucalypt savanna land-types within a 125 755 km(2) region.
   3 Fire and grazing variables provided no explanatory power. In general, relative rainfall (rainfall for a given period standardized against mean annual rainfall) was positively related and initial woody cover negatively related to rates of change in both the overstorey and the understorey. The interaction between rainfall and initial woody cover was significant, reflecting the fact that increases in cover coincided with low initial cover when rainfall is higher than average, whereas decreases in cover typically occurred with high initial cover, regardless of rainfall.
   4 On average, overstorey and understorey cover increased over the second half of the 20th century. This pattern is consistent with the first half of the 20th century having more intense droughts and being drier overall than the relatively wet second half.
   5 The findings highlight the primary importance of interactions between rainfall fluctuations and density dependence as determinants of large-scale, long-term woody plant cover dynamics in savannas subject to large rainfall excess and deficit over multiyear time-scales.

AB Invasive species can change decomposition rates within an ecosystem by changing the quality of the litter entering a system. It is not known, however, whether or not invasions can also change rates of decomposition irrespective of litter quality. We conducted an experiment to explore the differences in decomposition between leaf litter of native and exotic invasive woody plants and between invaded and uninvaded mesic hardwood forests on Long Island, New York, USA. We evaluated the mass and nitrogen loss rates from leaf litter of four pairs of native and exotic woody species. Litter from the exotic species decomposed and released nitrogen significantly faster than litter from the native species. The largest differences in decomposition and nitrogen loss occurred between the invaded and uninvaded sites rather than between native and exotic species, with litter of all species types decomposing substantially faster in invaded sites. These results suggest that the invasion of exotic species into hardwood forests alters decomposition and nutrient cycling, irrespective of species-specific litter quality differences between natives and exotics.

AB A long-standing issue in marine biology is identifying spatial scales at which populations of sessile adults are connected by planktonic offspring. We examined the genetic continuity of the acorn barnacle Balanus glandula, an abundant member of rocky intertidal communities of the northeastern Pacific Ocean, and compared these genetic patterns to the nearshore oceanography described by trajectories of surface drifters. Consistent with its broad dispersal potential, barnacle populations are genetically similar at both mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase I) and nuclear (elongation factor 1-alpha) loci across broad swaths of the species' range. In central California, however, there is a striking genetic cline across 475 km of coastline between northern and southern populations. These patterns indicate that gene flow within central California is far more restricted spatially than among other populations. Possible reasons for the steep cline include the slow secondary introgression of historically separated populations, a balance between diversifying selection and dispersal, or some mix of both. Geographic trajectories of oceanic drifters closely parallel geographical patterns of gene flow. Drifters placed to the north (Oregon; similar to44degreesN) and south (Santa Barbara, California; similar to34degrees N) of the cline disperse hundreds of kilometres within 40 days, yet over the long-term their trajectories never overlapped. The lack of communication between waters originating in Oregon and southern California probably helps to maintain strong genetic differentiation between these regions. More broadly, the geographical variation in gene flow implies that focusing on species-level averages of gene flow can mask biologically important variance within species which reflects local environmental conditions and historical events.

AB Aim Australian acacias (1012 recognized species native to Australia, which were previously grouped in Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae) have been moved extensively around the world by humans over the past 250 years. This has created the opportunity to explore how evolutionary, ecological, historical and sociological factors interact to affect the distribution, usage, invasiveness and perceptions of a globally important group of plants. This editorial provides the background for the 20 papers in this special issue of Diversity and Distributions that focusses on the global cross-disciplinary experiment of introduced Australian acacias.
   Location Australia and global.
   Methods The papers of the special issue are discussed in the context of a unified framework for biological invasions. Distributions of species were mapped across Australia, their representation in bioclimatic zones examined and the potential global distribution of the group modelled. By collating a variety of different lists, we determined which Australian acacias have reached different stages in the introduction-naturalization-invasion continuum in different parts of the world. Paradigms and key research questions relating to barriers to invasion, stages of invasion and management perceptions are sketched.
   Results According to our global database of Australian acacia records, 386 species have been moved outside Australia by human agency, 71 species are naturalized or weedy, and 23 are unequivocally invasive. Climatic models suggest that about a third of the world's land surface is climatically suitable for Australian acacias. Many species are commercially important crops or are useful for other purposes and have been extensively planted, and many different human perceptions of Australian acacias exist in different parts of the world. The papers in the special issue cover all the barriers, stages and processes that define biological invasions and touch on many aspects: history and the human dimension; aspects of the species pool; species traits; biotic interactions; climate and niche; and management.
   Main conclusions Australian acacias are an excellent model group for examining interactions between evolutionary, ecological and socio-economic drivers of species introductions. New insights have emerged on the biological, ecological and evolutionary correlates of naturalization and invasion, but human usage factors permeate all explanatory models. Understanding and managing introduced Australian acacias requires a fundamental and integrative appreciation of both intrinsic (e.g. species traits) and extrinsic (e.g. human usage and perceptions) aspects.

AB Ecological security patterns (ESPs) aim to provide an effective spatial approach for maintaining urban ecological security based on the relationship between landscape patterns and ecological processes. However, the methods of selecting ecological security sources and evaluating resistance surfaces for ESPs construction are not well developed and lack consideration of land degradation and spatial heterogeneity. Using Shenzhen City, a fast-growing city in a rapidly urbanizing region, as a case study area, this study evaluated two types of land degradation risk for ecological land: type transformation risk and functional damage risk. Both two kinds of risk were combined with ecological functional importance, which was composed of habitat quality and landscape connectivity, so as to quantify the comprehensive reserve value of ecological land to identify the ecological security sources. Ecological corridors were established with the application of remotely-sensed impervious surface area in the ecological resistance surface evaluation. In all, 477.43 km(2) ecological land were identified as ecological security sources, with 278.1 km and 197.5 km for the length of group corridors and landscape corridors respectively. The ecological corridors spatially presented a radiation pattern of one axis and three strips. The majority of both ecological security sources and corridors was located within the existing ecological protection boundary, confirming its ecological significance. This study provided an effective quantification framework to identify urban ESPs, and ESPs mapping could make a fundamental support to urban planning.

AB Extremely and conditions in tropical Africa occurred in several discrete episodes between 135 and 90 ka, as demonstrated by lake core and seismic records from multiple basins [Scholz CA, Johnson TC, Cohen AS, King JW, Peck J, Overpeck JT, Talbot MR, Brown ET, Kalinclekafe L,Amoako PYO,etal (2007) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 104:16416-16421]. This resulted in extraordinarily low lake levels, even in Africa's deepest lakes. On the basis of well dated paleoecological records from Lake Malawi, which reflect both local and regional conditions, we show that this aridity had severe consequences for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. During the most and phase, there was extremely low pollen production and limited charred-particle deposition, indicating insufficient vegetation to maintain substantial fires, and the Lake Malawi watershed experienced cool, semidesert conditions (<400 mm/yr precipitation). Fossil and sedimentological data show that Lake Malawi itself, currently 706 m deep, was reduced to an approximate to 125 m deep saline, alkaline, well mixed lake. This episode of aridity was far more extreme than any experienced in the Afrotropics during the Last Glacial Maximum (approximate to 35-15 ka). Aridity diminished after 95 ka, lake levels rose erratically, and salinity/alkalinity declined, reaching near-modern conditions after 60 ka. This record of lake levels and changing limnological conditions provides a framework for interpreting the evolution of the Lake Malawi fish and invertebrate species flocks. Moreover, this record, coupled with other regional records of early Late Pleistocene aridity, places new constraints on models of Afrotropical biogeographic refugia and early modern human population expansion into and out of tropical Africa.

AB We identified a dwarf transgenic hybrid poplar (Popultis tremula X Populus alba) after screening of 627 independent activation-tagged transgenic lines in tissue culture, greenhouse, and field environments. The cause of the phenotype was a hyperactivated gene encoding GA 2-oxidase (GA2ox), the major gibberellin (GA) catabolic enzyme in plants. The mutation resulted from insertion of a strong transcriptional enhancer near the transcription start site. Overexpression of the poplar GA2ox gene (PtaGA2ox1) caused hyperaccumulation of mRNA transcripts, quantitative shifts in the spectrum of GAs, and similarity in phenotype to transgenic poplars that overexpress a bean (Phaseolus coccineus) GA2ox gene. The poplar PtaGA2ox1 sequence was most closely related to PsGA2ox2 from pea (Pisum sativum) and two poorly known GA2oxs from Arabidopsis (AtGA2ox4 and AtGA2ox5). The dwarf phenotype was reversible through gibberellic acid application to the shoot apex. Transgenic approaches to producing semidwarf trees for use in arboriculture, horticulture, and forestry could have significant economic and environmental benefits, including altered fiber and fruit production, greater ease of management, and reduced risk of spread in wild populations.

AB A 30-day feeding experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of promoted bioflocs on growth performance, feed utilization, digestive enzyme activity and whole body composition of Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles (average 6.95 +/- 0.22 g) in zero-water exchange culture tanks. Two bioflocs treatments and one control were evaluated: Bioflocs-based tanks with two levels of C/N ratio (15, 20) by addition of carbohydrate referred to as 'CN15' and 'CN20', and clear water tanks operated with water exchange and without addition of carbohydrate referred to as 'Control'. Each group consisted of quadruplicate tanks (125 L) and each tank contained 28 shrimp (equivalent to shrimp density of 224 individuals and biomass of similar to 1.56 kg per cubic meter of water volume). Original concentrated bioflocs were collected from an indoor bioflocs-based shrimp culture pond, and inoculated into all bioflocs-based tanks with the same amount (0.5 mL L-1 bioflocs volume) just before stocking shrimp. Sucrose was applied as a source of carbohydrate and added separately to the CN15 and CN20 treatment tanks in addition to the applied feed (35% crude protein), so as to raise the C/N ratio of the feeds input (feed and sucrose) to 15 and 20 and subsequently promote the development of bioflocs. The monitoring of water quality parameters showed that they all remained within recommended levels for shrimp culture in the three groups. At the end of the experiment, survival rates of the shrimp were above 90%, with no significant differences among the three groups (P>0.05); and the growth (in terms of final weight, weight gain and specific growth rate) of the shrimp in both bioflocs treatments were significantly better (P<0.05) than that obtained in the control while the feed conversion rate was significantly lower (P<0.05). An overall enhancement in protease and amylase activities of the shrimp in both bioflocs treatments was observed, though the effect of the bioflocs on each enzyme activity performed inconsistently among different digestive tissues: digestive gland, stomach and intestine. Proximate composition analysis showed that the crude lipid and ash contents of the shrimp in both bioflocs treatments tended to increase. The bioflocs collected from both bioflocs treatments showed good prime nutritional values and appropriate extracellular enzymes activities. The crude protein and crude lipid contents ranged from 27.3% to 31.6% and 3.7% to 4.2%, respectively; and protease and amylase activities ranged from 10.7 to 14.4 mu mol min (1) g (1) TSS and 293.5 to 335.5 mu mol min(-1) g(-1) TSS, respectively. The results from this study suggest that the promoted bioflocs can improve growth performance and feed utilization of the cultured shrimp, probably through providing a supplemental food source and enhancing feed digestion and utilization.

AB Late Holocene archaeological vertebrate faunas from the Sacramento Valley of north-central California document dramatic changes through time in the relative abundances of large- and small-sized species. The abundances of medium and large mammals decrease significantly through time relative to small resident fishes. When seasonal and spatial variability is held constant, significant decreases also exist in the abundances of large anadromous fishes relative to small resident fishes. These patterns support models of resource intensification posited for central California, which suggest that substantial decreases in foraging efficiency occurred during the late Holocene.

AB The temporal dynamics and spatial distributions of zooplankton in the tidal freshwater portion of the Hudson River were studied over a 3-yr period. We tested the hypothesis that advective transport regulates zooplankton biomass in the Hudson and in lakes, estuaries, and rivers for which we have published values. In the Hudson, zooplankton biomass was negatively correlated with discharge over the entire season (P < 0.0001) as well as during the warmer period of the year (P = 0.007) when biomass was greatest. The spatial distribution of zooplankton over 160-km transects was heterogeneous. Downstream changes in the abundance of a dominant species, Bosmina longirostris, indicate that certain areas of the river support net population growth whereas other areas are population sinks. We infer that zooplankton biomass in the Hudson is a function of the balance between reproduction determined by resources and losses due to advection. Zooplankton biomass differs among lakes, estuaries, and rivers in a manner consistent with the differences in water residence time. Biomass is highest in lakes, lower in saline estuaries and tidal rivers, and lowest in rivers. Advective losses appear to be important in explaining differences between planktonic communities in lentic and lotic environments.

AB A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.

AB Disturbances from. re and herbivory strongly affect savanna vegetation dynamics. In some savannas,. re especially may be instrumental in preserving the coexistence of trees and grasses. The role of herbivory by large mammals is less clear; herbivory has been shown variously to promote and to suppress tree establishment. Here we ask how interactions between herbivory and. re act to shape savanna vegetation dynamics via their effects on tree populations in Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, a savanna with a full complement of native large mammals.
   We examined the effects of herbivore exclusion on tree growth, mortality, and seedling establishment from 2000 to 2007 at 10 sites located in areas of low and high herbivore pressure throughout the park. Results were analyzed statistically and using Leslie matrix models of population dynamics. Herbivory and. re acted primarily to suppress sapling growth rather than on sapling mortality or seedling establishment. This indicates that browsing, like. re, suppresses tree density by imposing a demographic bottleneck on the maturation of saplings to adults.
   Model results suggest that, while browsing and. re each alone impacted growth, a combination of browsing and. re had much greater effects on tree density. Only. re and browsing together were able to prevent increases in tree density. These results suggest that, while soil resources, including nutrients and moisture, are probably instrumental in determining tree growth rates, disturbances from. re and herbivory may be instrumental in limiting tree cover and facilitating the coexistence of trees and grasses in savannas.

AB Allochthonous marine input is a key component of the dynamics of islands and terrestrial coastal ecosystems on islands in the Gulf of California, Mexico, where an unproductive desert juxtaposes a highly productive ocean. In this area, seabirds are a major conduit bringing marine productivity to land. Seabirds leave guano on roosting and nesting islands, and carrion on nesting islands.
   We analyze how seabirds affect the abundance of a dominant consumer group, tenebrionid beetles, on 25 islands in the Gulf of California over a three-year period. Tenebrionid densities vary by three orders of magnitude among islands. Beetles are most abundant in areas influenced by seabirds: they are approximately five times more dense on nesting and roosting islands than on other islands and on mainland sites, and approximately six times more dense inside vs. outside colonies. Path analyses show that seabirds significantly affect beetles by two distinct pathways. On roosting islands, effects are mainly indirect: guano, a fertilizing nutrient, significantly enhances plant productivity; beetles eat plant detritus. On nesting islands, significant effects are primarily direct: beetles eat seabird carrion; the indirect pathway (guano and plants) contributes little on these islands.
   By providing energy and nutrients to fuel a diverse array of consumer populations, seabirds are central to the dynamics of these island ecosystems. Scavengers and avian parasites directly increase by eating seabird products. Likewise, populations of consumers that eat detritus, plant tissues, and seeds are enhanced indirectly via the fertilizing effects of guano on plants. Increases in these primary consumers indirectly facilitate high densities of many predators. Thus, consumer populations on these islands are deeply subsidized by substantial input from seabirds. Because consumers cannot influence the renewal rate of their allochthonous resources, the dynamics of these consumers and their food webs are largely donor controlled.

AB The flora of southern Africa has exceptional species richness and endemism, making it an ideal system for studying the patterns and processes of evolutionary diversification. Using a wealth of recent case studies, I examine the evidence for pollinator-driven diversification in this flora. Pollination systems, which represent available niches for ecological diversification, are characterized in southern Africa by a high level of ecological and evolutionary specialization on the part of plants, and, in some cases, by pollinators as well. These systems are asymmetric, with entire plant guilds commonly specialized for a particular pollinator species or functional type, resulting in obvious convergent floral evolution among guild members. Identified modes of plant lineage diversification involving adaptation to pollinators in these guilds include (i) shifts between pollination systems, (ii) divergent use of the same pollinator, (iii) coevolution, (iv) trait tracking, and (v) floral mimicry of different model species. Microevolutionary studies confirm that pollinator shifts can be precipitated when a plant species encounters a novel pollinator fauna on its range margin, and macroevolutionary studies confirm frequent pollinator shifts associated with lineage diversification. As Darwin first noted, evolutionary specialization for particular pollinators, when resulting in ecological dependency, may increase the risk of plant extinction. I thus also consider the evidence that disturbance provokes pollination failure in some southern African plants with specialized pollination systems.

AB Advances in ecology during the past decade have led to a much more detailed understanding of the potential negative consequences of species' introductions. Moreover, recent studies of mycorrhizal symbionts have led to an increased knowledge of the potential utility of fungal inoculations in agricultural, horticultural and ecological management. The intentional movement of mycorrhizal fungal species is growing, but the concomitant potential for negative ecological consequences of invasions by mycorrhizal fungi is poorly understood. We assess the degree to which introductions of mycorrhizal fungi may lead to unintended negative, and potentially costly, consequences. Our purpose is to make recommendations regarding appropriate management guidelines and highlight top priority research needs. Given the difficulty in discerning invasive species problems associated with mycorrhizal inoculations, we recommend the following. First, careful assessment documenting the need for inoculation, and the likelihood of success, should be conducted prior to inoculation because inoculations are not universally beneficial. Second, invasive species problems are costly and often impossible to control by the time they are recognized. We recommend using local inoculum sources whenever possible. Third, non-sterile cultures of inoculum can result in the movement of saprobes and pathogens as well as mutualists. We recommend using material that has been produced through sterile culture when local inoculum is not available. Finally, life-history characteristics of inoculated fungi may provide general guidelines relative to the likelihood of establishment and spread. We recommend that, when using non-local fungi, managers choose fungal taxa that carry life-history traits that may minimize the likelihood of deleterious invasive species problems. Additional research is needed on the potential of mycorrhizal fungi to spread to non-target areas and cause ecological damage.

AB Despite the large spatial extent and the obvious importance of the savanna biome, not to mention several decades of savanna research, the origin, age, nature, and dynamics of savannas are not well understood. Basically, the question surrounding the presence or existence of savannas focuses on the long-term coexistence of the dominating life forms - trees and grasses. How do these two very different components coexist, without one of them dominating the other, and what mechanisms determine the proportion of each? Earlier equilibrium concepts have recently been replaced by non-equilibrium concepts, and the current view is that tree-grass interactions in savannas cannot be predicted by a simple model. Instead, many interacting factors operating at various spatial and temporal scales contribute to creating and maintaining savanna physiognomy. In this paper we analyse a number of studies from savannas in different parts of the world and discuss whether a general pattern can be perceived behind the numerous factors influencing the presence of savannas systems. On the basis of this analysis we propose a new unifying concept of savanna existence, i.e., the concept of ecological buffering mechanisms. In contrast to previous approaches to explain tree-grass coexistence in savannas, the concept of buffering mechanisms does not focus on equilibria or non-equilibria, steady states of the system or domains of attraction. Instead, in the concept of ecological buffering mechanisms we suggest that it is much more useful to focus on the boundaries of savanna existence itself and to investigate the mechanisms that allow a savanna to persist in critical situations where this system is driven to its boundaries, e.g., pure grasslands or tropical forests. The concept of ecological buffering mechanisms integrates both earlier concepts of ecological theory and general ideas on savanna dynamics as well as specific studies of savannas in different parts of the world.

AB We studied avian breeding and molting activity in relation to rainfall, temporal fluctuations in food resource abundance, and food exploitation by birds, in four arid and semiarid tropical habitats in Venezuela. Twice a month we used mist nets to monitor changes in breeding and molting conditions of captured birds and forced them to regurgitate to determine their diet and feeding guild membership. Food abundance was assessed by measuring the flowering and fruiting seasonality of marked plants and by evaluating arthropod abundance with four different trapping methods. Flowering activity was limited largely to the wet season. Fleshy fruits, although produced year-round, were also more abundant in the rainy period. Arthropod abundance followed the same general pattern with numbers highest in the wet season and lowest in the dry season. Birds of all feeding guilds predominantly bred and molted during the wet season, synchronously with the highest abundance of most food resources. However, the diet analysis revealed a higher occurrence of arthropods coupled with a sharp decrease in the intake of vegetable matter during the birds' breeding season. Consequently, we suggest that arthropod abundance is a crucial factor governing the timing of breeding activities, even in species that normally include a high proportion of nectar and fruits in their diet. We also postulate that, in tropical habitats receiving > 1500 mm of rain per year, breeding in nectarivores and frugivores in the dry season may be related to the lower reduction in arthropod numbers over the less severe drought period.

AB Evolutionary principles are now routinely incorporated into medicine and agriculture. Examples include the design of treatments that slow the evolution of resistance by weeds, pests, and pathogens, and the design of breeding programs that maximize crop yield or quality. Evolutionary principles are also increasingly incorporated into conservation biology, natural resource management, and environmental science. Examples include the protection of small and isolated populations from inbreeding depression, the identification of key traits involved in adaptation to climate change, the design of harvesting regimes that minimize unwanted life-history evolution, and the setting of conservation priorities based on populations, species, or communities that harbor the greatest evolutionary diversity and potential. The adoption of evolutionary principles has proceeded somewhat independently in these different fields, even though the underlying fundamental concepts are the same. We explore these fundamental concepts under four main themes: variation, selection, connectivity, and eco-evolutionary dynamics. Within each theme, we present several key evolutionary principles and illustrate their use in addressing applied problems. We hope that the resulting primer of evolutionary concepts and their practical utility helps to advance a unified multidisciplinary field of applied evolutionary biology.

AB Mutualisms are key components of biodiversity and ecosystem function, yet the forces maintaining them are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of removing large mammals on an ant-Acacia mutualism in an African savanna. Ten years of large-herbivore exclusion reduced the nectar and housing provided by plants to ants, increasing antagonistic behavior by a mutualistic ant associate and shifting competitive dominance within the plant-ant community from this nectar-dependent mutualist to an antagonistic species that does not depend on plant rewards. Trees occupied by this antagonist suffered increased attack by stem-boring beetles, grew more slowly, and experienced doubled mortality relative to trees occupied by the mutualistic ant. These results show that large mammals maintain cooperation within a widespread symbiosis and suggest complex cascading effects of megafaunal extinction.

AB No-take marine reserves are advocated widely as a potential solution to the loss of marine biodiversity and ecosystem structure, and to over-fishing. We assess the duration of protection required for unfished populations of large predatory reef fish to attain natural states. We have monitored two marine reserves at Sumilon and Apo Islands, Philippines, regularly for 17 years (1983-2000). The biomass of large predatory fish was still increasing exponentially after 9 and 18 years of protection at Sumilon and Apo reserves, respectively. There was little evidence that the rate of accumulation of biomass inside the reserves was slowing down even after so many years of protection. This suggests that the length of time to full recovery will be considerable. We made two assumptions in order to estimate this period. Firstly, that biomass growth will follow the logistic model. Secondly, the conservative assumption that biomass had already attained 90% of the local carrying capacity of the environments in the reserves. We conclude that the time required for full recovery will be 15 and 40 years at Sumilon and Apo reserves, respectively. Such durations of recovery appear consistent with known life history characteristics of these fish, and with empirical data on recovery rates of heavily exploited fish stocks. By the time the full fisheries or ecosystem benefits from such reserves are apparent, human populations and impacts will have doubled in much of the developing world. Thus, networks of such reserves need to be implemented immediately. Furthermore, the management mechanisms for the reserves need to be successful over timescales of human generations.

Herein the general principles of rafting are described and how they contribute to population connectivity. Rafting dispersal has particular characteristics, which may differ substantially from those of species with planktonic larval dispersal. Dispersal distances achieved via rafting can vary considerably: journeys may be very short or in some cases extremely long, depending on currents and wind. Accumulation of rafts in convergence zones facilitates cohesion of travelling groups, possibly reducing the risk of founder populations being very small. This becomes particularly important over long distances where singular founder events could provoke strong reduction of the genetic variability in the founded population. The frequency of transport affects the degree of connectivity between local populations. Three important rafting routes are distinguished: frequent, intermittent and episodic. Frequent rafting routes are found in bays, lagoons and estuaries, and they are typically facilitated by substrata of biotic origin (seagrass, saltmarsh vegetation, intermediate-sized algae and mangroves). Intermittent rafting routes are found along temperate continental shores where they are facilitated primarily by giant kelps. In the subtropics and the Arctic intermittent rafting routes facilitated by wood are particularly important. Episodic rafting routes, which often cross vast areas of open ocean (biogeographic barriers), are facilitated by volcanic pumice, floating trees and occasionally by giant kelps when these are pushed beyond intermittent routes by strong winds or currents. Dispersal events occur in a highly sporadic manner in this latter category of rafting route, but when they happen, large amounts of floating substrata and rafters may be dispersed simultaneously. Intervals between events can be decades, centuries or even millennia, and consequently populations resulting from these events may be isolated from each other for long time periods. Population connectivity on frequent, intermittent and episodic rafting routes is high, intermediate and low, respectively. Genetic studies support these predictions, and furthermore underline that rafting may contribute to population connectivity over a wide range of geographic scales, from < 100 km up to > 5000 km. Rafting also has a strong effect on evolutionary processes of the organisms dispersed by this means. It is suggested that local recruitment (consequence of direct development) contributes to enhanced rates of population divergence among local populations of common rafters, but occasionally high genetic diversity may result from secondary admixture. Isolation of colonisers after singular episodic rafting events facilitates allopatric speciation. Through these processes rafting dispersal may support local species richness and thus have an influence on local biogeography and biodiversity. Human activities affect rafting connections in the oceans either by reducing or enhancing the possibility of transport and landfall. In many cases it cannot be safely decided whether the appearance of a species in a new habitat is due to rafting or to other transport mechanisms, and genetic studies can help to identify the most likely causes.
   Future field and laboratory studies on the ecology of potential rafters in combination with genetic studies on different spatial and temporal scales will contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of rafting dispersal, consideration of wich is crucial in developing efficient conservation measures in the marine environment.

AB Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of individual amino acids (AAs) has become a powerful analytical tool in trophic ecology. Heavily fractionating "trophic" AAs (e.g., glutamic acid: Glu) provide a robust indicator of trophic transfer, while minimally fractionating "source" AAs (e.g., phenylalanine: Phe) closely reflect the delta N-15 value at the base of the food web (delta N-15(baseline)). Together, the CSIA-AA approach provides an unprecedented ability to disentangle the influences of delta N-15(baseline) values and trophic fractionation on consumer nitrogen isotope values. Perhaps the most important assumption underlying CSIA-AA applications to trophic ecology is that trophic fractionation of Glu and Phe, and thus the trophic discrimination factor TDFGlu-Phe (Delta N-15(Glu) - Delta N-15(Phe)), is effectively constant across diverse consumer-resource relationships. To test this assumption, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis of controlled feeding experiments that examined individual AA trophic fractionation (Delta N-15(C-D)) and resulting TDFGlu-Phe values. We found tremendous variability in TDFGlu-Phe values from 0% to >10% across 70 species (317 individuals) and 88 distinct consumer-diet combinations. However, this variability appears to follow predictable patterns driven by two dominant variables: diet quality and mode of nitrogen excretion. Consumers feeding on high-quality diets (small diet-consumer AA imbalances) tend to have significantly lower TDFGlu-Phe values than consumers feeding on low-quality diets. Similarly, urea/uric acid-producing consumers also exhibit significantly lower TDFGlu-Phe values than their ammonia-producing counterparts. While these patterns are certainly not universal, together these factors likely explain many of the observed patterns of TDFGlu-Phe variability. We provide an overview of the biochemical and physiological mechanisms underpinning AA Delta N-15(C-D) to explain these patterns. There are several seemingly unique systems, including the remarkably consistent TDFGlu-Phe values across insect food webs and the isotopically "invisible" trophic transfers in microbial food webs, that may provide additional insight into the influence of diet quality and nitrogen cycling on AA fractionation. In this review, we argue that to realize the full potential of CSIA-AA approaches in trophic ecology, we must embrace the variability in TDFGlu-Phe values. This likely requires developing new models of trophic transfer dynamics for some applications, including multi-TDFGlu-Phe equations that directly incorporate variability in TDFGlu-Phe value.

AB The hypothesis that pollinators have been important drivers of angiosperm diversity dates back to Darwin, and remains an important research topic today. Mounting evidence indicates that pollinators have the potential to drive diversification at several different stages of the evolutionary process. Microevolutionary studies have provided evidence for pollinator-mediated floral adaptation, while macroevolutionary evidence supports a general pattern of pollinator-driven diversification of angiosperms. However, the overarching issue of whether, and how, shifts in pollination system drive plant speciation represents a critical gap in knowledge. Bridging this gap is crucial to fully understand whether pollinator-driven microevolution accounts for the observed macroevolutionary patterns. Testable predictions about pollinator-driven speciation can be derived from the theory of ecological speciation, according to which adaptation (microevolution) and speciation (macroevolution) are directly linked. This theory is a particularly suitable framework for evaluating evidence for the processes underlying shifts in pollination systems and their potential consequences for the evolution of reproductive isolation and speciation.
   This Viewpoint paper focuses on evidence for the four components of ecological speciation in the context of plant-pollinator interactions, namely (1) the role of pollinators as selective agents, (2) floral trait divergence, including the evolution of pollination ecotypes, (3) the geographical context of selection on floral traits, and (4) the role of pollinators in the evolution of reproductive isolation. This Viewpoint also serves as the introduction to a Special Issue on Pollinator-Driven Speciation in Plants. The 13 papers in this Special Issue range from microevolutionary studies of ecotypes to macroevolutionary studies of historical ecological shifts, and span a wide range of geographical areas and plant families. These studies further illustrate innovative experimental approaches, and they employ modern tools in genetics and floral trait quantification. Future advances to the field require better quantification of selection through male fitness and pollinator isolation, for instance by exploiting next-generation sequencing technologies. By combining these new tools with strategically chosen study systems, and smart experimental design, we predict that examples of pollinator-driven speciation will be among the most widespread and compelling of all cases of ecological speciation.

AB 1. High-density populations of large herbivores are now widespread. Wildlife managers commonly attempt to control large herbivores through hunting to meet specific management objectives, considering population density as the minimal key source of information. Here, we review the problems of censusing populations of large herbivores and describe an alternative approach, employing indicators of ecological change.
   2. Estimating density of large herbivores with high precision and accuracy is difficult, especially over large areas, and requires considerable investment of time, people and money. Management decisions are often made on an annual basis, informed by population changes over the previous year. However, estimating year-to-year changes in density is not a realistic goal for most large herbivores. Furthermore, population density per se provides no information on the relationship between the population and its habitat.
   3. For successful management of large herbivores, we need to consider not only the fate of the population, but rather changes in both population and habitat features, as well as their interaction. Managers require information on trends in both the animal population and habitat quality in order to interpret changes in the interaction between these two compartments.
   4. We propose that a set of indicators of animal performance, population abundance, habitat quality and/or herbivore habitat impact provides relevant information on the population-habitat system. Monitoring temporal changes in these indicators provides a new basis for setting hunting quotas to achieve specific management objectives. This sort of adaptive management is employed widely in France for managing roe deer Capreolus capreolus.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The management of large herbivores would be improved by investing fewer resources in trying to estimate the absolute abundance of ungulates, and more resources in collecting additional data to inform understanding of the ecological status of the ungulate-habitat system being managed. This paper presents a set of indicators of ecological change for monitoring the interaction between a population and its habitat as a basis for adaptive management to attain explicit goals and to improve knowledge of the system. This approach could improve management for a variety of large herbivores, by harmonizing actions at wide spatial scales.

AB The advent and recent advances of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have enabled accurate measurement of 3D ecosystem structure. Here, we review insights gained through the application of LiDAR to animal ecology studies, revealing the fundamental importance of structure for animals. Structural heterogeneity is most conducive to increased animal richness and abundance, and increased complexity of vertical vegetation structure is more positively influential compared with traditionally measured canopy cover, which produces mixed results. However, different taxonomic groups interact with a variety of 3D canopy traits and some groups with 3D topography. To develop a better understanding of animal dynamics, future studies will benefit from considering 3D habitat effects in a wider variety of ecosystems and with more taxa.

AB Large herbivores are known to respond to spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of forage resources, but how important herbivores are in creating those spatial patterns, how their influence may be scale dependent, and how herbivore-induced patterns affect ecosystem processes remain unclear. We examined the effects of native migratory ungulates on the spatial distribution of soil nitrogen and N-mineralization potential at scales ranging from 0.1-30 m in grasslands of Yellowstone National Park using geostatistical analyses of soils collected inside and outside long-term (36+-yr) exclosures.
   At small spatial scales (0.1-2 m), ungrazed grasslands showed a high degree of patchiness in the distribution of soil N and N-mineralization potential (94% and 77% of sample variation explained by small-scale patchiness, respectively). For both variables, patches occurred at a consistent mean size of similar to 40 cm. In contrast, grazed grassland exhibited minimal spatial structure in the distribution of soil N and N-mineralization rates (< 24% of variation for both variables spatially dependent) and no consistent patch size at a scale of 0.1-2 m. In grazed grassland, most variation was extremely fine grained, occurring across distances < 10 cm. The high degree of fine-grained heterogeneity in grazed grassland was associated with greater plant diversity in small (20 x 20 cm) patches. Recycling of nitrogen through dung and urine is clearly important for maintaining long-term nitrogen balance of the system, but we estimated that only 2.5% of the grazed grassland sampled was recently affected by urine. Results conflict with predictions of increased heterogeneity in grazed communities based primarily on the deposition of dung and urine in discrete patches and suggest that the dominant mechanism(s) by which grazers alter N cycling in this ecosystem operates through the plant community. We hypothesize that grazers promote fine-scale heterogeneity by diversifying plant species effects on soils and/or increasing the spatial variability in plant litter inputs.
   At larger spatial scales (5-30 m), large herbivores altered the distribution of soil N across a topographic gradient. In a grazed community, soil N properties were associated with the topographic gradient and exhibited increasing variance among sampling points separated by increasing distances from 5 to 30 m. Ungrazed grassland exhibited no spatial structure in soil N distribution and no correlation with topography. Collectively, our data show that grazers influence the distribution of soil N properties at every spatial scale from individual plants to landscapes.

AB Proliferation of woody plants in grasslands and savannas since the 1800s has been widely documented. In the southwestern United States, increased abundance of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa) has been attributed to heavy grazing by livestock. Here, we test the hypothesis that P. glandulosa invasion of grasslands requires, first, reductions in herbaceous biomass and density such as those that accompany livestock grazing and, second, episodes of high soil moisture availability.
   No combination of grass density (nonmanipulated or reduced 50%) or defoliation (none, moderate, heavy) significantly affected P. glandulosa seedling emergence within a watering regime (natural and supplemented) at our field site in semiarid southern Texas. Seedling emergence on plots receiving only natural rainfall was high (42%), despite the fact that precipitation was substantially below normal. Supplemental watering, to generate moisture levels approximating years of unusually high annual rainfall, increased emergence to 59%. Seedling survival after 2 yr was high (62-77%) and statistically comparable across the density, defoliation, and watering treatments. Net photosynthesis (A(n)) of 1-yr-old seedlings was enhanced by supplemental watering, but reductions in grass density or biomass had little effect on seedling A(n) or xylem water potential. Height, aboveground biomass, and leaf area were comparable among 1- and 2-yr-old seedings across all density, defoliation, and watering combinations.
   High seedling emergence and survival on unwatered plots, even during a "drought year,'' suggests that Prosopis recruitment is not contingent upon unusual or episodic rainfall. Reductions in biomass and density of herbaceous vegetation had no influence on seedling emergence, growth, or survival, suggesting that Prosopis invasion is minimally influenced by grass competition. Historic grazing at this site appears to have altered herbaceous composition and reduced above- and belowground biomass production below the threshold level required for competitive exclusion of woody vegetation. Such data suggest that rates and patterns of seed dispersal may be the primary determinants of P. glandulosa encroachment on present-day landscapes in semiarid regions. Minimizing livestock dispersal of seed (in the case of leguminous shrubs) and maintenance of an effective fire regime (through production of fine fuels) may be crucial for sustaining herbaceous composition and production in grazed systems prone to invasion by unpalatable woody plants.

AB A large part of the literature analyzing the links between biodiversity conservation and community development assumes that nature-based tourism managed by indigenous communities will result not only in conservation of natural resources but also in increased development. In practice, ecotourism has often failed to deliver the expected benefits to indigenous communities due to a combination of factors, including shortages in the endowments of human, financial and social capital within the community, lack of mechanisms for a fair distribution of the economic benefits of ecotourism, and land insecurity. Based on a review of experiences, we analyze the complex interaction among the factors shaping the success and failure of ecotourism experiences in indigenous communities, and we stress the need for a better approach to enhance the indigenous communities' livelihood possibilities coming from ecotourism, as well as to promote land tenure and communities' empowerment.

AB Populations of the tropical limpet Cellana grata Could were studied on exposed shores around Cape d'Aguilar, Hong Kong. C. grata is a high shore species, the zonation pattern of which varies seasonally, shifting downwards in association with increasing summer temperatures. C. grata is a non-homing species and was active (foraging) whilst awash by the tide, moving up and down the shore with the flood and ebb tides, respectively. Limpets moved up to 1 m in the vertical plane over a tidal cycle. When not foraging limpets took refuge in habitats that reduced the effects of high temperature and desiccation stress. Temperature measurements of individuals and their physical environment showed that the quality of these refuges varied both spatially and temporally. Horizontal rock surfaces were hotter than vertical surfaces; limpet body temperatures and habitat temperatures in refuges (crevices, pool interfaces and east-facing vertical surfaces) were consistantly cooler than adjacent habitats by 3 to 8 degrees C and limpet body temperatures were usually 2 degrees C warmer than the rock they rested on. Experimental manipulations with specimens restrained 0.5 m above their normal resting height or on horizontal rock surfaces and prevented from returning to refuges caused desiccation, osmotic stress and, in many eases, death as a consequence of prolonged emersion in these sub-optimal habitats. Individuals on horizontal surfaces lost water more rapidly than those on vertical surfaces and showed higher mortality. C. grata does not adopt many of the behavioural adaptions to reduce heat stress shown by other gastropod species. It does, however, exhibit 'mushrooming' behaviour, lifting its shell from the rock surface, although the exact benefits of this behaviour are unclear. Summer physical extremes may strongly select for limpet activity rhythms entrained by wave splash and the selection of refuges from high temperatures and desiccation when inactive. Variation in the quality of these refuges can lead to selective mortality during very hot periods.

AB Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) arrived in Zimbabwe ca. 1000 years ago. Numbers of free-ranging dogs have reached unprecedented levels in communal lands (agro-pastoralist rural areas), and interact with large wild carnivores along boundaries with wildlife reserves as predators and prey. This study examined a population of 236 dogs in a 33-km(2) section of Gokwe Communal Land (GCL) bordering the Sengwa Wildlife Research Area (SWRA) in north-western Zimbabwe in 1995-1996. Dogs were found up to 6 km within the SWRA, and were the most common carnivore on the GCL-SWRA boundary. Observations of 16 radio-collared does showed that they were inefficient predators. Only 20 kills were recorded amongst the remaining dog population, of which three were wild ungulates. Dogs were unsuccessful predators due to their small group size (mean 1.7) and body mass (mean 14.7 kg). and the abundance of alternative food. It is therefore unlikely that they compete with large carnivores for wild prey. However, leopards (Panthera pardus), lions (P. leo) and spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) preyed on dogs in GCL, removing greater than or equal to6% of the dog population in 1993. Such predation provides ideal circumstances for disease transmission. Canid disease was prevalent in the study area; including rabies and probably distemper. The risk of infection is greatest during the dry season (May-October), when peaks in rates of disease, carnivore incursions into GCL, and predation on dogs coincided. The role of jackals (Canis adustus and Canis mesomelas) and spotted hyaena predation of dogs is discussed in relation to disease epidemics within wildlife reserves. With a dog population growth rate of 6.5% per annum, and the prevalence of canid diseases, the conservation threat posed by dogs is escalating on communal land-wildlife reserve boundaries in Zimbabwe. Measures to control dog numbers and improve vaccination coverage of dogs are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dense populations of patellid limpets characterize the mid- to low-intertidal communities of the southwestern rocky shores of South Africa. Patella argenvillei and P. granatina reach average densities up to 200/m(2), representing in some cases approximate to 10-13 kg/m(2) of whole wet biomass, and attain sizes up to 100-mm shell length. Traditionally these limpets have been regarded as generalized grazers, but in fact they have highly specialized feeding mechanisms. P. granatina is found primarily on the mid- to low shore of sheltered boulder-bays, while P. argenvillei forms a conspicuous monospecific belt low on semi-exposed shores in association with adjacent kelp beds. Both species are the dominant occupiers of space in their respective habitats. We have investigated the main pathways and supply of food necessary to maintain limpet biomasses as high as this. Epilithic micro- and macroalgae and the kelps Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida are common sources of food for these two limpet species. Gut contents show that kelp represents > 50% of the total diet of both species. An abundant source of food is provided to P. granatina by drifting kelp and seaweed debris, and to P. argenvillei by nearby attached kelp plants, which they actively prune. Differences in the timing and method of feeding exist. P. granatina captures drifting kelp and seaweeds while underwater during incoming and outgoing tides, and P. argenvillei prunes the fronds of nearby attached kelp plants during the rising tide. P. argenvillei feeds collectively, several individuals sharing a piece of kelp trapped by a single limpet. This overcomes the intraspecific competition normally experienced in high density limpet populations, and the maximum size of P. argenvillei rises with density. P. granatina does not feed collectively and its maximum size declines with density. An experimental exclusion of kelp from the limpets' diets resulted in significantly increased mortality and a reduction in body mass. Subtidal production of kelp fronds subsidizes populations of both limpet species and is vital to the maintenance of their remarkably high biomasses. Supplied with a superabundance of food, both species achieve such high ''packing'' that primary space becomes their limiting factor. The trophic subsidy provided by kelps has important secondary consequences since the dense limpet populations powerfully influence intertidal community structure and function.

AB Many forested landscapes around the world are severely altered during mining for their rich mineral and energy reserves. Herein we provide an overview of the challenges inherent in efforts to restore mined landscapes to functioning forest ecosystems and present a synthesis of recent progress using examples from North America, Europe and Australia. We end with recommendations for further elaboration of the Forestry Reclamation Approach emphasizing: (1) Landform reconstruction modelled on natural systems and creation of topographic heterogeneity at a variety of scales; (2) Use and placement of overburden, capping materials and organic amendments to facilitate soil development processes and create a suitable rooting medium for trees; (3) Alignment of landform, topography, overburden, soil and tree species to create a diversity of target ecosystem types; (4) Combining optimization of stock type and planting techniques with early planting of a diversity of tree species; (5) Encouraging natural regeneration as much as possible; (6) Utilizing direct placement of forest floor material combined with seeding of native species to rapidly re-establish native forest understory vegetation; (7) Selective on-going management to encourage development along the desired successional trajectory. Successful restoration of forest ecosystems after severe mining disturbance will be facilitated by a regulatory framework that acknowledges and accepts variation in objectives and outcomes.

AB Fragmentation of the ecosystems of the earth into spatially isolated units has emerged as a primary component of global change. Often, fragmentation results from actions that are intended to enhance human livelihoods and well-being; however, there are often costs to ecosystems and human economies that are not considered. We describe the three general categories of processes causing fragmentation of rangelands worldwide: dissection, decoupling, and compression. We show that access to heterogeneity of landscapes is an important attribute of grazing ecosystems worldwide, and that fragmentation of these systems, even when it proceeds in the absence of habitat loss, can limit options of people and animals, options that are particularly important in temporally heterogeneous environments. We discuss the consequences of fragmentation for people, livestock, wildlife, and landscapes and describe potential adaptations that can mitigate its harmful outcomes. We close by reviewing policy options that promote re-aggregation of landscapes and adaptation to fragmentation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in key drivers (e.g., climate, disturbance regimes and land use) may affect the sustainability of forest landscapes and set the stage for increased tension among competing ecosystem services. We addressed two questions about a suite of supporting, regulating and provisioning ecosystem services in each of two well-studied forest landscapes in the western US: (1) How might the provision of ecosystem services change in the future given anticipated trajectories of climate, disturbance regimes, and land use? (2) What is the role of spatial heterogeneity in sustaining future ecosystem services? We determined that future changes in each region are likely to be distinct, but spatial heterogeneity (e.g., the amount and arrangement of surviving forest patches or legacy trees after disturbance) will be important in both landscapes for sustaining forest regeneration, primary production, carbon storage, natural hazard regulation, insect and pathogen regulation, timber production and wildlife habitat. The paper closes by highlighting five general priorities for future research. The science of landscape ecology has much to contribute toward understanding ecosystem services and how land management can enhance-or threaten-the sustainability of ecosystem services in changing landscapes.

AB With about 500 known species worldwide, the large brachiopods are a relatively small group of primitive crustaceans. With few exceptions they live in temporary aquatic systems that are most abundant in arid and semi arid areas. As many regions remain unexplored and as especially the number of species in clam shrimps and tadpole shrimps is underestimated due to difficult identification, the species list will increase with future surveys. The Branchiopoda are monophyletic, but inter-ordinal relationships, as well as many evolutionary relationships at lower taxonomic levels are still unclear. Ongoing molecular studies will more accurately depict species diversity and phylogenetic patterns. With the exception of some anostracan families, most families are not restricted to the northern or southern hemisphere or specific zoogeographical regions. Large branchiopods are used for the assessment of the quality and function of temporary wetlands. Due to the reduction in number and quality of temporary wetlands, several species became endangered and are red listed by the IUCN.

AB The loss of interactions from mutualistic networks could foreshadow both plant and animal species extinctions. Yet, the characteristics of interactions that predispose them to disruption are largely unknown. We analyzed 12 pollination webs from isolated hills ("sierras"), in Argentina, ranging from tens to thousands of hectares. We found evidence of nonrandom loss of interactions with decreasing sierra size. Low interaction frequency and high specialization between interacting partners contributed additively to increase the vulnerability of interactions to disruption. Interactions between generalists in the largest sierras were ubiquitous across sierras, but many of them lost their central structural role in the smallest sierras. Thus, particular configurations of interaction networks, along with unique ecological relations and evolutionary pathways, could be lost forever after habitat reduction.

AB Jaguar Panthera onca and puma Puma concolor are sympatric throughout the jaguar's distribution. Although several studies have focused on the interactions between these two predators, the ecological and behavioural factors that promote their coexistence remain unclear. The goal of this study was to identify those factors that facilitate the coexistence of these cats in a mosaic landscape in the Venezuelan llanos. The study was conducted from January 1996 until November 1998. Five jaguars and six pumas were captured and radio-collared. A high degree of spatial overlap was observed between jaguars and pumas, which may be related to the abundance and distribution of prey species. At a fine scale, there was little overlap of puma locations with jaguar locations. Both species were more active at night than during daytime, but seasonal differences were detected in the activity levels of these predators. Major segregation was found in food habits. Jaguars selected for large prey and pumas for medium-sized prey. Jaguars selected for capybara Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris and collared peccary Tayassu tajacu and consumed caiman Caiman crocodilus and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus less than expected. Pumas selected just for collared peccary and also killed caiman less than expected. It is suggested that the abundance of medium-sized prey is an ecological factor that is facilitating the coexistence of jaguar and puma in the study area. Habitat heterogeneity may be another influential factor leading to the coexistence. Seasonal differences in activity levels probably reflect differences in the size and species of prey taken by these cats.

AB Larval supply affects the structure of marine communities. Cross-shelf transport of larvae by upwelling and downwelling may cause variation in larval supply. We tested the hypothesis that slow-swimming bivalve larvae are swept offshore during upwelling and shoreward during downwelling. We sampled a transect at Duck, North Carolina during a period when currents shifted from upwelling to downwelling and back to upwelling. During each shift, nearshore water was exchanged with offshore water and currents were 10 to 100 times faster than larval swimming speeds. Larval Spisula solidissima and Ensis directus were found below the thermocline and, contrary to prediction, were swept onshore during upwelling and offshore during downwelling. When S. solidissima larvae were found above the thermocline, cross-shelf transport was as predicted. Larval Tellina spp. and Mulinia lateralis remained within 5 km of shore despite cross-shelf currents and the exchange of nearshore waters with offshore waters. They did not behave as passive particles; they were not swept off shore by upwelling or onshore by downwelling. For these taxa the hypothesis was rejected. These larvae may have remained close to shore by using behaviors analogous to those displayed by animals concentrated at convergent fronts. Given the relatively slow swimming speed of bivalve larvae, there is no reason to expect that any larval type is swept offshore by upwelling. The effect of upwelling and downwelling on larval distributions varies with larval behavior and vertical distribution. Without careful sampling, one cannot invoke offshore transport of larvae by upwelling as a cause of variations in larval settlement.

AB Within the last decade the study of phenology has taken on new importance because of its contribution to climate-change research. However, phenology data sets spanning many years are rare in the tropics, making it difficult to evaluate possible responses of tropical communities to climate change. Here we use two data sets (1970-1983 and 1990-2002) to describe the fruiting patterns of the tropical tree community in Kibate National Park, Uganda. To address variation in spatial patterns, we describe fruiting over 2-3 y among four sites each separated by 12-15 km. Presently, the Kibale region is receiving c. 300 min more rain than it did at the start of the century, droughts are less frequent, the onset of the rainy season is earlier. and the average maximum monthly temperature is 3.5degreesC hotter than it was 25 y ago. The 1990-2002 phenology data illustrated high temporal variability in the proportion of the populations fruiting. Interannual variation in community-wide fruit availability was also high; however, the proportion of trees that fruited has increased over the past 12 + y. At the species level a variety of patterns were exhibited; however, a number of the most common species currently rarely fruit, and when they do, typically < 41% of the individuals take part in fruiting events. Combining the data set from 1990 to 2002 with that from 1970 to 1983 for specific species again reveals an increase in the proportion of trees fruiting between 1990 and 2002: however, the proportion of the populations fruiting decreased during the earlier period. When one examines particular species over this whole period a variety of patterns are evident. For example, Pouteria altissima exhibited a relatively regular pattern of fruiting during the 1970s; however, it rarely fruited in the 1990s. Contrasting phenological patterns at four sites revealed that at the community level the fruiting patterns of only one of the six pair-wise site combinations were correlated. Relationships between rainfall and fruiting were variable among sites. Contrasting changes in fruiting patterns over the 30 y with differences among the four sites varying in rainfall, suggests that the changes observed in fruiting may be due to climate change. Responses to this climate change are likely complex and will vary among species. However, for some species, current conditions appear unsuitable for fruiting.

AB This paper reviews how and when African rainforest diversity arose, presenting evidence from both plant and animal studies. Preliminary investigations show that these African forests are an assemblage of species of varying age. Phylogenetic evidence, from both African rainforest angiosperms and vertebrates, suggest a Tertiary origin for the major lineages in some of these groups. In groups where savannah species are well represented and rainforest species are a minority, the latter appear to be relicts of a Mid-Tertiary rainforest. By contrast, species that are primarily adapted to rainforest have arisen in the past 10 Myr with the main morphological innovations dating from the Late Miocene, and Quaternary speciation dominating in large, morphologically homogeneous groups. The small number of species-level phylogenies for African rainforest plants hinders a more incisive and detailed study into the historical assembly of these continental forests.

AB Herbivory can change the structure and spatial heterogeneity of vegetation. We ask whether all species of grazers in a savanna ecosystem can have this effect or whether megaherbivores (> 1000 kg) have a 'special' role that cannot be replicated by other species of grazers. We performed a replicated landscape scale experiment that examined the effects of White Rhino on the grass sward, on other species of grazing mammals and on the movement of fire through the landscape. White Rhino maintained short grass ('lawn') patches in mesic areas (similar to 750 mm pa) with increases in grass sward height when they were removed. Other species of grazers were unable to maintain short grass communities when White Rhino were removed. In semi-arid areas (similar to 600 mm pa) other, smaller grazers were able to maintain short grass communities in the absence of White Rhino and sward height did not increase. White Rhino removals affected fire by increasing fuel loads and fuel continuity. This resulted in larger, less patchy fires. We propose that the White Rhino acts as an influential ecosystem engineer, creating and maintaining short grass swards, which alter habitat for other grazers and change the fire regime. These results indicate the existence of context-dependent facilitation between White Rhino and other grazers in mesic, but not in semi-arid, savannas. Such top down effects on the ecosystem may have been much more widespread before the extinction of large grazers in the Pleistocene.

AB Invasion science is a very active subdiscipline of ecology. However, some scientists contend that theoretical integration has been limited and that predictive power remains weak. This paper, focusing on plants, proposes a new multi-pronged research strategy that builds on recent advances in invasion science. More intensive studies on particular model organisms and ecosystems are needed to improve our understanding of the full suite of interacting factors that influence invasions (model system research'). At the same time, comparative studies across many study systems are essential for unravelling the context-dependencies of insights that emerge from particular studies (multi-site studies'); and quantitative synthesis based on large datasets should be constrained to well-defined theoretical domains (focused meta-analysis'). We also suggest ways for better integration of information about species biology and ecosystem characteristics (invasion syndromes'). We expect that a resulting theory of invasions will need to be conceived as a somewhat heterogeneous conglomerate of elements of varying generality and predictive power: laws that apply to well-specified domains, general concepts and theoretical frameworks that can guide thinking in research and management, and in-depth knowledge about the drivers of particular invasions.

AB The idea of coevolution originated with Darwin's proposal that long-proboscid pollinators and long-tubed flowers might be engaged in reciprocal selection, but this has not been demonstrated. Here we test key aspects of Darwin's hypothesis of reciprocal selection in an experiment with naturally interacting populations of extremely long-proboscid flies (Moegistorhynchus longirostris: Nemestinidae) and long-tubed irises (Lapeirousia anceps: Iridaceae). We show that the benefit derived by both the fly (volume of nectar consumed) and the plant (number pollen grains received) depends on the relative length of their interacting organs. Each trait is shown to act both as agent and target in directional reciprocal selection, potentially leading to a race. This understanding of how fitness in both species varies in relation to the balance of their armament allows us to make tentative predictions about the nature of selection across multiple communities. We find that in each community a core group of long-tubed plant species might together be involved in diffuse coevolution with the fly. In poorly matched populations, the imbalance in armament is too great to allow reciprocal selection to act, and these species might instead experience one-sided selection that leads to convergence with the core species. Reciprocal selection drives the evolution of the community, then, additional species become attached to the network of interacting mutualists by convergence.

AB Moisture, nutrients, fire and herbivory are the principal factors governing tree-grass cover ratios of savannas. We investigated tree (Acacia mellifera) recruitment after fire and under conditions of maximum-recorded rainfall, nitrogen addition and grazing in a completely-crossed field experiment. We employed a similar garden experiment with the exception of the fire treatment. Tree germination in the field was extremely low, probably due to below-average natural rainfall in plots that only received natural rain, and insufficient watering frequency in irrigated plots. Due to low germination in the field experiment, no treatment significantly affected tree recruitment. In the garden experiment, frequent watering, nutrient control (i.e. no nitrogen addition) and grazing enhanced tree recruitment with significant interactions between rain, nitrogen and grazing. We infer that above-average rainfall years with frequent rainfall events are required for mass tree recruitment. Grass defoliation makes space and resources available for tree seedlings. Nitrogen enrichment increases the competitive ability of fast-growing grasses more than that of the N-2-fixing tree component. In contrast to conventional wisdom that grazing alone causes encroachment, we suggest that there are complex interactions between the above-mentioned factors and 'triggering' events such as unusually high rainfall.

AB This study examines the impacts of woody, N-2-fixing invasive Acacia spp. on the patterns of nutrient cycling in two invaded ecosystems of differing nutrient status in the Cape floristic region. Patterns of soil nutrient mineralization were measured by a field incubation method while the significance of the fixation process in altering nutrient cycling was assessed by the delta(15)N natural abundance technique. The results confirm earlier reports that invasion by woody shrubs results in organic matter and nutrient enrichment of surface soils of both ecosystems. However, patterns of nutrient availability (phosphorus and nitrogen) were not necessarily enhanced. In the more fertile strandveld both phosphorus and nitrogen (significant at P<0.10) showed trends towards enhanced annual mineralization rates upon invasion, while in the low nutrient fynbos system only phosphorus followed this trend. It is unclear whether this differential response is a consequence of plant- or soil-derived feedbacks on the decomposition processes in each system. The delta(15)N values of the soils from the invaded sites of both ecosystems indicated a strong influence of the alien species on the soil nitrogen component. However, as with other studies of natural ecosystems, the contribution of nitrogen from fixation could not be readily quantified with the delta(15)N natural abundance method because of problems in selecting suitable non-N-2-fixing reference plants. A technique of disrupting nodule structure and function, by fumigation with O-2, to Obtain the delta(15)N value of a non-N-2-fixing specimen of the study species was tried and found to overcome some of the problems associated with the lack of suitable reference plants. With this technique it was possible to detect the almost total dependence of A. saligna on N-2-fixation in the fynbos soils with their low nitrogen mineralization rates. In the strandveld ecosystem with much higher soil nitrogen release rates A. cyclops was only partly dependent on fixation (about half) for its nitrogen. The nutrient enrichment of both ecosystems and trends towards enhanced rates of nutrient mineralization could have profound implications on the long-term success of alien invader clearing operations and the restoration of the indigenous flora at these sites.

AB The finding that regular spatial patterns can emerge in nature from local interactions between organisms has prompted a search for the ecological importance of these patterns. Theoretical models have predicted that patterning may have positive emergent effects on fundamental ecosystem functions, such as productivity. We provide empirical support for this prediction. In dryland ecosystems, termite mounds are often hotspots of plant growth (primary productivity). Using detailed observations and manipulative experiments in an African savanna, we show that these mounds are also local hotspots of animal abundance (secondary and tertiary productivity): insect abundance and biomass decreased with distance from the nearest termite mound, as did the abundance, biomass, and reproductive output of insect-eating predators. Null-model analyses indicated that at the landscape scale, the evenly spaced distribution of termite mounds produced dramatically greater abundance, biomass, and reproductive output of consumers across trophic levels than would be obtained in landscapes with randomly distributed mounds. These emergent properties of spatial pattern arose because the average distance from an arbitrarily chosen point to the nearest feature in a landscape is minimized in landscapes where the features are hyper-dispersed (i.e., uniformly spaced). This suggests that the linkage between patterning and ecosystem functioning will be common to systems spanning the range of human management intensities. The centrality of spatial pattern to system-wide biomass accumulation underscores the need to conserve pattern-generating organisms and mechanisms, and to incorporate landscape patterning in efforts to restore degraded habitats and maximize the delivery of ecosystem services.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important greenhouse gas (GHG) which has a global warming potential 310 times that of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a hundred year lifespan. N2O is generated during microbial nitrification and denitrification, which are common in aquaculture systems. To date, few studies have been conducted to quantify N2O emission from aquaculture. Additionally, very little is known with respect to the microbial pathways through which N2O is formed in aquaculture systems. This review suggests that aquaculture can be an important anthropogenic source of N2O emission. The global N2O-N emission from aquaculture in 2009 is estimated to be 9.30 X 10(10) g, and will increase to 3.83 x 10(11) g which could account for 5.72% of anthropogenic N2O-N emission by 2030 if the aquaculture industry continues to increase at the present annual growth rate (about 7.10%). The possible mechanisms and various factors affecting N2O production are summarized, and two possible methods to minimize N2O emission, namely aquaponic and biofloc technology aquaculture, are also discussed. The paper concludes with future research directions.

AB Aim The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) (Cape Floristic Kingdom) is currently narrowly delimited to include only the relatively mesic Cape fold mountains and adjacent intermontane valleys and coastal plains. We evaluate the floristic support for expanding the delimitation to include the whole winter-rainfall area (arid and mesic climates) into a Greater CFR.
   Location Southern Africa, particularly the south-western tip.
   Methods The initial divisive hierarchical classification analysis TWINSPAN used the presence/absence of vascular plant genera to obtain major floristic groupings in southern Africa. For the more detailed analyses, we scored the flora as present/absent within a set of centres, among which the floristic relationships were investigated (agglomerative methods, UPGMA and minimum spanning trees). These analyses were conducted with species, genera and families separately. The centres were grouped into five regions. The species richness and endemism was calculated for the centres, regions and combination of regions. The dominant floristic components of each region were sought by calculating the percentage contribution of each family to the flora.
   Results The divisive method showed that the winter-rainfall areas are floristically distinct from the rest of southern Africa. The species- and generic-level analyses revealed five regions: CFR, Karoo Region, Hantam-Tanqua-Roggeveld Region, Namaqualand Region and Namib-Desert Region. The CFR has the highest endemism and richness. However, the combination of the CFR, the Hantam-Tanqua-Roggeveld Region and the Namaqualand Region results in a higher total endemism. Combined, these three regions almost match the region delimited by the TWINSPAN analysis, and together constitute the Greater CFR.
   Main conclusions The CFR constitutes a valid floristic region. This is evident from the endemism and the distinctive composition of the flora. However, the total endemism is higher for the whole winter-rainfall area, and this supports the recognition of the larger unit. If floristic regions are to be delimited only on endemism, then the Greater CFR is to be preferred. If floristic regions are delimited on the composition of their floras at family level, then the support for such a grouping is weaker.

AB Increasing globalization has spread invasive marine organisms, but it is not well understood why some species invade more readily than others. It is also poorly understood how species' range limits are set generally, let alone how anthropogenic climate change may disrupt existing species boundaries. We find a quantitative relationship that determines if a coastal species with a benthic adult stage and planktonic larvae can be retained within its range and invade in the direction opposite that of the mean current experienced by the larvae (i.e. upstream). The derivation of the retention criterion extends prior riparian results to the coastal ocean by formulating the criterion as a function of observable oceanic parameters, focusing on species with obligate benthic adults and planktonic larvae, and quantifying the effects of iteroparity and longevity. By placing the solutions in a coastal context, the retention criterion isolates the role of 3 interacting factors that counteract downstream drift and set or advance the upstream edge of an oceanic species' distribution. First, spawning over several seasons or years enhances retention by increasing the variation in the currents encountered by the larvae. Second, for a given population growth rate, species with a shorter pelagic period are better retained and more able to spread upstream. And third, prodigious larval production improves retention. Long distance downstream dispersal may thus be a byproduct of the many propagules often necessary to ensure local recruitment and persistence of a population in an advective environment.

AB Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is a crop pest native to the Americas, which has invaded and spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa within two years. Recent estimates of 20-50% maize yield loss in Africa suggest severe impact on livelihoods. Fall armyworm is still infilling its potential range in Africa and could spread to other continents. In order to understand fall armyworm's year-round, global, potential distribution, we used evidence of the effects of temperature and precipitation on fall armyworm life-history, combined with data on native and African distributions to construct Species Distribution Models (SDMs). We also investigated the strength of trade and transportation pathways that could carry fall armyworm beyond Africa. Up till now, fall armyworm has only invaded areas that have a climate similar to the native distribution, validating the use of climatic SDMs. The strongest climatic limits on fall armyworm's year-round distribution are the coldest annual temperature and the amount of rain in the wet season. Much of sub-Saharan Africa can host year-round fall armyworm populations, but the likelihoods of colonising North Africa and seasonal migrations into Europe arc hard to predict. South and Southeast Asia and Australia have climate conditions that would permit fall armyworm to invade. Current trade and transportation routes reveal Australia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand face high threat of fall armyworm invasions originating from Africa.

AB The pace of deforestation worldwide has necessitated the development of strategies that restore forest cover quickly and efficiently. We review one potential strategy, applied nucleation, which involves planting small patches of trees as focal areas for recovery. Once planted, these patches, or nuclei, attract dispersers and facilitate establishment of new woody recruits, expanding the forested area over time. Applied nucleation is an attractive option in that it mimics natural successional processes to aid woody plant recolonization. To date, results of experimental tests of applied nucleation are consistent with theoretical predictions and indicate that the density and diversity of colonists is higher in planted nuclei than in areas where no planting takes place (e.g. passive restoration). These studies suggest that the applied nucleation strategy has the potential to restore deforested habitats into heterogeneous canopies with a diverse community composition, while being cheaper than projects that rely on plantation designs. We recommend several areas where research would aid in refining the methodology. We also call for further comparisons as nuclei age beyond the 2-13 years that have been studied, thus far, in order to confirm that practical applications continue to match theoretical predictions. Finally, we suggest that applied nucleation could be effective in the restoration of a variety of habitat types or species guilds beyond the ones to which it has been applied thus far.

AB The inherent complexity of high-diversity systems can make them particularly difficult to understand. The relatively recent introduction of functional approaches, which seek to infer ecosystem functioning based on species' ecological traits, has revolutionized our understanding of these high-diversity systems. Today, the functional structure of an assemblage is widely regarded as a key indicator of the status or resilience of an ecosystem. Indeed, functional evaluations have become a mainstay of monitoring and management approaches. But is the heavy focus on broad metrics of functional structure grounded in empirical research? On tropical coral reefs, the ocean's most diverse ecosystems, remarkably few studies directly quantify ecosystem functions and the term 'function' is widely used but rarely defined, especially when applied to reef fishes. Our review suggests that most 'functional' studies do not study function as it relates to ecological processes. Rather, they look at easy-to-measure traits or proxies that are thought to have functional significance. However, these links are rarely tested empirically, severely limiting our capacity to extend results from community structure to the dynamic processes operating within high-diversity ecosystems such as coral reefs. With rapid changes in global ecosystems, and in their capacity to deliver ecosystem services, there is an urgent need to understand and empirically measure the role of organisms in various ecosystem functions. We suggest that if we are to understand and manage transitioning coral reefs in the Anthropocene, a broad definition of the word 'function' is needed along with a focus on ecological processes and the empirical quantification of functional roles. In this review, we propose a universal operational definition of the term 'function' that works from a cellular to a global level. Specifically, it is the movement or storage of energy or material. Within this broad definitional framework, all functions are part of a continuum that is tied together by the process-based unifier of material fluxes. With this universal definition at hand, we then present a path forward that will allow us to fully harness the power of functional approaches in understanding and managing high-diversity systems such as coral reefs. A plain language summary is available for this article.

AB Animal-mediated pollination is essential for both ecosystem services and conservation of global biodiversity, but a growing body of work reveals that it is negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbance. Landscape-scale disturbance results in two often inter-related processes: (1) habitat loss, (2) disruptions of habitat configuration (i.e. fragmentation). Understanding the relative effects of such processes is critical in designing effective management strategies to limit pollination and pollinator decline. We reviewed existing published work from 1989 to 2009 and found that only six of 303 studies considering the influence of landscape context on pollination separated the effects of habitat loss from fragmentation. We provide a synthesis of the current landscape, behavioural, and pollination ecology literature in order to present preliminary multiple working hypotheses explaining how these two landscape processes might independently influence pollination dynamics. Landscape disturbance primarily influences three components of pollination interactions: pollinator density, movement, and plant demography. We argue that effects of habitat loss on each of these components are likely to differ substantially from the effects of fragmentation, which is likely to be more complex and may influence each pollination component in contrasting ways. The interdependency between plants and animals inherent to pollination systems also has the possibility to drive cumulative effects of fragmentation, initiating negative feedback loops between animals and the plants they pollinate. Alternatively, due to their asymmetrical structure, pollination networks may be relatively robust to fragmentation. Despite the potential importance of independent effects of habitat fragmentation, its effects on pollination remain largely untested. We postulate that variation across studies in the effects of fragmentation owes much to artifacts of the sampling regimes adopted, particularly (1) incorrectly separating fragmentation from habitat loss, and (2) mis-matches in spatial scale between landscapes studied and the ecological processes of interest. The field of landscape pollination ecology could be greatly advanced through the consideration and quantification of the matrix, landscape functional connectivity, and pollinator movement behaviour in response to these elements. Studies designed to disentangle the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation are essential for gaining insight into landscape-mediated pollination declines, implementing effective conservation measures, and optimizing ecosystem services in complex landscapes.

AB P>With rapidly increasing rates of contemporary extinction, predicting extinction vulnerability and identifying how multiple stressors drive non-random species loss have become key challenges in ecology. These assessments are crucial for avoiding the loss of key functional groups that sustain ecosystem processes and services. We developed a novel predictive framework of species extinction vulnerability and applied it to coral reef fishes. Although relatively few coral reef fishes are at risk of global extinction from climate disturbances, a negative convex relationship between fish species locally vulnerable to climate change vs. fisheries exploitation indicates that the entire community is vulnerable on the many reefs where both stressors co-occur. Fishes involved in maintaining key ecosystem functions are more at risk from fishing than climate disturbances. This finding is encouraging as local and regional commitment to fisheries management action can maintain reef ecosystem functions pending progress towards the more complex global problem of stabilizing the climate.

AB The coexistence of woody and grassy plants in savannas has often been attributed to a rooting-niche separation (two-layer hypothesis). Water was assumed to be the limiting resource for both growth forms and grasses were assumed to extract water from the upper soil layer and trees and bushes from the lower layers. Woody plant encroachment (i.e. an increase in density of woody plants often unpalatable to domestic livestock) is a serious problem in many savannas and is believed to be the result of overgrazing in 'two-layer systems'. Recent research has questioned the universality of both the two-layer hypothesis and the hypothesis that overgrazing is the cause of woody plant encroachment.
   We present an alternative hypothesis explaining both tree-grass coexistence and woody plant encroachment in and savannas. We propose that woody plant encroachment is part of a cyclical succession between open savanna and woody dominance and is driven by two factors: rainfall that is highly variable in space and time, and inter-tree competition. In this case, savanna landscapes are composed of many patches (a few hectares in size) in different states of transition between grassy and woody dominance, i.e. we hypothesize that and savannas are patch-dynamic systems. We summarize patterns of tree distribution observed in an arid savanna in Namibia and show that these patterns are in agreement with the patch-dynamic savanna hypothesis. We discuss the applicability of this hypothesis to fire-dominated savannas, in which rainfall variability is low and fire drives spatial heterogeneity.
   We conclude that field studies are more likely to contribute to a general understanding of tree-grass coexistence and woody plant encroachment if they consider both primary (rain and nutrients) and secondary (fire and grazing) determinants of patch properties across different savannas.

AB Wetlands perform many essential ecosystem services-carbon storage, flood control, maintenance of biodiversity, fish production, and aquifer recharge, among others-services that have increasingly important global consequences. Like biodiversity hotspots and frontier forests, the world's largest wetlands are now mapped and described by all international team of scientists, highlighting their conservation importance at the global scale. We explore current understanding of some ecosystem services wetlands provide. We selected four of these wetlands (the largest peatland, West Siberian Lowland; the largest floodplain, Amazon River Basin; the least-known wetland, Congo River Basin; and the most heavily developed wetland, Mississippi River Basin), and we illustrate their diversity, emphasizing values and lessons for thinking big in terms of conservation goals. Recognizing the global significance of these wetlands is an important first step toward forging global conservation solutions. Each of the world's largest wetlands requires a basinwide sustainable management strategy built oil new institutional frameworks-at international, national, and regional levels-to ensure provision of their vital services.

AB 1 A total of 35 transition and elasticity matrices for the rare iteroparous herb Gentiana pneumonanthe was analysed for temporal and spatial variation. The data used were collected annually from 10 sites in six different populations on up to seven occasions in the period 1987-93.
   2 In general, temporal variation was higher in transition matrices than in elasticities, while between-site variation was high for both transition and elasticity matrices.
   3 The relative contributions of three life-history transitions, progression (or growth, G), recruitment from seed (fecundity, F) and survival (retrogression plus stasis, L) to the finite rate of increase, lambda, were also highly variable, between years within as well as between sites. The observed variation is very large in comparison with that previously observed either between or within other iteroparous herbs from open habitats, even showing some overlap with demographic patterns normally characteristic of woody plants.
   4 A G-L-F ordination shows a long, narrow band across the entire diagram from matrices with a low elasticity for L and high elasticities for G and F at one end to matrices which have an elasticity of 1.00 for L on the other.
   5 Correlations between the G-, L- and F-elasticities, lambda, and the vegetation cover suggest that the band in the ordination diagram represents a successional pathway in wet heathlands from invasive to regressive populations. Elasticity matrices from regularly mown hay meadows are characteristic of stable populations, but represent senile, regressive populations after mowing has ceased.
   6 Relationships between lambda and the elasticities of G, L and F show that in matrices of stable or declining populations (lambda less than or equal to 1) survival is most important. In growing populations (lambda > 1) the contribution of progression and fecundity becomes larger,
   7 Given their relatively large temporal and spatial variation, elasticities are useful in nature conservation and management only if the corresponding value of lambda is taken into account.
   8 Significant positive correlations between transition probabilities of different life stages were observed. This phenomenon may increase the risk of extinction by environmental stochasticity.

AB Numerous techniques have been proposed to estimate carnivore abundance and density, but few have been validated against populations of known size. We used a density estimate established by intensive monitoring of a population of radiotagged leopards (Panthera pardus) with a detection probability of 1.0 to evaluate efficacy of track counts and camera-trap surveys as population estimators. We calculated densities from track counts using 2 methods and compared performance of 10 methods for calculating the effectively sampled area for camera-trapping data. Compared to our reference density (7.33 +/- 60.44 leopards/100 km(2)), camera-trapping generally produced more accurate but less precise estimates than did track counts. The most accurate result (6.97 +/- 61.88 leopards/ 100 km(2)) came from camera-trap data with a sampled area buffered by a boundary strip representing the mean maximum distance moved by leopards outside the survey area (MMDMOSA) established by telemetry. However, contrary to recent suggestions, the traditional method of using half the mean maximum distance moved from photographic recaptures did not result in gross overestimates of population density (6.56 +/- 61.92 leopards/100 km(2)) but rather displayed the next best performance after MMDMOSA. The only track-count method comparable to reference density employed a capture-recapture framework applied to data when individuals were identified from their tracks (6.45 +/- 61.43 leopards/ 100 km(2)) but the underlying assumptions of this technique limit more widespread application. Our results demonstrate that if applied correctly, camera-trap surveys represent the best balance of rigor and cost-effectiveness for estimating abundance and density of cryptic carnivore species that can be identified individually.

AB Connectivity among marine populations is critical for persistence of metapopulations, coping with climate change, and determining the geographic distribution of species. The influence of pelagic larval duration (PLD) on connectivity has been studied extensively, but relatively little is known about the influence of other biological parameters, such as the survival and behavior of larvae, and the fecundity of adults, on population connectivity. Furthermore, the interaction between the seascape (habitat structure and currents) and these biological parameters is unclear. We explore these interactions using a biophysical model of larval dispersal across the Indo-Pacific. We describe an approach that quantifies geographic patterns of connectivity from demographically relevant to evolutionarily significant levels across a range of species. We predict that at least 95% of larval settlement occurs within 155 km of the source population and within 13 days irrespective of the species' life history, yet long-distant connections remain likely. Self-recruitment is primarily driven by the local oceanography, larval mortality, and the larval precompetency period, whereas broad-scale connectivity is strongly influenced by reproductive output (abundance and fecundity of adults) and the length of PLD. The networks we have created are geographically explicit models of marine connectivity that define dispersal corridors, barriers, and the emergent structure of marine populations. These models provide hypotheses for empirical testing.

AB Atmospheric CO2 has more than doubled since the last glacial maximum (LGM) and could double again within this century, largely due to anthropogenic activity. It has been suggested that low [CO2] contributed to reduced tree cover in savanna and grassland biomes at LGM, and that increasing [CO2] over the last century promoted increases in woody plants in these ecosystems over the past few decades. Despite the implications of this idea for understanding global carbon cycle dynamics and key global role of the savanna biome, there are still very few experimental studies quantifying the effects of CO2 on tree growth and demography in savannas and grasslands. In this paper we present photosynthetic, growth and carbon allocation responses of African savanna trees (Acacia karroo and Acacia nilotica) and a C-4 grass, Themeda triandra, exposed to a gradient of CO2 concentrations from 180 (typical of LGM) to 1000 mu mol mol-1 in open-top chambers in a glasshouse as a first empirical test of this idea. Photosynthesis, total stem length, total stem diameter, shoot dry weight and root dry weight of the acacias increased significantly across the CO2 gradient, saturating at higher CO2 concentrations. After clipping to simulate fire, plants showed an even greater response in total stem length, total stem diameter and shoot dry weight, signalling the importance of re-sprouting following disturbances such as fire or herbivory in savanna systems. Root starch (per unit root mass and total root starch per plant) increased steeply along the CO2 gradient, explaining the re-sprouting response. In contrast to the strong response of tree seedlings to the CO2 gradient, grass productivity showed little variation, even at low CO2 concentrations. These results suggest that CO2 has significant direct effects on tree recruitment in grassy ecosystems, influencing the ability of trees to recover from fire damage and herbivory. Fire and herbivore regimes that were effective in controlling tree increases in grassy ecosystems could thus be much less effective in a CO2-rich world, but field-based tests are needed to confirm this suggestion.

AB Understanding the pattern of connectivity among populations is crucial for the development of realistic and spatially explicit population models in marine systems. Here we analysed variation at eight microsatellite loci to assess the genetic structure and to infer patterns of larval dispersal for a brooding coral, Seriatopora hystrix, at an isolated system of reefs in northern Western Australia. Spatial autocorrelation analyses show that populations are locally subdivided, and that the majority of larvae recruit to within 100 m of their natal colony. Further, a combination of F- and R- statistics showed significant differentiation at larger spatial scales (2-60 km) between sites, and this pattern was clearly not associated with distance. However, Bayesian analysis demonstrated that recruitment has been supplemented by less frequent but recent input of larvae from outside the local area; 2-6% of colonies were excluded from the site at which they were sampled. Individual assignments of these migrants to the most likely populations suggest that the majority of migrants were produced at the only site that was not decimated by a recent and catastrophic coral bleaching event. Furthermore, the only site that recovered to prebleaching levels received most of these immigrants. We conclude that the genetic structure of this brooding coral reflects its highly opportunistic life history, in which prolific, philopatric recruitment is occasionally supplemented by exogenously produced larvae.

AB 1. The impact of dense stands of the alien invasive species Acacia saligna (Labill) Wendl. on the guild structure of indigenous fynbos vegetation was investigated at three sites on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Two Acacia stands of either recent (1-2 fire cycles) or longer (> 2 fire cycles) origin were compared with neighbouring uninvaded vegetation.
   2. At one site fynbos recruitment was monitored following complete removal of vegetation in the three different stands in order to assess the restoration potential of invaded vegetation.
   3. Fynbos species richness, cover and frequency all declined through each invasion stage in the standing vegetation. Guild structure also changed: species with vertebrate-dispersed seeds were relatively more frequent in long-invaded stands and at two of the three sites long-invaded stands had relatively more tall shrubs and fewer shrubs with leptophyllous (ericoid) leaves compared to fynbos. Serotinous shrubs were virtually absent in long-invaded stands.
   4. Richness per plot of species recruited by seedlings was highest in fynbos and declined both with stage of invasion and time after clearing. However, the total stand species richness was nearly as high in recently invaded as in uninvaded fynbos.
   5. Ephemeral forbs constituted the majority of seedlings in all stands, but after two years they remained the most important growth form in terms of density and cover only in the long-invaded stand.
   6. At 18 months after clearing, indigenous canopy cover was about 50% in all stands, but only in uninvaded fynbos did this continue to increase over the second summer: After two years, resprouters formed about half the canopy cover in fynbos and recently invaded stands, but were insignificant in the long-invaded stand.
   7. After clearing, many species recruiting in the long-invaded stand were not present in the standing vegetation, indicating that persistent seed banks exist.
   8. As representatives of all the major fynbos growth forms were recruited into the long-invaded stand after clearing, albeit at a low density, such stands could revert to vegetation resembling fynbos in structure. However, in order to speed up the restoration process and to improve the probability of a fully functioning ecosystem being established, guilds which have been eliminated, such as serotinous Proteaceae, should be reintroduced.

AB The extent to which dormancy in large freshwater branchiopods is controlled endogenously (diapause) or exogenously (quiescence) is not always clear. It is assumed that both processes occur even within the same brood. Based on the effectiveness of common diapause-deactivating processes such as desiccation, hibernation, and resting, it can be stated that diapause is not a general process controlling responsiveness of large freshwater branchiopod eggs. Only in limited cases unequivocal evidence for the positive influence of these treatments is found.
   With few exceptions, hatching of activated cysts is effected by specific conditions that may even differ among conspecific populations. Generally, each species (or even population) has a specific temperature range or regime for optimal hatching performance. In a suitable thermal environment with sufficient light and oxygen, hatching is invariably invoked by a low osmotic medium.
   The erratic hatching pattern in most species is thought to be an adaptation to the variable temporary habitat. Hatching is generally spread over several days or even weeks, but the highest peak usually occurs on the first or second day of hatching. Low hatching percentages were found only in subtropical/desert species and may be a reflection of the low chances for successful reproduction. Generation carry-over of propagules in the egg bank by dormancy, and hatching at low conductivity, are, together with obligate oviparity and absence of an asexual life cycle phase, thought to be highly adaptive to the temporary environment. This enabled large branchiopods to survive since the Upper Cambrian.

AB Growing a resilient landscape depends heavily on finding an appropriate match between the scales of demands on ecosystems by human societies and the scales at which ecosystems are capable of meeting these demands. While the dynamics of environmental change and ecosystem service provision form the basis of many landscape ecology studies, enhancing landscape resilience is, in many ways, a problem of establishing relevant institutions that act at appropriate scales to modify and moderate demand for ecosystem services and the resulting exploitation of ecosystems. It is also of central importance for landscape sustainability that institutions are flexible enough to adapt to changes in the external environment. The model provided by natural ecosystems suggests that it is only by encouraging and testing a diversity of approaches that we will be able to build landscapes that are resilient to future change. We advocate an approach to landscape planning that involves growing learning institutions on the one hand, and on the other, developing solutions to current problems through deliberate experimentation coupled with social learning processes.

AB Intensification of fires and grazing by large herbivores has caused population declines in small vertebrates in many ecosystems worldwide. Impacts are rarely direct, and usually appear driven via indirect pathways, such as changes to predator-prey dynamics. Fire events and grazing may improve habitat and/or hunting success for the predators of small mammals, however, such impacts have not been documented. To test for such an interaction, we investigated fine-scale habitat selection by feral cats in relation to fire, grazing and small-mammal abundance. Our study was conducted in northwestern Australia, where small mammal populations are sensitive to changes in fire and grazing management. We deployed GPS collars on 32 cats in landscapes with contrasting fire and grazing treatments. Fine-scale habitat selection was determined using discrete choice modelling of cat movements. We found that cats selected areas with open grass cover, including heavily-grazed areas. They strongly selected for areas recently burnt by intense fires, but only in habitats that typically support high abundance of small mammals. Intense fires and grazing by introduced herbivores created conditions that are favoured by cats, probably because their hunting success is improved. This mechanism could explain why, in northern Australia, impacts of feral cats on small mammals might have increased. Our results suggest the impact of feral cats could be reduced in most ecosystems by maximising grass cover, minimising the incidence of intense fires, and reducing grazing by large herbivores.

AB Areas of endemism are central to cladistic biogeography. The concept has been much debated in the past, and from this has emerged the generally accepted definition as an area to which at least two species are endemic. Protocols for locating areas of endemism have been neglected, and to date no attempt has been made to develop optimality criteria against which to evaluate competing hypotheses of areas of endemism. Here various protocols for finding areas of endemism are evaluated-protocols based on both phenetic and parsimony analyses, on both unweighted data and data weighted by various criteria. The optimality criteria used to compare the performance of the methods include the number of species included in the areas of endemism, the number of areas delimited, and the degree of distributional congruency of the species restricted to each area of endemism. These methods are applied to the African Restionaceae in the Cape Floristic Region. Parsimony methods using weighted data are shown to perform best on the combination of all three optimality criteria. By varying the weighting parameters the size of the areas of endemism can be varied. This provides a very useful tool for locating areas of endemism that satisfy prespecified scale criteria.

AB The plant diversity of the Cape Floristic Region is regarded as being exceptional in an ecological and evolutionary context. The region supports about double the number of species predicted by models based on water-energy variables for regional floras globally. However, contemporary diversity patterns are profoundly influenced by evolutionary processes contingent upon idiosyncrasies of history and geography. The relatively recent appearance of dated molecular phylogenies, and their optimization in relation to habitat and geography, has provided hitherto unsurpassed opportunities to generate knowledge about the evolution of the Cape flora. Almost all studies invoke climatic deterioration during the Mio-Pliocene as the major trigger of radiations and subsequent speciation of Cape clades. while some do show the importance of edaphic heterogeneity for clade radiation, the evolution of this heterogeneity is not considered. Here, we review the literature on the late Cenozoic geomorphic evolution of the Cape in order to assess the extent to which the changing nature of scenery and soils could act as a stimulus for plant diversification. Despite dating uncertainties associated with both the phylogenetic and geomorphic data, it appears that moderate uplift in the early and late Miocene, which significantly increased the topo-edaphic heterogeneity of the Cape was an important driver of plant diversification. In particular, the massive increase in heterogeneity after the late Miocene event probably acted in synergy with rapid climatic deterioration, to produce the extraordinarily rapid diversification recorded for some Cape clades at that time. A comparison of the plant diversity and palaeoenvironmetal patterns of mediterranean-climate regions provide insights regarding the "remarkable environmental conditions" of the Cape that have generated the high diversification and low extinction rates necessary to produce such a rich flora. These conditions are a gradual increase in topo-edaphic heterogeneity and relative climatic stability during the late Cenozoic. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Measurements are presented of ambient nanoparticle distributions (2.7 to 10 nm diameter) in regions of high biogenic emissions encountered during the First Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE 1), November 15 to December 14, 1995. Large numbers of newly formed nanoparticles were observed directly downwind of penguin colonies on Macquarie Island(54.5 degrees S, 159.0 degrees W). In these regions, nanoparticle concentrations were also correlated with sulfuric acid (H2SO4(g)) gas concentrations. The measurements show that biogenic species, possibly ammonia (NH3), either by itself or with H2SO4, nucleated to form new particles at rates much higher than bimolecular H2SO4/H2O nucleation. Nanoparticle distributions evolved as air was advected away from the island showing clear evidence of growth of the newly formed particles. Observed growth rates were in the range of 2 to 5 nm h(-1) and were about a factor of 4 to 17 limes higher than the growth by condensing H2SO4(g) and associated water. The cause for fast growth of the newly formed particles is unknown.

AB Hydrodynamic forces generated by breaking waves have been proposed to act as one of the primary physical mechanisms constraining the sizes to which wave-swept intertidal plants can grow. Plants inhabiting intertidal areas are generally small relative to subtidal and terrestrial plants, and within a species, plants on wave-exposed shores are usually smaller than those at wave-protected sites. However, although these relationships have been well documented, there have been no manipulative field experiments demonstrating that wave forces are directly responsible for limiting plant sizes.
   In this study, I examined the effects of wave forces on plant sizes in the field by reciprocally transplanting Fucus gardneri (rockweed) individuals between wave-exposed and wave-protected intertidal sites at Fogarty Creek Point, Oregon. Mean sizes of wave-exposed plants transplanted to protected sites increased significantly relative to exposed control transplants. Mean sizes of wave-protected plants transplanted to exposed sites decreased significantly relative to protected control transplants.
   These data support but modify an accompanying mathematical model that predicts size-dependent survivorship of Fucus under conditions of high and low wave exposure. This model incorporates the trade-off between higher reproductive capacity and lower probability of survival at larger plant sizes. ''Optimal'' plant sizes predicted by the model closely match the mean observed sizes of plants collected from exposed and protected locations. However, the match between observed and predicted plant sizes occurred not via differential survivorship, but by direct size modification resulting from plant tattering.

AB Mapping savanna tree species is of broad interest for savanna ecology and rural resource inventory. We investigated the utility of (i) the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) hyperspectral data, and WorldView-2 and Quickbird multispectral spectral data and (ii) a combined spectral + tree height dataset (derived from the CAO LiDAR system) for mapping seven common savanna tree species or genera in the Sabi Sands Reserve and communal lands adjacent to Kruger National Park, South Africa. We convolved the 72 spectral bands of the CAO imagery to eight and four multispectral channels available in the WorldView-2 and Quickbird satellite sensors, respectively. A combination of the simulated WorldView-2 data and LiDAR tree height imagery was also assessed for species classification. First, the simulated WorldView-2 imagery provided a higher classification accuracy (77% +/- 3.1 (mean +/- standard deviation)) when compared to the simulated Quickbird (65% +/- 1.9) and CAO (65% +/- 1.2) data. Secondly, the combined spectral + height dataset provided a slightly higher overall classification accuracy (79% +/- 1.8) when compared to the WorldView-2 spectral only dataset. The difference was however, statistically significant (p<0.001; one-way analysis of variance for 30 bootstrapped replicates (n = 100) of the independent validation dataset). Higher classification accuracies were observed for trees with large crowns such as S. birrea, S. africana and A. nigrescens as compared to trees with small crowns. Species composition and diversity maps of trees with large crowns were consistent with established knowledge in the area. For example, the results showed higher tree diversity (number of different species per ha) in the Sabi Sands game reserve than in the communal areas. This study highlights the feasibility of remote sensing of tree species at the landscape scale in African savannas and the potential applicability of WorldView-2 sensor in mapping savanna tree species with a large crown.

AB Many coastal dune ecosystems in Portugal are invaded by the leguminous tree Acacia longifolia (Andrews) Willd. This exotic species was first introduced over one hundred years ago in an effort to mitigate dune erosion and loss of coastal landscapes. However, since then A. longifolia has spread to new areas, displacing the native vegetation. These invaded ecosystems contrast with the native dune ecosystems that are typically dominated by herb and shrub communities. This study characterizes belowground changes to the native environment as a result of recent (<10 y) and long-term invasion (>20 y) by A. longifolia by analyzing a range of chemical and microbial parameters. Both invaded areas accumulated higher litter densities with greater N contents and lower C/N ratios than the native areas, which corresponded to lower C/N ratio and to higher potential rates of nitrification in the invaded soils. Long-term occupation by A. longifolia has significantly altered the soil properties with increased levels of organic C, total N and exchangeable cations resulting in higher microbial biomass, basal respiration, and p-glucosaminidase activity. However, basal respiration and microbial biomass were significantly higher within recent invasion sites when calculated relative to soil organic C. The results from this study show that invasions by A. longifolia have altered the original native ecosystem processes and that the impacts are more pronounced within long-term invaded sites. A positive feedback mechanism is apparent for A. longifolia invading these Mediterranean dunes, which can make the restoration of native plant communities increasingly difficult with time elapsed since invasion.

AB Despite impressive efforts at clearing stands of invasive Australian Acacia species in South Africa, insufficient attention has been given to understanding the role of seed banks in the invasiveness and long-term persistence of populations. We review information on seeds of these species, considering seed production, seed rain, and the dynamics of seeds in three layers: leaf litter, and upper and lower seed banks in the soil. Many factors affect the accumulation and susceptibility to destruction of seed banks and thus the opportunities for intervention to reduce seed numbers for each of these components. Reduction of seed banks is crucial for the overall success of the multi-million dollar management initiatives against these species. Classical biological control of buds, flower and young pods has reduced the seed production of many Australian acacias in South Africa. Fire can be applied to reduce seed numbers in the leaf litter and upper seed bank in some cases, although there are serious problems associated with high fire intensities in dense acacia stands. Other options, e.g. soil inversion and solarisation, exist to exercise limited reduction of seed numbers in some situations. There is little prospect of meaningful reduction of seed numbers in the lower seed bank. Preventing the accumulation of seed banks by limiting seed production through biological control is by far the most effective means, and in almost all cases the only practical means, of reducing seed numbers. This must be an integral part of management strategies. Several invasive Australian acacias are already under effective biological control, and further work to identify additional potential agents for all the currently invasive species and potentially invasive alien species is the top priority for improving the efficiency of management programmes.

AB We investigated the influence of the exotic nitrogen-fixing black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) on nitrogen cycling in a pitch pine (Pinus rigida) - scrub oak (Quercus ilicifolia, Q. prinoides) ecosystem. Within paired pine-oak and adjacent black locust stands that were the result of a 20-35 year-old invasion, we evaluated soil nutrient contents, soil nitrogen transformation rates, and annual litterfall biomass and nitrogen concentrations. In the A horizon, black locust soils had 1.3-3.2 times greater nitrogen concentration relative to soils within pine-oak stands. Black locust soils also had elevated levels of P and Ca, net nitrification rates and total net N-mineralization rates. Net nitrification rates were 25-120 times greater in black locust than in pine-oak stands. Elevated net N-mineralization rates in black locust stands were associated with an abundance of high nitrogen, low lignin leaf litter, with 86 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in leaf litter returned compared with 19 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in pine-oak stands. This difference resulted from a two-fold greater litterfall mass combined with increased litter nitrogen concentration in black locust stands (1.1% and 2.6% N for scrub oak and black locust litter, respectively). Thus, black locust supplements soil nitrogen pools, increases nitrogen return in litterfall, and enhances soil nitrogen mineralization rates when it invades nutrient poor, pine-oak ecosystems.

AB Seabirds are chemical and physical engineers that are capable of transforming terrestrial vegetation by altering edaphic conditions, generating physical disturbance, and affecting seed dispersal. Substantial changes in seabird populations are occurring worldwide and are likely to have important consequences for plant community composition on islands and coastal areas. This review focuses on the impact of seabirds on plant biomass, species richness and community composition. A total of 57 publications (42 studies) were selected for review. Of the 42 studies represented in the publications, 55% were descriptive. Most studies took place in Australia, New Zealand, the British Isles, Japan, North America, and sub-Antarctic islands. A few studies showed that aboveground plant biomass in seabird colonies increased with sufficient rainfall and moderate temperatures. The majority of studies on plant species richness showed a decrease in seabird colonies compared to areas unaffected by birds. However, species richness was higher in areas of intermediate seabird disturbance, compared to undisturbed areas. Moreover, the effects of seabirds on species richness varied with respect to island size. Most studies of plant community composition indicated that annuals, ''ruderals", and cosmopolitan species increased in abundance in seabird colonies. Changes in plant communities in seabird colonies appear to result mainly from altered soil nutrient concentrations and pH, increased physical disturbance, and seed dispersal by seabirds and humans. However, few studies have rigorously studied the relative importance of these alterations. Both the direction and magnitude of seabird effects are modified by: (1) density of birds, (2) temperature and precipitation, and (3) proximity to human habitation. A reduction in seabird populations is likely to have negative consequences for native plant species that rely on seabird disturbance for their persistence. However, seed dispersal by nesting seabirds, especially gulls, frequently leads to invasion by cosmopolitan plant species and declines of native species. Further studies that incorporate both quantitative sampling and manipulative experiments would go a long way in improving our understanding of how seabirds affect plant communities.

AB Shrub expansion is a global phenomenon that is occurring on savannas, rangelands, and grasslands. In addition, this is an increasingly documented occurrence in the Arctic. Numerous recent studies have strived to pinpoint the drivers of this phenomenon, quantify the changes, and understand their implications for regional and global land use, disturbance regimes, and nutrient cycling. Inquiry into these topics has been facilitated by recent technological developments in satellite remote sensing, aerial photograph analysis, and computer simulation modeling. We provide a new review that accounts for more recent studies in these regions, Arctic shrub expansion, and technological and analytical developments. This four-part discussion focuses on observed patterns of shrub expansion in three rangeland types (desert grasslands, mesic grasslands, savannas) and the Arctic tundra, the primary causes of this expansion, critical comparisons and contrasts between these land types, and recommendations for future avenues of research. These new avenues can inform the development of future land management policies, as well as ongoing investigations to understand and mitigate the effects of climate change.

AB As the process of marine-protected-area design and implementation evolves, the incorporation of new tools will advance our ability to create and maintain effective protected areas. We reviewed characteristics and approaches that contribute to successful global marine conservation efforts. One successful characteristic emphasized in most case studies is The importance of incorporating stakeholders at all phases of the process. Clearly defined goals; and objectives at all stages of the design process are important for improved communication and standardized expectations of stakeholder groups. The inclusion of available science to guide the size and design of marine protected areas and to guide clear monitoring strategies Mat assess success at scientific, social, and economic levels is also an important tool in the process. Common shortcoming's hi marine conservation planning strategies include government instability and resultant limitations to monitoring and enforcement, particularly in developing nations. Transferring knowledge to local community members has also presented challenges in areas where in situ training, local capacity, and existing infrastructure are sparse. Inaccessible, unavailable, or outdated science is often a limitation to conservation projects in developed and developing nations. To develop and maintain successful marine protected areas, it is necessary to acknowledge that each case is unique, to apply tools and lessons learned from other marine protected areas, and to maintain flexibility to adjust to the individual circumstances of the case at hand.

AB The quantification of coastal connectivity is important for a wide range of real-world applications ranging from assessment of pollutant risk to nearshore fisheries management. For these purposes, coastal connectivity can be defined as the probability that water parcels from one location have advected to another site over a given time interval. Here we demonstrate how to quantify connectivity using Lagrangian probability-density functions (PDFs) based on numerical solutions of the coastal circulation of the Southern California Bight (SCB). Ensemble mean dispersal patterns from a single release site show strong dependencies on particle-release location, season, and year, reflecting annual and interannual circulation patterns in the SCB. Mean connectivity patterns are heterogeneous for the advection time of 30 days or less, due to local circulation patterns, and they become more homogeneous for longer advection times. However, connectivity patterns for a single realization are highly variable because of intrinsic eddy-driven transport and synoptic wind-forcing variability. In the long term, mainland sites are good sources while both Northern and Southern Channel Islands are poor sources, although they receive substantial fluxes of water parcels from the mainland. The predicted connectivity gives useful information to ecological and other applications for the SCB (e. g., designing marine protected areas and predicting the impact of a pollution event) and demonstrates how high-resolution numerical solutions of coastal ocean circulations can be used to quantify nearshore connectivity.

AB Parental food deliveries are generally assumed to promote offspring fitness in altricial birds, mainly because mass at. edging often predicts recruitment as breeding adults. We studied how such provisioning influences recruitment in house sparrows, Passer domesticus, through both a traditional two-step indirect analysis ( via. edging mass) and a single direct analysis. In our study, total parental deliveries predicted neither. edging mass nor recruitment. Instead, delivery of the largest food items ('e-prey') predicted both. Offspring recruitment was determined only by personal mass, but from a parental perspective, the number of recruits per brood hinged principally on two factors, brood size and mean nestling mass at. edging. As in other species, recruitment probability declined across the breeding season, even though deliveries of the largest food items increased. Within the natural range of provisioning that parents achieved, the function relating e-prey and recruitment appeared to be accelerating, indicating that parents could rapidly enhance offspring success if bringing more of those items were possible. The failure of adults to do so suggests that the associated foraging costs are likely to be prohibitive, illustrating what has been called a 'food ESS' for parental care.

AB Background: Biofloc technology (BFT), a rearing method with little or no water exchange, is gaining popularity in aquaculture. In the water column, such systems develop conglomerates of microbes, algae and protozoa, together with detritus and dead organic particles. The intensive microbial community presents in these systems can be used as a pond water quality treatment system, and the microbial protein can serve as a feed additive. The current problem with BFT is the difficulty of controlling its bacterial community composition for both optimal water quality and optimal shrimp health. The main objective of the present study was to investigate microbial diversity of samples obtained from different culture environments (Biofloc technology and clear seawater) as well as from the intestines of shrimp reared in both environments through high-throughput sequencing technology.
   Results: Analyses of the bacterial community identified in water from BFT and "clear seawater" (CW) systems (control) containing the shrimp Litopenaeus stylirostris revealed large differences in the frequency distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Four out of the five most dominant bacterial communities were different in both culture methods. Bacteria found in great abundance in BFT have two principal characteristics: the need for an organic substrate or nitrogen sources to grow and the capacity to attach to surfaces and co-aggregate. A correlation was found between bacteria groups and physicochemical and biological parameters measured in rearing tanks. Moreover, rearing-water bacterial communities influenced the microbiota of shrimp. Indeed, the biofloc environment modified the shrimp intestine microbiota, as the low level (27 %) of similarity between intestinal bacterial communities from the two treatments.
   Conclusion: This study provides the first information describing the complex biofloc microbial community, which can help to understand the environment-microbiota-host relationship in this rearing system.

AB Vegetation changes, particularly those involving transitions between tree- and grass-dominated covers, often modify evaporative water losses as a result of plant-mediated shifts in moisture access and demand. Massive afforestation of native grasslands, particularly important in the Southern Hemisphere, may have strong yet poorly quantified effects on the hydrological cycle. We explored water use patterns in Eucalyptus grandis plantations and the native humid grasslands that they replace in Central Argentina. In order to uncover the interactive effects that land cover type, soil texture and climate variability may have on evaporative water losses and water use efficiency, we estimated daily evapotranspiration (ET) in 117 tree plantations and grasslands plots across a soil textural gradient (clay-textured Vertisols to sandy-textured Entisols) using radiometric information from seven Landsat scenes, existing timber productions records, and C-13 measurements in tree stems. Tree plantations had cooler surface temperatures (-5 degrees C on average) and evaporated more water (+80% on average) than grasslands at all times and across all sites. Absolute ET differences between grasslands and plantations ranged from similar to 0.6 to 2 mm day(-1) and annual up-scaling suggested values of similar to 630 and similar to 1150 mm yr(-1) for each vegetation type, respectively. The temporal variability of ET was significantly lower in plantations compared with grasslands (coefficient of variation 36% vs. 49%). Daily ET increased as the water balance became more positive (accumulated balance for previous 18 days) with a saturation response in grassland vs. a continuous linear increase in plantations, suggesting lower ecophysiological limits to water loss in tree canopies compared with the native vegetation. Plantation ET was more strongly affected by soil texture than grassland ET and peaked in coarse textured sites followed by medium and fine textured sites. Timber productivity as well as C-13 concentration in stems peaked in medium textured sites, indicating lower water use efficiency on extreme textures and suggesting that water limitation was not responsible for productivity declines towards finer and coarser soils. Our study highlighted the key role that vegetation type plays on evapotranspiration and, therefore, in the hydrological cycle. Considering that tree plantations may continue their expansion over grasslands, problematic changes in water management and, perhaps, in local climate can develop from the higher evaporative water losses of tree plantations.

AB Examination of phenological patterns of tropical trees at different temporal and spatial scales can elucidate biotic and abiotic factors that correlate with fruiting, flowering and/or leaf set patterns. In this study, 3793 trees from 104 species in Kibale National Park, Uganda were monitored. The trees were selected from two sites (Kanyawara and Ngogo) separated by 10 km. Trees were monitored monthly to document community-wide and population-level fruiting and flowering patterns for a maximum of 76 mo. Analysis of two sites over a number of years permitted examination of generalities of patterns found on smaller spatial and temporal scales. Spectral analysis indicated that community-level flowering and fruiting at Kanyawara exhibited regular annual peaks, although the flowering peaks were of shorter duration. At Ngogo, community-level flowering also displayed regular annual peaks, but fruiting had an irregular pattern with no distinct peaks. The abundance of fruiting trees at Kanyawara was negatively related to the minimum temperature in the previous season (3-7 mo prior). Since fruiting tended to peak when the first wet season of the year was ending and the dry season was beginning, this suggests that the minimum temperature in the previous dry season is important in determining how many individuals fruit. Flowering at Kanyawara peaked immediately after the maximum annual period of high irradiance. Within-species synchronization was evident in the flowering for all species examined at Ngogo and for 64% of those at Kanyawara. Fruiting was synchronous within species for 64% of the species at both sites. Despite this general community-level synchronization, the months of peak fruiting and flowering for some species varied markedly among years. Furthermore, for a number of species the timing of fruiting or flowering events differed between Kanyawara and Ngogo. For some species, trends that were suggested from one year of data were not supported when additional years were considered. Although these two sites are close together, share many of the same species, and experience similar climatic regimes, many phenological patterns were site-dependent.

AB Both pollination by animals and mycorrhizal symbioses with fungi are believed to have been important for the diversification of flowering plants. However, the mechanisms by which these above- and belowground mutualisms affect plant speciation and coexistence remain obscure. We provide evidence that shifts in pollination traits are important for both speciation and coexistence in a diverse group of orchids, whereas shifts in fungal partner are important for coexistence but not for speciation. Phylogenetic analyses show that recently diverged orchid species tend either to use different pollinator species or to place pollen on different body parts of the same species, consistent with the role of pollination-mode shifts in speciation. Field experiments provide support for the hypothesis that colonization of new geographical areas requires adaptation to new pollinator species, whereas co-occurring orchid species share pollinator species by placing pollen on different body parts. In contrast to pollinators, fungal partners are conserved between closely related orchid species, and orchids recruit the same fungal species even when transplanted to different areas. However, co-occurring orchid species tend to use different fungal partners, consistent with their expected role in reducing competition for nutrients. Our results demonstrate that the two dominant mutualisms in terrestrial ecosystems can play major but contrasting roles in plant community assembly and speciation.

AB 1. The concept of threshold has become important in ecology, but the nature of potential threshold responses of vegetation to grazing in rangeland ecosystems remains poorly understood. We aimed to identify ecological thresholds in vegetation changes along a grazing gradient and to examine whether threshold changes were expressed similarly. at a variety of ecological sites.
   2. To accomplish this, we surveyed the vegetation along grazing gradients at 10 ecological sites, each located at different landscape positions in Mongolia's central and southern rangelands. Evidence for a threshold in changes in floristic composition along the grazing gradient was examined by comparing linear models of the data with nonlinear models fitted using an exponential curve, an inverse curve, a piecewise regression and a sigmoid logistic curve.
   3. Three nonlinear models (piecewise, exponential and sigmoid) provided a much better fit to the data than the linear models, highlighting the presence of a discontinuity in vegetation changes along the grazing gradient. The shapes of the best-fit models and their fit to the data were generally similar across sites, indicating that the changes in floristic composition were relatively constant below a threshold level of grazing, after which the curve changed sharply.
   4. Except for two sites, the best-fit models had relatively narrow bootstrap confidence intervals (95% CI), especially around threshold points or zones where the rate of change accelerated, emphasizing that our results were robust and conclusive.
   5. Synthesis. Our study provided strong evidence for the existence of ecological thresholds in vegetation change along a grazing gradient across all ecological sites. This suggests that vegetation responses to grazing in the study areas are essentially nonlinear. The recognition that real threshold changes exist in real grazing gradients will help land managers to prevent the occurrence of undesirable states and promote the occurrence of desirable states, and will therefore permit a major step forward in the sustainable management of rangeland ecosystems.

AB 1. Moths (Lepidoptera) are the major nocturnal pollinators of flowers. However, their importance and contribution to the provision of pollination ecosystem services may have been under-appreciated. Evidence was identified that moths are important pollinators of a diverse range of plant species in diverse ecosystems across the world. 2. Moth populations are known to be undergoing significant declines in several European countries. Among the potential drivers of this decline is increasing light pollution. The known and possible effects of artificial night lighting upon moths were reviewed, and suggest how artificial night lighting might in turn affect the provision of pollination by moths. The need for studies of the effects of artificial night lighting upon whole communities of moths was highlighted. 3. An ecological network approach is one valuable method to consider the effects of artificial night lighting upon the provision of pollination by moths, as it provides useful insights into ecosystem functioning and stability, and may help elucidate the indirect effects of artificial light upon communities of moths and the plants they pollinate. 4. It was concluded that nocturnal pollination is an ecosystem process that may potentially be disrupted by increasing light pollution, although the nature of this disruption remains to be tested.

AB Explanations for documented increases in woody plant dominance in grasslands and savannas of North America include atmospheric CO2 enrichment and changes in climate, livestock grazing, and fire regimes. However, tree/shrub encroachment has also coincided with the eradication of a once widespread native herbivore, the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). We used field experiments and repeat aerial photography to demonstrate that prairie dogs, and the herbivores and granivores associated with their colonies, probably maintained grassland and savanna by preventing woody species such as Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite) from establishing or attaining dominance.
   Prosopis seed and pod disappearance was 3-99 times greater within prairie dog colonies. Ants were the primary agent of seed removal, whereas prairie dogs and associated vertebrates were the primary agents of pod removal. Survival of Prosopis seedlings protected from vertebrate herbivory was similar on and off prairie dog colonies (approximate to 60%), whereas survival of unprotected seedlings was 3 times greater off- than on-colony. On-colony, prairie dogs and associated herbivores girdled and destroyed all Prosopis saplings within 2 d of planting; survival of 1-yr-old seedlings was reduced by 50% after 3 mo of exposure to on-colony herbivores. Despite high levels of woody plant seed disappearance and seedling herbivory, on-colony ''seedling'' reserves were substantial (950 plants/ha). Thus, prairie dogs and the fauna that occur on their colonies suppressed rather than eliminated Prosopis from the colony site. Removal of prairie dogs led to rapid development of Prosopis stands. Repeat aerial photography showed that Prosopis canopy cover on a colony eradicated in 1950 (27%) increased to a level (61%) comparable to that of off-colony Prosopis stands (65%) within 23 yr.
   These data illustrate how transitions from grassland to woodland vegetation can be mediated by a rodent herbivore. They further demonstrate how purposeful or inadvertent removal of native herbivores can have unforeseen effects on plant species composition and landscape physiognomy. Investigations of environmental constraints on vegetation distribution and abundance should take into account the historical role of herbivores in shaping the present system. Inconsistencies among historic accounts of woody plant distribution and abundance in semiarid western North America may be resolved by considering population dynamics of prairie dogs. Widespread eradication of this formerly abundant rodent has eliminated a significant constraint to woody plant establishment on many semiarid grassland and savanna landscapes and has thereby facilitated transitions to shrubland and woodland states. Past land management designed to remove one perceived impediment to livestock production appears to have contributed significantly to development of another management problem that is now a major detriment to sustainable livestock production.

AB 1. Plant-pollinator interactions are affected by global change, with largely negative impacts on pollination and plant reproduction. Urban areas provide a unique and productive study system for understanding the impacts of many global change drivers on plant-pollinator interactions.
   2. We review the mechanistic pathways through which urban drivers alter plant-pollinator interactions. The literature on urban drivers of plant-pollinator interactions is small but growing and has already produced exciting insights about how population processes or pollinator behaviour interacts with landscape urban drivers to affect pollination outcomes.
   3. Habitat loss and fragmentation can change flower visitation rates and pollination success through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour or through population-level effects on pollinators. Urban environments, where impermeable surface provides an inhospitable matrix, may allow researchers to identify habitat fragments more clearly than in many other environments.
   4. Recent studies have found that non-native plants are not differently preferred by pollinators relative to native plants, therefore removing the basis for expecting pollinator-mediated competition between native and non-native plants in urban habitats. However, non-native species together with managed vegetation may have powerful effects in urban habitats via changes in community-level plant phenology and consequent changes in pollinator phenology.
   5. The current level of climate warming has not caused plants and pollinators to become detectably temporally separated, although at the same time, diversity among species' phenological responses could buffer plant-pollinator interactions from climate variation. Due to the urban warming effect, cities provide a promising system for better understanding the warming effects on plant-pollinator interactions.
   6. Environmental contaminants such as soil nitrogen and heavy metal pollution have been examined with respect to plant-pollinator interactions in small-scale, mechanistic studies. The extent to which environmental contaminants drive plant-pollinator interactions in actual urban landscapes is, however, currently unknown.
   7. Important knowledge gaps that require research attention include understanding the consequences of plant and pollinator trait filtering on plant-pollinator interactions, and expanding the literature to include underrepresented biomes and pollinator taxa.

AB P>1. There is considerable evidence for the negative impacts of habitat alteration on pollinators in highly disturbed regions of the world. However, it remains unclear whether these findings reflect a global crisis for crop pollination. Understanding the extent to which world agriculture is endangered by pollinator decline is essential if the economic valuation of nature is to be used to promote conservation.
   2. We assess the susceptibility to pollinator limitation of one of the most important tropical and subtropical fruit crops, mango Mangifera indica L., commonly planted in a region of South Africa located between two large biodiversity-rich protected natural areas. We conducted flower visitor surveys, exclusion experiments and spatial analysis of flower visitation and fruit production patterns.
   3. Our results show that both ants and flower visitors were effective pollinators of mango, the latter significantly declining (in abundance and species richness) with distance to natural habitat while ants were not affected. Neither the absence of pesticides nor the supplementation of flower visitors by using managed honeybees served to offset these negative impacts. Food-web data suggest that maintaining diversity of flower resources within farmland can help maintain pollinator communities.
   4. Moreover, models based exclusively on pollinator abundance underestimated the negative effect of distance from natural habitat on production (42% less at 500 m from natural habitat). As soil nutrient levels and water content are regularly measured and corrected in all study sites, these results suggest that pollinator diversity may also be important.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides one of the first examples of marked pollination limitation in farms surrounded by well-protected natural habitat. For mango farming to be sustainable, it is essential to limit contiguous growth of farmland and consider practices that restore the complexity of plant-pollinator networks within farms, for example through the creation and maintenance of pollinator-friendly areas. By highlighting the economic gains of adopting pollinator-friendly practices in agriculture, this work contributes to a growing body of studies that reveal that making farmland more suitable for pollinators benefits both agriculture and nature conservation.

AB We reviewed information on the demands of incubation to examine whether these could influence the optimal clutch size of birds. The results indicate that appreciable metabolic costs of incubation commonly exist, and that the incubation of enlarged clutches can impose penalties on birds. In 23 studies on 19 species, incubation metabolic rate (IMR) was not elevated above the metabolic rate of resting non-incubating birds (RMR), but contrary to the physiological predictions of King and others, IMR was greater than RMR in 15 studies on 15 species. Across species, IMR was substantially above basal metabolic rate (BMR), averaging 1.606 x BMR. Of six studies on three species performed under thermo-neutral conditions, none found IMR to be in excess of RMR. IMRs measured exclusively within the thermo-neutral zone averaged only 1.08 x BMR contrasting with the significantly higher figure of 1.72 x BMR under wider conditions. 16 of 17 studies on procellariiforms found IMR below RMR, indicating a significant difference between this and other orders. We could find no other taxonomic, or ecological factors which had clear effects on IMR. Where clutch size was adjusted experimentally during incubation, larger clutches were associated with: significantly lower percentage hatching success in 11 of 19 studies; longer incubation periods in eight of ten studies; greater loss of adult body condition in two of five studies; and higher adult energy expenditure in eight of nine studies. Given that incubation does involve metabolic costs and given that the demands of incubation increase sufficiently with clutch size to affect breeding performance, we propose that the optimal clutch size of birds may in part by shaped by the number of eggs the parents can afford to incubate.

AB The rate of biological invasions is expected to increase as the effects of climate change on biological communities become widespread. Climate change enhances habitat disturbance which facilitates the establishment of invasive species, which in turn provides opportunities for hybridization and introgression. These effects influence local biodiversity that can be tracked through genetic and genomic approaches. Metabarcoding and metagenomic approaches provide a way of monitoring some types of communities under climate change for the appearance of invasives. Introgression and hybridization can be followed by the analysis of entire genomes so that rapidly changing areas of the genome are identified and instances of genetic pollution monitored. Genomic markers enable accurate tracking of invasive species' geographic origin well beyond what was previously possible. New genomic tools are promoting fresh insights into classic questions about invading organisms under climate change, such as the role of genetic variation, local adaptation and climate pre-adaptation in successful invasions. These tools are providing managers with often more effective means to identify potential threats, improve surveillance and assess impacts on communities. We provide a framework for the application of genomic techniques within a management context and also indicate some important limitations in what can be achieved.

AB Biophysical models are being used increasingly, both as predictive tools of larval dispersal for a particular system and for general evaluation of the role of different factors in larval transport. In the results of such models, larval duration, mortality, and behavior in the water column have exhibited pronounced effects on larval dispersal of marine benthic invertebrates. The parameterization of these processes has broadly reflected values from laboratory experiments, but the accuracy of these values is unknown. The pelagic larval duration used in models should be determined by laboratory, or preferably field, studies and should incorporate environmentally dependent variability. For mortality, in situ estimates are now feasible and, likely, more accurate than the currently used values. Larval behavior can be measured in the field, by high-frequency sampling of distributional changes relative to features in the water column or by controlled larval releases in tractable systems. To successfully validate the outcomes of these models, we must either improve our techniques for measuring larval abundance at the end of larval transport immediately before settlement, or incorporate components for settlement into the models. We must also address the mismatch in sampling resolution between biological and physical processes. If used with caution, this powerful approach can significantly advance our understanding of larval transport.

AB 1. Concerns over the ecological impacts of high African elephant Loxodonta africana densities suggest that it may be necessary to control their numbers locally, although the best management approach is still widely debated. Artificial water supply is believed to be a major cause of local overabundance, and could be used as a potential tool to regulate elephant distribution and impact across landscapes, but its effect on elephants at the population scale has never been studied.
   2. We assessed how dry-season surface-water availability constrained the distribution of an entire elephant population, using aerial and waterhole census data from Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. The study was initiated in 1986, when the population was released from culling. We studied how artificial waterholes, holding water throughout the dry season, and vegetation production, estimated from a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), influenced the long-term distribution of elephant densities. We also investigated how the elephant distribution responded to changes in population density and annual rainfall, a driver of surface-water availability.
   3. Long-term dry-season elephant densities across the park tended to increase with vegetation production, and increased asymptotically with the density of artificial waterholes.
   4. Since the culling stopped, dry-season elephant densities have increased in most areas of the park, except in areas of low vegetation production and low water availability. Interannual fluctuations in elephant distribution are linked to rainfall variability through its effect on surface-water availability. During dry years elephants concentrated in areas where artificial pumping maintained surface-water availability during the dry season.
   5. During dry years elephant numbers at waterholes increased because of reduced surface-water availability, and elephants were distributed more evenly across waterholes, although active waterholes were unevenly distributed across the park.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Surface-water availability drives the distribution and abundance of elephants within Hwange National Park, and therefore appears to be at the heart of the trade-off between elephant conservation and the extent of their impact on ecosystems. Artificial manipulation of surface water is one of the tools available for the management of elephant populations and should not be overlooked when considering options for controlling elephant numbers in places where they are considered to be overabundant.

AB The ramifying effects of top predators on food webs traditionally have been studied within the framework of trophic cascades. Trophic cascades are compelling because they embody powerful indirect effects of predators on primary production. Although less studied, indirect effects of predators may occur via routes that are not exclusively trophic. We quantified how the introduction of foxes onto the Aleutian Islands transformed plant communities by reducing abundant seabird populations, thereby disrupting nutrient subsidies vectored by seabirds from sea to land. We compared soil and plant fertility, plant biomass and community composition, and stable isotopes of nitrogen in soil, plants, and other organisms on nine fox-infested and nine historically fox-free islands across the Aleutians. Additionally, we experimentally augmented nutrients on a fox-infested island to test whether differences in plant productivity and composition between fox-infested and fox-free islands could have arisen from differences in nutrient inputs between island types.
   Islands with historical fox infestations had soils low in phosphorus and nitrogen and plants low in tissue nitrogen. Soils, plants, slugs, flies, spiders, and bird droppings on these islands had low delta N-15 values indicating that these organisms obtained nitrogen from internally derived sources. In contrast, soils, plants, and higher trophic level organisms on fox-free islands had elevated delta N-15 signatures indicating that they utilized nutrients derived from the marine environment. Furthermore, soil phosphorus (but not nitrogen) and plant tissue nitrogen were higher on fox-free than fox-infested islands. Nutrient subsidized fox-free islands supported lush, high biomass plant communities dominated by graminoids. Fox-infested islands were less graminoid dominated and had higher cover and biomass of low-lying forbs and dwarf shrubs. While delta N-15 profiles of soils and plants and graminoid biomass varied with island size and distance from shore, after accounting for these effects differences between fox-infested and fox-free islands still existed. Fertilization over four years caused a 24-fold increase in graminoid biomass and a shift toward a more graminoid dominated plant community typical of fox-free islands. These results indicate that apex predators can influence plant productivity and composition through complex interaction web pathways involving both top-down forcing and bottom-up nutrient exchanges across systems.

AB Because flow in the California Current is unidirectional for months, larvae of coastal species may drift and settle downstream of their parents, potentially causing the parental population to go extinct from upstream to downstream; this is a marine equivalent of the drift paradox in streams. Unidirectional larval drift might, however, be minimized by when, where, and how organisms reproduce. We compiled data on California Current fishes (89 nearshore, 65 shelf/slope) and benthic crustaceans (35 nearshore, 15 shelf/slope) and found three unique sets of life history traits displayed by (1) shelf/slope species, (2) nearshore pelagic-spawning fishes (all from the Southern California Bight [SCB] and Baja California), and (3) all other nearshore species. Pelagic larval durations (PD) of shelf/slope species are long (similar to 136 d); offspring are pelagic winter through summer and are found at depth below the mixed layer offshore. Offspring experience northward flow in winter and southward flow in spring/summer, perhaps minimizing net alongshore drift. Adults are both long-lived and highly fecund. Nearshore species have short PDs (similar to 45 d), and offspring are pelagic during spring/summer upwelling and are found nearshore and near the bottom. Nearshore larvae may experience southwards flow during upwelling and northward flow during relaxation events, minimizing net alongshore transport. Nearshore species have shorter lives and are less fecund than shelf/slope species. Nearshore pelagic-spawning fishes (all from the SCB and Baja) have short PDs (similar to 48 d), but in contrast to other nearshore species, their larvae are pelagic from spring into fall and are found far from shore. Adults are long-lived, highly fecund, and have numerous broods per year. These life history traits may have evolved to exploit eddies and countercurrents present in the SCB and off Baja for larval retention. Each set of life history traits appears to improve chances of offspring recruiting to parental populations. The pelagic phase, rather than being dispersive, may be selected to achieve a migration between larval pelagic and adult benthic habitats.

AB The ability of miniscule larvae to control their fate and replenish populations in dynamic marine environments has been a long-running topic of debate of central importance for managing resources and understanding the ecology and evolution of life in the sea. Larvae are considered to be highly susceptible to offshore transport in productive upwelling regions, thereby increasing dispersal, limiting onshore recruitment, and reducing the intensity of community interactions. We show that 45 species of nearshore crustaceans were not transported far offshore in a recruitment-limited region characterized by strong upwelling. To the contrary, 92% of these larvae remained within 6 km from shore in high densities throughout development along two transects sampled four times during the peak upwelling season. Larvae of most species remained nearshore by remaining below a shallow Ekman layer of seaward-flowing surface waters throughout development. Larvae of other species migrated farther offshore by occurring closer to the surface early in development. Postlarvae evidently returned to nearshore adult habitats either by descending to shoreward-flowing upwelled waters or rising to the sea surface where they can be transported shoreward by wind relaxation events or internal waves. Thus wind-driven offshore transport should not limit recruitment, even in strong upwelling regions, and larvae are more likely to recruit closer to natal populations than is widely believed. This study poses a new challenge to determine the true cause and extent of recruitment limitation for a more diverse array of species along upwelling coasts, and thus to further advance our understanding of the connectivity, dynamics, and structure of coastal populations.

AB Predictions of the identities and ecological impacts of invasive alien species are critical for risk assessment, but presently we lack universal and standardized metrics that reliably predict the likelihood and degree of impact of such invaders (i.e. measurable changes in populations of affected species). This need is especially pressing for emerging and potential future invaders that have no invasion history. Such a metric would also ideally apply across diverse taxonomic and trophic groups. We derive a new metric of invader ecological impact that blends: (i) the classic Functional Response (FR; consumer per capita effect) and Numerical Response (NR; consumer population response) approaches to determining consumer impact, that is, the Total Response (TR=FRxNR), with; (ii) the Parker-Lonsdale equation' for invader impact, where Impact=RangexAbundancexEffect (per capita effect), into; (iii) a new metric, Relative Impact Potential (RIP), where RIP=FRxAbundance. The RIP metric is an invader/native ratio, where values >1 predict that invader ecological impact will occur, and increasing values above 1 indicate increasing impact. In addition, the invader/invader RIP ratio allows comparisons of the ecological impacts of different invaders. Across a diverse range of trophic and taxonomic groups, including predators, herbivores, animals and plants (22 invader/native systems with 47 individual comparisons), high-impact invaders were significantly associated with higher FRs compared to native trophic analogues. However, the RIP metric substantially improves this association, with 100% predictive power of high-impact invaders. Further, RIP scores were significantly and positively correlated with two independent ecological impact scores for invaders, allowing prediction of the degree of impact of invasive alien species with the RIP metric. Finally, invader/invader RIP scores were also successful in identifying and associating with higher impacting invasive alien species.Synthesis and applications. The Relative Impact Potential metric combines the per capita effects of invaders with their abundances, relative to trophically analogous natives, and is successful in predicting the likelihood and degree of ecological impact caused by invasive alien species. As the metric constitutes readily measurable features of individuals, populations and species across abiotic and biotic context-dependencies, even emerging and potential future invasive alien species can be assessed. The Relative Impact Potential metric can be rapidly utilized by scientists and practitioners and could inform policy and management of invasive alien species across diverse taxonomic and trophic groups.

AB Most species introductions are not expected to result in invasion, and species that are invasive in one area are frequently not invasive in others. However, cases of introduced organisms that failed to invade are reported in many instances as anecdotes or are simply ignored. In this analysis, we aimed to find common characteristics between non-invasive populations of known invasive species and evaluated how the study of failed invasions can contribute to research on biological invasions. We found intraspecific variation in invasion success and several recurring explanations for why non-native species fail to invade; these included low propagule pressure, abiotic resistance, biotic resistance, genetic constraints and mutualist release. Furthermore, we identified key research topics where ignoring failed invasions could produce misleading results; these include studies on historical factors associated with invasions, distribution models of invasive species, the effect of species traits on invasiveness, genetic effects, biotic resistance and habitat invasibility. In conclusion, we found failed invasions can provide fundamental information on the relative importance of factors determining invasions and might be a key component of several research topics. Therefore, our analysis suggests that more specific and detailed studies on invasion failures are necessary.

AB The circulation of seed among farmers is central to agrobiodiversity conservation and dynamics. Agrobiodiversity, the diversity of agricultural systems from genes to varieties and crop species, from farming methods to landscape composition, is part of humanity's cultural heritage. Whereas agrobiodiversity conservation has received much attention from researchers and policy makers over the last decades, the methods available to study the role of seed exchange networks in preserving crop biodiversity have only recently begun to be considered. In this overview, we present key concepts, methods, and challenges to better understand seed exchange networks so as to improve the chances that traditional crop varieties (landraces) will be preserved and used sustainably around the world. The available literature suggests that there is insufficient knowledge about the social, cultural, and methodological dimensions of environmental change, including how seed exchange networks will cope with changes in climates, socio-economic factors, and family structures that have supported seed exchange systems to date. Methods available to study the role of seed exchange networks in the preservation and adaptation of crop specific and genetic diversity range from meta-analysis to modelling, from participatory approaches to the development of bio-indicators, from genetic to biogeographical studies, from anthropological and ethnographic research to the use of network theory. We advocate a diversity of approaches, so as to foster the creation of robust and policy-relevant knowledge. Open challenges in the study of the role of seed exchange networks in biodiversity conservation include the development of methods to (i) enhance farmers' participation to decision-making in agro-ecosystems, (ii) integrate ex situ and in situ approaches, (iii) achieve interdisciplinary research collaboration between social and natural scientists, and (iv) use network analysis as a conceptual framework to bridge boundaries among researchers, farmers and policy makers, as well as other stakeholders.

AB Plants have often been moved across the globe with intact root systems. These roots are likely to have housed symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi and the movement of plants may have facilitated the introduction of EM fungi.
   Here, we report data compiled from a newly created database of EM fungal introductions. We estimate the magnitude of EM fungal introductions around the world and examine patterns associated with these introductions. We also use the data to develop a framework for understanding the invasion biology of EM fungi.
   At least 200 species of basidiomycete and ascomycete EM fungi have been moved from native ranges to novel habitats. The majority of recorded introductions are associated with Pinus or Eucalyptus plantations in the southern hemisphere. Most introduced species appear to be constrained from spreading in novel habitats and associate only with their introduced hosts. Aspects of life history, including host range, may influence the ability of EM species to establish or invade.
   Human-caused introductions of EM fungi are a common and global phenomenon. The mechanisms controlling EM fungi in novel habitats and potential impacts of EM fungal introductions are almost entirely unknown.

AB The effects of fishing, the duration of protection from fishing, features of the reef habitat, including benthic cover and sea urchin abundance, and the distance between reefs were examined to determine the ability of these factors to predict ecological aspects of fish communities. Population density, species richness, and rarity were estimated for 127 species of coral reef fish on 22 patch and fringing reefs along similar to 400 km of East African coastline. The reefs included five protected areas, of which three study sites were protected for more than 25 years, and four sites were protected less than 10 years. Habitat variables were often significantly associated with fish community variables in fringing reefs, but not in patch reefs. Fish diversity was positively correlated with hard coral and coralline algal cover, and negatively correlated with sea urchin and algal turf abundance. However, multiple regression analysis suggests that protection from fishing was the single strongest factor affecting fish abundance and diversity. Consequently, many of the habitat correlations were probably due to direct and indirect effects of fishing on reef ecology, where heavy fishing results in increases in sea urchin and algal turf abundance and reduces hard coral and coralline algal abundance. Protected areas had higher abundances and species richness of commercially important triggerfish, surgeonfish, and parrotfish. There was, however, no relationship between local rarity in our study sites with rarity at the level of the western Indian Ocean for three well known fish families of angelfish, butterflyfish, and damselfish. Older reserves had more and rarer species than young reserves or fished reefs; and, consequently, the maintenance of reserves older than 10 years may be needed to sustain the full local diversity of fishes.

AB The Emeryville Shellmound is a famous but now destroyed midden once located on the east shore of San Francisco Bay. Analyses of the fish remains from the stratified late Holocene deposits indicate that prehistoric peoples had substantial impacts on the sturgeon populations of the Bay. This calls into question the commonly held belief that native peoples lived in harmony with nature and has important implications for the management of modern vertebrate populations.

AB The assessment of fruit abundance is critical for studies of frugivore ecology. A variety of methods have been used to estimate habitat-wide fruit abundance. However, since the methods have not been calibrated with each other, it is difficult to compare results of different studies. Here we compare three methods used simultaneously to collect fruit abundance data in the Kibale Forest, Uganda. Estimates of fruit abundance derived from fruit traps were not correlated with estimates derived from either systematic transect sampling or estimates obtained from observing fruiting phenology of key species on a fruit trail.

AB Megafaunal extinctions and a lack of suitable remote sensing technology impede our understanding of both the ecological legacy and current impacts of large mammal herbivores in the Earth system. To address this, we reconstructed the form and intensity of herbivory pressure across sub-Saharan Africa similar to 1000 years ago. Specifically, we modeled and mapped species-level biomass for 92 large mammal herbivores using census data, species distributions, and environmental covariates. Trait-based classifications of these species into herbivore functional types, and analyses of their biomass surfaces, reveal four ecologically distinct continental-scale herbivory regimes, characterized by internally similar forms and intensities of herbivory pressure. Associations between herbivory regimes, fire prevalence, soil nutrient status, and rainfall provide important insights into African ecology and pave the way for integrating herbivores into global-scale studies.

AB Plants collected from diverse sites on subantarctic Macquarie Island varied by up to 30 parts per thousand in their leaf delta(15)N values. N-15 natural abundance of plants, soils, animal excrement and atmospheric ammonia suggest that the majority of nitrogen utilised by plants growing in the vicinity of animal colonies or burrows is animal-derived. Plants growing near scavengers and animal higher in the food chain had highly enriched delta(15)N values (mean = 12.9 parts per thousand), reflecting the highly enriched signature of these animals' excrement, while plants growing near nesting penguins and albatross, which have an intermediate food chain position, had less enriched delta(15)N values (> 6 parts per thousand). Vegetation in areas affected by rabbits had lower delta(15)N values (mean = 1.2 parts per thousand), while the highly depleted delta(15)N values (below -5 parts per thousand) of plants at upland plateau sites inland of penguin colonies, suggested that a portion of their nitrogen is derived from ammonia (mean N-15 = -10 parts per thousand) lost during the degradation of penguin guano. Vegetation in a remote area had delta(15)N values near -2 parts per thousand. These results contrast with arctic and subarctic studies that attribute large variations in plant N-15 values to nitrogen partitioning in nitrogen-limited environments. Here, plant N-15 reflects the N-15 Of the likely nitrogen sources utilised by plants.

AB Denitrification is a critical process that can alleviate the effects of excessive nitrogen availability in aquatic ecosystems subject to eutrophication. An important part of denitrification occurs in benthic systems where bioturbation by meiofauna (invertebrates <1mm) and its effect on element cycling are still not well understood. Here we study the quantitative impact of meiofauna populations of different abundance and diversity, in the presence and absence of macrofauna, on nitrate reduction, carbon mineralization and methane fluxes. In sediments with abundant and diverse meiofauna, denitrification is double that in sediments with low meiofauna, suggesting that meiofauna bioturbation has a stimulating effect on nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. However, high meiofauna densities in the presence of bivalves do not stimulate denitrification, while dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium rate and methane efflux are significantly enhanced. We demonstrate that the ecological interactions between meio-, macrofauna and bacteria are important in regulating nitrogen cycling in soft-sediment ecosystems.

AB Forest degradation is broadly defined as a reduction in the capacity of a forest to produce ecosystem services such as carbon storage and wood products as a result of anthropogenic and environmental changes. The main causes of degradation include unsustainable logging, agriculture, invasive species, fire, fuelwood gathering, and livestock grazing. Forest degradation is widespread and has become an important consideration in global policy processes that deal with biodiversity, climate change, and forest management. There is, however, no generally recognized way to identify a degraded forest because perceptions of forest degradation vary depending on the cause, the particular goods or services of interest, and the temporal and spatial scales considered. Here, we suggest that there are types of forest degradation that produce a continuum of decline in provision of ecosystem services, from those in primary forests through various forms of managed forests to deforestation. Forest degradation must be measured against a desired baseline condition, and the types of degradation can be represented using five criteria that relate to the drivers of degradation, loss of ecosystem services and sustainable management, including: productivity, biodiversity, unusual disturbances, protective functions, and carbon storage. These criteria are not meant to be equivalent and some might be considered more important than others, depending on the local forest management objectives. We propose a minimum subset of seven indicators for the five criteria that should be assessed to determine forest degradation under a sustainable ecosystem management regime. The indicators can be remotely sensed (although improving calibration requires ground work) and aggregated from stand to management unit or landscape levels and ultimately to sub-national and national scales.

AB Species-rich grasslands that become enriched with nitrogen often suffer decreases in species richness, increases in plant biomass, and invasion by weedy exotic species. Suitable techniques to restore enriched grasslands and reestablish native communities are increasingly needed. Here we report results of a 5-yr experiment in enriched coastal prairie grasslands (Bodega Marine Reserve, Bodega Bay, California, USA), to determine the combined effects of mowing and biomass removal on total soil nitrogen, net rates of mineralization, nitrogen retention, and species richness and biomass. We mowed and removed plant biomass from plots in areas where the N-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), had greatly enriched the soil, and where the community was composed of weedy introduced plants. Our goal was to facilitate the establishment of the native grassland assemblage such as was found at nearby low soil nitrogen sites.
   Mowing and biomass removal resulted in a dramatic change in the species assemblage, from exotic annual grasses to a mixed exotic/native forb community composed primarily of perennials. Species richness was significantly greater in treated plots than in control plots weedy exotic grasses diminished in abundance, and both native and exotic forb species increased. In mowed vs. control plots, there was significantly less mean aboveground biomass, but significantly greater belowground biomass. This shift in species composition had significant impacts on nitrogen retention. In late fall and winter when plant-available N was highest, much nitrogen leached from the effectively fallow control plots where germination of annual grasses did not peak until midwinter. In contrast, mowed plots retained substantially greater amounts of nitrogen, due to the presence of perennial plants possessing large amounts of belowground biomass early in the season. Despite the cumulative removal of 22 g N/M-2 in biomass over 5 yr, there was no difference between mowed and control plots in total soil N, pool sizes of inorganic N, or net rates of N mineralization. The results indicate that removal of plant biomass by mowing shifted this plant community from an annual grass to a perennial forb assemblage. However, in doing so, N retention by vegetation was increased, making it more difficult to reduce soil N.

AB Here we integrate spatial information on annual burnt area, fire frequency, fire seasonality, fire radiative power and fire size distributions to produce an integrated picture of fire regimes in southern Africa. The regional patterns are related to gradients of environmental and human controls of fire, and compared with findings from other grass-fuelled fire systems on the globe. The fire regime differs across a gradient of human land use intensity, and can be explained by the differential effect of humans on ignition frequencies and fire spread. Contrary to findings in the savannas of Australia, there is no obvious increase in fire size or fire intensity from the early to the late fire season in southern Africa, presumably because patterns of fire ignition are very different. Similarly, the importance of very large fires in driving the total annual area burnt is not obvious in southern Africa. These results point to the substantial effect that human activities can have on fire in a system with high rural population densities and active fire management. Not all aspects of a fire regime are equally impacted by people: fire-return time and fire radiative power show less response to human activities than fire size and annual burned area.

AB We review the evidence for multiple ecological states and the factors that create ecological resilience in coral reef ecosystems. There are natural differences among benthic communities along gradients of water temperature, light, nutrients, and organic matter associated with upwelling-downwelling and onshore-offshore systems. Along gradients from oligotrophy to eutrophy, plant-animal symbioses tend to decrease, and the abundance of algae and heterotrophic suspension feeders and the ratio of organic to inorganic carbon production tend to increase. Human influences such as fishing, increased organic matter and nutrients, sediments, warm water, and transportation of xenobiotics and diseases are common causes of a large number of recently reported ecological shifts. It is often the interaction of persistent and multiple synergistic disturbances that causes permanent ecological transitions, rather than the succession of individual short-term disturbances. For example, fishing can remove top-level predators, resulting in the ecological release of prey such as sea urchins and coral-eating invertebrates. When sea urchins are not common because of unsuitable habitat, recruitment limitations, and diseases, and when overfishing removes herbivorous fish, frondose brown algae can dominate. Terrigenous sediments carried onto reefs as a result of increased soil erosion largely promote the dominance of turf or articulated green algae. Elevated nutrients and organic matter can increase internal eroders of reef substratum and a mixture of filamentous algae. Local conservation actions that attempt to reduce fishing and terrestrial influences promote the high production of inorganic carbon that is necessary for reef growth. However, global climate change threatens to undermine such actions because of increased bleaching and mortality caused by warm-water anomalies, weakened coral skeletons caused by reduced aragonite availability in reef waters, and increased incidence of diseases in coral reef species. Consequently, many coral reefs, including those that are heavily managed, have experienced net losses in accumulated inorganic carbon in recent decades and appear likely to continue this trend in coming decades. Reefs urgently need to be managed with a view to strengthening their resilience to the increased frequency and intensity of these pressures. Ecological targets must include the restoration or maintenance of species diversity, keystone species, spatial heterogeneity, refugia, and connectivity. Achieving these goals will require unprecedented cooperative synergy between human organizations at all political levels, from intergovernmental to local.

AB More people and goods are moving further and more frequently via many different trade and transport networks under current trends of globalisation. These networks can play a major role in the unintended introduction of exotic species to new locations. With the continuing rise in global trade, more research attention is being focused on the role of networks in the spread of invasive species. This represents an emerging field of research in invasion science and the substantial knowledge being generated within other disciplines can provide ecologists with new tools with which to study invasions. For the first time, we synthesise studies from several perspectives, approaches and disciplines to derive the fundamental characteristics of network topology determining the likelihood of spread of organisms via trade and transport networks. These characteristics can be used to identify critical points of vulnerability within these networks and enable the development of more effective strategies to prevent invasions.

AB Although the demography of woody plants in savannas has long been shown to be due to many factors, there still is no consensus as to the relative importance of the top-down processes of fire and herbivory, nor on how fire and herbivory affect plant demography. We review the recent literature and suggest that further progress depends on the following: (i) a demographic framework with clear terminology and which focuses on recruitment, transitions and mortality, (ii) an understanding of mechanisms of how fire actually damages plants and how plants survive and out-grow this damage, mainly through height, bark thickness or diameter growth, (iii) an understanding of how losses in biomass due to herbivory may affect plant demography and, (iv) a consideration of interactions between fire and herbivory. Our synthesis suggests (i) strong recruitment limitation as well as some evidence of transition limitation by both fire and herbivory, (ii) that in some cases herbivory alone, notably by elephants and impala, can be more significant than fire alone, on woody plant population size, (iii) that fire and herbivory together are a lethal combination for woody plants and, (iv) that differences in strategies and responses of savanna plants to fire and herbivory are poorly explored.

AB Cophyline narrow-mouthed frogs (Anura: Microhylidae) are a diverse endemic radiation of Madagascar. Cophylines contain a high proportion of range restricted species and constitute a good model system to understand patterns of evolutionary diversification in tropical ecosystems. We combine spatial and phylogenetic analyses for a near-complete taxon sample to test competing explanations for patterns of species richness (SR) and endemism. Our reconstruction of the phylogeny of cophylines indicates the presence of 22 new species and several instances of nonmonophyly. We found a strong historical signal in current cophyline ranges indicating a high degree of spatial niche conservatism in clade diversification, with clades occurring in the North of Madagascar constituting the most derived in the phylogeny. We identified six positively correlated centers of SIR and endemism that can neither be explained by stochastic models such as elevational or latitudinal mid-domain effect, nor by low-elevation river catchments. Instead, the locations of these centers in areas spanning a high altitudinal range in combination with specific climatic parameters support a key role of mountainous areas for speciation of these anurans, although we cannot exclude an influence of habitat loss due to human impact. High conservation priority is ascribed to these areas.

AB Grassland to forest conversions currently affect some of the world's most productive regions and have the potential to modify many soil properties. We used afforestation of native temperate humid grassland in the Pampas with eucalypts as an experimental system to 1) isolate forest and grassland imprints on soil acidity and base cation cycling and 2) evaluate the mechanisms of soil acidification. We characterized soil changes with afforestation using ten paired stands of native grasslands and Eucalyptus plantations (10-100 years of age). Compared to grasslands, afforested stands had lower soil pH (4.6 vs. 5.6, p < 0.0001) and similar to 40% lower exchangeable Ca (p < 0.001) in the top 20 cm of the soil. At three afforested stands where we further characterized soil changes to one meter depth, soil became increasingly acidic from 5 to 35 cm depth but more alkaline below similar to60 cm compared to adjacent grasslands, with few differences observed between 35 and 60 cm. These changes corresponded with gains of exchangeable acidity and Na in intermediate and deeper soil layers. Inferred ecosystem cation balances (biomass + forest floor + first meter of mineral soil) revealed substantial vertical redistributions of Ca and Mn and a tripling of Na pools within the mineral soil after afforestation. Soil exchangeable acidity increased 0.5-1.2 kmol(c).Ha(-1).yr(-1) across afforested stands, although no aboveground acidic inputs were detected in wet + dry deposition, throughfall and forest floor leachates. Our results suggest that cation cycling and redistribution by trees, rather than cation leaching by organic acids or enhanced carbonic acid production in the soil, is the dominant mechanism of acidification in this system. The magnitude of soil changes that we observed within half a century of tree establishment in the Pampas emphasizes the rapid influence of vegetation on soil formation and suggests that massive afforestation of grasslands for carbon sequestration could have important consequences for soil fertility and base cation cycles.

AB The vertebrate predators of post-metamorphic anurans were quantified and the predator-prey relationship was investigated by analysing the relative size of invertebrate predators and anurans. More than 100 vertebrate predators were identified (in more than 200 reports) and classified as opportunistic, convenience, temporary specialized and specialized predators. Invertebrate predators were classified as solitary non-venomous, venomous and social foragers according to 333 reviewed reports. Each of these categories of invertebrate predators was compared with the relative size of the anurans, showing an increase in the relative size of the prey when predators used special predatory tactics. The number of species and the number of families of anurans that were preyed upon did not vary with the size of the predator, suggesting that prey selection was not arbitrary and that energetic constraints must be involved in this choice. The relatively low predation pressure upon brachycephalids was related to the presence of some defensive strategies of its species. This compounding review can be used as the foundation for future advances in vertebrate predator-prey interactions.

AB Coastal marine assemblages are shaped by interactions between physical factors, biological interactions, and almost ubiquitously, human impacts. Large-scale manipulations of human access replicated over a range of physical and biological conditions can generate insights over the processes shaping marine assemblages. We examined the relative roles of human impacts and hydrographic conditions on assemblages of shallow (3-10 m depth) rocky reefs by comparing no-take reserves with fishing areas occurring in gradients of exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves around two Mediterranean islands, Capraia and Giannutri, Italy. We hypothesized that fishing influences assemblages directly by reducing populations of target fish species, and indirectly by reducing predation on sea urchins, intensifying herbivory, and causing "barrens" of encrusting coralline algae. We examined how the possible effects of fishing varied with physical exposure of the coastline.
   The composition of fish assemblages differed significantly between sites within no-take reserves and fished reference sites. Abundances and sizes of predatory fishes targeted by local fisheries were greater in no-take reserves than in fished areas. Sea urchin densities, the extent of coralline barrens, and the structure of the algal and invertebrate benthic assemblages showed clear variation associated with exposure of the coastline to dominant winds and waves, but weak effects of protection from human use. Densities of the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula were significantly greater along the windward than along the leeward sides of the islands, and were positively correlated with the extent of coralline barrens. In contrast, the purple sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus was more abundant along the leeward sides of islands and showed indirect responses to protection at Giannutri, where purple sea urchins tended to have greater densities at fished than at protected sites. Protection from fishing influenced fish assemblages directly, and benthic assemblages indirectly, but the latter effect was observed only at sites with lower physical exposure. Indirect effects of fishing and recovery of assemblages within marine protected areas through cascading trophic interactions are likely to vary depending on local physical conditions and on the characteristics of species that are locally dominant.

AB Aim To examine the different uses and perceptions of introduced Australian acacias (wattles; Acacia subgenus Phyllodineae) by rural households and communities.
   Location Eighteen landscape-scale case studies around the world, in Vietnam, India, Reunion, Madagascar, South Africa, Congo, Niger, Ethiopia, Israel, France, Portugal, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic and Hawai'i.
   Methods Qualitative comparison of case studies, based on questionnaire sent to network of acacia researchers. Information based on individual knowledge of local experts, published and unpublished sources.
   Results We propose a conceptual model to explain current uses and perceptions of introduced acacias. It highlights historically and geographically contingent processes, including economic development, environmental discourses, political context, and local or regional needs. Four main groupings of case studies were united by similar patterns: (1) poor communities benefiting from targeted agroforestry projects; (2) places where residents, generally poor, take advantage of a valuable resource already present in their landscape via plantation and/or invasion; (3) regions of small and mid-scale tree farmers participating in the forestry industry; and (4) a number of high-income communities dealing with the legacies of former or niche use of introduced acacia in a context of increased concern over biodiversity and ecosystem services.
   Main conclusions Economic conditions play a key role shaping acacia use. Poorer communities rely strongly on acacias (often in, or escaped from, formal plantations) for household needs and, sometimes, for income. Middle-income regions more typically host private farm investments in acacia woodlots for commercialization. Efforts at control of invasive acacias must take care to not adversely impact poor dependent communities.

AB Periodic hydrological connectivity among fragmented floodplain habitats governs the persistence of aquatic biota. In dryland rivers, unpredictable flooding interspersed with low flows and drying drive their "boom and bust" ecology. During drying, aquatic habitats contract and fragment. Flooding connects and expands habitats, triggering productivity booms in waterbirds, fish, and plants. Microinvertebrates form the base of the food web and also flourish after floods, but their colonization pathways remain unknown. To determine the relative contribution of flood water-transported propagules vs. emergence of in situ resting stages from inundated sediments, we studied short-term recruitment of microinvertebrates after flooding in the dryland Darling River, Australia. Lakes open to transported and emerging in situ micro invertebrates were compared with lake and laboratory microcosms closed to transported microinvertebrates. Floods imported most early colonists to floodplain lakes. In situ emergence from sediments was less important until weeks later but potentially sustained production over a longer period of inundation. Some taxa primarily colonized lakes via emergence whereas others were only transported to lakes. A spatially nested ANOVA approach spanning patches within lakes to among reaches revealed contrasting variability across hierarchical scales for taxonomic richness and densities of microinvertebrate taxa. This was most marked at the reach scale, possibly reflecting seasonal patterns in flooding. Microinvertebrate colonization sequences in the Darling River floodplain rely on connectivity between habitats during flooding. Ecological connectivity was greater at small spatial scales (patches within lakes 100-1000 m, among lakes 10(4)-10(5) m) than at larger spatial scales (reaches 10(5)-10(6) m). The strength of connectivity is likely to vary across spatial scales with the magnitude, duration, and rate of rise and fall of floods.

AB 1. We tested for costs of chick rearing in the black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (Linnaeus) by removing entire clutches from 149 of 405 randomly selected nests, in which one or both mates was colour-banded. After the manipulation, we monitored adult nest attendance and body condition at unmanipulated and manipulated nests, and measured the survival and fecundity of these adults the following year.
   2. Late in the chick-rearing period, adults from unmanipulated nests (i.e. with chicks) went on significantly longer foraging trips, and were significantly lighter for their size, than adults from manipulated nests (i.e. without chicks).
   3. Adults from unmanipulated nests also survived to the following nesting season at a significantly lower rate than those from the manipulated nests (0.898 vs. 0.953), suggesting that attempting to raise chicks can reduce life expectancy by 55%.
   4. There was a tendency for adults from nests that were unmanipulated in year one to have lower reproductive success in year two, primarily because of reduced hedging success, and a higher incidence of non-breeding.
   5. These findings suggest that mass loss in kittiwakes during chick rearing may not be adaptive. Raising chicks can lead to reproductive costs, and the causal mechanism appears to be a reduction in body condition.
   6. We compare our results with previous brood (or clutch) size manipulation experiments that have measured adult body condition, survival and/or future fecundity. Although the empirical evidence suggests that long-lived species are more likely to experience survival costs than short-lived species, we believe the opposite may be true. We suggest that shifting the experimental protocol of cost of reproduction studies from brood enlargements (an approach taken in most prior studies) to brood reductions will provide more accurate quantifications of naturally occurring costs.
   7. The cost of reproduction is one mechanism proposed to explain the reduced survival rates reported for kittiwake populations in the North Atlantic relative to those in the North Pacific ocean. Oceanographic data, however, suggest that lower food availability may limit survival of kittiwakes in the North Atlantic where a deeper mixed layer and reduced primary production combine to make conditions less favourable for this seabird during the winter months.

AB Networks of urban green space can provide critical resources for wild bees, however it is unclear which attributes of green spaces provide these resources, or how their management can be improved to benefit a diversity of bee species. We examined bee communities in three dominant urban green space habitats: (1) golf courses (2) public parks and (3) front gardens and streetscapes in residential neighbourhoods in Melbourne, Australia and assessed which local and landscape attributes influenced bee communities. There was a greater abundance and richness of bee species in public parks compared to golf courses and residential neighbourhoods, where the latter habitat was dominated by European Honeybees (Apis mellifera). The occurrence of A. mellifera was positively associated with increases in flowering and native plants. Ground-nesting Homalictus species occurred more frequently in older golf courses and public parks surrounded by low impervious surface cover, and with a low diversity of flowering plants. Cavity nesting, floral specialists within the Colletidae family occurred more often in green space habitats with greater native vegetation, and occurred infrequently in residential neighbourhoods. The lack of appropriate nesting habitat and dominance of exotic flowering plants in residential neighbourhoods appeared to positively impact upon the generalist A. mellifera, but negatively affected cavity and ground nesting floral specialist bee species (e.g. Halictidae and Colletidae). Our results highlight the need to include urban areas in pollinator conservation initiatives, as providing resources critical to diverse bee communities can assist in maintaining these key pollinators in urban landscapes.

AB ABSTRACT
   Vital rates of large herbivores normally respond to increased resource limitation by following a progressive sequence of effects on life-history characteristics from survival of young, age at first reproduction, reproduction of adults, to adult survival. Expected changes in life-history characteristics, however, should operate through changes in nutritional condition, which is the integrator of nutritional intake and demands represented primarily by the deposition and catabolism of body fat. Elucidating seasonal patterns of nutritional condition and its relative influence on individual and population performance should improve our understanding of life-history strategies and population regulation of ungulates, provide insight into the capacity of available habitat to support population growth, and allow assessment of the underlying consequences of mortality on population dynamics. We acquired longitudinal data on individual female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and linked those data with environmental and population characteristics. Our goal was to provide a nutritional basis for understanding life-history strategies of these large mammals, and to aid in the conservation and management of large herbivores in general. We studied a migratory population of mule deer that overwintered in Round Valley on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, and was subject to a highly variable climate and predation from a suite of large carnivores. We intensively monitored nutritional and life-history characteristics of this population during 1997-2009 as it recovered from a population crash, which occurred during 1985-1991. Deer in Round Valley migrated to high-elevation summer ranges on both sides of the crest of the Sierra Nevada (Sierra crest), where a rain shadow resulted in a mesic and more forested range on the west side compared with xeric conditions east of the Sierra crest. Average survival of neonatal mule deer to 140 days of age during 2006-2008 was 0.33 (SE = 0.091), but was lower for neonates on the west side (0.13, SE = 0.092) compared with those on the east side (0.44, SE = 0.11) of the Sierra crest. Birth mass and nutritional condition of mothers had a positive effect on survival of young; however, those effects were evident only for neonates born east of the crest where predation pressure was less intense compared with the west side. Black bear (Ursus americanus) predation was the main cause of mortality for west-side young (mortality rate = 0.63, SE = 0.97) compared with canid and felid predation for east-side young (0.29, SE = 0.076). Mean autumn recruitment of young during 1997-2008 was lower for females on the west side (0.42, SE = 0.037) than for females on the east side (0.70, SE = 0.041) of the crest, and was affected positively by March ingesta-free body fat (IFBFat) of individual females. At the level of the population, ratios of young-to-adult females (1991-2009) were highly variable and strongly related to March IFBFat of adult females during the current and preceding year. Reproduction by yearling females was sensitive to per capita availability of forage during summer (as 1-yr-old individuals), thereby influencing whether a sufficient body mass for ovulation was obtained. Litter size remained high (1.69, SE = 0.027) during the study, but was influenced positively by forage availability, negatively by summer temperature, and was greater for females that resided on the west side of the Sierra crest during summer than those on the east side. In contrast, pregnancy rates remained unchanged across years of study (0.
   98, SE = 0.005). Survival of prime-age (2- to 9-yr-old) females was 0.90 (SE = 0.021) in summer, 0.94 (SE = 0.012) in winter, and 0.87 (SE = 0.025) annually. Although relatively stable across years, both winter and summer survival were influenced positively by the preceding April snowpack relative to the density of the population. Mean IFBFat of adult females was 7.2% (SE = 0.077) in March 1997-2009 and 9.7% (SE = 0.23) in November 2002-2008. Nutritional condition offered a mechanistic link between factors that influence resource limitation and population performance, because condition of adult females in autumn and late winter was sensitive to the nutritional history of individual animals as related to forage growth, population density, migratory tactic, reproductive costs, and nutritional carryover. Nutritional condition of adult females in March also was the most parsimonious predictor of finite rate of population growth (lambda) during the forthcoming year. The relative magnitude of effect of nutritional condition on survival and reproduction was mostly in accordance with the predicted changes of vital rates in response to resource limitation for populations of large herbivores. Our results indicate that management and conservation of large herbivore populations could be improved by integrating indices of nutritional condition into current monitoring and research programs. We offer a method to estimate the proximity of a population to nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) that is based on nutritional status of the population relative to population performance (termed animal-indicated NCC). The proximity of the population to animal-indicated NCC represents the short-term capacity of the environment to support population growth. A nutritional approach to monitor and manage populations offers a direct link to the capacity of the habitat, and reduces the need to estimate population abundance or set goals according to population size. We also propose that the consequences of mortality (degree of additive or compensatory mortality) on population dynamics can be assessed by comparing the estimated nutritional capacity for survival and recruitment of young to that measured empirically, because more young are produced than what the habitat can support when nutrition is limiting. Our approach is useful for quantifying effects of predation, and provides a basis for determining the efficacy of predator control to enhance ungulate populations. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.

AB In this study, we explored how rainfall manipulation influenced competitive interactions between grasses and juvenile trees (small nonreproductive trees capable of resprouting) in savanna. To do this, we manipulated rainfall amount in the field using an incomplete factorial experiment that determined the effects of rainfall reduction, no manipulation, rainfall addition, and competition between grasses and trees on grass and tree growth. As response variables, we focused on several measures of tree growth and Disc Pasture Meter settling height as an estimate of grass aboveground biomass. We conducted the study over four years, at two sites in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results show that rainfall manipulation did not have substantial effects on any of the measures of tree growth we considered. However, trees at plots where grasses had been removed grew on average 15 cm more in height and 1.3-1.7 times more in basal area per year than those in plots with grasses. Grass biomass was not influenced by the presence of trees but was significantly and positively influenced by rainfall addition. These findings were not fundamentally influenced by soil type or by prevailing precipitation, suggesting applicability of our results to a wide range of savannas. Our results suggest that, in savannas, increasing rainfall serves to increase the competitive pressure exerted by grasses on trees. The implication is that recruitment into the adult tree stage from the juvenile stage is most likely in drought years when there is little competition from grass for resources and grass fuel loads are low.

AB The use of fossil sediments and genetic markers has allowed reconstruction of range shifts of forest trees induced by past climatic changes. Independently, studies of the ecology and population biology of human-induced tree invasions have started to appear. Here, we review the literature on the ecology and the genetics of past and contemporary invasions of forest trees and argue that population research dealing with past (natural) or with ongoing (human-induced) invasions should be better integrated. In particular, we suggest using identical terms to describe artificial and natural invasions, as this should help integrate the two fields. We then discuss the modalities of introduction of tree species, the life history traits associated with invasiveness, the importance of long-distance seed dispersal, the establishment of small populations, the role of biotic interactions and the specific contribution of palaeoecology to the study of tree invasions. Next, we discuss genetic and evolutionary aspects, including the genetic characteristics of invasive woody species, the genetic consequences of dispersal (founder effects and admixture), shifts in dispersal-related traits and in mating system and the importance of hybridization and introgression during invasion. We then review models of the genetic consequences of tree invasions, examine the possibility for rapid adaptation of trees to new environmental conditions and discuss the relative importance of environmental versus genetic factors in controlling tree invasions. We conclude by proposing solutions for two central "genetic paradoxes" of invasions. The first one is the necessity for invasive species to adapt to new conditions, which seems difficult to reconcile with the expected loss of diversity through founder events. The second is the common observation of invasive species outcompeting native ones, which does not seem to fit with the belief in widespread local adaptation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biological invaders can alter ecosystem processes via multiple pathways, yet few studies have compared the relative importance of these pathways. We assessed the impacts of exotic, invasive grasses on ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling in the seasonal submontane woodlands of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where native grasses have been historically rare. Exotic grasses have become abundant over the past 30 yr and have altered two controls over N cycling: plant species composition and fire regime. Here we synthesize the results of a long-term investigation of species impacts in this system. To determine effects of grasses and fire on internal N cycling, we compared litterfall. decomposition, N mineralization from soil organic matter (SOM), and plant N uptake and production in invaded unburned forest. grass-removal plots within the forest, and woodland converted to grassland by fire. We measured ecosystem N loss via fire by comparing N pools among unburned, naturally burned, and experimentally burned sites. We also assessed the effects of fire on annual N fixation in the unburned forest vs. the grassland.
   Exotic grasses had relatively small effects on N cycling in the unburned woodland despite being abundant in the understory for 30 yr. Grasses contributed similar to 30% of fine litterfall and primary-production mass and N in the unburned woodland. However, these contributions did not result in significantly increased totals because litterfall and production of Metrosideros polymorpha, the dominant native tree, was reduced in the invaded woodland relative to grass-removal plots, presumably due to competition with grasses. Although area-weighted decomposition was lower in the grass-removal treatment than in the control, net N mineralization from litter and SOM were similar between these treatments. Annual plant N uptake was similar to annual net N mineralization from SOM in both treatments.
   By contrast. the burned grassland exhibited much lower rates of litterfall and production mass and N, but higher rates of net N mineralization from SOM than the woodland. As a result, total annual plant N uptake was only 17% of annual net mineralization. This change was primarily due to the loss of native species. Aboveground N pools were significantly reduced with fire. Native species were largely eliminated by fire. However, across all burned and unburned sites there was no change in total ecosystem N because the N contained in biomass was relatively small compared to N in litter and soil. Soil contained > 95% of ecosystem N in all sites. Only in the high-intensity experimental burn was there significant loss of N from the soil pool. Fire reduced N inputs through asymbiotic N fixation mainly due to the loss of M. polymorpha, whose litter is an important site of asymbiotic N fixation, and alteration of the soil O-layer. This reduction in N inputs makes it unlikely that fixation activity will replace N lost via combustion before the next fire. Fire and the ensuing loss of native species led to decreased N inputs, increased rates of N mineralization from litter and SOM. and dramatically reduced plant N uptake, potentially leading to a more leaky N cycle. It appears that the indirect effects of grasses on N cycling via the elimination of native species by fire is the most important pathway though which exotic grasses alter ecosystem N dynamics in this system.

AB 1. Anthropogenic stressors affect the ecosystems upon which humanity relies. In some cases when resilience is exceeded, relatively small linear changes in stressors can cause relatively abrupt and nonlinear changes in ecosystems.
   2. Ecological regime shifts occur when resilience is exceeded and ecosystems enter a new local equilibrium that differs in its structure and function from the previous state. Ecological resilience, the amount of disturbance that a system can withstand before it shifts into an alternative stability domain, is an important framework for understanding and managing ecological systems subject to collapse and reorganization.
   3. Recently, interest in the influence of spatial characteristics of landscapes on resilience has increased. Understanding how spatial structure and variation in relevant variables in landscapes affects resilience to disturbance will assist with resilience quantification, and with local and regional management.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We review the history and current status of spatial resilience in the research literature, expand upon existing literature to develop a more operational definition of spatial resilience, introduce additional elements of a spatial analytical approach to understanding resilience, present a framework for resilience operationalization and provide an overview of critical knowledge and technology gaps that should be addressed for the advancement of spatial resilience theory and its applications to management and conservation.

AB In this study, we documented the changes in the intestinal bacterial community at four stages in Litopenaeus vannamei: 14 days postlarvae (L14) and 1-, 2- and 3-month old juveniles (J1, J2, J3), using 454 pyrosequencing techniques. The intestinal bacterial community was dominated by three bacterial phyla, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria at all stages. However, the relative abundance and bacterial lineages varied at the family level. The intestinal bacterial community of L14 and J1 was similar, with dominant members belonging to the Comamonadaceae of Betaproteobacteria. Conversely, bacterial members affiliated to Flavobacteriaceae of Bacteroidetes were dominant in J2 and Vibrionaceae of Gammaproteobacteria was dominant in J3. The abundance of Microbacteriaceae of Actinobacteria also fluctuated during the four stages. Bacterial members of Flavobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria) were present through all growth stages, and likely form the intestinal core microbiome of L. vannamei. However, they varied at the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level through the growth stages. The intestinal bacterial community of pond-rearing shrimp included the three main bacterial phyla identified above, and an additional group, Mycoplasmataceae of Mollicutes. Our results demonstrate that the intestinal bacterial community of L. vannamei was highly dynamic during the growth stages. Bacterial members belonging to Commamonadaceae dominated in the earlier growth stage of shrimp, possibly influenced by feeding with Artemia nauplii, but there was a shift to Flavobacteriaceae in the mid and Vibrionaceae in the late growth stages.

AB Large mammalian herbivores manifest a strong top-down control on ecosystems that can transform entire landscapes, but their impacts have not been reviewed in the context of terrestrial carbon storage. Here, we evaluate the effects of plant biomass consumption by large mammalian herbivores (>10 kg adult biomass), and the responses of ecosystems to these herbivores, on carbon stocks in temperate and tropical regions, and the Arctic. We calculate the difference in carbon stocks resulting from herbivore exclusion using the results of 108 studies from 52 vegetation types. Our estimates suggest that herbivores can reduce terrestrial above- and below-ground carbon stocks across vegetation types but reductions in carbon stocks may approach zero given sufficient periods of time for systems to respond to herbivory (i.e. decades). We estimate that if all large herbivores were removed from the vegetation types sampled in our review, increases in terrestrial carbon stocks would be up to three orders of magnitude less than many of the natural and human-influenced sources of carbon emissions. However, we lack estimates for the effects of herbivores on below-ground biomass and soil carbon levels in many regions, including those with high herbivore densities, and upwards revisions of our estimates may be necessary. Our results provide a starting point for a discussion on the magnitude of the effects of herbivory on the global carbon cycle, particularly given that large herbivores are common in many ecosystems. We suggest that herbivore removal might represent an important strategy towards increasing terrestrial carbon stocks at local and regional scales within specific vegetation types, since humans influence populations of most large mammals.

AB We outline a hierarchical framework of classes of mechanisms, operating at different spatial and temporal scales, by which populations may exploit environmental heterogeneity to ensure persistence in environments subject to physical disturbance. Examples are provided for stream systems subject to high flow disturbances. Genotypic heterogeneity, encompassing morphological and physiological adaptations, operates at evolutionary and biogeographic scales, and ultimately constrains mechanisms at smaller scales. On ecological scales, organisms may exploit temporal or spatial heterogeneity, or both, to maintain population sizes larger than possible by morphological adaptations alone. For 2 classes of mechanism operating at large scales (>1 generation and >1 habitat patch), individuals do not survive disturbances and population persistence depends on recruitment from external sources. Where generations overlap and populations exploit temporal refugia in complex life cycles, dispersal occurs between habitat patches of different types. Alternatively dispersal occurs between habitat patches of similar type. For 2 other classes of mechanism, operating at smaller scales (<1 generation and less than or equal to 1 habitat patch), individuals survive disturbances by moving between microhabitat patches of different types, or by changes in habitude which reduce the negative effects of disturbance. A simple mathematical model is used to explore the efficacy of 4 mechanisms of refugium use operating through microhabitat heterogeneity within a single habitat patch. Simulations of population changes over a series of disturbance events showed that each of 4 mechanisms could maintain a viable population under certain conditions. Total refugium area and proportion of the population lost at each disturbance event had a strong effect on final population size for all mechanisms. Doubling disturbance frequency had little effect on final population size if movements of individuals into refugia were facilitated by small accessible refugium patches, or if individuals remained in refugia during benign inter-disturbance periods. Empirical evidence supports the efficacy of these mechanisms: organisms with short life cycles and, perhaps, poor mobility may be lost from erosive patches but persist in refugia; macroinvertebrates may accumulate in refugia during disturbance events and redistribute throughout the stream after the disturbance. More empirical data on the spatial attributes of refugium patches and the mobility of stream organisms are required to test and to add realism to these models.

AB This study describes the fruiting phenology of woody plants and their dispersal syndromes in caatinga (semi-arid region in the northeast of Brazil). The fruiting phenology of 42 species with different dispersal modes and life-forms was followed over a period of 1 y. Animal dispersal was the most commonly observed dispersal mode (36%), followed by anemochory (33%), ballistic dispersal (19%) and barochory (12%). Overall, a greater number of species fruited during the rainy season. Zoochorous species were the most representative in the rainy season, whereas anemochorous species predominated during the dry season. Five different life-forms were observed, and the occurrence of dispersal modes was discussed for each of them. In the caatinga plant community studied the patterns of life-forms, fruiting phenology and seed dispersal syndromes were similar to other tropical seasonal ecosystems.

AB Invasive species cause ecological, economic and social impacts and are key drivers of global change. This is the case for the genus Prosopis (mesquite; Fabaceae) where several taxa are among the world's most damaging invasive species. Many contentious issues ('conflicts of interest') surround these taxa, and management interventions have not yet sustainably reduced the negative impacts. There is an urgent need to better understand the factors that drive invasions and shape management actions, and to compare the effectiveness of different management approaches. This paper presents a global review of Prosopis, focusing on its distribution, impacts, benefits and approaches to management. Prosopis was found to occur in a 129 countries globally and many more countries are climatically suitable. All areas with naturalized or invasive Prosopis species at present are suitable for more taxa and many Asian and Mediterranean countries with no records of Prosopis are bioclimatically suitable. Several Prosopis species have substantial impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and local and regional economies in their native and even more so in their invasive ranges; others provide multiple benefits to local communities. Management efforts are underway in only a small part of the invaded range. Countries where more research has been done are more likely to implement formal management than those where little published research is available. Management strategies differ among countries; developed nations use mainly mechanical and chemical control whereas developing nations tend to apply control through utilization approaches. A range of countries are also using biological control. Key gaps in knowledge and promising options for management are highlighted.

AB Dispersal influences ecological dynamics, evolution, biogeography, and biodiversity conservation, but models of larval dispersal in marine organisms make simplifying assumptions that are likely to approximate poorly the temporal dynamics of larval survival and capacity for settlement. In particular, larval mortality rates are typically assumed to be constant throughout larval life; and all larvae are frequently assumed to acquire and lose competence at the same time. To improve upon these assumptions, we here develop simple models of dispersal potential that incorporate rates of mortality, and acquisition and loss of settlement competence. We fit these models to empirical competence and survival data for five scleractinian coral species, to test the models' ability to characterize empirical survival and competence patterns, and to estimate the dispersal potential implied by those patterns. The models fit the data well, incorporating qualitative features of competence and survival that traditional approaches to modeling dispersal do not, with important implications for dispersal potential. Most notably, there was high within-cohort variation in the duration of the competent period in all species, and this variation increases both self-recruitment and long-distance dispersal compared with models assuming a fixed competent period. These findings help to explain the seeming paradox of high genetic population structure, coupled with large geographic range size, observed in many coral species. More broadly, our approach offers a way to parsimoniously account for variation in competence dynamics in dispersal models, a phenomenon that our results suggest has important effects on patterns of connectivity in marine metapopulations.

AB Vertebrate herbivores and fire are known to be important drivers of vegetation dynamics in African savannas. It is of particular importance to understand how changes in herbivore population density, especially of elephants, and fire frequency will affect the amount of tree cover in savanna ecosystems, given the critical importance of tree cover for biodiversity, ecosystem function, and human welfare. We developed a spatially realistic simulation model of vegetation,fire, and dominant herbivore dynamics, tailored to the Serengeti ecosystem of east Africa. The model includes key processes such as tree-grass competition, fire, and resource-based density dependence and adaptive movement by herbivores. We used the model to project the ecosystem 100 years into the future from its present state under different fire, browsing (determined by elephant population density), and grazing (with and without wildebeest present) regimes. The model produced the following key results: (1) elephants and fire exert synergistic negative effects on woody cover; when grazers are excluded, the impact of fire and the strength of the elephant-fire interaction increase; (2) at present population densities of 0.15 elephants/km(2), the total amount of woody cover is predicted to remain stable in the absence of fire, but the mature tree population is predicted to decline regardless of the fire regime; without grazers present to mitigate the effects of fire, the size structure of the tree population will become dominated by seedlings and mature trees; (3) spatial heterogeneity in tree cover varies unimodally with elephant population density fire increases heterogeneity in the presence of grazers and decreases it in their absence; (4) the marked rainfall gradient in the Serengeti directly affects the pattern of tree cover in the absence of fire; with fire, the woody cover is determined by the grazing patterns of the migratory wildebeest, which are partly rainfall driven. Our results show that, in open migratory ecosystems such as the Serengeti, grazers can modulate the impact of fire and the strength of the interaction between fire and browsers by altering fuel loads and responding to the distribution of grass across the landscape, and thus exert strong effects on spatial patterns of tree cover.

AB This article reports the use of simple beam and finite-element models to investigate the relationship between rostral shape and biomechanical performance in living crocodilians under a range of loading conditions. Load cases corresponded to simple biting, lateral head shaking, and twist feeding behaviors. The six specimens were chosen to reflect, as far as possible, the full range of rostral shape in living crocodilians: a juvenile Caiman crocodilus, subadult Alligator mississippiensis and Crocodylus johnstoni, and adult Caiman crocodilus, Melanosuchus niger, and Paleosuchus palpebrosus. The simple beam models were generated using morphometric landmarks from each specimen. Three of the finite-element models, the A. mississippiensis, juvenile Caiman crocodilus, and the Crocodylus johnstoni, were based on CT scan data from respective specimens, but these data were not available for the other models and so these-the adult Caiman crocodilus, M. niger, and P. palpebrosus-were generated by morphing the juvenile Caiman crocodilus mesh with reference to three-dimensional linear distance measured from specimens. Comparison of the mechanical performance of the six finite-element models essentially matched results of the simple beam models: relatively tall skulls performed best under vertical loading and tall and wide skulls performed best under torsional loading. The widely held assumption that the platyrostral (dorsoventrally flattened) crocodilian skull is optimized for torsional loading was not supported by either simple beam theory models or finite-element modeling. Rather than being purely optimized against loads encountered while subduing and processing food, the shape of the crocodilian rostrum may be significantly affected by the hydrodynamic constraints of catching agile aquatic prey. This observation has important implications for our understanding of biomechanics in crocodilians and other aquatic reptiles.

AB Aim To develop an approach for assessing the spatial scale of centres of endemism among species level data.
   Location Australia.
   Methods Endemism is inherently scale dependent. Therefore, the Corrected Weighted Endemism (CWE) index used by Crisp et al. [J. Biogeogr. (2001)28:183] is extended to account for species samples in local neighbourhoods as a Spatial CWE index. This then allows an analysis of how the degree of endemism of a location (cell) changes with spatial scale. The quality of the Spatial CWE index results are assessed using three spatial randomizations at the species level with and without preserving species richness and distributional patterns. We show that CWE is equivalent to beta diversity and predict that it should show high rates of change around centres of endemism.
   Results Similar patterns to those found by Crisp et al. using a data set of vascular flora from Australia are retrieved, but the extent to which they are scale dependent is more easily identified. For example, the Central Australian centre discounted by Crisp et al. is identified when a three-cell radius neighbourhood is used. However, the level of endemism in this centre is no greater than in the margins of many of the coastal centres of endemism. Most of the identified centres of endemism are better than random at all scales and are increasingly so as the spatial scale increases. As predicted, the highest rate of change in Spatial CWE (beta diversity) is most often between zero- and one-cell radius neighbours in most centres of endemism.
   Main conclusions The explicit incorporation of geographical space in analyses allows for a greater understanding of the scale-dependence of phenomena, in this case endemism and beta diversity.

AB It is often taken for granted that all animals host and depend upon a microbiome, yet this has only been shown for a small proportion of species. We propose that animals span a continuum of reliance on microbial symbionts. At one end are the famously symbiont-dependent species such as aphids, humans, corals and cows, in which microbes are abundant and important to host fitness. In the middle are species that may tolerate some microbial colonization but are only minimally or facultatively dependent. At the other end are species that lack beneficial symbionts altogether. While their existence may seem improbable, animals are capable of limiting microbial growth in and on their bodies, and a microbially independent lifestyle may be favored by selection under some circumstances. There is already evidence for several 'microbiome-free' lineages that represent distantly related branches in the animal phylogeny. We discuss why these animals have received such little attention, highlighting the potential for contaminants, transients, and parasites to masquerade as beneficial symbionts. We also suggest ways to explore microbiomes that address the limitations of DNA sequencing. We call for further research on microbiome-free taxa to provide a more complete understanding of the ecology and evolution of macrobe-microbe interactions.

AB Reliable methods to estimate species richness are very important to managers and conservationists because they provide key data to make the right decisions in conservation programmes. In the case of carnivore mammals, traditional methods, such as direct count censuses, are not useful since these animals are usually scarce, elusive and nocturnal. Difficulties in carnivore sampling are compounded when monitoring programmes are developed at large spatial scales, where high economic costs and field efforts are necessary to achieve reliable richness or abundance estimates. These problems have highlighted the need to find more effective carnivore survey methods, especially in regions with high rates of landscape change, such as the Mediterranean basin. The present study, performed in a typical Mediterranean area, was the first in Europe to test simultaneously the relative efficiencies of four broad-applied sampling methods to detect carnivore species at large spatial scales. Sign surveys based on scat detection, scent stations, camera-trapping and live-trapping were investigated. We compared efficiencies using biological parameters and by considering both the logistic and economic costs of each method. Overall, scent stations and sign surveys were the most efficient methods both in economic and logistic terms. In addition, the use of scent stations may be necessary to detect species rarely detected by scats. Detailed and extensive training programmes for conducting sign surveys and scent stations may overcome perceived problems thus enhancing the widespread use of both methods. Our results are applicable not only to other Mediterranean areas, but also to other habitats and regions of the world. More research into the suitability of these and other methods in relation to different landscapes, seasons and species is required.

AB The seasonality of both rainfall and solar irradiance might influence the evolution of flowering and fruiting in tropical forests. In seasonally dry forests, to the degree that soil moisture limits plant productivity, community-wide peaks in reproduction are expected during the rainy season, with seedfall and germination timed to allow seedlings to become well established while soil moisture is available. Where soil moisture is never seasonally limiting, seasonal changes in light availability caused by periods of cloudiness or seasonally low zenithal sun angles should favour reproduction during seasons when irradiance levels are high. To evaluate these predictions, we documented the timing of flower and fruit fall for 10 and 15 y at El Verde, Puerto Rico, and Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. At El Verde, rainfall is abundant year-round and solar declination largely determines seasonal variation in irradiance. At BCL rainfall is abundant throughout the 8-mo wet season while drought develops and average solar irradiance increases by 40-50% over the 4-mo dry season. Seasonal variation in the number of species flowering and fruiting at both sites was generally consistent with the hypothesis that seasonal variation in irradiance limits the evolution of reproductive phenologies. Community-level metrics provided no evidence for a similar role for moisture availability at BCL Seasonal variation in irradiance also strongly influenced seed development times at both sites. Thus, community-wide phenologics reveal a strong signature of seasonal changes in irradiance, even in those forests that exhibit some degree of seasonality in rainfall.

AB Populations of many nearshore marine species are connected through the dispersal of their larvae. In this paper, larval connectivity patterns in the Southern California Bight are explored using 2 quantities: potential and realized larval connectivity. Potential connectivity is defined as the probability of larval transport from a source to a destination location and is quantified using Lagrangian particle simulations. Realized connectivity is the product of potential connectivity with larval production and can be used to estimate larval settlement patterns. Potential and realized connectivity patterns are quantified for kelp bass Paralabrax clathralus, kelp rockfish Sebastes atrovirens, and red abalone Haliotis rufescens, 3 species with a range of larval dispersal characteristics. Connectivity patterns were found to be both heterogeneous, with locations having different source and destination strengths, and asymmetric, with directionality in larval transport. Both potential and realized connectivity were strongly influenced by the length and timing of the spawning season as well as planktonic larval duration. For kelp bass and kelp rockfish, a strong correspondence was found between realized and potential destination locations, suggesting that circulation processes have a dominant role in shaping the spatial distribution of these 2 species. Strong temporal variability in realized larval connectivity was observed on seasonal and inter-annual time scales (particularly between El Nino and La Nina conditions). These results provide novel information for use in marine fisheries and conservation management.

AB The emerging threat of pollinator decline has motivated research on bee conservation biology in order to both understand the causes of declines and to develop appropriate conservation strategies. The application of genetics to the conservation of diploid animals has proven to be important for both overcoming genetic threats to population viability and for providing tools to guide conservation programs. However, the haplodiploid bees have several unusual genetic properties of relevance to their conservation, which warrant special attention. Here I review how haplodiploidy and complementary sex determination affect genetic parameters pertinent to the viability and future evolutionary potential of bee populations. I also review how genetic tools can improve the conservation management of bees. I find that bees are especially prone to extinction for genetic reasons, and that genetics can provide invaluable tools for managing bee populations to circumvent pollinator decline.

   HERBIVORES
AB An hypothesis predicting which woody species selected by elephant are at risk of local extirpation is based on an understanding of elephant digestive physiology, foraging ecology, attributes of individual plants and populations, and historical changes in ecosystems. Elephant select items rich in cell solubles relative to availability for achieving maximum throughput per unit time on account of their large energy requirement, hindgut fermentation with limited cell wall digestion, high passage rate, and inefficient recycling of microbial protein. Accordingly, diet is predominantly green grass and herbs in the wet season, green browse in the late wet and dry seasons, and bark and roots following leaf fall. Increased consumption of woody material indicates nutritional stress. Bulls graze more than cows and impact woody plants more when grazing deteriorates.
   Species vulnerable to extirpation by elephant are those: whose attributes predispose adults to pollarding, uprooting or ringbarking; adults coppice poorly, hence mortality occurs; mortality is not compensated by regeneration and recruitment owing to the impact of elephant and other agents; species have a restricted distribution; and poor dispersal ability constrains recolonisation. Threat of their local extirpation has increased because of an increased probability of encounter with elephant attributed to artificial boundaries that have constrained movement, and proliferation of water points that has reduced spatial refuges for plants and weakened density-dependent regulation of elephant populations. Degradation of grasslands, wetlands and riparian areas has forced elephant to subsist on woody vegetation for a longer period of the annual cycle. A reduction in water points should increase local elephant density and attendant density-dependent effects of increased foraging distance, nutritional stress, calf and juvenile mortality, and predation, and reduce reproduction. Eliminating human predation after 4000 years in some parks has contributed to the problem. Mitigation of the threat of local extirpation should concentrate on configuration of boundaries, water provision, simulated predation, minimum reserve size, and not pursue non-definable notions of elephant carrying capacity.

AB International trade in wildlife is a key threat to biodiversity conservation. CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, seeks to ensure international wildlife trade is sustainable, relying on trade bans and controls. However, there has been little comprehensive review of its effectiveness and here we review approaches taken to regulate wildlife trade in CITES. Although assessing its effectiveness is problematic, we assert that CITES boasts few measurable conservation successes. We attribute this to: non-compliance, an over reliance on regulation, lack of knowledge and monitoring of listed species, ignorance of market forces, and influence among CITES actors. To more effectively manage trade we argue that interventions should go beyond regulation and should be multi-faceted, reflecting the complexity of wildlife trade. To inform these interventions we assert an intensive research effort is needed around six key areas: (1) factors undermining wildlife trade governance at the national level, (2) determining sustainable harvest rates for, and adaptive management of CITES species, (3) gaining the buy-in of local communities in implementing CITES, (4) supply and demand based market interventions, (5) means of quantifying illicit trade, and (6) political processes and influence within CITES.

AB Most plants require mutualistic associations to survive, which can be an important limitation on their ability to become invasive. There are four strategies that permit plants to become invasive without being limited by a lack of mutualists. One is to not be dependent on mutualists. The other three strategies are to form novel mutualisms, form associations with cosmopolitan species, or co-invade with mutualists from their native range. Historically there has been a bias to study mutualisms from a plant perspective, with little consideration of soil biota as invasive species in their own right. Here we address this by reviewing the literature on belowground invasive mutualists of woody plants. We focus on woody invaders as ecosystem-transforming plants that frequently have a high dependence on belowground mutualists. We found that co-invasions are common, with many ectomycorrhizal plant species and N-fixing species co-invading with their mutualists. Other groups, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal plants, tend to associate with cosmopolitan fungal species or to form novel associations in their exotic range. Only limited evidence exists of direct negative effects of co-invading mutualists on native mutualist communities, and effects on native plants appear to be largely driven by altered environmental conditions rather than direct interactions. Mutualists that introduce novel ecosystem functions have effects greater than would be predicted based solely on their biomass. Focusing on the belowground aspects of plant invasions provides novel insights into the impacts, processes and management of invasions of both soil organisms and woody plant species.

AB Predicting the oceanic dispersal of planktonic larvae that connect scattered marine animal populations is difficult, yet crucial for management of species whose movements transcend international boundaries. Using multi-scale biophysical modeling techniques coupled with empirical estimates of larval behavior and gamete production, we predict and empirically verify spatio-temporal patterns of larval supply and describe the Caribbean-wide pattern of larval connectivity for the Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus), an iconic coral reef species whose commercial value approaches $1 billion USD annually. Our results provide long sought information needed for international cooperation in the management of marine resources by identifying lobster larval connectivity and dispersal pathways throughout the Caribbean. Moreover, we outline how large-scale fishery management could explicitly recognize metapopulation structure by considering larval transport dynamics and pelagic larval sanctuaries.

AB Foraging theory was first developed to predict the behaviour of widely-foraging animals that actively search for prey. Although the behaviour of sit-and-wait predators often follows predictions derived from foraging theory, the similarity between these two distinct groups of predators is not always obvious. In this review, we compare foraging activities of trap-building predators (mainly pit-building antlions and web-building spiders), a specific group of sit-and-wait predators that construct traps as a foraging device, with those of widely-foraging predators. We refer to modifications of the trap characteristics as analogous to changes in foraging intensity. Our review illustrates that the responses of trap-building and widely-foraging predators to different internal and external factors, such as hunger level, conspecific density and predation threat are quite similar, calling for additional studies of foraging theory using trap-building predators. In each chapter of this review, we summarize the response of trap-building predators to a different factor, while contrasting it with the equivalent response characterizing widely-foraging predators. We provide here evidence that the behaviour of trap-building predators is not stereotypic or fixed as was once commonly accepted, rather it can vary greatly, depending on the individual's internal state and its interactions with external environmental factors.

TI Do trophic cascades affect the storage and flux of atmospheric carbon?

AB We combine data collected from the past 40 years to estimate the indirect effects of sea otters (Enhydra lutris) on ecosystem carbon (C) production and storage across their North American range, from Vancouver Island to the western edge of Alaska's Aleutian Islands. We find that sea otters, by suppressing sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus spp) populations, allow kelp (Order Laminariales) ecosystems to develop with a net primary productivity (NPP) of 313-900 grams C per square meter per year (g C m(-2) yr(-1)) and biomass density of 101-180 grams C per square meter (g C m(-2)). In the absence of sea otters, these areas would have an NPP of 25-70 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and biomass density of 8-14 g C m(-2). Over an ecosystem area of approximately 5.1 x 10(10) m(2), the effect of sea otter predation on living kelp biomass alone represents a 4.4- to 8.7-teragram increase in C storage. At 2012 prices (US$47 per ton of C), this stored C would be valued at US$205 million-$408 million on the European Carbon Exchange. Although questions remain concerning the pathways and compartments of kelp C flux and storage, sea otters undoubtedly have a strong influence on these elements of the C cycle. Predator-induced trophic cascades likely influence the rates of C flux and storage in many other species and ecosystems.

AB We examine the impact of spatial processes on the efficacy of restocking in species with varying forms of population or metapopulation structure. Metapopulations are classified based on spatial complexity and the degree of connectedness between populations. Designation of effective restocking sites requires careful attention to metapopulation dynamics; populations in the metapopulation can differ dramatically in demography and connectivity, and the sites they occupy can vary in habitat quality. Source populations, which are optimal for restocking, can be distinct geographically and may be a small percentage of the metapopulation. Sink areas, where restocking is almost certain to be fruitless, can nonetheless serve as productive locations for habitat restoration since larvae from source reefs are likely to recruit to these areas. Effective restocking of metapopulations is most likely to be attained by selection of optimal source populations; inattention to metapopulation dynamics can doom restoration efforts with marine species.

AB Disease agents and pests associated with freshwater crayfish fall into six main categories-viruses, bacteria, rickettsia-like organisms (RLOs), fungi, protists and metazoans. Data and information on specific disease agents and pests from each of these categories are presented in this synopsis. Each agent or group of agents is considered under the following headings-condition, causative agent(s), life cycle/life history, epizootiology, pathology, pathogen viability. Information for the synopsis was obtained from the published literature and from personal contact with internationally recognised experts in freshwater crayfish aquaculture, biology and disease. Data of relevance for import risk analysis are summarised.
   Import risk analysis is the process by which the risks associated with importation of animals and plants, and products derived from animals and plants, are assessed and managed. Hazard identification is essential and is the first component of an import risk analysis. In 1996, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) commenced a review of policy relating to the importation of non-viable freshwater crayfish products, along with a suite of other aquatic animal products. AQIS commissioned a synopsis of freshwater crayfish pests and pathogens for use as a resource document for hazard identification in the formal IRA process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We investigated the contribution of internal water storage and efficiency of water transport to the maintenance of water balance in six evergreen tree species in a Hawaiian dry forest. Wood-saturated water content, a surrogate for relative water storage capacity, ranged from 70 to 105%, and was inversely related to its morphological correlate, wood density, which ranged between 0.51 and 0.65 g cm(-) (3). Leaf-specific conductivity (k(L)) measured in stem segments from terminal branches ranged from 3 to 18 mmol m(-1) s(-1) MPa-1, and whole-plant hydraulic efficiency calculated as stomatal conductance (g) divided by the difference between predawn and midday leaf water potential (Psi(L)), ranged from 70 to 150 mmol m(-2) s(-1) MPa-1. Hydraulic efficiency was positively correlated with k(L) (r(2) = 0.86). Minimum annual Psi(L) ranged from - 1.5 to - 4.1 MPa among the six species. Seasonal and diurnal variation in Psi(L) were associated with differences among species in wood-saturated water content, wood density and k(L). The species with higher wood-saturated water content were more efficient in terms of long-distance water transport, exhibited smaller diurnal variation in Psi(L) and higher maximum photosynthetic rates. Smaller diurnal variation in Psi(L) in species with higher wood-saturated water content, k(L) and hydraulic efficiency was not associated with stomatal restriction of transpiration when soil water deficit was moderate, but avoidance of low minimum seasonal Psi(L) in these species was associated with a substantial seasonal decline in g. Low seasonal minimum Psi(L) in species with low k(L), hydraulic efficiency, and wood-saturated water content was associated with higher leaf solute content and corresponding lower leaf turgor loss point. Despite the species-specific differences in leaf water relations characteristics, all six evergreen tree species shared a common functional relationship defined primarily by k(L) and stem water storage capacity.

AB Suspended sediments (clay and silt particles) differentially inhibit cladoceran populations, but not rotifer populations, and can change the outcome of competition between rotifers and cladocerans in favor of rotifers (Kirk and Gilbert 1990). This paper provides a mechanistic explanation for the population and community effects of suspended clay. Feeding experiments with radioactively labeled phytoplankton cells (Cryptomonas) showed that the presence of suspended clay (< 2-mu-m particle size) significantly decreased the phytoplankton ingestion rates of five cladoceran species (Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia ambigua, D. galeata mendotae, D. magna, and D. pulex) by 13-83% but not those of three rotifer species (Keratella cochlearis, K. crassa, and Synchaeta pectinata). When radioactively labeled phytoplankton cells and clay particles were offered simultaneously, cladocerans were less selective for phytoplankton over clay than were rotifers. Thus, cladocerans ingested more suspended clay particles than did rotifers, and this caused the reductions in phytoplankton ingestion rates. Smaller cladocerans were less selective for phytoplankton over clay than were larger cladocerans, and their phytoplankton ingestion rates were thus reduced more by clay. Rotifers fed more selectively than either large or small cladocerans, were able to avoid ingesting clay particles, and therefore were not inhibited by suspended clay. Thus, differences in the feeding modes and selectivities of rotifers and cladocerans form the mechanistic basis for the change in competitive outcome in favor of rotifers observed in the presence of suspended clay. This mechanism may form the basis for changes in the relative abundance of rotifers and cladocerans in turbid lakes and reservoirs.

AB Objectives
   To (1) assess the strength of evidence for the role of termites in vegetation heterogeneity in African savannas, and (2) identify the mechanisms by which termites induce such heterogeneity.
   Location
   African savannas.
   Methods
   We conducted a review of the literature, a meta-analysis and qualitative systems analysis to identify mechanisms to explain the observed patterns.
   Results
   The review provided evidence for termite-induced heterogeneity in floristic composition and vegetation patterning in savannas across Africa. Termites induced vegetation heterogeneity directly or indirectly through their nest-building and foraging activities, associated nutrient cycling and their interaction with mammalian herbivores and fire. The literature reviewed indicated that termite mounds essentially act as islands of fertility, which are responsible for ecosystem-level spatial heterogeneity in savannas. This was supported by the meta-analysis, which demonstrated that mounds of Ancistrotermes, Macrotermes, Odontotermes (family Macrotermitinae), Cubitermes (family Termitinae) and Trinervitermes (Nasutitermitinae) are significantly enriched in clay (75%), carbon (16%), total nitrogen (42%), calcium (232%), potassium (306%) and magnesium (154%) compared to the surrounding savanna soil.
   Conclusions
   Termite activity is one of the major factors that induce vegetation patterning in African savannas. The implications of this are discussed and research questions for future studies and modelling efforts are indicated.

AB A Gram-negative bacterium, designated LA31B(T), was isolated from water collected from a hypersaline lagoon on Laysan Atoll in the north-western Hawaiian Islands. Single cells of LA31B(T) were slightly curved but became helical as their length increased. Preliminary characterization based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that LA31B(T) shared 96.0% identity with an Arcobacter sp. isolated from a cyanobacterial mat in hypersaline Lake Sinai, and 94% identity with Arcobacter nitrofigilis, the type species of the genus Arcobacter. A polyphasic taxonomic study was conducted and confirmed the phylogenetic affiliation of strain LA31B(T) to the genus Arcobacter. However, LA31B(T) was found to be distinct from all recognized Arcobacter species, by a comprehensive biochemical test analysis, whole-cell fatty acid profiling, DNA G + C content (35 mol% in LA31B(T)) and degree of DNA-DNA reassociation. Most notably, LA31B(T) was found to be an obligate halophile, a hitherto undescribed feature among recognized Arcobacter species. These data indicate that LA31B(T) should be considered to represent a novel species in the genus Arcobacter, for which the name Arcobacter halophilus sp. nov. is proposed. This is the first obligately halophilic member of the genus. The type strain is LA31B(T) (= ATCC BAA- 102 2 T=CIP 108450(T)).

AB The recruitment of native seedlings is often reduced in areas where the invasive Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is abundant. To address this recruitment problem, we evaluated the effectiveness of L. maackii eradication methods and restoration efforts using seedlings of six native tree species planted within eradication and unmanipulated (control) plots. Two eradication methods using glyphosate herbicide were evaluated: cut and paint and stem injection with an EZ-Ject lance. Lonicera maackii density and biomass as well as microenvironmental characteristics were measured to study their effects on seedling growth and survivorship. Mean biomass of Amur honeysuckle was 361 +/- 69 kg/ha, and density was 21,380 +/- 3,171. plants/ha. Both eradication treatments were effective in killing L. maackii ( greater than or equal to 94%). The injection treatment was most effective on large L. maackii individuals (> 1.5 cm diameter), was 43% faster to apply than cutting and painting and less fatiguing for the operator, decreased operator exposure to herbicide, and minimized impact to nontarget vegetation. Deer browse tree protectors were used on half of the seedlings, but did not affect survivorship or growth. After 3 years, survival of native seedlings was significantly less where L. maackii was left intact (32 +/- 3%) compared with the eradication plots (p < 0.002). Seedling survival was significantly different between cut (51 +/- 3%) and injected (45 +/- 3%) plots. Species had different final percent survival and rates of mortality. Species survival differed greatly by species (in descending order): Fraxinus pennsylvanica > Quercus muehlenbergii greater than or equal to Prunus serotina greater than or equal to Juglans nigra > Cercis canadensis > Cornus florida. Survivorship and growth of native seedlings was affected by a severe first-year drought and by site location. One site exhibited greater spring soil moisture, pH, percent open canopy, and had greater survivorship relative to the other site (55 +/- 2 vs. 30 +/- 2 %). Overall, both L. maackii eradication methods were successful, but restorationists should be aware of the potential for differential survivorship of native seedlings depending on species identity and microenvironmental conditions.

AB 1. The role of seasonal phenology in the emergence of zooplankton from diapause in patterns of seasonal abundance in the water column was investigated in Oneida Lake, New York. Replicate emergence traps, placed in contact with the lake sediments at two locations (one at a shallow site and one at a deep site), were monitored between May and August.
   2. Although six rotifer taxa showed a clear seasonal succession in the water column throughout the study period, all but one taxon emerged exclusively in spring. Three cladoceran and three calanoid copepod species, also present in the water column throughout the study period, again showed predominantly spring emergence. In contrast, three cyclopoid copepod species had distinct seasonal periods of emergence that corresponded, at least in part, to the timing of abundance peaks in the plankton.
   3. These results for a single lake are largely consistent with patterns observed or inferred by other investigators for other lakes: variable dependence of abundance in the plankton on diapause emergence for species with long-lived diapausing eggs (i.e. rotifers, cladocerans and calanoid copepods), and much closer dependence for species with short-lived diapausing immature stages (i.e. cyclopoid copepods).

AB Land use is known to reduce the diversity of species and complexity of biotic interactions. In theory, interaction networks can be used to predict the sensitivity of species against co-extinction, but this has rarely been applied to real ecosystems facing variable land-use impacts. We investigated plant-pollinator networks on 119 grasslands that varied quantitatively in management regime, yielding 25401 visits by 741 pollinator species on 166 plant species. Species-specific plant and pollinator responses to land use were significantly predicted by the weighted average land-use response of each species' partners. Moreover, more specialized pollinators were more vulnerable than generalists. Both predictions are based on the relative interaction strengths provided by the observed interaction network. Losses in flower and pollinator diversity were linked, and mutual dependence between plants and pollinators accelerates the observed parallel declines in response to land-use intensification. Our findings confirm that ecological networks help to predict natural community responses to disturbance and possible secondary extinctions.

AB Sub-Saharan Africa includes some 45,000 plant species. The spatial patterns of this diversity have been well explored. We can group the species into a set of biogeographical regions (largely co-incident with regions defined for terrestrial vertebrate groups). Furthermore, we know that the diversity is unevenly distributed, with southern Africa (especially the south-western tip) disproportionally species rich, while the West African interior is disproportionally species poor. However, the origins of this diversity have only been explored for two anomalous African Floras (the Tropic-alpine Flora and the Cape Flora), whereas the origins of the diversity of the other floras are still unknown. Here I argue that six floras, with distinct geographical centers, different extra-African affinities, ages of radiation and radiation rates, can be delimited: the Austro-temperate, Tropic-alpine, Lowland forest, Tropic-montane, Savanna and Arid Floras. The oldest flora may be the Lowland forest Flora, and the most recent is the Tropic-alpine, which probably evolved during the Plio-Pleistocene on the summits of the East Africa volcanoes. My results suggest that the most rapidly radiating flora is the Austro-temperate Flora, while the other floras are all diversifying at more or less the same rate, this is also consistent with the current massive species richness in this flora (about half of the African species richness). The Austro-temperate Flora appears to be related to the floras of the other southern continents, the Tropic-alpine Flora to that of the Northern Hemisphere, and the four tropical floras to the tropical regions of the other continents, consistent with the theory of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Current African diversity may be the result of the sequential adding of new floras to the continent. Possibly the species poverty especially of the Lowland forest Flora may be the result of the spread of C-4 grasslands and associated regular fires.

TI Jaguar (Panthera onca) feeding ecology: distribution of predator and

AB Jaguars Panthera onca inhabiting tropical or subtropical evergreen moist forest have often been classified as opportunistic predators because they consume prey relative to its availability. However, these studies failed to address simultaneously the distribution of predator and prey through time and space, which may lead to an incomplete or erroneous understanding of jaguar foraging strategies. In this study, we reconstructed jaguar diet from scat, and used camera traps to investigate jaguar prey availability and the distribution of jaguar and its prey through space and time. We focused our examination of predator-prey temporal and spatial relations on forest infrastructure comprising man-made paths, small mammal trails, tapir Tapirus bairdi trail and trail-less, forested areas as they represent distinct habitats for prey selection. Overall, we observed high overlap between the prey used and available, suggestive of opportunistic foraging. However, jaguars exhibited selective tendencies in discriminating between larger prey. Jaguars used collared peccary Tayassu tajacu greater than its availability, while preying upon the equally abundant and similarly distributed white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari and tapir less than predicted based upon availability. Armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus and paca Agouti paca, 56.6% of total consumption, were consumed relative to availability but exhibited low spatial overlap with jaguar. Armadillo and paca used trail-less, forested areas and small mammal trails not used by jaguar and were photographed more frequently at greater distances from man-made paths, major thoroughfares for jaguars. This study suggests that although forest jaguars use prey relative to its abundance, jaguars may rely on foraging strategies other than chance encounters for exploiting prey.

TI Motivations for the restoration of ecosystems
SO CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE climate change; ecological restoration; natural capital
ID RECOVERY; FOREST; LIFE
AB The reasons ecosystems should be restored are numerous, disparate, generally understated, and commonly underappreciated. We offer a typology in which these reasons-or motivations-are ordered among five rationales: technocratic, biotic, heuristic, idealistic, and pragmatic. The technocratic rationale encompasses restoration that is conducted by government agencies or other large organizations to satisfy specific institutional missions and mandates. The biotic rationale for restoration is to recover lost aspects of local biodiversity. The heuristic rationale attempts to elicit or demonstrate ecological principles and biotic expressions. The idealistic rationale consists of personal and cultural expressions of concern or atonement for environmental degradation, reengagement with nature, and/or spiritual fulfillment. The pragmatic rationale seeks to recover or repair ecosystems for their capacity to provide a broad array of natural services and products upon which human economies depend and to counteract extremes in climate caused by ecosystem loss. We propose that technocratic restoration, as currently conceived and practiced, is too narrow in scope and should be broadened to include the pragmatic rationale whose overarching importance is just beginning to be recognized. We suggest that technocratic restoration is too authoritarian, that idealistic restoration is overly restricted by lack of administrative strengths, and that a melding of the two approaches would benefit both. Three recent examples are given of restoration that blends the technocratic, idealistic, and pragmatic rationales and demonstrates the potential for a more unified approach. The biotic and heuristic rationales can be satisfied within the contexts of the other rationales.

AB Ecosystems and the species and communities within them are highly complex systems that defy predictions with any degree of certainty. Managing and conserving these systems in the face of uncertainty remains a daunting challenge, particularly with respect to developing networks of marine reserves. Here we review several modelling frameworks that explicitly acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty, and then use these methods to evaluate reserve spacing rules given increasing levels of uncertainty about larval dispersal distances. Our approach finds similar spacing rules as have been proposed elsewhere - roughly 20-200 km - but highlights several advantages provided by uncertainty modelling over more traditional approaches to developing these estimates. In particular, we argue that uncertainty modelling can allow for (1) an evaluation of the risk associated with any decision based on the assumed uncertainty; (2) a method for quantifying the costs and benefits of reducing uncertainty; and (3) a useful tool for communicating to stakeholders the challenges in managing highly uncertain systems. We also argue that incorporating rather than avoiding uncertainty will increase the chances of successfully achieving conservation and management goals.

AB We analyzed data sets on phytomass production, basal cover, and monthly precipitation of a semiarid grassland in South Africa for good, medium, and poor rangeland condition (a) to investigate whether phytomass production per unit of basal cover differed among rangeland conditions, (b) to quantify the time scales of a carryover effect from production in previous months, and (c) to construct predictive models for monthly phytomass. Finally, we applied the best models to a 73-year data set of monthly precipitation data to study the long-term variability of grassland production. Our results showed that mean phytomass production per unit of basal cover did not vary significantly among the rangeland conditions-that is, vegetated patches in degraded grassland have approximately the same production as vegetated patches in grassland in good condition. Consequently, the stark decline in production with increasing degradation is a first-order effect of reduced basal area. Current-year precipitation accounted for 64%, 62%, and 36% of the interannual variation in phytomass production for good, medium, and poor condition, respectively. We found that 61%, 68%, and 33%, respectively, of the unexplained variation is related to a memory index that combines mean monthly temperature and a memory of past precipitations. We found a carryover effect in production from the previous 4 years for grassland in good condition and from the previous I or 3S month for grassland in medium and poor condition. The memory effect amplified the response of production to changes in precipitation due to alternation of prolonged periods of dry or wet years/months at the time scale of the memory. The interannual variability in phytomass production per unit basal cover (coefficient of variation [CV] = 0.42-0.50 for our 73-year prediction, CV = 0.57-0.71 for the 19-ycar data) was greater than the corresponding temporal variability in seasonal rainfall (CV = 0.29).

AB A general description of rocky shore distribution patterns ("zonation") along the whole Portuguese coast is given to provide the context for comparisons of distribution patterns of mid-shore organisms. In order to test if there was any variation in species distribution and abundance in the upper and lower mid-shore zone (eulittoral) along the entire intertidal Portuguese coast, three main regions were studied (north, centre and south) and nine shores were visited in each region. At each one of the 27 locations, the shore was levelled and a general qualitative description was made, which also aided stratification of subsequent quantitative sampling. An upper zone (littoral fringe) characterised by the presence of encrusting lichens, small littorinid gastropods and cyanobacteria was found on most of the shores along the Portuguese coast. The mid-shore zone (eulittoral) is essentially dominated by barnacles and sometimes mussels. The distribution patterns observed on the lower shore (sub-littoral fringe) showed a distinction between northern shores, where large brown algae are present. and shores located in the central and southern regions, essentially dominated by red algal turf species. Multidimensional analysis and the ANOSIM test have revealed clear differences in the structure of the upper and lower mid-shore zone. Within each level, the northern region was considerably different from the south and central regions, SIMPER analysis revealed the species which contributed to the separation between shore levels and regions. It has also given important information on the geographical decline in abundance of species.

AB Modern coexistence theory and contemporary niche theory represent parallel frameworks for understanding the niche's role in species coexistence. Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show, for a general consumer-resource model, that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.

AB Grazing lawns are a distinct grassland community type, characterised by short-stature and with their persistence and spread promoted by grazing. In Africa, they reveal a long co-evolutionary history of grasses and large mammal grazers. The attractiveness to grazers of a low-biomass sward lies in the relatively high quality of forage, largely due to the low proportion of stem material in the sward; this encourages repeat grazing that concomitantly suppresses tall-grass growth forms that would otherwise outcompete lawn species for light. Regular grazing that prevents shading and maintains sward quality is thus the cornerstone of grazing lawn dynamics. The strong interplay between abiotic conditions and disturbance factors, which are central to grazing lawn existence, can also cause these systems to be highly dynamic. Here we identify differences in growth form among grazing lawn grass species, and assess how compositional differences among lawn types, as well as environmental variables, influence their maintenance requirements (i.e. grazing frequency) and vulnerability to degradation. We also make a clear distinction between the processes of lawn establishment and lawn maintenance. Rainfall, soil nutrient status, grazer community composition and fire regime have strong and interactive influences on both processes. However, factors that concentrate grazing pressure (e.g. nutrient hotspots and sodic sites) have more bearing on where lawns establish. Similarly, we discuss the relevance of enhanced rates of nitrogen cycling and of sodium levels to lawn maintenance. Grazer community composition and density has considerable significance to grazing lawn dynamics; not all grazers are adapted to foraging on short-grass swards, and differences in body size and relative mouth dimensions determine which species are able to convert tall-grass swards into grazing lawns under different conditions. Hence, we evaluate the roles of different grazers in lawn dynamics, as well as the benefits that grazer populations derive from having access to grazing lawns. The effects of grazing lawns can extend well beyond their borders, due to their influence on grazer densities, behaviour and movements as well as fire spread, intensity and frequency. Variation in the area and proportion of a landscape that is grazing lawn can thus have a profound impact on system dynamics. We provide a conceptual model that summarises grazing lawn dynamics, and identify a rainfall range where we predict grazing lawns to be most prevalent. We also examine the biodiversity associated with grazing lawn systems, and consider their functional contribution to the conservation of this biodiversity. Finally, we assess the utility of grazing lawns as a resource in a rangeland context.

AB In frequently burnt mesic savannas, trees can get trapped into a cycle of surviving fire-induced stem death (i.e. topkill) by resprouting, only to be topkilled again a year or two later. The ability of savanna saplings to resprout repeatedly after fire is a key component of recent models of tree-grass coexistence in savannas. This study investigated the carbon allocation and biomass partitioning patterns that enable a dominant savanna tree, Acacia karroo, to survive frequent and repeated topkill. Root starch depletion and replenishment, foliage recovery and photosynthesis of burnt and unburnt plants were compared over the first year after a burn. The concentration of starch in the roots of the burnt plants (0.08 +/- A 0.01 g g(-1)) was half that of the unburnt plant (0.16 +/- A 0.01 g g(-1)) at the end of the first growing season after topkill. However, root starch reserves of the burnt plants were replenished over the dry season and matched that of unburnt plants within 1 year after topkill. The leaf area of resprouting plants recovered to match that of unburnt plants within 4-5 months after topkill. Shoot growth of resprouting plants was restricted to the first few months of the wet season, whereas photosynthetic rates remained high into the dry season, allowing replenishment of root starch reserves. C-14 labeling showed that reserves were initially utilized for shoot growth after topkill. The rapid foliage recovery and the replenishment of reserves within a single year after topkill implies that A. karroo is well adapted to survive recurrent topkill and is poised to take advantage of unusually long fire-free intervals to grow into adults. This paper provides some of the first empirical evidence to explain how savanna trees in frequently burnt savannas are able to withstand frequent burning as juveniles and survive to become adults.

AB Documenting and understanding patterns of biodiversity is a central issue in biogeography and macroecology. Knowledge about the distribution of biodiversity is also a central prerequisite for its sustainable use and conservation. Due to a greater availability of distribution data, methodological advances, and software tools, important progress has been made during the last decade to map broad-scale geographic gradients of plant species richness and endemism at continental to global scales. In this paper, we provide an overview about recent advances made in this field. We present studies that analyze global-scale diversity patterns of gymnosperms and all vascular plants. Exemplarily for the model continent Africa, we show how biogeographic data can be used to develop broad-scale conservation strategies.

AB [1] The impacts of a 40 ha stand of Eucalyptus camaldulensis in the Pampas grasslands of Argentina were explored for 2 years using a novel combination of sap flow, groundwater data, soil moisture measurements, and modeling. Sap flow measurements showed transpiration rates of 2 - 3.7 mm d(-1), lowering groundwater levels by more than 0.5 m with respect to the surrounding grassland. This hydraulic gradient induced flow from the grassland areas into the plantation and resulted in a rising of the plantation water table at night. Groundwater use estimated from diurnal water table fluctuations correlated well with sap flow ( p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.78). Differences between daily sap flow and the estimates of groundwater use were proportional to changes in surface soil moisture content ( p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.75). E. camaldulensis therefore used both groundwater and vadose zone moisture sources, depending on soil water availability. Model results suggest that groundwater sources represented similar to 67% of total annual water use.

AB Can rates of biomass recovery of fished species be inferred reliably from once-only spatial comparisons of no-take marine reserves of different ages and fished areas? We used underwater visual census at 15 no-take marine reserves in the Philippines to both infer and measure such rates. We made a single estimate of the biomass of large predatory fishes (Serranidae, Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae) targeted heavily by fisheries in each of 13 well protected no-take reserves (age range 0.5 to 13 yr), and in nearby nonreserve (fished) sites. We also measured rates of biomass buildup of these fish regularly for 18 yr (1983 to 2001) in 2 no-take reserves (Sumilon, Apo) and nonreserve sites. The duration of protection required to detect significantly higher reserve biomass was similar, but lower for temporal monitoring (3 to 4 yr) than for spatial comparisons (6 yr). The reserve:nonreserve biomass ratios at maximum duration of reserve protection were similar for inferred (9.0) and measured (6.3 to 9.8) estimates. Thus, results of long-term monitoring of 2 reserves may have regional generality. The inferred rate of change of a reserve effect index (log 10 [Reserve biomass + 1 / Nonreserve biomass + 11) with duration of protection did not differ significantly from the measured rate at Sumilon, but was higher than that measured at Apo. A habitat complexity index did not affect estimates of 'reserve effects' significantly in this study, and reserve protection was generally effective. Thus, using similar methods of reserve protection and census on the same target group in similar areas, one can make useful inferences about rates of recovery in no-take marine reserves.

AB Experiences worldwide reveal that degraded lands restoration projects achieve little success or fail. Hence, understanding the underlying causes and accordingly, devising appropriate restoration mechanisms is crucial. In doing so, the ever-increasing aspiration and global commitments in degraded lands restoration could be realized. Here we explain that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) biotechnology is a potential mechanism to significantly improve the restoration success of degraded lands. There are abundant scientific evidences to demonstrate that AMF significantly improve soil attributes, increase above and belowground biodiversity, significantly improve tree/shrub seedlings survival, growth and establishment on moisture and nutrient stressed soils. AMF have also been shown to drive plant succession and may prevent invasion by alien species. The very few conditions where infective AMF are low in abundance and diversity is when the soil erodes, is disturbed and is devoid of vegetation cover. These are all common features of degraded lands. Meanwhile, degraded lands harbor low levels of infective AMF abundance and diversity. Therefore, the successful restoration of infective AMF can potentially improve the restoration success of degraded lands. Better AMF inoculation effects result when inocula are composed of native fungi instead of exotics, early seral instead of late seral fungi, and are consortia instead of few or single species. Future research efforts should focus on AMF effect on plant community primary productivity and plant competition. Further investigation focusing on forest ecosystems, and carried out at the field condition is highly recommended. Devising cheap and ethically widely accepted inocula production methods and better ways of AMF in situ management for effective restoration of degraded lands will also remain to be important research areas.

AB Non-native plants have invaded nearly all ecosystems and represent a major component of global ecological change. Plant invasions frequently change the composition and structure of vegetation communities, which can alter animal communities and ecosystem processes. We reviewed 87 articles published in the peer-reviewed literature to evaluate responses of arthropod communities and functional groups to non-native invasive plants. Total abundance of arthropods decreased in 62% of studies and increased in 15%. Taxonomic richness decreased in 48% of studies and increased in 13%. Herbivorous arthropods decreased in response to plant invasions in 48% of studies and increased in 17%, likely due to direct effects of decreased plant diversity. Predaceous arthropods decreased in response to invasive plants in 44% of studies, which may reflect indirect effects due to reductions in prey. Twenty-two percent of studies documented increases in predators, which may reflect changes in vegetation structure that improved mobility, survival, or web-building for these species. Detritivores increased in 67% of studies, likely in response to increased litter and decaying vegetation; no studies documented decreased abundance in this functional group. Although many researchers have examined effects of plant invasions on arthropods, sizeable information gaps remain, specifically regarding how invasive plants influence habitat and dietary requirements. Beyond this, the ability to predict changes in arthropod populations and communities associated with plant invasions could be improved by adopting a more functional and mechanistic approach. Understanding responses of arthropods to invasive plants will critically inform conservation of virtually all biodiversity and ecological processes because so many organisms depend on arthropods as prey or for their functional roles, including pollination, seed dispersal, and decomposition. Given their short generation times and ability to respond rapidly to ecological change, arthropods may be ideal targets for restoration and conservation activities. Efectos de las Plantas Invasoras sobre los Artropodos
   Resumen Las plantas no-nativas han invadido casi todos los ecosistemas y representan un gran componente del cambio ecologico global. Las invasiones de plantas cambian frecuentemente la composicion y la estructura de las comunidades vegetales, lo que puede alterar a las comunidades animales y a los procesos ambientales. Revisamos 87 articulos publicados en la literatura revisada por colegas para evaluar las respuestas de las comunidades de artropodos y de los grupos funcionales a las plantas no-nativas invasoras. La abundancia total de artropodos disminuyo en 62% de los estudios e incremento en 15%. La riqueza taxonomica disminuyo en 48% de los estudios e incremento en 13%. Los artropodos herbivoros disminuyeron en respuesta a las plantas invasoras en 48% de los estudios e incrementaron en 17%, probablemente debido a los efectos directos de la diversidad disminuida de plantas. Los artropodos depredadores disminuyeron en respuesta a las plantas invasoras en 44% de los estudios, lo que puede reflejar efectos indirectos debido a reducciones en la cantidad de presas. El 22% de los estudios documentaron incrementos en los depredadores, lo que puede reflejar cambios en la estructura vegetal que mejoraron la movilidad, la supervivencia o la construccion de telaranas de estas especies. Los detritivoros incrementaron en 67% de los estudios, probablemente en respuesta al aumento de basura y vegetacion en descomposicion; ningun estudio documento disminuciones en la abundancia de este grupo funcional. Aunque muchos investigadores han examinado los efectos de las invasiones de plantas sobre los artropodos, todavia existen vacios considerables de informacion, especificamente con respecto a como las plantas invasoras influyen los requerimientos de dieta y habitat. Ademas de esto, la habilidad de predecir los cambios en las poblaciones de artropodos y en las comunidades asociadas con las invasiones de plantas podria mejorarse al adoptar una estrategia mas funcional y mecanica. Entender las respuestas de los artropodos a las plantas invasoras informara criticamente a la conservacion de toda la biodiversidad y de los procesos ecologicos porque tantos organismos dependen de los artropodos como presa o para sus papeles funcionales, como la polinizacion, la dispersion de semillas y la descomposicion. Dados sus tiempos cortos de generacion y su habilidad de responder rapidamente al cambio ecologico, los artropodos pueden ser objetivos ideales para las actividades de conservacion y restauracion.

TI Is there a 'browse trap'? Dynamics of herbivore impacts on trees and

AB Despite widespread acknowledgement that large mammal herbivory can strongly affect vegetation structure in savanna, we still lack a theoretical and practical understanding of savanna dynamics in response to herbivory.
   Like fire, browsing may impose height-structured recruitment limitations on trees (i.e. a 'browse trap'), but the demographics of herbivore effects have rarely been considered explicitly. Evidence that cohorts of trees in savannas may establish during herbivore population crashes and persist long term in savanna landscapes is anecdotal.
   Here, we use an experimental approach in Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park in South Africa, examining the response of grass biomass and tree populations to 10years of graduated herbivore exclusion, and their subsequent response when exclosures were removed.
   We found that grazer exclusion increased grass biomass and that, despite presumable increases in fire intensity and grass competition, herbivore - especially mesoherbivore, including impala and nyala - exclusion resulted in increases in tree size. After herbivore reintroduction, grazers reduced grass biomass over short time-scales, but tree release from browsing persisted, regardless of tree size.
   Synthesis. This work provides the first experimental evidence that release from browsing trumps grazer-grass-fire interactions to result in increases in tree size that persist even after browser reintroduction. Escape from the 'browse trap' may be incremental and not strictly episodic, but, over longer time-scales, reductions in browsing pressure may lead to tree establishment events in savanna that persist even during periods of intense browsing. Explicitly considering the temporal demographic effects of browsing will be the key for a much-needed evaluation of the potential global extent of herbivore impacts in savanna.

AB The phenology of 19 species of plants was followed for two years at Serra Talhada, Pernambuco Stare, Northeastern Brazil. Ten plants of each species were monitored biweekly. All plants had a complete canopy cover from February (well established rainy season) until May-June (just after rains ceased), and all but a few individuals, belonging to six species, were leafless in October-November (peak of the dry season). Leaf fall and flush, flowering, and fruiting were almost continuous in the community throughout both the years, but they peaked at different periods. The peak of leaf flush preceded the rainy season, spurred by occasional rains, followed by flowering early in the rainy season, and then fruiting. Leaf fall became more pronounced after the rainy season. The species covered a whole range of deciduousness, from those which retained their leaves throughout both years to those which were leafless during 6-7 months each year. This was mostly due to the capacity of leaf retention after the onset of the dry season. Autochoric and zoochoric species produced fruits mostly during the rainy season and anemochoric species during the dry period. The patterns of flowering and fruiting were complex. One species did not produce flowers or fruits in either year; five produced flowers and fruits in one year only and two others produced flowers in both years but fruits in only one. Most of the other species had high intraspecific synchrony and produced flowers for a shorter period than fruits.

AB Poaceae (the grasses) is arguably the most successful plant family, in terms of its global occurrence in (almost) all ecosystems with angiosperms, its ecological dominance in many ecosystems, and high species richness. We suggest that the success of grasses is best understood in context of their capacity to colonize, persist, and transform environments (the "Viking syndrome"). This results from combining effective long-distance dispersal, efficacious establishment biology, ecological flexibility, resilience to disturbance and the capacity to modify environments by changing the nature of fire and mammalian herbivory. We identify a diverse set of functional traits linked to dispersal, establishment and competitive abilities. Enhanced long-distance dispersal is determined by anemochory, epizoochory and endozoochory and is facilitated via the spikelet (and especially the awned lemma) which functions as the dispersal unit. Establishment success could be a consequence of the precocious embryo and large starch reserves, which may underpin the extremely short generation times in grasses. Post-establishment genetic bottlenecks may be mitigated by wind pollination and the widespread occurrence of polyploidy, in combination with gametic self-incompatibility. The ecological competitiveness of grasses is corroborated by their dominance across the range of environmental extremes tolerated by angiosperms, facilitated by both C-3 and C-4 photosynthesis, well-developed frost tolerance in several clades, and a sympodial growth form that enabled the evolution of both annual and long-lived life forms. Finally, absence of investment in wood (except in bamboos), and the presence of persistent buds at or below ground level, provides tolerance of repeated defoliation (whether by fire, frost, drought or herbivores). Biotic modification of environments via feedbacks with herbivory or fire reinforce grass dominance leading to open ecosystems. Grasses can be both palatable and productive, fostering high biomass and diversity of mammalian herbivores. Many grasses have a suite of architectural and functional traits that facilitate frequent fire, including a tufted growth form, and tannin-like substances in leaves which slow decomposition. We mapped these traits over the phylogeny of the Poales, spanning the grasses and their relatives, and demonstrated the accumulation of traits since monocots originated in the mid-Cretaceous. Although the sympodial growth form is a monocot trait, tillering resulting in the tufted growth form most likely evolved within the grasses. Similarly, although an ovary apparently constructed of a single carpel evolved in the most recent grass ancestor, spikelets and the awned lemma dispersal units evolved within the grasses. Frost tolerance and C-4 photosynthesis evolved relatively late (late Palaeogene), and the last significant trait to evolve was probably the production of tannins, associated with pyrophytic savannas. This fits palaeobotanical data, suggesting several phases in the grass success story: from a late Cretaceous origin, to occasional tropical grassland patches in the later Palaeogene, to extensive C-3 grassy woodlands in the early-middle Miocene, to the dramatic expansion of the tropical C-4 grass savannas and grasslands in the Pliocene, and the C-3 steppe grasslands during the Pleistocene glacial periods. Modern grasslands depend heavily on strongly seasonal climates, making them sensitive to climate change.

AB In Australia, as in many countries, there has been a shift in timber production from native forests to plantations. While plantations are primarily considered an efficient means of producing timber, there is increasing interest in their potential contribution to biodiversity conservation. Plantations may have both positive and negative consequences for biodiversity, at a range of scales. We compiled a list of these consequences from the literature, and used them to assess plantation scenarios proposed for cleared rainforest landscapes in tropical and subtropical Australia. The scenarios were monocultures of: (i) hoop pine, (ii) exotic pine and (iii) eucalypts; (iv) mixed species plantations; (v) a mosaic of monoculture plantations; and (vi) a mosaic of plantations and ecological restoration plantings. Of these scenarios, plantations of eucalypts and exotic pines have the least positive consequences for biodiversity: they have little or no intrinsic value in rainforest landscapes, provide poor quality habitat for rainforest biota, and (particularly eucalypts) are characterised by a relatively open canopy which in cleared landscapes favours the recruitment of grasses and other weeds. The three scenarios based on plantations of rainforest trees have similar, moderately positive consequences for biodiversity, while a mosaic of plantations and restoration plantings has the most positive consequences for biodiversity in cleared rainforest landscapes. All scenarios may have negative impacts on biodiversity conservation if plantations replace remnant forest, provide habitat for weeds, or the tree species used in plantations or their genes escape into native forests. In practice, the relative importance of positive and negative impacts, and hence the ranking of scenarios may vary with landscape forest cover. Scenarios with strongly positive consequences for biodiversity would be favoured for the reforestation of heavily cleared landscapes, whereas scenarios with few negative consequences for biodiversity would be favoured in well-forested landscapes. Consequently, any plantation of rainforest trees may have acceptable consequences for biodiversity in well-forested landscapes, provided the trees are not invasive or carrying exotic genotypes, and plantations are managed to control weeds and feral animals. With the same caveats, plantations of exotic pines may also be acceptable from a biodiversity conservation perspective in well-forested landscapes. At present, our capacity to design and manage rainforest plantations for both timber and biodiversity objectives is limited by a lack of information on factors affecting timber production, biodiversity values and trade-offs or synergies between these objectives. Obtaining this information will require the integration of large-scale, long-term biodiversity research in broadscale plantation projects. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim The central aim of this paper is to localize areas of endemism of the vascular plant flora in the Eastern Alps. Moreover, causes for location and limits of the areas of endemism are assessed.
   Location The study area includes the Eastern European Alps and adjacent lowland areas.
   Methods Analyses were based on 288 vascular plant taxa endemic to the study region, scored in 115 operational geographic units, which were predominantly mountain ranges. For each of these units, number of endemic taxa, range down weighted endemism, environmental variables, elevation of the last glacial maximum ice sheet, and elevation of the snowline during the last glacial maximum, were estimated. To evaluate the relationships between the geographical areas, the presence/absence matrix of endemics in areas was used to calculate phenograms and cladograms. Values from the range down weighted endemism superimposed on phenograms and cladograms were used to indicate areas of endemism. Linear regressions between richness in endemism and environmental as well as palaeo-environmental variables were used to infer causes of the observed patterns of endemism.
   Results The endemic taxa of the Eastern Alps show a very uneven distribution, the majority being confined to one or few mountain ranges. High levels of endemism are found in the southern, southeastern, easternmost, and northeastern Eastern Alps. Trees obtained from phenetic and cladistic methods were largely congruent. Seven areas of endemism were clearly delimited, all in regions that are regarded as glacial refugia. Two of them are located on siliceous, four on calcareous bedrock. Not all endemic taxa, however, grow in the areas of endemism. Therefore, enlargement areas are suggested. Linear regression showed a significant correlation between high endemism and low glacial ice cover, but not with other environmental variables.
   Main conclusions Vicariance resulting from Pleistocene glaciations is the most important factor causing distributional patterns of endemic plants and the formation of areas of endemism. Mapping values of weighted endemism onto trees facilitated delimitation and definition of the areas of endemism. Because of their strong dependence on siliceous bedrock and the resulting disjunct distributional patterns of some taxa in the Southern Alps, the inclusion of a few operational geographic units with high levels of endemism was not supported by the analyses. Despite post-vicariant dispersal that causes problems in analyses of areas of endemism, the circumscription of areas of endemism in the Eastern Alps was possible to a satisfactory extent. Other methodological approaches, however, which include concepts of post-vicariant dispersal and that allow overlap of areas of endemism would be highly useful.

AB The number of free ranging African lions Panthera leo has never been comprehensively assessed. We present an inventory of available information, covering most protected areas and ranging in quality from educated guesses to individually known populations. This gives a conservative estimate of 16,500-30,000 free ranging lions in Africa. The inventory shows that populations are small and fragmented in West and Central Africa, whereas the species still occurs widely in East and Southern Africa. The results concur with the current IUCN Red List categorization of the lion as Vulnerable.

AB Ecological networks are a useful tool to study the complexity of biotic interactions at a community level. Advances in the understanding of network patterns encourage the application of a network approach in other disciplines than theoretical ecology, such as biodiversity conservation. So far, however, practical applications have been meagre. Here we present a framework for network analysis to be harnessed to advance conservation management by using plant-pollinator networks and islands as model systems. Conservation practitioners require indicators to monitor and assess management effectiveness and validate overall conservation goals. By distinguishing between two network attributes, the 'diversity' and 'distribution' of interactions, on three hierarchical levels (species, guild/group and network) we identify seven quantitative metrics to describe changes in network patterns that have implications for conservation. Diversity metrics are partner diversity, vulnerability/generality, interaction diversity and interaction evenness, and distribution metrics are the specialization indices d' and H'(2), and modularity. Distribution metrics account for sampling bias and may therefore be suitable indicators to detect human-induced changes to plant-pollinator communities, thus indirectly assessing the structural and functional robustness and integrity of ecosystems. We propose an implementation pathway that outlines the stages that are required to successfully embed a network approach in biodiversity conservation. Most importantly, only if conservation action and study design are aligned by practitioners and ecologists through joint experiments, are the findings of a conservation network approach equally beneficial for advancing adaptive management and ecological network theory. We list potential obstacles to the framework, highlight the shortfall in empirical, mostly experimental, network data and discuss possible solutions.

AB In ecosystems, species interact with other species directly and through abiotic factors in multiple ways, often forming complex networks of various types of ecological interaction. Out of this suite of interactions, predator-prey interactions have received most attention. The resulting food webs, however, will always operate simultaneously with networks based on other types of ecological interaction, such as through the activities of ecosystem engineers or mutualistic interactions. Little is known about how to classify, organize and quantify these other ecological networks and their mutual interplay. The aim of this paper is to provide new and testable ideas on how to understand and model ecosystems in which many different types of ecological interaction operate simultaneously. We approach this problem by first identifying six main types of interaction that operate within ecosystems, of which food web interactions are one. Then, we propose that food webs are structured among two main axes of organization: a vertical (classic) axis representing trophic position and a new horizontal 'ecological stoichiometry' axis representing decreasing palatability of plant parts and detritus for herbivores and detrivores and slower turnover times. The usefulness of these new ideas is then explored with three very different ecosystems as test cases: temperate intertidal mudflats; temperate short grass prairie; and tropical savannah.

AB Pollen limitation (PL) of seed production creates unique conditions for reproductive adaptation by angiosperms, in part because, unlike under ovule or resource limitation, floral interactions with pollen vectors can contribute to variation in female success. Although the ecological and conservation consequences of PL have received considerable attention in recent times, its evolutionary implications are poorly appreciated. To identify general influences of PL on reproductive adaptation compared with those under other seed-production limits and their implications for evolution in altered environments, we derive a model that incorporates pollination and post-pollination aspects of PL. Because PL always favours increased ovule fertilization, even when population dynamics are not seed limited, it should pervasively influence selection on reproductive traits. Significantly, under PL the intensity of inbreeding does not determine whether outcrossing or autonomous selfing can evolve, although it can affect which response is most likely. Because the causes of PL are multifaceted in both natural and anthropogenically altered environments, the possible outcrossing solutions are diverse and context dependent, which may contribute to the extensive variety of angiosperm reproductive characteristics. Finally, the increased adaptive options available under PL may be responsible for positive global associations between it and angiosperm diversity.

AB We present the approach and results of an intuitive, expert-based mapping exercise to identify subtropical thicket (including Acocks' (1953) Valley Bushveld, Noorsveld and Spekboomveld) vegetation types as features for conservation planning. The study area comprised 105 500km(2) in southern and south-eastern South Africa, the planning domain for the Subtropical Thicket Ecosystem Planning (STEP) Project. We developed a four-tier typological hierarchy based on geography, floristics, structure and grain. This yielded 112 unique thicket vegetation types, 78 of which comprised thicket clumps in a matrix of non-thicket vegetation (mosaics). By identifying mosaics, we expanded the subtropical thicket concept and increased its extent in the study area by between 1.8 and 2.8 times that of earlier assessments. We also compiled a list of plant species that yielded a rich flora of 1 558 species, 20% of which are endemic to our expanded thicket biome. Consistent with previous studies, endemics were strongly associated with succulent members of the Aizoaceae, Asphodelaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Apocynaceae and Crassulaceae. We discuss our results in terms of Acocks'(1953) typology as well as those of more recent treatments, and comment on the evolution of subtropical thicket vegetation. Although some confusion regarding the delimitation and characterisation of thicket was resolved by this study, much more research is required to develop and test hypotheses on the determinants of thicket boundaries and the origins and evolution of thicket species.

AB The polysaccharolytic enzymes of the abalone Haliotis midae and its resident gut bacteria were investigated. Bacteria isolated from the abalone gut were able to degrade the polysaccharides laminarin, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), alginate, agarose and carrageenan. Detection of alginate lyase, CMCase, laminarinase, agarase and carrageenase in the hepatopancreas, which was devoid of bacteria, indicated that H. midae produces a range of polysaccharases. The endogenous polysaccharases of abalone fed either Ecklonia maxima or Gracilaria verrucosa varied in response to diet. It is proposed that bacteria resident in the digestive system of H. midae assist in the digestion of alginate, laminarin, agarose, carrageenan and cellulose. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB During 2014-2016, severe marine heatwaves in the northeast Pacific triggered well-documented disturbances including mass mortalities, harmful algal blooms, and declines in subtidal kelp beds. However, less attention has been directed towards understanding how changes in sea surface temperature (SST) and alongshore currents during this period influenced the geographic distribution of coastal taxa. Here, we examine these effects in northern California, USA, with a focus on the region between Point Reyes and Point Arena. This region represents an important biogeographic transition zone that lies < 150 km north of Monterey Bay, California, where numerous southern species have historically reached their northern (poleward) range limits. We report substantial changes in geographic distributions and/or abundances across a diverse suite of 67 southern species, including an unprecedented number of poleward range extensions (37) and striking increases in the recruitment of owl limpets (Lottia gigantea) and volcano barnacles (Tetraclita rubescens). These ecological responses likely arose through the combined effects of extreme SST, periods of anomalous poleward flow, and the unusually long duration of heatwave events. Prolonged marine heatwaves and enhanced poleward dispersal may play an important role in longer-term shifts in the composition of coastal communities in northern California and other biogeographic transition zones.

AB This study explores the social, economic, and ecological context within which communities in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia use adaptive coral reef management. We tested whether periodic closures had positive effects on reef resources, and found that both the biomass and the average size of fishes commonly caught in Indo-Pacific subsistence fisheries were greater inside areas subject to periodic closures compared to sites with year-round open access. Surprisingly, both long-lived and short-lived species benefited from periodic closures. Our study sites were remote communities that shared many socioeconomic characteristics; these may be crucial to the effectiveness of adaptive management of reef resources through periodic closures. Some of these factors include exclusive tenure over marine resources, a body of traditional ecological knowledge that allows for the rapid assessment of resource conditions, social customs that facilitate compliance with closures, relatively small human populations, negligible migration, and a relatively low dependence on fisheries. This dynamic adaptive management system, in which communities manage their resources among multiple social and ecological baselines, contrasts with western fisheries management practices, centered on maintaining exploited populations at stable levels in which net production is maximized.

AB Although acacias are ecologically and economically important, their demography is poorly known. In part this is because few field experiments have been undertaken. Also, a bewildering diversity of factors have been suggested to determine their demography. These factors include disease, fire, large and small browsers and grazers, climatic variation, competition with grass, seed predation and anthropogenic impacts. This synthesis concentrates on the life-history period from seed to adult plant and indicates that important hurdles have been demonstrated for some species in some habitats. Seed and seedling limitation have not been clearly demonstrated, nor has the value of dispersal been quantified. In contrast, the impacts of herbivores and fire in affecting the escape or release of resprouts has been repeatedly demonstrated. Whether fire and herbivory merely slow down the rate of promotion through size-classes or actually prevent it, needs further work. We note that very little comparative work amongst Acacia species has taken place. Most studies have concentrated on single aspects of their life history (especially seed predation), and have not been analysed in relation to population growth. Few field experiments, especially concerning seedling biology, have been performed. We conclude with some suggestions of a framework for interpreting acacia demography.

AB Root exclusion experiments demonstrated the importance of belowground competition between grasses and Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite) during the critical seeding establishment phase of the woody plant life cycle. Belowground available volume accounted for 67% and 79% of the variance in first- and second-year Prosopis seedling growth and survival, respectively. Available volume in the vertical dimension was more important than that in the horizontal dimension. Trials spanned years with contrasting annual precipitation, suggesting that root competition occurs in years of near-average as well as below-average annual rainfall. Spatial heterogeneity in canopy gaps and belowground biomass was also quantified in a Schizachayriuim-Paspalum grassland matrix and evaluated with respect to Prosopis seedling establishment. Of the 100 grid points encountered in four grass stands, 62% were unoccupied; and 50% of these exceeded 80 cm(2) (similar to10 cm diameter). Gaps greater than or equal to 10 cm in diameter were sufficient for successful Prosopis germination and survival after one (40%) and two (15%) growing seasons. Herbaceous root biomass was statistically comparable among stands, but point-specific biomass varied three orders of magnitude (<50 g/m(2) to >3000 g/m(2)). In addition, root biomass was temporally variable, ranging from a mean (+/-1 SE; g/m(2)) of 768 (86) in a year of below-average annual rainfall (1996; 721 mm) to 1108 (104) in a year of roughly average annual rainfall (1995; 1032 rum). It is often assumed that grasslands dominated by productive, late seral species will be resistant to woody plant encroachment; and that grazing, by reducing the ability of grasses to competitively exclude woody seedlings, makes grasslands susceptible to tree/shrub invasion. However, given the substantial annual variation in belowground biomass observed in this study, it seems reasonable that ungrazed grasslands may be more susceptible to woody plant encroachment in some years and more resistant in others. Furthermore, given the substantial spatial variation in aboveground gap area and belowground biomass, there may be numerous low-competition microsites for woody plant seedlings within ungrazed grasslands. A high degree of temporal and spatial variability in gap area and belowground biomass may therefore help explain successful establishment of woody seedlings in ungrazed or lightly grazed, late seral grasslands in the absence of fire. We found no correlation between aboveground structure and belowground biomass at scales of 1-10 m(2). Thus, readily quantifiable attributes such as grass basal area or gap area could not be used to infer site susceptibility to woody plant seedling establishment.

AB Permanent sample plot (PSP) studies play a major role in ecological and management research. Bias and error may arise in such studies at each stage of the assessment procedure from plot establishment through to data interpretation, and can undermine confidence in the use of PSP data. This paper considers these problems and suggests how they might be identified and minimised. Examples are taken from Budongo Forest, Uganda, which provides some of the world's longest-term PSP data from both primary and treated tropical forest (1939-1993 and 1933-1992 respectively).
   Three distinct types of artefact in PSP studies are recognised: errors in methodology, impact of methodology, and inappropriate analysis. Deficiencies in each aspect of plot evaluation can have considerable influence on the evaluation of change with time and of differences between sites. Each technique can be controlled and/or improved. Data correction and 'harmonisation' procedures are discussed. Interpretation of PSP data must consider the many pitfalls of assessing such complex data. Some of the central considerations in data interpretation are reviewed and critical areas are defined e.g. time period between observations influences the evaluation of dynamic quantities. Some conclusions disagree with those of other authors. The most significant factors identified (many with implications for vegetation monitoring generally) are summarised and a set of recommendations is provided.

AB 1. We examined survival and recruitment (into the breeding population) in three cohorts of western gulls Larus occidentalis (Audubon) in relation to brood size at hatching, hatching order and hatching date. We divided the pre-breeding period into four stages: (i) the natal stage-'pre-fledging' from hatching to independence; (ii) the juvenile stage-the period from independence to age 1 year; (iii) the subadult stage- the second and third years of life; and (iv) the recruitment stage-the period when adults breed for the first time.
   2. Hatching date and hatching order (in order of importance) each had a strong, negative effect on survival in the natal stage. Brood size had little effect on natal survival; however, after controlling for hatching date there was a significant negative effect. Juvenile survival covaried positively with brood size, negatively with hatching date, and negatively (but weakly) with hatching order. No variate correlated with survival in the subadult stage; however, recruitment probability of adults covaried negatively with hatching date. Effects of each variate did not reflect confounding by parental age.
   3. Of the three variables, only the effect of hatching date varied between cohorts, and only in the natal stage.
   4. The post-fledging survival advantage of hatching early in the season (expressed in the juvenile and recruitment stages) may reflect a direct effect; chicks fledging early in the season may establish lasting dominance over other chicks, and/or an indirect effect (better parental quality). We suggest that the post-fledging advantage of hatching into a large brood probably reflects a direct effect; competitive abilities may covary positively with brood size due to interaction between siblings, and/or an indirect effect (parental quality).
   5. Relative recuitment rate of different cohorts was accurately predicted by natal survival. However, natal survival was a poor indicator of the probability that a given hatchling recruited because of selection occurring post-fledging on differences related to brood size and to a lesser extent on hatching order and hatching date. As a result, each parent's reproductive success was poorly measured by natal survival of their young. The data suggest that survival of young to age 1 year provides a more reliable estimate of recruitment probability and a parent's reproductive success.

AB Aim This study aimed to detect distribution patterns and identify diversity hotspots for Chinese endemic woody seed plant species (CEWSPS). Location China. Methods Presence of 6885 CEWSPS throughout China was mapped by taking the Chinese administrative county as the basic spatial analysis unit. The diversity was measured with five indices: endemic richness (ER), weighted endemism (WE), phylogenetic diversity (PD), phylogenetic endemism (PE) and biogeographically weighted evolutionary distinctiveness (BED). Three levels of area (i.e. 1, 5 and 10% of Chinas total land area) were used to identify hotspots, but the 5% level was preferred when both the total area of the hotspots identified and the diversity of CEWSPS reached by the hotspots were considered. Results Distribution patterns of CEWSPS calculated with the five indices are consistent with each other over the national extent. However, the hotspots do not show a high degree of consistency among the results derived from the five indices. Those identified with ER and PD are very similar, and so are those with WE and BED. In total, 20 hotspots covering 7.9% of Chinas total land area were identified, among which 11 were identified with all the five indices, including the Hengduan Mountains, Xishuangbanna Region, Hainan Island, and eight mountainous areas located in east Chongqing and west Hubei, in east Yunnan and west Guangxi, in north Guangxi, south-east Guizhou and south-west Hunan, in north Guangdong and south Hunan, in south-east Tibet, and in south-east Hubei and north-west Jiangxi. Taiwan Island was also identified as a major hotspot with WE, PE and BED. Main conclusions Hotspots of CEWSPS were identified with five indices considering both distributional and phylogenetic information. They cover most of the key areas of biodiversity defined by previous researchers using other approaches. This further verifies the importance of these areas for Chinas biodiversity conservation.

AB We analysed simulated connectivity patterns for reef fish larvae in the Cairns section of the Great Barrier Reef, and identified 2 key subregions that exhibit regional scale source-sink dynamics. The source and sink were separated latitudinally by a boundary at 16.1 degrees S, with the source subregion lying to the north. Larval transport between the 2 subregions was predominantly unidirectional, from north to south. Only a few local populations, described here as 'gateway reefs', were able to transport larvae from the sink subregion to the source subregion and thus maintain the connectedness of the metapopulation. The northern subregion was able to persist without external larval supply, but when conditions were recruitment limited, the southern Subregion depended on larval supply from the north to persist. The relative autonomy of the northern subregion, and its importance in sustaining the Southern subregion, will influence the effectiveness of conservation efforts.

TI The spread of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta, Dougl.) in New Zealand
SO FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE lodgepole pine; natural regeration; New Zealand
ID INVASIONS
AB Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta, Dougl.) was introduced to New Zealand in about 1880. It is the most vigorous naturally regenerating introduced conifer, which has led to large areas of unwanted spread or 'wildings'. Wildings threaten existing indigenous flora and fauna, visual landscape and land use values. The area affected by all conifer natural regeneration is estimated at 150,000 ha of which approximately two thirds is lodgepole pine. Control operations have been undertaken in New Zealand since the 1960s. The high 'weed' potential of lodgepole pine, coupled with its low grower and market acceptance in New Zealand, means that the species is seldom planted nowadays.
   Lodgepole pine spreads more Vigorously than other introduced conifers as it cones earlier, is capable of producing seed and wildings at higher altitudes, and has lighter seed allowing dispersal over wide areas.
   Spread occurs most readily on ungrazed land with low vegetation density, and is least likely to occur in intact, dense vegetation, or where intensive grazing is practiced. Direction and distance of spread from parent trees is predictable. Most wildings occur initially as fringe spread within 50 m downwind of parent trees. Distant spread (measured in kilometers) is usually associated with trees on take-off sites exposed to the wind, such as hilltops and ridges. Spread commonly occurs in 'waves', about once every 5 years for fringe spread, and once every 10-20 years for distant spread.
   Research on seed production, dissemination and the factors influencing seedling establishment has resulted in the development of strategies for the prevention and control of spread. The major aspects to consider for new plantings are siting, planting design and surrounding land management. Where large areas of spread exist, containment is often the most practical recommendation. Eradication is by burning, hand pulling (small seedlings only), felling and application of chemicals to stumps or foliage.
   Lodgepole pine was the first conifer to attract significant adverse attention due to its propensity for natural regeneration, but concern about the spread of introduced conifers is now general, especially in the hill and high country grasslands of the eastern South Island. This concern has been promoted by new 'effects-based' resource management legislation which is currently being implemented by territorial authorities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Reproductive phenology of 13 sympatric taxa of Chamaecrista in three sections was surveyed at Serra do Cipo, south-east Brazil. Mean abundance of flowers and fruits per plant and mean number of aborted, predated, and surviving seeds per fruit were estimated, Monthly average number of developed seeds per fruit multiplied by the monthly mean number of fruits per plant gave the monthly average number of seeds produced by a plant of each taxon. Five types of phenological behaviour were differentiated by cluster analyses according to the season during which each species produced most of its mature seeds. This behaviour was related to the taxonomic section to which the taxa belong, to plant architecture, to geographical range, to seed predation and to local climatic seasonality. Herbs were more affected by variation in rainfall than shrubs and trees. Two species did not show any clear seasonal behaviour. Widespread taxa produced most of their mature seeds in the rainy season or immediately after it, and all but one of the narrowly distributed species produced most of their mature seeds in the dry season or in the transition from dry to rainy season. Seed predation is probably not an important selective force affecting reproductive phenology of larger taxa, while the smaller taxa seemed too constrained by abiotic factors for biotic factors to influence their phenology significantly.

AB In California, most anostracan crustaceans inhabit ephemeral wetlands, such as vernal peels, mountain meadows, and desert playas with biphasic wet/dry cycles. The shrimps hatch and mature during the aquatic phase and deposit dormant cysts which remain in the soil through the dry phase. In some habitats, due to the variable nature of local rainfall patterns, pools at times fill only partially and dry quickly before the shrimp are able to mature and reproduce. Species in such unpredictable environments produce cysts that do not all hatch when first hydrated. A portion remain dormant and hatch in later pool fillings. We investigated the hatching pattern of two newly described species of anostracans found in unpredictable vernal pools in southern California, U.S.A., Branchinecta sandiegonensis Fugate and Streptocephalus woottoni Eng et al. Hatching rates for these species were among the lowest yet reported for anostracans. Initial hatch from the soil cyst bank was 6% for B. sandiegonensis and 0.18% for S. woottani and cumulative totals were 28% and 2.8%, respectively, over 3 hydrations. Furthermore, hatching variability was demonstrated for the cysts of single pairs. This life-history pattern conforms to the 3 major predictions of models of diversified risk-spreading or bet-hedging strategies as developed for annual plants.

AB A 44-yr record of herbaceous vegetation change was analysed for three contrasting grazing regimes within a semi-arid savanna to evaluate the relative contribution of confined livestock grazing and climatic variability as agents of vegetation change. Grazing intensity had a significant, directional effect on the relative composition of short- and mid-grass response groups; their composition was significantly correlated with time since the grazing regimes were established. Interannual precipitation was not significantly correlated with response group composition. However, interannual precipitation was significantly correlated with total plant basal area while time since imposition of grazing regimes was not, L but both interannual precipitation and tit-no since the grazing regimes were established were significantly correlated with total plant density. Vegetation change was reversible even though the herbaceous community had been maintained in an altered state for ca. 60 yr by intensive livestock grazing. However, ca, 25 yr were required for the mid-grass response group to recover following the elimination of grazing and recovery occurred intermittently. The increase in mid-grass composition was associated with a significant decrease in total plant density and an increase in mean individual plant basal area. Therefore, we failed to reject the hypotheses based on the proportional change in relative response group composition with grazing intensity and the distinct effects of grazing and climatic variability on response group composition, total basal area and plant density. Long-term vegetation change indicates that grazing intensity established the long-term directional change in response group composition, but that episodic climate events defined the short-term rate and trajectory of this change and determines the upper limit on total basal area. The occurrence of both directional and non-directional vegetation responses were largely a function of (1) the unique responses of the various community attributes monitored and (2) the distinct temporal responses of those community attributes to grazing and climatic variation. This interpretation supports previous conclusions that individual ecosystems may exist in equilibrial and non-equilibrial states at various temporal and spatial scales.

AB Dense, conspicuous colonies of seabirds and pinnipeds breed on ocean islands throughout the world. Such colonies have been shown to have local impacts on prey populations, but whether or not they affect nutrient cycling has been debated. We determined the natural abundance levels of the stable isotopes (C and N) of primary producers, seabirds and other consumers at and near St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands, Bering Sea, in summer 1993. Marine primary producers (phytoplankton, as particulate organic matter, and kelp) collected near seabird colonies were ca. 6.5 parts per thousand, enriched in both N-15 and C-13 relative to those collected further from shore. Terrestrial plants collected near the seabird colonies were enriched in N-15 (delta(15)N ca. 22 parts per thousand) compared with conspecifics collected away from the colonies (delta(15)N ca. 11 parts per thousand). The trend towards higher delta(15)N values in marine and terrestrial plants near bird colonies is consistent with their uptake of ornithogenic N. This N-15-enrichment of plants using ornithogenic N can be attributed to a combination of two processes: trophic enrichment, and volatilization of ammonia produced during degradation of terrestrially deposited guano. Seabird breeding colonies at St. Paul Island appear to be significant sources of recycled nitrogen for terrestrial plants in the vicinity of colonies and for phytoplankton in the nearshore zone.

AB AimsClassification of vegetation is an essential tool to describe, understand, predict and manage biodiversity. Given the multiplicity of approaches to classify vegetation, it is important to develop international consensus around a set of general guidelines and purpose-specific standard protocols. Before these goals can be achieved, however, it is necessary to identify and understand the different choices that are made during the process of classifying vegetation. This paper presents a framework to facilitate comparisons between broad-scale plot-based classification approaches.
   ResultsOur framework is based on the distinction of four structural elements (plot record, vegetation type, consistent classification section and classification system) and two procedural elements (classification protocol and classification approach). For each element we describe essential properties that can be used for comparisons. We also review alternative choices regarding critical decisions of classification approaches; with a special focus on the procedures used to define vegetation types from plot records. We illustrate our comparative framework by applying it to different broad-scale classification approaches.
   ConclusionsOur framework will be useful for understanding and comparing plot-based vegetation classification approaches, as well as for integrating classification systems and their sections.

AB There is a large body of evidence indicating that predator behavior may strongly influence patterns and processes at the population and community level. Site selection is a major component of fitness in sit-and-wait predators, especially when relocation is rare. Although several review articles dealt with these issues in web-building spiders, this is the first attempt to summarize the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on site selection and relocation in another group of sit-and-wait predators, the pit-building antlions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae). Our synthesis shows that prey abundance may have relatively little effect on pit relocation and that physical properties of the habitat or competition often override its effect. We suggest that owing to a variety of constraints such as physiological constraints or difficulties in assessing site quality, site selection and relocation are not necessarily optimal and thus food intake rate is not maximized. We call for a multi-factorial study on a single species in order to pinpoint the dominant factors and to assess to what extent they influence site selection and relocation. We conclude by proposing new research directions, such as studying whether pit relocation is an adaptive response, when controlling for possible phylogenetic effects.

AB We examined the relationship between pelagic larval duration (PLD)-a predictor of a species' dispersal potential-and the geographic distribution range of 62 Mediterranean littoral fishes. We found a significant, positive, weak relationship between PLD and distribution range. This relationship was observed in species with long PLDs that can cross the few dispersal barriers (Macaronesian Islands) present in the Mediterranean, and in endemic Mediterranean species with short PLDs. Species with inshore larvae exhibited a shorter PLD than species with offshore larvae. Species with larvae living in spring-summer had shorter PLDs than those developing in autumn-winter. Mean geographic range was clearly smaller for species with inshore larval distributions than for species with offshore larval distributions. However, the geographic range of species with benthic eggs was smaller than that of pelagic spawners. The size of the distribution range of fishes is probably not controlled only by the PLD. The inshore/offshore position and the season of planktonic life play an important role in ensuring the return of larvae to their settlement habitats. Consequently, these factors also affect the size of the species' distribution range.

AB Stable isotope analysis is a powerful tool for unravelling the complex structure of food webs(1-3). This technique is particularly well suited for studies at ecosystem boundaries, where physical processes and mobile consumers link the dynamics of seemingly disparate systems(4-6). In coastal and insular environments, seabirds play a crucial role in transporting marine-based energy and nutrients to islands(7-9). Here we show using stable isotopes that nutrients from the ocean drive the dynamics of terrestrial food webs on small islands. The indirect effects of seabird-derived nutrients on plant productivity are particularly prominent during wet El Nino Southern Oscillation years on our Gulf of California study sites. During dry years that characterize the region, many terrestrial consumers are subsidized by carrion and prey from the ocean. Shifts in trophic structure related to El Nino Southern Oscillation could only be elucidated because of the distinct nitrogen isotope ratios associated with seabird islands. The contributions of seabirds and other marine sources are reflected in the isotope signatures of terrestrial consumers in ways that challenge conventional interpretations of stable isotope results in studies of food webs.

AB Organic fertilizers have the capacity to alter the nitrogen isotopic composition of plants. Camelid dung and seabird guano are two potentially important fertilizers in the agricultural systems of western South America, particularly Peru and Chile. This paper presents isotopic data (delta C-13 and delta N-15) from field grown plants (maize, lea mays) fertilized with the following four treatments: CO (control, no fertilizer applied), AS (ammonium sulfate, a chemical fertilizer), DU (camelid dung), and SG (seabird guano). Plants were grown in experimental plots in the Viru Valley, northern Peru. Plants fertilized with the chemical fertilizer presented very similar isotopic compositions compared to the control. Conversely, the camelid dung fertilized plants were characterized by higher delta N-15 values compared to the control plants (by 1.8 to 4.2 parts per thousand depending on the plant part). The seabird guano fertilized plants were greatly enriched in N-15 in comparison to the control plants (by 11.3 to 20.0 parts per thousand). The results of this study have important implications for the reconstruction of human diet using isotopic data derived from bone collagen and related tissues, particularly in the prehispanic Andes, but also in Europe and North America during the 19th century, when Peruvian seabird guano was used extensively. Specifically, the interpretation of the relative contributions of plant and animal protein to the diet on the basis of bulk isotopic compositions of bone collagen (or similar tissues) may be confounded by camelid dung fertilization if the carbon isotopic compositions of the two sources are similar. Likewise, the interpretation of the relative contributions of maize and marine protein may be confounded by seabird guano fertilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The coastal ocean environment off California is largely determined by wind-driven coastal upwelling, with an ecosystem that is tightly coupled to seasonality in this upwelling. Three decades of data measured over the California shelf at NOAA buoys are used to describe the seasonal variability of the winds that force upwelling and the response of the coastal ocean in terms of sea temperature. Moreover, seasonal patterns in surface chlorophyll and alongshore currents are determined from one decade of data. In addition to clear seasonality, all these data exhibit distinct spatial and non-seasonal temporal variability in upwelling. Based on alongshore wind stress characteristics in central and north California, three seasons are defined: Upwelling Season (April-June) with strong upwelling-favorable winds and large standard deviation due to frequent reversals; Relaxation Season ( July-September) with weak equatorward winds and low variability; and Storm Season ( December-February) characterized by weak mean wind stress but large variability. The remaining months are transitional, falling into one or other season in different years. In addition to large-scale latitudinal differences in wind stress, spatial differences are associated with coastal topography - specifically the acceleration of wind downstream of capes. Latitudinal differences in sea surface temperature depend on wind stress, both local and large-scale, but also on surface heating and offshore influences. Intra-annual and inter-annual anomalies in wind and sea surface temperature are associated with variability in coastal winds, large-scale winds, and offshore basin-scale ocean conditions. Satellite chlorophyll concentration shows an optimal window relation with upwelling forcing, allowing maximum concentrations during moderate winds and minimal during poor or strong winds.

AB Behavior such as ontogenetic vertical migration (OVM) limits the transport of marine larvae with short pelagic larval durations (PLDs), but its effect on the supposed long-distance dispersal of larvae with long PLDs is unknown. We conducted laboratory tests of ontogenetic change in larval phototaxis and examined size-specific patterns of larval distribution in the plankton to characterize OVM in the Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus during its long (6 mo) PLD. We then used a coupled biophysical model to explore the consequences of OVM and hydrodynamics on larval P. argus dispersal in the Caribbean Sea. Larvae reared in the laboratory were positively phototatic for the first 2 mo and then avoided light thereafter, similar that seen in the planktonic distribution of same-sized larvae. Simulations of larval dispersal from 13 spawning sites in the Caribbean Sea predicted that twice as many larvae would recruit to nurseries if they displayed OVM compared with passive dispersers. Larvae with OVM typically settled <400 km from where they were spawned, while passive dispersers often settled >1000 km away. OVM also produced an asymmetrical bimodal pattern of dispersal dominated by larvae that settled near their origin (similar to 60%), but showed a second peak of larvae that dispersed over long distances (similar to 20%). Hydrodynamics created subregional differences in the potential for self-recruitment. Our findings suggest that (1) larval behavior constrains the dispersal of even long-lived larvae, particularly in tandem with retentive oceanographic environments, and (2) larval sources of P. argus in the Caribbean Sea cannot be estimated from passive transport and surface circulation.

AB Invasion by the African grass Andropogon gayanus is drastically altering the understory structure of oligotrophic savannas in tropical Australia. We compared nitrogen (N) relations and phenology of A. gayanus and native grasses to examine the impact of invasion on N cycling and to determine possible reasons for invasiveness of A. gayanus. Andropogon gayanus produced up to 10 and four times more shoot phytomass and root biomass, with up to seven and 2.5 times greater shoot and root N pools than native grass understory. These pronounced differences in phytomass and N pools between A. gayanus and native grasses were associated with an altered N cycle. Most growth occurs in the wet season when, compared with native grasses, dominance of A. gayanus was associated with significantly lower total soil N pools, lower nitrification rates, up to three times lower soil nitrate availability, and up to three times higher soil ammonium availability. Uptake kinetics for different N sources were studied with excised roots of three grass species ex situ. Excised roots of A. gayanus had an over six times higher uptake rate of ammonium than roots of native grasses, while native grass Eriachne triseta had a three times higher uptake rate of nitrate than A. gayanus. We hypothesize that A. gayanus stimulates ammonification but inhibits nitrification, as was shown to occur in its native range in Africa, and that this modification of the soil N cycle is linked to the species' preference for ammonium as an N source. This mechanism could result in altered soil N relations and could enhance the competitive superiority and persistence of A. gayanus in Australian savannas.

AB Several key characteristics of the species-rich orchid family are due to its symbiotic relationships with pollinators and mycorrhizal fungi. The majority of species are insect pollinated and show strong adaptations for outcrossing, such as pollination by food- and sexual-deception, and all orchids are reliant on mycorrhizal fungi for successful seedling establishment. Recent studies of orchid pollination biology have shed light on the barriers to reproductive isolation important to diversification in different groups of deceptive orchids. Molecular identification of orchid mycorrhizal fungi has revealed high fungal specificity in orchids that obtain organic nutrients from fungi as adults. Both pollinator and fungal specificity have been proposed as drivers of orchid diversification. Recent findings in orchid pollination and mycorrhizal biology are reviewed and it is shown that both associations are likely to affect orchid distribution and population structure. Integrating studies of these symbioses will shed light on the unparalleled diversification of the orchid family.

AB 1, Shrub encroachment is reducing the carrying capacity of arid grasslands in southern Africa for cattle. Although shrub-encroachment is known to occur as a result of the selective overgrazing of grasses by cattle, the interactions between rainfall and grazing are not well understood. Both the quantity and sequence of rainfall events are likely to influence the growth rates and competitive abilities of shrubs and grasses.
   2, Shrub encroachment is a slow process and animals are stocked at low densities in arid regions. Thus, field experiments for determining stocking rates that avoid shrub encroachment under various rainfall scenarios are almost impossible to replicate. We used a grid-based simulation model to investigate the shrub-grass dynamics of the southern Kalahari under various realistic rainfall scenarios and stocking rates of domestic livestock. The simulation experiments addressed the following questions: (1) Does simulated cattle grazing lead to shrub encroachment? (2) Over what time scale does the process take place? (3) Are the dynamics of vegetation-change continuous in relation to grazing pressure or do they show a threshold behaviour?
   3. Simulation results indicated that the answers to all three questions depended on the quantity and sequence of rainfall. Simulated cattle grazing led to shrub encroachment under all rainfall scenarios, once stocking rates exceeded a threshold determined by long-term mean annual rainfall.
   4. The stocking rate threshold for shrub encroachment was less distinct (i.e. shrub cover in different simulation experiments had a higher coefficient of variation) under xeric than mesic climatic scenarios. This is because either competition from the herbaceous layer or rain may limit shrub establishment. In relatively mesic scenarios, where shrub encroachment was limited mainly by grass competition, the grazing of grasses beyond a certain threshold led to an almost deterministic increase in shrub cover. However, under xeric climates, where rainfall was lower and more stochastic, the rate of shrub encroachment in response to a given intensity of grazing became less predictable.
   5, The most significant finding of the simulation experiments was that, although the stocking rates currently recommended by pasture scientists are unlikely to lead to shrub encroachment within 20 years, they have a high probability of bringing about shrub encroachment within a century. These findings applied to most of the rainfall scenarios found in the southern Kalahari and are therefore of particular interest to rangeland policy makers in this semi-arid region.

AB Coral reefs are in decline worldwide, and marine reserve networks have been advocated as a powerful management tool for maximizing the resilience of coral communities to an increasing variety, number, and severity of disturbances. However, the effective design of reserves must account for the spatial scales of larval dispersal that affect the demography of communities over ecological time frames. Ecologically relevant distances of dispersal were inferred from DNA microsatellite data in a broadcast-spawning (Acropora tenuis) and a brooding (Seriatopora hystrix) coral at isolated reef systems off northwest Australia. Congruent with expectations based on life histories, levels of genetic subdivision among populations were markedly higher in the brooder than in the broadcast spawner. Additionally, significant subdivision for both species between systems (<100 km), and between (<10 km) or within reefs (<10 km) within systems, indicated that many reefs or reef patches are demographically independent. There was also a clear distinction in the scale of genetic structure between the different systems; at the more geographically complex of the systems, a much finer scale structure was detected in both species. This suggested that the hydrodynamics associated with these complex reefs restrict distances regularly traveled by larvae. The primary implication is that short-term recovery of these coral communities after severe disturbance requires the input of larvae from viable communities kilometers to a few tens of kilometers away. Therefore, to be self-sustaining, we suggest that coral reef protected areas need to be large enough to encompass these routine dispersal distances. Further, to facilitate recovery from severe disturbances, protected areas need to be replicated over these spatial scales. However, specific designs also need to account for size, complexity, and isolation of reefs, which will either restrict or enhance dispersal within this range.

AB Question: Bush encroachment (i.e. an increase in density of woody plants often unpalatable to domestic livestock) is a serious problem in many savannas and threatens the livelihood of many pastoralists. Can we derive a better understanding of the factors causing bush encroachment by investigating the scale dependency of patterns and processes in savannas?
   Location: An and savanna in the Khomas Hochland, Namibia.
   Methods: Patterns of bush, grass, and soil nutrient distribution were surveyed on several scales along a rainfall gradient, with emphasis on intraspecific interactions within the dominant woody species, Acacia reficiens.
   Results: Savannas can be interpreted as patch-dynamic systems where landscapes are composed of many patches (a few ha in size) in different states of transition between grassy and woody dominance.
   Conclusions: In and savannas, this patchiness is driven both by rainfall that is highly variable in space and time and by inter-tree competition. Within the paradigm of patch-dynamic savannas, bush encroachment is part of a cyclical succession between open savanna and woody dominance. The conversion from a patch of open savanna to a bush-encroached area is initiated by the spatial and temporal overlap of several (localized) rainfall events sufficient for Acacia germination and establishment. With time, growth and self-thinning will transform the bush-encroached area into a mature Acacia stand and eventually into open savanna again. Patchiness is sustained due to the local rarity (and patchiness) of rainfall sufficient for germination of woody plants as well as by plant-soil interactions.

   ORIENTATION; TRACKING; ATLANTIC; SYSTEM; MODEL
AB Although oceanic dispersal in larval and juvenile marine animals is widely studied, the relative contributions of swimming behavior and ocean currents to movements and distribution are poorly understood [1-4]. The sea turtle "lost years'' [5] (often referred to as the surface-pelagic [6] or oceanic [7] stage) are a classic example. Upon hatching, young turtles migrate offshore and are rarely observed until they return to coastal waters as larger juveniles [5]. Sightings of small turtles downcurrent of nesting beaches and in association with drifting organisms (e.g., Sargassum algae) led to this stage being described as a "passive migration'' during which turtles' movements are dictated by ocean currents [5-10]. However, laboratory and modeling studies suggest that dispersal trajectories might also be shaped by oriented swimming [11-15]. Here, we use an experimental approach designed to directly test the passive-migration hypothesis by deploying pairs of surface drifters alongside small green (Chelonia mydas) and Kemp's ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) wild-caught turtles, tracking their movements via satellite telemetry. We conclusively demonstrate that these turtles do not behave as passive drifters. In nearly all cases, drifter trajectories were uncharacteristic of turtle trajectories. Species-specific and location-dependent oriented swimming behavior, inferred by subtracting track velocity from modeled ocean velocity, contributed substantially to individual movement and distribution. These findings highlight the importance of in situ observations for depicting the dispersal of weakly swimming animals. Such observations, paired with information on the mechanisms of orientation, will likely allow for more accurate predictions of the ecological and evolutionary processes shaped by animal movement.

AB Large mammalian herbivores are well recognized to play important roles in regulating woody cover and biomass in savannas, but the extent to which browsing ungulates are capable of regulating woody populations in the absence of other disturbances such as fire is unclear. Moreover, the degree to which browser effects on savannas operate through effects on woody plant recruitment vs. mortality has rarely been examined.
   We conducted a 10-year, replicated herbivore exclusion experiment in a semi-arid savanna in East Africa (mean annual rainfall=514mm), where fires have been actively suppressed for decades. Browsers dramatically influenced recruitment, growth and mortality of all size classes of woody vegetation. A decade of herbivore exclusion resulted in a sevenfold increase in recruitment, a 2.5-fold decrease in mortality and a threefold increase in woody biomass inside exclosures, while biomass outside exclosures remained relatively unchanged.
   At the plant community level, extensive browsing of seedlings by small-bodied ungulates suppressed woody recruitment in this semi-arid system, generating a browsing trap' comparable to the fire trap' reported for mesic systems. Browsing by large- and medium-bodied ungulates reduced both growth and survival of individuals in larger size classes.
   At the plant species level, browser impacts were variable. Although browsers negatively influenced recruitment of all species, they had little to no impact on the mortality of some dominant species, resulting in a long-term, browser-driven shift in woody species composition that was largely mediated via their differential effects on plant mortality rates rather than recruitment.
   Synthesis. Our results demonstrate unequivocally that, even in the absence of fire, native browsing ungulates can exert dramatic top-down' controls in semi-arid savannas, influencing all aspects of woody plant demography. Besides suppressing woody plant recruitment, browsers can also have substantial cumulative long-term impacts on growth and mortality rates of woody plants, including adults, which can differ between species in ways that fundamentally alter the structure and function of woody vegetation. In semi-arid rangelands, intact communities of native browsing ungulates thus provide a critical ecosystem service by regulating woody cover, and their removal (or extinction) from these systems can lead to rapid woody encroachment.

AB The stable isotope compositions of biologically precipitated apatite in bone, teeth, and scales are widely used to obtain information on the diet, behavior, and physiology of extinct organisms and to reconstruct past climate. Here we report the application of a new type of geochemical measurement to bioapatite, a "clumped-isotope" paleothermometer, based on the thermodynamically driven preference for C-13 and O-18 to bond with each other within carbonate ions in the bioapatite crystal lattice. This effect is dependent on temperature but, unlike conventional stable isotope paleothermometers, is independent from the isotopic composition of water from which the mineral formed. We show that the abundance of C-13-O-18 bonds in the carbonate component of tooth bioapatite from modern specimens decreases with increasing body temperature of the animal, following a relationship between isotope "clumping" and temperature that is statistically indistinguishable from inorganic calcite. This result is in agreement with a theoretical model of isotopic ordering in carbonate ion groups in apatite and calcite. This thermometer constrains body temperatures of bioapatite-producing organisms with an accuracy of 1-2 degrees C. Analyses of fossilized tooth enamel of both Pleistocene and Miocene age yielded temperatures within error of those derived from similar modern taxa. Clumped-isotope analysis of bioapatite represents a new approach in the study of the thermophysiology of extinct species, allowing the first direct measurement of their body temperatures. It will also open new avenues in the study of paleoclimate, as the measurement of clumped isotopes in phosphorites and fossils has the potential to reconstruct environmental temperatures.

AB To assess the validity of previously developed risk assessment schemes in the conditions of Central Europe, we tested (1) Australian weed risk assessment scheme (WRA; Pheloung et al. 1999); (2) WRA with additional analysis by Daehler et al. (2004); and (3) decision tree scheme of Reichard and Hamilton (1997) developed in North America, on a data set of 180 alien woody species commonly planted in the Czech Republic. This list included 17 invasive species, 9 naturalized but non-invasive, 31 casual aliens, and 123 species not reported to escape from cultivation. The WRA model with additional analysis provided best results, rejecting 100% of invasive species, accepting 83.8% of non-invasive, and recommending further 13.0% for additional analysis. Overall accuracy of the WRA model with additional analysis was 85.5%, higher than that of the basic WRA scheme (67.9%) and the Reichard-Hamilton model (61.6%). Only the Reichard-Hamilton scheme accepted some invaders. The probability that an accepted species will become an invader was zero for both WRA models and 3.2% for the Reichard-Hamilton model. The probability that a rejected species would have been an invader was 77.3% for both WRA models and 24.0% for the Reichard-Hamilton model. It is concluded that the WRA model, especially with additional analysis, appears to be a promising template for building a widely applicable system for screening out invasive plant introductions.

AB [1] Two high-frequency radar stations (CODAR) were installed along the northern California coast in May 2001. Comparisons of radar data with acoustic Doppler current profiler ( ADCP) current data and near-surface drifter tracks indicate considerable agreement, with minimum RMS differences of order 0.05 - 0.15 m/s and average drifter-HF-radar track separation rates of 5 +/- 3 km/d. Radar data resolve the three main sources of intraseasonal current variability in the area: ( 1) upwelling/relaxation dynamics, ( 2) tidal and diurnal forcing, and ( 3) inertial currents. Subtidal fluctuations are the largest component of variability, accounting for 45 - 75% of the variance. Wind-driven dynamics are the dominant source of this subtidal variability (67% of subtidal variability). Both upwelling and relaxation periods exhibit consistent patterns of surface velocity, with nearshore currents being slower and more poleward than offshore currents, which are strongly equatorward. Analysis of tidal and inertial variability indicate that current fluctuations are polarized toward clockwise rotation and are generally weaker and more linearly polarized near the coast. M-2 tidal current ellipses switch direction of rotation at the shelf break, suggesting the presence of internal tidal waves. Currents in all frequency bands are deflected and accelerated around Pt. Reyes, and there are indications of increased current variability and changes in flow direction near Cordell Bank. The presence of considerable cross-shore and alongshore gradients in the strength and direction of surface flow patterns, and in particular weak poleward currents over the inner shelf, could have important consequences for plankton retention in the area.

AB Foraging theory is increasingly used as a framework to analyze prehistoric resource depression, or declines in prey capture rates that stem from the activities of foragers. Resource depression, with the resulting declines in foraging efficiency, appears to be an important variable underlying many behavioral transitions in human prehistory. And, while two of the primary lines of evidence used to document resource depression archaeologically are temporal declines in the relative abundances of 'high-return' species and the mean age of harvested prey, this phenomenon may also be reflected by increases in both high-ranked prey abundances and mean age. These divergent signals are linked to variation in the behavior and spatial distributions of different prey species and are illustrated with the Emeryville Shellmound faunal sequence. More detailed attention should be given to these variables in applications of foraging models to the archaeological record.

AB Increasing the predictive capabilities of ecological models is important for providing solutions to environmental problems. Progress in this direction relies on the understanding of basic ecological processes. Here, I used interaction web models and natural history information to predict the direct and indirect interactions that regulated succession in a relatively unstudied rocky shore assemblage in the northwest Mediterranean. Natural changes in abundance of organisms and general patterns of succession were examined during March 1991-September 1995. It was predicted that limpets enhanced succession by preventing the monopolization of the substratum by filamentous algae, indirectly facilitating the establishment of other colonists, such as the red alga Rissoella verruculosa, cyanobacteria (Rivularia spp,), and barnacles (Chthamalus spp.). This hypothesis was first tested by comparing succession in artificially denuded patches of substratum maintained at reduced densities of herbivores, with similar patches exposed to natural densities. Variability in the effects of limpets was examined in relation to the size of patches and time of clearance. To unravel the pathways of interaction that influenced the outcomes of this long-term experiment, I manipulated separate components of the assemblage at early and late stages of succession. I tested whether the filamentous algae inhibited the establishment of Rissoella and Rivularia in the absence of limpets, and whether grazers could exert direct positive effects on these algae. I also tested whether the colonization of Rissoella and barnacles under the natural grazing regime could reduce the local abundance of limpets, thereby facilitating the establishment of filamentous algae at later stages of succession.
   The filamentous algae monopolized the substratum in the experimental absence of limpets, while in the presence of these grazers, Rissoella, Rivularia, and barnacles colonized. The filamentous algae inhibited the establishment of Rissoella (but not that of Rivularia) independently of the presence of limpets, and there was no positive direct effect of these herbivores on Rissoella. Interactions between barnacles and Rissoella were negligible, but these organisms jointly reduced the coverage of Rivularia and the local density of limpets, eventually facilitating the colonization of filamentous algae late in succession.
   A main implication of the results of this study is that interaction web models integrated with a basic understanding of the mechanisms of interaction and supported by natural history information, may lead to correct predictions of the direct and indirect effects of species and their influence on succession. As an extension of this approach, I have presented a set of general, qualitative models of succession, applicable to different marine benthic habitats. It is argued that making these models more quantitative, through the analysis of specific alternatives to the null hypotheses, could substantially increase our capabilities to understand and predict the dynamics of these systems.

AB Theoretical predictions for the relationships between duration of dormancy, reproductive life span, and dispersal ability developed for plants in temporally varying environments are applied here to crustaceans. Mathematical models suggest that diapause duration should negatively covary with adult life span, and that both diapause and life span should negatively covary with dispersal ability. A survey of 167 crustacean species from 20 orders and three classes confirms that species with prolonged diapause have short adult life spans and those with long adult lives either have diapause lasting less than a year, or do not diapause at all. Prolonged diapause is more common among small or inland water crustaceans than it is among large or marine species, whereas large or marine species have significantly longer adult life spans on average than do those that are small or from inland waters. A greater fraction of species in the Branchiopoda exhibit prolonged diapause than do members of the Maxillopoda which, in turn, are more likely to exhibit prolonged diapause than are the Malacostraca. A greater fraction of malacostracan species have adult life spans exceeding one year than do species in either the Branchiopoda or the Maxillopoda. Cladistic analysis shows that phylogenetic constraint is likely to be at least in part responsible for the expression of diapause among the Crustacea. We conclude that both natural selection and macroevolutionary pattern have influenced the distribution of diapause among modern crustaceans.

AB Intestinal bacterial communities in aquaculture have been drawn to attention due to potential benefit to their hosts. To identify core intestinal bacteria in the black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), bacterial populations of disease-free shrimp were characterized from intestines of four developmental stages (15-day-old post larvae (PL15), 1-(J1), 2-(J2), and 3-month-old (J3) juveniles) using pyrosequencing, real-time PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) approaches. A total of 25,121 pyrosequencing reads (reading length = 442 +/- 24 bases) were obtained, which were categorized by barcode for PL15 (7,045 sequences), J1 (3,055 sequences), J2 (13,130 sequences) and J3 (1,890 sequences). Bacteria in the phyla Bacteroides, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were found in intestines at all four growth stages. There were 88, 14, 27, and 20 bacterial genera associated with the intestinal tract of PL15, J1, J2 and J3, respectively. Pyrosequencing analysis revealed that Proteobacteria (class Gammaproteobacteria) was a dominant bacteria group with a relative abundance of 89% for PL15 and 99% for J1, J2 and J3. Real-time PCR assay also confirmed that Gammaproteobacteria had the highest relative abundance in intestines from all growth stages. Intestinal bacterial communities from the three juvenile stages were more similar to each other than that of the PL shrimp based on PCA analyses of pyrosequencing results and their DGGE profiles. This study provides descriptive bacterial communities associated to the black tiger shrimp intestines during these growth development stages in rearing facilities.

AB Pollinators play a key role within most terrestrial communities in maintaining plant populations, as well as pollinating many agricultural crops for seed and fruit production. The mobility of pollinating animals is significant to their importance but we know little about how landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera, Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on plant reproductive success plants had increased pollinator activity, pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections. The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on bumblebees for pollination services.

AB We studied the effect of roads and traffic on hedgehog population density by comparing relative densities in 15 paired road and control plots matched for landscape parameters. Relative hedgehog density was determined by means of footprints in specially designed tunnels. The relative density was closely correlated with the total number of individual hedgehogs that were caught in trays in five of the plots immediately after the tunnels were removed. A power analysis indicated that, with the resources available, we could only detect an effect greater than 35%. We were unable to demonstrate a significant effect, i.e. hedgehog density in areas adjacent to roads is not reduced by more than 35%. However, we did find about 30% fewer tracks in road plots when compared to control plots and the P-values were marginally insignificant at the P less than or equal to 0.05 significance level. These results suggest that roads and traffic are likely to reduce hedgehog density by about 30%, which may affect the survival probability of local populations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

ID ALIEN PLANTS; PATTERNS; HAWAII
AB We studied 28 alien tree species currently Planted for forestry purposes in the Czech Republic to determine the probability of their escape from cultivation and naturalization. Indicators of propagule pressure (number of administrative units in which a species is planted and total planting area) and time of introduction into cultivation were used as explanatory variables in multiple regression models. Fourteen species escaped from cultivation, and 39% of the variance was explained by the number of planting units and the time of introduction, the latter being more important. Species introduced early bad a higher probability of escape than those introduced later, with more than 95% probability of escape for those introduced before 1801 and < 5% for those introduced after 1892. Probability of naturalization was more difficult to predict, and eight species were misclassified. A model omitting two species with the largest influence on the model yielded similar predictors of naturalization as did the probability of escape. Both phases of invasion therefore appear to be driven by Planting and introduction history in a similar way. Our results demonstrate the importance of forestry for recruitment of invasive trees. Six alien forestry trees, classified as invasive in the Czech Republic, are currently reported in nature reserves. In addition, forestry authorities want to increase the diversity of alien species and planting area in the country.

AB Year-round aerosol samples collected in the boundary layer at coastal Antarctic sites (Dumont D'Urville, Neumayer, and Halley) indicate a seasonal cycle of ammonium concentrations with a minimum in winter (April-September), A large intersite difference appears in the summer (November-February) maxima values, from similar to 12.5 ng m(-3) at Neumayer to 140-230 ng m(-3) at Dumont D'Urville. At Dumont D'Urville, ammonium concentrations are the largest ever reported from Antarctic sites, and the large summer maxima are associated with large enrichments with respect to sea salt for potassium and calcium. In addition, seasonal ammonium variations at Dumont D'Urville are in phase with a well-marked seasonal cycle of oxalate concentrations which exhibit maxima of 5-10 ng m(-3) in spring and summer and minima of less than 0.5 ng m(-3) in winter. Such a composition of aerosols present in the boundary layer at Dumont D'Urville in summer is linked to the presence of a large Adelie penguin population from the end of October to March at the site. Ornithogenic soils (defined as guano-enriched soils), together with the bacterial decomposition of uric acid, are a source of ammonium, oxalate, and cation (such as potassium and calcium) aerosol, in addition to a subsequent large ammonia loss from ornithogenic soils to the atmosphere. The total breeding population of 5 million Adelie penguins widely distributed around the Antarctic continent may emit, at most, some 2.5x10(-4) Mt of NH3-N during the summer months. In contrast, Halley and Neumayer Stations are far less exposed to penguin colony emissions. At Neumayer, ammonium concentrations peak from January to March and are in phase with the increase of biogenic sulfur species. Here the NH4+/(MSA + nss SO4-) molar ratio is close to 13% in summer aerosol and to 40% in winter aerosol. Using this summer ratio, which may be related to ammonia and sulfur oceanic emissions occurring south of 50 degrees S in summer and estimated DMS emissions in these regions at this time, we derive an upper limit of 0.064 Mt NH3-N emitted per year by the high-latitude Southern Ocean in summer. This study indicates a very limited ammonia neutralization of acidic sulfate aerosols at high southern latitudes, except in the vicinity of ornithogenic soils occupied by large penguin colonies.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the water requirements for germination and early seedling establishment of four African savanna tree species, namely Acacia karroo, A. nilotica, A. tortilis and Mundulea sericea. The acacias are characteristic of nutrient-rich, and M. sericea of nutrient-poor savannas. Imbibition times of scarified seeds of A. karroo (4 h), M. sericea (6 h) and A. tortilis (8 h) were rapid relative to A. nilotica (28 h) and were inversely correlated with seed size. Imbibed water is lost in about 2 h after drying at 25 degrees C for ail species except A. nilotica (only 70% moisture loss). Seeds of A. karroo and M. sericea kept at 40 degrees C dried to below their original moisture contents within 2 h. Seeds of A. nilotica and A. tortilis dried at 40 degrees C lost viability relative to (undried) control seeds, while there was no significant loss of viability for A. Karroo and M. sericea. For fully imbibed seeds to germinate in sandy savanna soils, all four species required at least the equivalent of 3 mm rainfall every 2 days under mild greenhouse conditions. However, most ungerminated seeds were still viable despite drying-out from a fully imbibed state. Maintenance of soil at 50% field capacity (FC), or watering to FC every 9th day is the maintenance requirements for 2-week-old seedlings of A. nilotica and M. sericea to continue growth for a further 5 weeks under greenhouse conditions, although A. nilotica mostly survived 25% FC with one seedling surviving 12.5% FC. Root penetration was rapid in sandy soils, with A. nilotica and M. sericea attaining a depth of 40 cm within 15 days. Frequent, but not necessarily high, rainfall appears to be essential for germination and seedling survival over the first 7 weeks. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB As one of the few countries in Latin America to have reversed persistent losses in tree cover, Chile may hold important insights for forest transition theory. However, existing studies have not provided methodologically consistent analyses at sufficient temporal and spatial scales to properly assess the state of Chile's forest transition. In the current study, we generate high-resolution maps of Chilean land use change between 1986, 2001 and 2011. We couple remote sensing with a review of historic assessments of Chile's forest resources to document long-term trends in forest extent. This historical review identifies multiple discrete forest transitions throughout Chile's history. These fluctuations in forest clearing emphasize that the cultural, economic and political forces that precipitate forest transitions can all be reversed. The remote sensing analysis calls into question official statistics indicating an expansion of native forests between 1986 and 2011. We find that increases in forest cover were largely driven by the expansion of forest plantations, rather than through native forest regeneration. Plantation forests directly displaced native forests in many locations, especially during the 1986-2001 period. Nevertheless, declines in the rate of forest conversion during the 2001-2011 period suggest that plantations are beginning to ease pressure on native forests. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Activities involving fauna monitoring are usually limited by the lack of resources; therefore, the choice of a proper and efficient methodology is fundamental to maximize the cost-benefit ratio. Both direct and indirect methods can be used to survey mammals, but the latter are preferred due to the difficulty to come in sight of and/or to capture the individuals, besides being cheaper. We compared the performance of two methods to survey medium and large-sized mammal: track plot recording and camera trapping, and their costs were assessed. At Jatai Ecological Station (S21 degrees 31'15 ''- W47 degrees 34'42 ''-Brazil) we installed ten camera traps along a dirt road directly in front of ten track plots, and monitored them for 10 days. We cleaned the plots, adjusted the cameras, and noted down the recorded species daily. Records taken by both methods showed they sample the local richness in different ways (Wilcoxon, T=231; p;;0.01). The track plot method performed better on registering individuals whereas camera trapping provided records which permitted more accurate species identification. The type of infra-red sensor camera used showed a strong bias towards individual body mass (R-2=0.70; p=0.017), and the variable expenses of this method in a 10-day survey were estimated about 2.04 times higher compared to track plot method; however, in a long run camera trapping becomes cheaper than track plot recording. Concluding, track plot recording is good enough for quick surveys under a limited budget, and camera trapping is best for precise species identification and the investigation of species details, performing better for large animals. When used together, these methods can be complementary.

AB Conservation seeks ultimately to protect and maintain biodiversity indefinitely. Most biodiversity features targeted in past conservation planning have been largely aspects of ecological and biogeographical pattern rather than process. However, the persistence of biodiversity can only be ensured through consideration of the ecological and evolutionary processes that underpin biodiversity, as well as its present spatial pattern. This paper identifies spatial surrogates of ecological and evolutionary processes for regional conservation planning in one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, the Cape Floristic Region. We identified six types of spatial components (namely edaphic interfaces, upland-lowland interfaces, sand movement corridors, riverine corridors, upland-lowland gradients and macroclimatic gradients) as surrogates for key processes such as ecological and geographical diversification, and species migration. Spatial components were identified in a GIS using published data and expert knowledge. Options for achieving targets for process components have been seriously compromised by habitat transformation. Between 30 and 75% of the original extent of the spatial components currently remain functional. Options for achieving upland-lowland and macroclimatic gradients are very limited in the lowlands where most of the habitat has been transformed by agriculture. We recommend that future studies place their research on ecological and evolutionary processes in a spatially explicit framework. Areas maintaining adaptive diversification (e.g. environmental gradients, ecotones) or containing historically isolated populations should be identified and protected. The spatial dimensions of eco-logical processes such as drought and fire refugia also need to be determined and such insights incorporated in conservation planning. Finally, connectivity within these areas should be ensured to maintain species migration and gene flow.

AB Non-native tree (NNT) species have been transported worldwide to create or enhance services that are fundamental for human well-being, such as timber provision, erosion control or ornamental value; yet NNTs can also produce undesired effects, such as fire proneness or pollen allergenicity. Despite the variety of effects that NNTs have on multiple ecosystem services, a global quantitative assessment of their costs and benefits is still lacking. Such information is critical for decision-making, management and sustainable exploitation of NNTs. We present here a global assessment of NNT effects on the three main categories of ecosystem services, including regulating (RES), provisioning (PES) and cultural services (CES), and on an ecosystem disservice (EDS), i.e. pollen allergenicity. By searching the scientific literature, country forestry reports, and social media, we compiled a global data set of 1683 case studies from over 125 NNT species, covering 44 countries, all continents but Antarctica, and seven biomes. Using different meta-analysis techniques, we found that, while NNTs increase most RES (e.g. climate regulation, soil erosion control, fertility and formation), they decrease PES (e.g. NNTs contribute less than native trees to global timber provision). Also, they have different effects on CES (e.g. increase aesthetic values but decrease scientific interest), and no effect on the EDS considered. NNT effects on each ecosystem (dis)service showed a strong context dependency, varying across NNT types, biomes and socio-economic conditions. For instance, some RES are increased more by NNTs able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, and when the ecosystem is located in low-latitude biomes; some CES are increased more by NNTs in less-wealthy countries or in countries with higher gross domestic products. The effects of NNTs on several ecosystem (dis)services exhibited some synergies (e.g. among soil fertility, soil formation and climate regulation or between aesthetic values and pollen allergenicity), but also trade-offs (e.g. between fire regulation and soil erosion control). Our analyses provide a quantitative understanding of the complex synergies, trade-offs and context dependencies involved for the effects of NNTs that is essential for attaining a sustained provision of ecosystem services.

AB Recent syntheses on the evolutionary causes of dispersal have focused on dispersal as a direct adaptation, but many traits that influence dispersal have other functions, raising the question: when is dispersal for' dispersal? We review and critically evaluate the ecological causes of selection on traits that give rise to dispersal in marine and terrestrial organisms. In the sea, passive dispersal is relatively easy and specific morphological, behavioural, and physiological adaptations for dispersal are rare. Instead, there may often be selection to limit dispersal. On land, dispersal is relatively difficult without specific adaptations, which are relatively common. Although selection for dispersal is expected in both systems and traits leading to dispersal are often linked to fitness, systems may differ in the extent to which dispersal in nature arises from direct selection for dispersal or as a by-product of selection on traits with other functions. Our analysis highlights incompleteness of theories that assume a simple and direct relationship between dispersal and fitness, not just insofar as they ignore a vast array of taxa in the marine realm, but also because they may be missing critically important effects of traits influencing dispersal in all realms.

AB The current distribution of forest genetic resources on Earth is the result of a combination of natural processes and human actions. Over time, tree populations have become adapted to their habitats including the local ecological disturbances they face. As the planet enters a phase of human-induced climate change of unprecedented speed and magnitude, however, previously locally-adapted populations are rendered less suitable for new conditions, and 'natural' biotic and abiotic disturbances are taken outside their historic distribution, frequency and intensity ranges. Tree populations rely on phenotypic plasticity to survive in extant locations, on genetic adaptation to modify their local phenotypic optimum or on migration to new suitable environmental conditions. The rate of required change, however, may outpace the ability to respond, and tree species and populations may become locally extinct after specific, but as yet unknown and unquantified, tipping points are reached. Here, we review the importance of forest genetic resources as a source of evolutionary potential for adaptation to changes in climate and other ecological factors. We particularly consider climate-related responses in the context of linkages to disturbances such as pests, diseases and fire, and associated feedback loops. The importance of management strategies to conserve evolutionary potential is emphasised and recommendations for policy-makers are provided. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Alien conifers, mainly pines, have been planted in South Africa for a range of purposes for over 300 years. Formal plantations cover 660 000 ha of the country, and invasive stands of varying density occur on a further 2.9 million ha. These trees have brought many benefits but have also caused unintended problems. The management of alien conifers has evolved in response to emerging problems such as excessive water use by plantations of conifers, changing values and markets, and the realities of a new ecological order brought about by invasive alien conifers. This paper reviews the history of conifer introductions to South Africa, the benefits and impacts with which they are associated, and the ongoing and evolving research that has been conducted to inform their management. The South African approach has included taking courageous steps to address the problem of highly invasive species that are also an important commercial crop. These interventions have not, however, had the desired effect of both retaining benefits from formal plantations while simultaneously reversing the trend of growing impacts associated with self-sown invasive stands. We suggest that different approaches need to be considered, including the systematic phasing out of commercial forestry in zones where it delivers low returns, and the introduction of more effective, focussed and integrated, region-specific approaches to the management of invasive stands of conifers. These steps would deliver much improved economic outcomes by protecting valuable ecosystem services, but will require political commitment to policies that could be unpopular in certain sectors of society.

AB Trees act as ecosystem engineers and invasions by exotic tree species profoundly impact recipient communities. Recently, research on invasive trees has dramatically increased, enabling the assessment of general trends in tree invasion. Analysing 90 studies dealing with 45 invasive tree species, we conducted a quantitative review and a meta-analysis to estimate the relevance of eight leading hypotheses for explaining tree invasions. We also tested whether species functional traits (growth rate, density/cover, germination, biomass and survival) equally promote tree invasiveness. Overall, our results suggest that several hypotheses, linked to invasibility or invasiveness, are pertinent to explain tree invasions. Furthermore, more than one hypothesis has been supported for a given species, which indicates that multiple factors lead to the success of invasive tree species. In addition, growth rate appears to be the most efficient predictor of invasiveness for invasive trees and could thus be used as a means to identify potential alien tree invasions. We conclude that further investigations are needed to test the consistency of some hypotheses across a broader pool of invasive tree species, whilst experimental studies with the same tree species across a larger range of sites would help to reveal the full suite of factors that affect tree invasions.

AB The global-scale natural experiment created by the widespread dissemination of most of the I I I species of pines (genus Pinus, family Pinaceae) has shed light on many aspects of plant invasion ecology. Introductions and the fate of alien pines have been well documented worldwide, facilitating the accurate labelling of species as "naturalized", "invasive", or "non-invasive" using objective criteria. Thirty species are naturalized and 21 are invasive. Three life-history traits that clearly separate invasive from non-invasive taxa define the inherent ability of species to disperse over long distances, win in competition against other plants, and to survive or proliferate under a range of disturbance regimes. The realization of colonization opportunities for potentially invasive pines is determined by extrinsic factors, especially those that mediate seedling establishment. Meta-analysis of many introduction/invasion events revealed the interplay of factors. Detailed studies of pine invasions have elucidated the roles of long-distance seed dispersal and propagule pressure in driving invasions. Enhanced understanding of the ecology of pine invasions has improved our ability to manage these invasions. No other speciose genus of plants has yielded important insights on so many facets of invasion ecology.

AB Fire positively and negatively affects food webs across all trophic levels and guilds and influences a range of ecological processes that reinforce fire regimes, such as nutrient cycling and soil development, plant regeneration and growth, plant community assembly and dynamics, herbivory and predation. Thus we argue that rather than merely describing spatio-temporal patterns of fire regimes, pyrodiversity must be understood in terms of feedbacks between fire regimes, biodiversity and ecological processes. Humans shape pyrodiversity both directly, by manipulating the intensity, severity, frequency and extent of fires, and indirectly, by influencing the abundance and distribution of various trophic guilds through hunting and husbandry of animals, and introduction and cultivation of plant species. Conceptualizing landscape fire as deeply embedded in food webs suggests that the restoration of degraded ecosystems requires the simultaneous careful management of fire regimes and native and invasive plants and animals, and may include introducing new vertebrates to compensate for extinctions that occurred in the recent and more distant past.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'The interaction of fire and mankind'.

AB Grazing intensity and bush encroachment are disturbance factors that may alter the floristic composition of herbaceous species. This paper investigates impacts of grazing (intensity) and bush encroachment on herbaceous species and rangeland conditions in Borana, southern Ethiopia. Herbaceous species richness and the abundance of each species were greater in the light- and moderate-grazed areas than heavy-grazed sampling plots. Similarly, herbaceous species richness was highest at an intermediate level of biomass and seems to decline as biomass increases. Among a total of 40 herbaceous species recorded, 20 per cent were tolerant of grazing, whereas the remaining 80 per cent were highly susceptible to heavy grazing. In both encroached and non-encroached sampling plots, species richness varied from three to six species 025m(-2). Overall, herbaceous species richness and abundance, in relation to grazing gradient, might disclose a better picture of the effect of grazing on individual herbaceous species. As species richness seems to decline under heavy grazing intensity, low to intermediate grazing levels may promote and conserve key forage species in savanna grazing lands.

AB Carbon sequestration by afforestation can help mitigate global climate change but may have adverse environmental and economic impacts in some regions. For example, economic incentives for carbon sequestration may encourage the expansion of Pinus radiata timber plantations in the Fynbos biome of South Africa, with negative consequences for water supply and biodiversity. I built a dynamic ecological-economic model to investigate whether afforestation of a Fynbos catchment with Pinus radiata is economically viable when the potential benefits of carbon sequestration and timber production are balanced against the losses to water supply. I found that afforestation appears viable to the forestry industry under current water tariffs and current carbon accounting legislation, but would appear unviable if the forestry industry were to pay the true cost of water used by the plantations. I also found that under various plausible future economic scenarios. afforestation can be associated with either large future economic gains or losses, suggesting a need for future analyses based on branches of decision theory that deal with severe uncertainty. I conclude with a general recommendation that climate legislation should be explicit about the conditions under which afforestation for carbon sequestration of native vegetation is a legitimate climate mitigation strategy.

   TRAITS
AB Effective ecosystem management in the face of human alterations depends on our ability to quantify ecologically significant changes and to discriminate among impact levels and types We reviewed the literature on biological responses of freshwater biota to human disturbances over the last century. Many of the main methods for assessing ecological integrity originated in Europe [e g, Saprobien Index, Trent Biotic Index, Biological Monitoring Working Party, River InVertebrate Prediction And Classification System, multiple traits] or in North America [e.g., Index of Biotic Integrity, leaf-litter breakdown, functional feeding groups] We used bibliometric data to detail the contribution of J-NABS to developments in assessment of ecological integrity. A total of 225 bioassessment articles were published in J-NABS from 1986 to 2007 This total was similar to 1/2 of the number of bioassessment articles published over the same period in Freshwater Biology (FWB, another leading freshwater journal used for comparison), but the proportion of bioassessment articles in the 2 journals was similar (similar to 20%). The proportion of bioassessment articles in J-NABS has increased over the last 25 y. This trend indicates the growing interest in the topic and the delay (similar to 30 y since the Clean Water Act) of scientific action in response to water legislation Taxonomic composition and multivariate techniques, multimetric indices, lotic systems, macroinvertebrates, land use, and overall human impacts were major themes in J-NABS bioassessment articles. Progress in bioassessment is needed in 3 main areas First, bioassessments done at large spatial scales are needed to meet requirements of new environmental policies Second, bioassessment should shift from consideration of taxon losses to losses of ecological functions Third, statistical techniques are needed for predictive assessment of deviation in ecological integrity between expected (natural) and observed (natural or impacted) conditions. Assessment of functional integrity based on multiple traits is a promising area because biological traits represent universal biological characteristics that are connected to ecosystem functions However, the relationships between ecophysiological traits of individuals and ecosystem-scale responses must be properly defined for specific types of human impairment, and utility of the approach for routine bioassessments applied by managers must be tested.

AB The abundance of woody plants on grasslands and savannas often is controlled by the availability of water and its location in soil. Water availability to plants is limited by precipitation, but the distribution of soil water and period over which it is available in these ecosystems are influenced by the transpiration rates of grasses, We discuss implications of recent and projected increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration for transpiration, soil water availability, and the balance of grasses and shrubs, An increase in CO2 concentration often reduces potential transpiration/leaf area by reducing stomatal conductance. On grasslands where effects of stomatal closure on transpiration are not negated by an increase in leaf temperature and leaf area, rising CO2 concentration should slow the depletion of soil water by grasses and potentially favor shrubs and other species that might otherwise succumb to water stress. Predicted effects of CO2 are supported by results from CO2-enrichment studies in the field and are compatible with recent models of interactions between resource levels and vegetation pattern and structure.

AB The histological study of various bones in the families Teleosauridae and Metriorhynchidae reveals common, but also contrasting structural features of the skeleton. Both display a zonal pattern of bone tissue, suggesting a cyclic growth and an ecto-poikilothermic physiology, quite similar to those of recent crocodiles. However, the Teleosauridae exhibit no peculiar skeletal specializations related to marine life, which suggests that they had an amphibious, rather than a truly marine habitat. Conversely, the skeleton of the Metriorhynchidae displays a certain degree of structural lightening, especially obvious in their skull, but also present in their femora and ribs. This structural specialization of the skeleton, together with the supposed physiological regime of the Metriorhynchidae, had definite bearings on their body trim in water, locomotor capabilities, and activity cycles. These various topics are discussed with reference to the ecological and eco-physiological adaptations of the Thalattosuchia.

AB Planted forests of alien tree species make significant contributions to the economy and provide multiple products and ecosystem services On the other hand, non-native trees now feature prominently on the lists of invasive alien plants in many parts of the world, and in some areas non-native woody species are now among the most conspicuous, damaging and, in some cases, best-studied invasive species. Afforestation and reforestation policies, both on public and private land, need to include clearly stated objectives and principles to reduce impacts of invasive trees outside areas set aside for forestry. With the intention of encouraging national authorities to implement general principles of prevention and mitigation of the risks posed by invasive alien tree species used in plantation forestry into national environmental policies, the Council of Europe facilitated the preparation of a Code of Conduct on Planted Forest and Invasive Alien Trees. This new voluntary Code, comprising 14 principles, complements existing codes of conduct dealing with horticulture and botanic gardens. The Code is addressed to all relevant stakeholders and decision makers in the 47 Member States of the Council of Europe. It aims to enlist the co-operation of the forest sector (trade and industry, national forest authorities, certification bodies and environmental organizations) and associated professionals in preventing new introductions and reducing, controlling and mitigating negative impacts due to tree invasions that arise, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of plantation forestry.

AB Most reviews concerning the impact of climate change on coral reefs discuss independent effects of warming or ocean acidification. However, the interactions between these, and between these and direct local stressors are less well addressed. This review underlines that coral bleaching, acidification, and diseases are expected to interact synergistically, and will negatively influence survival, growth, reproduction, larval development, settlement, and post-settlement development of corals. Interactions with local stress factors such as pollution, sedimentation, and overfishing are further expected to compound effects of climate change.
   Reduced coral cover and species composition following coral bleaching events affect coral reef fish community structure, with variable outcomes depending on their habitat dependence and trophic specialisation. Ocean acidification itself impacts fish mainly indirectly through disruption of predation- and habitat-associated behavior changes.
   Zooxanthellate octocorals on reefs are often overlooked but are substantial occupiers of space; these also are highly susceptible to bleaching but because they tend to be more heterotrophic, climate change impacts mainly manifest in terms of changes in species composition and population structure. Non-calcifying macroalgae are expected to respond positively to ocean acidification and promote microbe-induced coral mortality via the release of dissolved compounds, thus intensifying phase-shifts from coral to macroalgal domination.
   Adaptation of corals to these consequences of CO2 rise through increased tolerance of corals and successful mutualistic associations between corals and zooxanthellae is likely to be insufficient to match the rate and frequency of the projected changes.
   Impacts are interactive and magnified, and because there is a limited capacity for corals to adapt to climate change, global targets of carbon emission reductions are insufficient for coral reefs, so lower targets should be pursued. Alleviation of most local stress factors such as nutrient discharges, sedimentation, and overfishing is also imperative if sufficient overall resilience of reefs to climate change is to be achieved.

AB The question of why there are so many plant species needs two kinds of answer: an explanation for the origin of plant species, and an explanation for how they can coexist. Pollinators are often implicated in the origin of plant species because adaptation to different modes of pollination can drive divergence in floral traits and bring about reproductive isolation. However, very few studies have attempted to answer the next question: 'Can plant species that differ only in their mode of pollination coexist?' Fragmentary evidence supports the idea that intraspecific competition for pollination resources can limit population growth rate, thus allowing the coexistence of species that use different pollinators, or the same pollinators at different times.

AB Marine reserve theory suggests that where large, productive populations are protected within no-take marine reserves, fished areas outside reserves will benefit through the spillover of larvae produced in the reserves. However, empirical evidence for larval export has been sparse. Here we use a simple idealized coastline model to estimate the expected magnitude and spatial scale of larval export from no-take marine reserves across a range of reserve sizes and larval dispersal scales. Results suggest that, given the magnitude of increased production typically found in marine reserves, benefits from larval export are nearly always large enough to offset increased mortality outside marine reserves due to displaced fishing effort. However, the proportional increase in recruitment at sites outside reserves is typically small, particularly for species with long-distance (on the order of hundreds of kilometers) larval dispersal distances, making it very difficult to detect in field studies. Enhanced recruitment due to export may be detected by sampling several sites at an appropriate range of distances from reserves or at sites downcurrent of reserves in systems with directional dispersal. A review of existing empirical evidence confirms the model's suggestion that detecting export may be difficult without an exceptionally large differential in production, short-distance larval dispersal relative to reserve size, directional dispersal, or a sampling scheme that encompasses a broad range of distances from the reserves.

AB Spanning the period from similar to 74-58 ka, and being broadly coeval with marine oxygen isotope stage 4 (MIS 4), the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort industries represent important phases in the development of the material culture of early modern humans. How and why these industries occurred when they did, however, remain matters for speculation. A key element of this debate has been the question of what role environmental change during the early stages of the last glacial period may have had on influencing human activity. Unfortunately, well-dated palaeoenvironmental evidence from this period is limited, and the debate has, out of necessity, been driven by the application of conceptual models of environmental change, many of which associate colder and warmer global climates with increased aridity and humidity respectively. In this paper, the regional marine and terrestrial evidence is synthesised to create an evidence-based palaeoenvironmental context. Based on the information available to date, it appears that rather than being characterised by dry conditions, MIS 4 was a period of relatively cool, moist climates, the ubiquity of which transcends the modern regional climate boundaries. It is suggested that orbital parameters at this time created greater interaction between tropical and temperate circulation systems, bringing more moisture to the subcontinent. These findings highlight the distinct nature of southern African climate systems, and caution against the application extra-regional conceptual models or inferring linear relationships with polar records.

AB We conducted a systematic global review of differences between timber plantations and pasture lands in terms of animal and plant species richness and abundance, and assessed the results using meta-analysis techniques. Our principal aim was to test the hypothesis that plantations contain higher species richness or abundance than pasture. Of the 1967 studies of potential relevance, 66 provided biological monitoring information and 36 met the requirements for meta-analyses. Sufficient data were available for meta-analyses to be conducted comparing the species richness and abundance of plantations and pasture lands for five taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, reptiles/amphibians, mammals, and birds. Within each taxon there was considerable variation in the difference between species richness and abundance between plantations and pasture lands. Birds and reptile/amphibians exhibited significantly higher species richness, and mammals exhibited significantly higher abundance, in plantations than in pasture lands which lacked remnant vegetation. Reptile/amphibian species richness was significantly higher in plantations in general. No significant differences in species richness were found for mammals, plants, or invertebrates, and no significant differences in abundance were found for birds, reptiles/amphibians, invertebrates, or plants. It is only within the presence of taxonomic caveats (i.e. reptiles/amphibians), or specific landscape features (i.e. absence of remnant vegetation within pasture), that it can be concluded that plantations support higher species richness or abundance than pasture land. We emphasize that caution is warranted when making general statements about the inherent biodiversity value of diverse and broadly-defined land-uses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increased sediment loading comprises one of the most important and pervasive anthropogenic impacts on aquatic ecosystems globally. In spite of this, little is known of the overall effects of increased sediment loads on lakes. By modifying both bottom-up and top-down ecological processes and restructuring energy flow pathways, increased sediment loads not only alter biotic assemblage structure and ecological functioning significantly, but frequently result in reduced biological diversity and productivity. Although lake food-webs can be subsidised to some extent by the adsorption of organic carbon to fine sediments, trophic structure and the composition of biotic assemblages remain likely to be modified considerably. The mineralogy and particle size of sediments and the availability of nutrients, by influencing both the scale and nature of impacts, are key determinants of the overall effects of increased sediment loads on lake ecosystems. Although interactions with other global anthropogenic pressures, such as invasion by exotic species and climate change, are likely to be significant, little remains known about the nature or likely strength of those interactions. Widespread increases in sediment loading to lakes have, therefore, profound implications for the conservation and management of global aquatic biological diversity.

The fastest species movement is due to the globalized supply and use of exotic plants in gardening and urban landscaping. These standard practices circumvent dispersal limitations and biological and environmental stresses; they have three major global impacts: (i) the enhancement of biological invasions, (ii) the elevation of volatile organic compound emissions and the resulting increase in photochemical smog formation, and (iii) the enhancement Of CO2 fixation and water use by gardened plants. These global effects, none of which are currently considered in global-change scenarios, are increasingly amplified with further warming and urbanization. We urge for quantitative assessment of the global effects of gardening and urban landscaping.

AB Supplementation of prebiotic compounds, including short-chain fructooligosaccharides (scFOS) has been shown to confer benefits on nutrient utilization, growth, and disease resistance of various animal species through improved gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota. However, potential uses of prebiotics for shrimp have not been defined. A 6-wk feeding trial was conducted in a recirculating system to determine the effects of scFOS supplementation on growth performance, immune functions, and GI microbiota composition of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). scFOS was supplemented in a nutritionally complete diet (35% crude protein) at 0.025, 0.0500, 0.075, 0.100, 0.200, 0.400, and 0.800% by weight. After 6 wk of feeding, shrimp fed 0, 0.1, and 0.8% scFOS were sampled for assays of immune function and GI microbiota. Dietary supplementation of scFOS did not improve weight gain, feed conversion ratio, or survival of shrimp. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis suggested the intestinal tract microbial community from shrimp fed the basal diet was different from that of shrimp fed the scFOS diets [similarity coefficient (SC) = 74.9%)], although the intestinal tract microbial community from shrimp fed the scFOS-supplemented diets was very similar (SC = 92.3%). All the bacterial species contributing to the GI microbial differences were identified, although most of them are uncultured species. Both total hemocyte count and hemocyte respiratory burst increased (P < 0.05) by incremental dietary supplementation of scFOS (0-0.8%). This study is the first to our knowledge to show that dietary scFOS can selectively support growth of certain bacterial species in the GI tract of shrimp and enhance immunity, which may facilitate development of alternative strategies, including novel probiotics and synbiotics, for shrimp growth and health management.

AB Background: Understanding the patterns of biodiversity distribution and what influences them is a fundamental pre-requisite for effective conservation and sustainable utilisation of biodiversity. Such knowledge is increasingly urgent as biodiversity responds to the ongoing effects of global climate change. Nowhere is this more acute than in species-rich tropical Africa, where so little is known about plant diversity and its distribution. In this paper, we use RAINBIO - one of the largest mega-databases of tropical African vascular plant species distributions ever compiled - to address questions about plant and growth form diversity across tropical Africa.
   Results: The filtered RAINBIO dataset contains 609,776 georeferenced records representing 22,577 species. Growth form data are recorded for 97% of all species. Records are well distributed, but heterogeneous across the continent. Overall, tropical Africa remains poorly sampled. When using sampling units (SU) of 0.5 degrees, just 21 reach appropriate collection density and sampling completeness, and the average number of records per species per SU is only 1.84. Species richness (observed and estimated) and endemism figures per country are provided. Benin, Cameroon, Gabon, Ivory Coast and Liberia appear as the botanically best-explored countries, but none are optimally explored. Forests in the region contain 15,387 vascular plant species, of which 3013 are trees, representing 5-7% of the estimated world's tropical tree flora. The central African forests have the highest endemism rate across Africa, with approximately 30% of species being endemic.
   Conclusions: The botanical exploration of tropical Africa is far from complete, underlining the need for intensified inventories and digitization. We propose priority target areas for future sampling efforts, mainly focused on Tanzania, Atlantic Central Africa and West Africa. The observed number of tree species for African forests is smaller than those estimated from global tree data, suggesting that a significant number of species are yet to be discovered. Our data provide a solid basis for a more sustainable management and improved conservation of tropical Africa's unique flora, and is important for achieving Objective 1 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation 2011-2020. In turn, RAINBIO provides a solid basis for a more sustainable management and improved conservation of tropical Africa's unique flora.

AB Projections of ecosystem and biodiversity change for Africa under climate change diverge widely. More than other continents, Africa has disturbance-driven ecosystems that diversified under low Neogene CO2 levels, in which flammable fire-dependent C-4 grasses suppress trees, and mega-herbivore action alters vegetation significantly. An important consequence is metastability of vegetation state, with rapid vegetation switches occurring, some driven by anthropogenic CO2-stimulated release of trees from disturbance control. These have conflicting implications for biodiversity and carbon sequestration relevant for policymakers and land managers. Biodiversity and ecosystem change projections need to account for both disturbance control and direct climate control of vegetation structure and function.

AB Leopards have the largest natural distribution of felids, but have lost a third of their historical range, and their current CITES status is 'Near Threatened'. Leopards are a highly sought after trophy species in Africa, although their populations are not monitored in most areas. Zimbabwe sets the highest leopard quota in Africa, but actual offtake does not reflect this, and the number of successful hunts has steadily declined in recent years. Accurate data on leopard populations is urgently needed, particularly where they are harvested.
   Camera-trapping is a powerful tool for non-invasively researching populations of rare and elusive felids, allowing accurate calculation of population density, and monitoring trends. However, unbaited camera-trapping is plagued by low capture rates, affecting the accuracy of the resultant density calculations. In addition, dependent cubs are underrepresented in the data, precluding an accurate description of demographic structure.
   We compared baited and unbaited camera-trapping methods and resultant data quality from two survey areas within our study site. Baited camera-trapping significantly increased leopard capture rates, as well as recording dependent cubs, which the unbaited method failed to detect. In addition, the baited method was more cost effective. Using baits to increase capture rates of leopards is more efficient than the unbaited method, and has the potential to accurately survey unmonitored populations; including where their density is too low to determine accurately via other means. These data are required for management of leopard populations, especially where harvested, and may be applied to improve monitoring efforts of other big cat species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper we summarize for the first time the effects of agriculture expansion and intensification on animal diversity in the Pampas of Argentina and discuss research needs for biodiversity conservation in the area. The Pampas experienced little human intervention until the last decades of the 19th century. Agriculture expanded quickly during the 20th century, transforming grasslands into cropland and pasture lands and converting the landscape into a mosaic of natural fragments, agricultural fields, and linear habitats. In the 1980s, agriculture intensification and replacement of cattle grazing-cropping systems by continuous cropping promoted a renewed homogenisation of the most productive areas. Birds and carnivores were more strongly affected than rodents and insects, but responses varied within groups: (a) the geographic ranges and/or abundances of many native species were reduced, including those of carnivores, herbivores, and specialist species (grassland-adapted birds and rodents, and probably specialized pollinators), sometimes leading to regional extinction (birds and large carnivores), (b) other native species were unaffected (birds) or benefited (bird, rodent and possibly generalist pollinator and crop-associated insect species), (c) novel species were introduced, thus increasing species richness of most groups (26% of non-rodent mammals, 11.1% of rodents, 6.2% of birds, 0.8% of pollinators). Much taxonomic and ecological work is still needed to understand Pampean animal biodiversity, to understand how agriculturization is affecting it, and to identify appropriate conservation actions. Networks of Important Bird Areas and Valuable Grassland Areas harbor a balanced representation of Pampean biodiversity and, if adequately protected, may provide valuable research sites, but complementary work should be carried out on agriculturized areas.

AB Habitat complexity can mediate key processes that structure local assemblages through effects on factors such as competition, predation and foraging behaviour. While most studies address assemblage responses to habitat complexity within one locality, a more global approach allows conclusions with greater independence from the phylogenetic constraints of the target assemblages, thus allowing greater generality. We tested the effects of natural and manipulated habitat complexities on ant assemblages from South Africa, Australia and Sweden, in order to determine if there were globally consistent responses in how functional measures of foraging success are regulated by habitat complexity. Specifically, we considered how habitat complexity affected ant foraging rates including the speed of discovery and rate of monopolisation. We also tested if habitat complexity affected the body size index, a size-related morphological trait, of ants discovering resources and occupying and monopolising the resources after 180 min. Ants were significantly slower to discover baits in the more complex treatments, consistent with predictions that they would move more slowly through more complex environments. The monopolisation index was also lower in the more complex treatments, suggesting that resources were more difficult to defend. Our index of ant body size showed trends in the predicted direction for complexity treatments. In addition, ants discovering, occupying and monopolising resources were smaller in simple than in complex natural habitats. Responses of discovering ants to resources in natural habitats were clear in only one of three regions. Consistent with our predictions, habitat complexity thus affected functional measures of the foraging success of ants in terms of measures of discovery and monopolisation rates and body size traits of successful ants. However, patterns were not always equally clear in manipulative and mensurative components of the study.

AB Seabirds drastically transform the environmental conditions of the sites where they establish their breeding colonies via soil, sediment, and water eutrophication (hereafter termed ornitheutrophication). Here, we report worldwide amounts of total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) excreted by seabirds using an inventory of global seabird populations applied to a bioenergetics model. We estimate these fluxes to be 591 Gg N y(-1) and 99 Gg P y(-1), respectively, with the Antarctic and Southern coasts receiving the highest N and P inputs. We show that these inputs are of similar magnitude to others considered in global N and P cycles, with concentrations per unit of surface area in seabird colonies among the highest measured on the Earth's surface. Finally, an important fraction of the total excreted N (72.5 Gg y(-1)) and P (21.8 Gg y(-1)) can be readily solubilized, increasing their short-term bioavailability in continental and coastal waters located near the seabird colonies.

AB 1. Specialization in plant-pollinator relationships is a core concept in discussions of plant evolution and ecology; it is central to our thinking, not just about the ecology of plant-pollinator interactions and pollinator services, but also about reproductive isolation, speciation, extinction and assembly of communities. However, as reviewed here, the concept ` plant-pollinator specialization' has multiple definitions and uses, and these disparate uses have engendered confusion in the literature. Organizing these disparate uses into a comprehensive framework is an overdue task, prior efforts notwithstanding.
   2. This contribution attempts to make clear the variation in meaning and usage of plant-pollinator specialization, including distinguishing between ecological specialization (interacting with few partners or resources), evolutionary specialization (genetic change associated with increased specialization) and phenotypic specialization (having specialized or derived phenotypic traits), with application of all three concepts to both plants and flower-visiting animals. These variations in interpretation of specialization affect how we view evolutionary and biogeographical trends, as well as extinction risk.
   3. In the light of this conceptual diversity, I evaluate the relationships between specialization and possible trends in floral evolution and rates of speciation and extinction. I also address several implications of specialization for community ecology and resilience of pollination services in the face of environmental disturbance.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are major tools to protect biodiversity and sustain fisheries. For species with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersive larval phase, the effectiveness of MPA networks for population persistence depends on connectivity through larval dispersal. However, connectivity patterns between MPAs remain largely unknown at large spatial scales. Here, we used a biophysical model to evaluate connectivity between MPAs in the Mediterranean Sea, a region of extremely rich biodiversity that is currently protected by a system of approximately a hundred MPAs. The model was parameterized according to the dispersal capacity of the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, an archetypal conservation-dependent species, with high economic importance and emblematic in the Mediterranean. Using various connectivity metrics and graph theory, we showed that Mediterranean MPAs are far from constituting a true, well-connected network. On average, each MPA was directly connected to four others and MPAs were clustered into several groups. Two MPAs (one in the Balearic Islands and one in Sardinia) emerged as crucial nodes for ensuring multi-generational connectivity. The high heterogeneity of MPA distribution, with low density in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, coupled with a mean dispersal distance of 120 km, leaves about 20% of the continental shelf without any larval supply. This low connectivity, here demonstrated for a major Mediterranean species, poses new challenges for the creation of a future Mediterranean network of well-connected MPAs providing recruitment to the whole continental shelf. This issue is even more critical given that the expected reduction of pelagic larval duration following sea temperature rise will likely decrease connectivity even more.

AB Classic island biogeographical theory predicts that reserves have to be large to conserve high biodiversity. Recent literature, however, suggests that habitat heterogeneity can counterbalance the effect of small reserve size. For savanna ungulates, body mass is said to drive habitat selection and facilitate species coexistence, where large species use a higher proportion of the landscape than smaller species, because a wider food quality tolerance allows them to use a higher diversity of habitat types. In this case, high habitat heterogeneity would facilitate diverse assemblages of different-sized ungulates. Digestive physiology should further modify this relationship, because non-ruminants have a wider diet tolerance than ruminants. We tested this hypothesis with an empirical dataset on distribution and habitat preference of different-sized African grazers.
   Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, Republic of South Africa.
   We recorded herbivore dung and habitat type on 24 line transects varying between 4 and 11 km with a total length of 190 km to determine habitat selection and landscape distribution of six grazer species, three ruminants and three non-ruminants.
   Larger ruminant grazers were more evenly distributed than smaller ruminants, had a more diverse use of habitats and used more low quality habitat. In contrast, non-ruminant grazers were more evenly distributed than similar-sized ruminants and body mass did not clearly influence diversity of habitat use and use of low quality habitat.
   We confirm that body mass influences diversity of habitat use of large herbivores but digestive strategy potentially modifies this relationship. Hence, habitat heterogeneity might facilitate herbivore diversity in savanna ecosystems and high heterogeneity might counterbalance the effects of fragmentation and declining reserve size. Concluding, processes that homogenize the landscape, such as fire (mis)management and artificial waterholes, might be as threatening to biodiversity as landscape fragmentation, especially for smaller ruminant herbivores.

AB This analysis goes beyond many phylogenies in exploring how phylogenetic structure imposed by morphology, ecology, and geography reveals useful evolutionary data. A comprehensive range of such diversity is evaluated within tribe Indigofereae and outgroups from sister tribes. A combined data set of 321 taxa (over one-third of the tribe) by 80 morphological characters, 833 aligned nuclear ribosomal ITS/5.8S sites. and an indel data set of 33 characters was subjected to parsimony analysis. Notable results include the Madagascan dry forest Disynstemon resolved as sister to tribe Indigofereae, and all species of the large genus Indigofera comprise just four main clades, each diagnosable by morphological synapomorphies and ecological and geographical predilections. These results suggest niche conservation (ecology) and dispersal limitation (geography) are important processes rendering signature shapes to the Indigofereae phylogeny in different biomes. Clades confined to temperate and succulent-rich biomes are more dispersal limited and have more geographical phylogenetic Structure than those inhabiting tropical grass-rich vegetation. The African and corridor, particularly the Namib center of endemism, harbors many of the oldest Indigofera lineages. A rates analysis of nucleotide substitutions confirms that the ages of the oldest crown clades are mostly younger than 16 Ma, implicating dispersal in explaining the worldwide distribution of the tribe.

AB A high resolution nested model of the Western Iberia shelf is developed and compared with field observations. We use an embedded particle tracking submodel that includes advection, diffusion, and diel vertical migration to simulate crab larvae dispersal. A set of experiments with varying oceanographic conditions and Lagrangian model parameters is analysed. It is found that major dispersal patterns that were observed in nature are reproduced in the model. The floats drift within meridionally elongated patches parallel to the coast usually inshore of the 100 in isobath. This distribution is controlled by local wind-driven circulation, buoyancy input from adjacent rivers, local topography, and vertical diel movements. River plumes are critical factors for retention patterns as they influence the near surface stratification, surface Ekman layer and innershelf processes. Weakly stratified coastal waters associated with low river run-off generate an enlarged innershelf whose dynamics tend to trap the floats and force them to drift along-wind. We find that the response to downwelling-favourable winds is always more dramatic than upwelling-favourable ones and this asymmetry results in a net Lagrangian transport directed poleward. Analyses of float distributions show that a large part of the floats (similar to 50%) is actually retained in the shelf zone near the emission points. A dispersal distance (L-d) of about 60 km is estimated which is mostly representative of along-shore dispersion. Some consequences of our results to local population dynamics are finally discussed.

AB Meta-analysis is a method ecologists may find useful for quantitatively reviewing and systematically examining results from a large number of studies on a subject for which there is conflicting evidence. I used meta-analysis to integrate results from 42 independent brood-enlargement studies and tested Lack's hypothesis that clutch size in birds has evolved toward that which produces the most surviving offspring. Cumulative evidence did not support Lack's hypothesis. Significantly (two-tailed P = .016) more fledglings were produced in enlarged broods than in normal-sized broods, indicating parents could raise more young than they had eggs. The standardized treatment effect of brood enlargement across all studies was a mean (+/-1 SE) increase of 0.55 (+/-0.22) standard deviations in the number of young produced. This result does not appear to bc affected by a publishing bias and is unlikely to be reversed by inclusion of additional studies. I also examined differences in methodology and species studied as possible confounding factors and explanations for conflicting results. Longer studies and species with altricial young were more likely to show food limitation. Latitude and date of study, degree of brood enlargement, validity of a study, and annual adult survival did not affect results.

AB The prevailing view that insects lack endogenous enzymes for plant cell wall (PCW) digestion had led to the hypothesis that PCW digestion evolved independently in different insect taxa through the establishment of symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. However, recent studies reporting endogenous PCW-degrading genes and enzymes for several insects, including phylogenetically basal insects and closely related arthropod groups, challenge this hypothesis. Here, we summarize the molecular and biochemical evidence on the mechanisms of PCW digestion in insects to analyze its evolutionary pathways. The evidence reveals that the symbiotic-independent mechanism may be the ancestral mechanism for PCW digestion. We discuss the implications of this alternative hypothesis in the evolution of plant-insect interactions and suggest that changes in the composition of lignocellulolytic complexes were involved in the evolution of feeding habits and diet specializations in insects, playing important roles in the evolution of plant-insect interactions and in the diversification of insects.

AB Baobab trees (Adansonia, Bombacaceae) are widely thought to store water in their stems for use when water availability is low. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the role of stored water during the dry season in three baobab species in Madagascar.
   In the dry season, leaves are present only during and after leaf flush. We quantified the relative contributions of stem and soil water during this period through measures of stem water content, sap flow and stomatal conductance.
   Rates of sap flow at the base of the trunk were near zero, indicating that leaf flushing was almost entirely dependent on stem water. Stem water content declined by up to 12% during this period, yet stomatal conductance and branch sap flow rates remained very low.
   Stem water reserves were used to support new leaf growth and cuticular transpiration, but not to support stomatal opening before the rainy season. Stomatal opening coincided with the onset of sap flow at the base of the trunk and occurred only after significant rainfall.

AB The forest-savannah transition is the most widespread ecotone in tropical areas, separating two of the most productive terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we review current understanding of the factors that shape this transition, and how it may change under various drivers of local or global change. At broadest scales, the location of the transition is shaped by water availability, mediated strongly at local scales by fire regimes, herbivory pressure and spatial variation in soil properties. The frequently dynamic nature of this transition suggests that forest and savannah can exist as alternative stable states, maintained and separated by fire-grass feedbacks and tree shade fire suppression feedback. However, this theory is still contested and the relative contributions of the main biotic and abiotic drivers and their interactions are yet not fully understood. These drivers interplay with a wide range of ecological processes and attributes at the global, continental, regional and local scales. The evolutionary history of the biotic and abiotic drivers and processes plays an important role in the current distributions of these transitions as well as in their species composition and ecosystem functioning. This ecotone can be sensitive to shifts in climate and other driving factors, but is also potentially stabilized by negative feedback processes. There is abundant evidence that these transitions are shifting under contemporary global and local changes, but the direction of shift varies according to region. However, it still remains uncertain how these transitions will respond to rapid and multi-faceted ongoing current changes, and how increasing human influence will interact with these shifts.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Tropical grassy biomes: linking ecology, human use and conservation'.

AB Managing invasive species is a current challenge for biodiversity conservation. A recurring recent suggestion is that by harvesting nonnatives for human consumption, people can control invasive populations. Even though humans may be able to control or eradicate certain populations of nonnative species by harvesting them as food sources, several caveats should be considered before starting these programs. A prominent problem is that creating a market engenders pressure to maintain that problematic species. Also, if the target species becomes an economic resource, people may try to recreate that market in previously uninvaded regions. Using invasive species as an economic resource may trigger the local community to protect these harmful species, to facilitate their incorporation into the local culture, and can generate severe management problems. As with other management programs, managers must know if the harvest actually reduces the target population. Mortality could produce a reduction in the population size or growth, or it could be compensatory, in which case removal of the harvested individuals would not affect population growth. However, in addition to possible control, there may be several benefits of this approach, including an opportunity for public outreach. Projects aiming at controlling invasives through human consumption should be carefully examined, as they may produce results opposite to those proposed.

AB Chitin consists of beta-1,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine residues and is estimated as the second most abundant biomass in the world after cellulose. However, relatively little chitin is utilized as a material for industrial, agricultural and medical applications and aquacultural purposes. Chitin may be useful as a constitutive material in formulated fish feed, and the interesting effects in fish merit further evaluation. There is evidence that fish and aquatic animals harbour a gut bacterial community that is distinctly different from that reported in the surrounding habitat or in the diet. Thus, the gut environment provides a specific niche, and bacterial activity in the gut is not merely a continuum of that observed in the environment. Today, it is well accepted that the gut microbiota in fish are modulated by dietary manipulations. But to what extent can dietary chitin and krill (chitin-rich) modulate the intestinal microbiota of fish and how do these dietary components affect the immune system? These questions will be discussed in the present review.

AB Recreational shore fishing along 250 km of the south and south-west coast of Portugal was studied based on roving creel and aerial surveys. Surveys were conducted between August 2006 and July 2007, following a stratified random-sampling design and provided information on catch and effort, harvest and discards, angler demographics and fishing habits. Overall, 192 roving creel surveys, 24 aerial surveys and 1321 interviews were conducted. Based on the aerial surveys, a mean +/- s.e. total fishing effort of 705 236 +/- 32 765 angler h year(-1) was estimated, corresponding to 166 430 +/- 9792 fishing trips year(-1). Average time spent per fishing trip was 4.7 h. A total of 48 species, belonging to 22 families, were recorded in roving creel surveys. The most important species was Diplodus sargus, accounting for 44% of the total catches by number and 48% by mass. Estimated mean +/- s.e. total annual recreational shore fishing catch was 160.2 +/- 12.6 t year(-1) (788 049 +/- 54 079 fishes year(-1)), of which 147.4 +/- 11.9 t year(-1) (589 132 +/- 42 360 fishes year(-1)) was retained. Although overall shore-based recreational catches only corresponded to 0.8% of the commercial landings (only common species considered), D. sargus catches by recreational shore anglers were considerable, corresponding to 65% of the commercial landings. The implications of these results for integrated fisheries management and conservation are discussed, and future research proposed.

AB Aim To determine how the distribution and cover of different vegetation types are affected by physical factors and livestock in a mountain range with a long evolutionary history of grazing.
   Location Upper vegetation belt of the Cordoba mountains (1700-2800 m a.s.l., 31 degrees 34' S, 64 degrees 50' W) in central Argentina.
   Methods Using GIS, we analysed the relationships of plant cover types to physical features (physiography and topography) and indicators of accumulated livestock pressure (distance to human settlements and roads) through multinomial logistic regression. We predicted a present vegetation map which was validated with a real map. We then constructed two maps simulating minimum and maximum values of accumulated livestock pressure for the whole area. Map comparisons allowed evaluation of the possible influence of livestock, both in extension and intensity.
   Results Both physical features and livestock pressure influenced the occurrence of vegetation units. The overall accuracy of the predicted map at the pixel level was low (26%) indicating low habitat specificity of the vegetation units. We suggest that some part of the unaccounted for variance was due to livestock pressure patterns that were not fully captured by our indicators. Our models proved adequate for predicting the total percentages of vegetation units at coarser scales. The extrapolations showed that under a history of low livestock pressure, such as in sites far away from human settlements and roads, the area would be dominated by woodlands, tussock grasslands and natural rock outcrops. Under a history of heavy livestock pressure, in turn, rock exposed by erosion, tussock grasslands and natural rock outcrops would dominate.
   Main conclusions Vegetation units showed low habitat specificity, and were associated with accumulated livestock pressure, indicating that livestock and its associated activities are important factors structuring the landscape and have important consequences for the integrity of the ecosystem. Results suggest that although this system evolved with large herbivores, it has experienced irreversible degradation processes, and intensification of current domestic livestock pressure is likely to lead to even more land degradation.

AB Ecosystem ecologists and restoration practitioners have become increasingly interested in the effects that invading species might have on soil processes. Invading species, particularly ones that differ from native species in traits that are likely to influence soil processes, may influence nitrogen cycling to such an extent that the legacy of the invasion persists long after invaders have been removed. We suggest that exotic species that are capable of altering soil nitrogen (N) pools, whether by augmenting ecosystem N through fixation of atmospheric N or by increasing rates of N losses, have the greatest capacity to interfere with restoration efforts. In contrast, cases where more subtle differences in tissue quality or quantity alter soil N fluxes but not total N pools may not exhibit a legacy long after removal of the exotic species. Given the challenges that invading species' effects on soils present to restoration efforts, it is important to develop predictions as to which invaders are likely to influence N dynamics after their removal and to develop techniques to minimize the influence of exotics on restored ecosystems.

AB 1. In long-lived species, such as seabirds, the allocation of resources between self-maintenance and reproduction is of particular interest because only a small reduction in adult survival may have a large negative effect on lifetime reproductive success. There is much debate about whether seabirds have a fixed or flexible level of investment in their current reproduction, and it has been proposed that parents can regulate the risk of an increase in mortality under the control of a mass threshold.
   2. Body mass change as response to experimental manipulations of parental effort was examined in blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii Mine-Edwards), a sexually size-dimorphic seabird, with females approximately 31% heavier than males.
   3. First, paternal effort was manipulated by trimming the flight feathers and thereby handicapping males during the chick-rearing period. Mass remained stable in handicapped males, while there was a reduction of female body mass as response to the handicapped partner. The handicapping of males had a significant effect on chick mass.
   4. Secondly, an experiment was made by enlarging and decreasing broods of two chicks to three and one during the first week after hatching. Body mass of females, but not males, was lower in enlarged broods, and body mass of males, but not females, was higher in the reduced broods when the chicks were 45 days old. Chick body masses were lower among enlarged broods than among reduced and control broods.
   5. Overall, these and other results revealed that blue-footed boobies have a sex-specific body mass regulation. Males had a fixed body mass at the end of experiments; they were working at some physiological maximum or were unwilling to pay the cost in terms of future survival, when the effort demanded was increased. Females performed a flexible effort and were working with a buffer of nutritional reserves that they used when necessary. Below a critical level, females preferentially allocated resources to the maintenance of their body condition at the expense of investment in current reproduction.

AB Aims: There is growing awareness of the influence of the bacterial composition of the gut on the health and growth of the host. This study compared the bacterial flora from the digestive system of the wild and cultured prawn, Penaeus merguiensis .
   Methods and Results: Whole guts were dissected from wild and cultured prawns and divided into sections corresponding to the foregut, digestive gland, midgut and hindgut. Homogenates of these sections were plated onto seawater nutrient agar and the colonies identified to genus level and, in some cases, species. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons amongst gut regions for both wild and cultured prawns are presented.
   Conclusions: Both wild and cultured prawns supported remarkably similar bacterial floral compositions, which included members from the genera Aeromonas , Plesiomonas , Photobacterium , Pseudoalteromonas , Pseudomonas and Vibrio . Members of the genus Vibrio were quantitatively dominant. A number of Vibrio species were recovered solely from cultured prawns. Of these, Vibrio gazogenes was the most notable (numerically dominating in all but the midgut). The opportunistic pathogen V. parahaemolyticus was also recovered.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The remarkable similarity of gut compositions between wild and cultured prawns, despite being drawn from very different habitats, suggests an influence of the host on the establishment of the gut flora. An understanding of host/gut floral interactions has significance in fostering conditions which promote the growth of cultivated hosts.

AB Conservation biology and applied ecology increasingly recognize that natural resource management is both an outcome and a driver of social, economic, and ecological dynamics. Protected areas offer a fundamental approach to conserving ecosystems, but they are also social-ecological systems whose ecological management and sustainability are heavily influenced by people. This editorial, and the papers in the invited feature that it introduces, discuss three emerging themes in social-ecological systems approaches to understanding protected areas: (1) the resilience and sustainability of protected areas, including analyses of their internal dynamics, their effectiveness, and the resilience of the landscapes within which they occur; (2) the relevance of spatial context and scale for protected areas, including such factors as geographic connectivity, context, exchanges between protected areas and their surrounding landscapes, and scale dependency in the provision of ecosystem services; and (3) efforts to reframe what protected areas are and how they both define and are defined by the relationships of people and nature. These emerging themes have the potential to transform management and policy approaches for protected areas and have important implications for conservation, in both theory and practice.

AB Global change is driving a massive rearrangement of the world's biota. Trajectories of distributional shifts are shaped by species traits, the recipient environment and driving forces with many of the driving forces directly due to human activities. The relative importance of each in determining the distributions of introduced species is poorly understood. We consider 11 Australian Acacia species introduced to South Africa for different reasons (commercial forestry, dune stabilization and ornamentation) to determine how features of the introduction pathway have shaped their invasion history. Projections from species distribution models (SDMs) were developed to assess how the reason for introduction influences the similarity between climatic envelopes in native and alien ranges. A lattice model for an idealized invasion was developed to assess the relative contribution of intrinsic traits and introduction dynamics on the abundance and extent over the course of simulated invasions. SDMs show that alien populations of ornamental species in South Africa occupy substantially different climate space from their native ranges, whereas species introduced for forestry occupy a similar climate space in native and introduced ranges. This may partly explain the slow spread rates observed for some alien ornamental plants. Such mismatches are likely to become less pronounced with the current drive towards 'eco gardens' resulting in more introductions of ornamental species with a close climate match between native and newly introduced regions. The results from the lattice model showed that the conditions associated with the introduction pathway (especially introduction pressure) dominate early invasion dynamics. The placement of introduction foci in urban areas limited the extent and abundance of invasive populations. Features of introduction events appear to initially mask the influence of intrinsic species traits on invasions and help to explain the relative success of species introduced for different purposes. Introduction dynamics therefore can have long-lasting influences on the outcomes of species redistributions, and must be explicitly considered in management plans.

AB Plant-plant interactions can be a complex mixture of positive and negative interactions, with the net outcome depending on abiotic and community contexts. In savanna systems, the effects of large herbivores on tree-grass interactions have rarely been studied experimentally, though these herbivores are major players in these systems. In African savannas, trees often become more abundant under heavy cattle grazing but less abundant in wildlife preserves. Woody encroachment where cattle have replaced wild herbivores may be caused by a shift in the competitive balance between trees and grasses. Here we report the results of an experiment designed to quantify the positive, negative, and net effects of grasses, wild herbivores, and cattle on Acacia saplings in a Kenyan savanna. Acacia drepanolobium saplings under four long-term herbivore regimes (wild herbivores, cattle, cattle + wild herbivores, and no large herbivores) were cleared of surrounding grass or left with the surrounding grass intact. After two years, grass-removal saplings exhibited 86% more browse damage than control saplings, suggesting that grass benefited saplings by protecting them from herbivory. However, the negative effect of grass on saplings was far greater; grass-removal trees accrued more than twice the total stem length of control trees. Where wild herbivores were present, saplings were browsed more and produced more new stem growth. Thus, the net effect of wild herbivores was positive, possibly due to the indirect effects of lower competitor tree density in areas accessible to elephants. Additionally, colonization of saplings by symbiotic ants tracked growth patterns, and colonized saplings experienced lower rates of browse damage. These results suggest that savanna tree growth and woody encroachment cannot be predicted by grass cover or herbivore type alone. Rather, tree growth appears to depend on a variety of factors that may be acting together or antagonistically at different stages of the tree's life cycle.

AB The build-up of biodiversity is the result of immigration and in situ speciation. We investigate these two processes for four lineages (Disa, Irideae p. p., the Pentaschistis clade and Restionaceae) that are widespread in the Afrotemperate flora. These four lineages may be representative of the numerous clades which are species rich in the Cape and also occur in the highlands of tropical Africa. It is as yet unclear in which direction the lineages spread. Three hypotheses have been proposed: (i) a tropical origin with a southward migration towards the Cape, (ii) a Cape origin with a northward migration into tropical Africa, and (iii) vicariance. None of these hypotheses has been thoroughly tested. We reconstruct the historical biogeography of the four lineages using likelihood optimization onto molecular phylogenies. We find that tropical taxa are nested within a predominantly Cape clade. There is unidirectional migration from the Cape into the Drakensberg and from there northwards into tropical Africa. The amount of in situ diversification differs between areas and clades. Dating estimates show that the migration into tropical East Africa has occurred in the last 17 Myr, consistent with the Mio-Pliocene formation of the mountains in this area.

AB We conducted a study to determine mechanisms constraining population recovery of pigeon guillemots Cepphus columba following the 1989 'Exxon Valdez' oil spill. We asked whether recovery was limited by continuing exposure to residual oil, reduced prey availability, or other causes. Our approach was to compare demographic, physiological, and behavioral parameters between an oiled site pre- and post-spill, and between the oiled site and an unoiled site post-spill. Adult mass, body condition, and nestling survival were significantly lower at the oiled site post-spill compared to pre-spill. After the spill, guillemots increased in number at the unoiled site and chicks fledged at significantly heavier weights than at the oiled site, where populations remained depressed. Elevated hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activities detected in adult guillemots a decade after the spill at the oiled site suggest that continued exposure to residual oil may have limited population recovery, although reduced availability of sand lance, a preferred forage fish, may have also played a role. Previous studies conducted at the oiled site demonstrated that guillemot chick growth and reproductive success were positively related to the percentage of high-lipid forage fishes, such as sand lance, in the chick diet. Aspects of sand lance life history and the pattern of 'Exxon Valdez' oil deposition strongly suggest that sand lance were impacted by the spill, although we lack direct evidence of this, and reductions in this species' abundance may have also resulted from natural causes. Our study suggests that the recovery of a top-level generalist predator may be constrained by both direct effects (continued exposure to residual oil) and indirect effects (reduced availability of a key prey species) following a large-scale perturbation. Furthermore, it demonstrates that recovery following oil spills may take considerably longer for certain species than the few years that have been proposed as typical for marine birds.

AB During feeding, echinoids remove a large proportion of calcium carbonate in addition to the algae growing on dead coral and are consequently of importance in estimating the turnover of organic and inorganic carbon in coral reefs. Rates of herbivory and the erosion of dead coral substratum, referred to as bioerosion, by the most abundant echinoid species in Kenyan reefs, Echinothrix diadema (Linnaeus), Diadema setosum (Leske), D. savignyi (Michelin) and Echinometra mathaei (de Blainville), were compared in three different reef categories with different histories of fishing and its: exclusion. These were reefs: (i) protected within Marine National Parks, which exclude all forms of fishing, coral and shell collection for more than 25 years; (ii) one reef within a Marine Park, which has received protection from fishing activities for 8 years (referred to as 'newly protected' reef), and (iii) unprotected reefs, which experience heavy fishing and some coral collection. The aim was to investigate the grazing and bioerosion activity by the above echinoid species in these reef categories. We surveyed sea urchin population densities and determined their rates of bioerosion and herbivory per individual and square meter. Individual rates of bioerosion and herbivory, of the species D. setosum, D. savignyi and E. diadema were estimated from laboratory gut content analysis and gut evacuation experiments in the field, using elevated underwater cages. Individual rates of bioerosion and herbivory of E. mathaei were obtained from a previous field study [J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 147 (1991) 121]. Sea urchin bioerosion was greater than herbivory for all studied species and proportional to the body size of the sea urchin species. The large-bodied E. diadema exhibited the highest bioerosion and herbivory rates (5.5 +/-0.9 and 2.2 +/-0.3 g individual(-1) day(-1) respectively) followed by D. setosum (1.8 +/-0.3 and 1.1 +/-0.2 g individual(-1) day(-1)) and D. savignyi (0.7 +/-0.2 and 0.4 +/-0.1 g individual(-1) day(-1)). Highest sea urchin densities were recorded at unprotected reefs (6.2 +/-1.5 individual m(-2)), and therefore, bioerosion and herbivory by sea urchins were also highest in this reef category (1180 +/- 230 g CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1) and 450 +/- 77 g algae m(-2) year(-1)). Protected reefs recorded 20 times lower sea urchin bioerosion and herbivory rates (50.3 +/- 25.8 g CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1) and 20.7 +/- 10.4 g algae m(-2) year(-1)), due to the low sea urchin population densities in these reefs (0.06 +/-0.01 individual m(-1)). The newly protected reef, with intermediate number of sea urchins (1.2 +/-0.1 individual m(-2)), had intermediate rates of sea urchin bioerosion and herbivory (711 +/- 157 g CaCO3 m(-2) and 299 +/- 63 g algae m(-2) year(-1)). These findings suggest that echinoids are important in the carbon cycle and reef development, and that fishing can influence these ecological processes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Communities are increasingly empowered with the ability and responsibility of working with national governments to make decisions about marine resources in decentralized co-management arrangements. This transition toward decentralized management represents a changing governance landscape. This paper explores the transition to decentralisation in marine resource management systems in three East African countries. The paper draws upon expert opinion and literature from both political science and linked social-ecological systems fields to guide exploration of five key governance transition concepts in each country: (1) drivers of change; (2) institutional arrangements; (3) institutional fit; (4) actor interactions; and (5) adaptive management. Key findings are that decentralized management in the region was largely donor-driven and only partly transferred power to local stakeholders. However, increased accountability created a degree of democracy in regards to natural resource governance that was not previously present. Additionally, increased local-level adaptive management has emerged in most systems and, to date, this experimental management has helped to change resource user's views from metaphysical to more scientific cause-and-effect attribution of changes to resource conditions.

Within these forests variation in the timing and intensity of leaf exchange may occur within and among individual trees and species, as well as from year to year. Understanding what generates this diversity of phenological behaviour requires a mechanistic model that incorporates rate-limiting physiological conditions, environmental cues, and their interactions. In this study we examined long-term patterns of leaf flushing for a large proportion of the hundreds of tree species that co-occur in a seasonal tropical forest community in western Thailand. We used the data to examine community-wide variation in deciduousness and tested competing hypotheses regarding the timing and triggers of leaf flushing in seasonal tropical forests. We developed metrics to quantify the nature of deciduousness (its magnitude, timing and duration) and its variability among survey years and across a range of taxonomic levels. Tree species varied widely in the magnitude, duration, and variability of leaf loss within species and across years. The magnitude of deciduousness ranged from complete crown loss to no crown loss. Among species that lost most of their crown, the duration of deciduousness ranged from 2 to 21 weeks. The duration of deciduousness in the majority of species was considerably shorter than in neotropical forests with similar rainfall periodicity. While the timing of leaf flushing varied among species, most (similar to 70%) flushed during the dry season. Leaf flushing was associated with changes in photoperiod in some species and the timing of rainfall in other species. However, more than a third of species showed no clear association with either photoperiod or rainfall, despite the considerable length and depth of the dataset. Further progress in resolving the underlying internal and external mechanisms controlling leaf exchange will require targeting these species for detailed physiological and microclimatic studies.

AB Marine scientists have made many recent advances in understanding the connections between the structure of benthic communities, replenishment of populations through dispersal processes, and interactions with the nearshore water mass. In this review, some of the themes and models relating to these processes and interactions are discussed. Benthic-pelagic coupling models are in the early stages of development, but encompass oceanic processes such as upwelling and downwelling, the transport of larvae and their arrival back to shore to settle. Most current knowledge of these processes is based on a few taxa, especially barnacle!; and mussels. This is discussed with reference and comparison to macroalgae, which dominate much of the intertidal zone on temperate rocky shores, and have quite different life histories, transport and settlement processes. The role of key, habitat-dominating species is discussed, particularly their early life histories, with reference to the differences in community composition, nearshore dynamics and settlement processes in different countries. Finally, some suggestions are made for future work to fill gaps in understanding about rocky shore communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB The use of juvenile Artemia as feed in aquaculture and in the pet shop industry has been getting more attention during the last decade. In this study, the use of selected bacterial strains to improve the nutritional value of dry food for Artemia juveniles and to obtain control of the associated microbial community was examined. Nine bacterial strains were selected based on their positive effects on survival and/or growth of Artemia juveniles under monoxenic culture conditions, while other strains caused no significant effect, significantly lower rates of survival and/or growth, or even total mortality of the Artemia, The nine selected strains were used to preemptively colonize the culture water of Artemia juveniles. Xenic culture of Artemia under suboptimal conditions yielded better survival and/or growth rates when they were grown in the preemptively colonized culture medium than when grown in autoclaved seawater. The preemptive colonization of the culture water had a drastic influence on the microbial communities that developed in the culture water or that were associated with the Artemia, as determined with Biolog GN community-level physiological profiles. Chemotaxonomical characterization based on fatty acid methyl ester analysis of bacterial isolates recovered from the culture tanks was performed, and a comparison with the initially introduced strains was made. Finally, several modes of action for the beneficial effect of the bacterial strains are proposed.

AB Snails are highly unusual among multicellular animals in that they move on a layer of costly mucus, leaving behind a trail that can be followed and utilized for various purposes by themselves or by other animals. Here we review more than 40years of experimental and theoretical research to try to understand the ecological and evolutionary rationales for trail-following in gastropods. Data from over 30 genera are currently available, representing a broad taxonomic range living in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The emerging picture is that the production of mucus trails, which initially was an adaptation to facilitate locomotion and/or habitat extension, has evolved to facilitate a multitude of additional functions. Trail-following supports homing behaviours, and provides simple mechanisms for self-organisation in groups of snails, promoting aggregation and thus relieving desiccation and predation pressures. In gastropods that copulate, trail-following is an important component in mate-searching, either as an alternative, or in addition to the release of water- or air-borne pheromones. In some species, this includes a capacity of males not only to identify trails of conspecifics but also to discriminate between trails laid by females and males. Notably, trail discrimination seems important as a pre-zygotic barrier to mating in some snail species. As production of a mucus trail is the most costly component of snail locomotion, it is also tempting to speculate that evolution has given rise to various ways to compensate for energy losses. Some snails, for example, increase energy intake by eating particles attached to the mucus of trails that they follow, whereas others save energy through reducing the production of their own mucus by moving over previously laid mucus trails. Trail-following to locate a prey item or a mate is also a way to save energy. While the rationale for trail-following in many cases appears clear, the basic mechanisms of trail discrimination, including the mechanisms by which many snails determine the polarity of the trail, are yet to be experimentally determined. Given the multiple functions of trail-following we propose that future studies should adopt an integrated approach, taking into account the possibility of the simultaneous occurrence of many selectively advantageous roles of trail-following behaviour in gastropods. We also believe that future opportunities to link phenotypic and genotypic traits will make possible a new generation of research projects in which gastropod trail-following, its multitude of functions and evolutionary trade-offs can be further elucidated.

AB Question
   Community ecologists are often confronted with multiple possible partitions of a single set of records of species composition and/or abundances from several sites. Different methods of numerical classification produce different results, and the question is which of them, and how many clusters, should be selected for interpretation. We demonstrate a new method for identifying the optimal partition from a series of partitions of the same set of sites, based on number of species with high fidelity to clusters in a partition (faithful species).
   Methods
   The new method, OptimClass, has two variants. OptimClass 1 searches the partition with the maximum number of faithful species across all clusters, while OptimClass 2 searches the partition with the maximum number of clusters that contain at least a preselected minimum number of faithful species. Faithful species are determined based on the P value of the Fisher's exact test, as a measure of fidelity. OptimClass was tested on three vegetation datasets that varied in species richness and internal heterogeneity, using several classification algorithms, resemblance measures and cover transformations.
   Results
   Results from both variants of OptimClass depended on the preselected threshold P value for faithful species: higher P gave higher probability that a partition with more clusters was selected as optimal. Good partitions, in terms of OptimClass criteria, involved flexible beta clustering, and also ordinal clustering. Good partitions were also obtained with TWINSPAN when the required number of clusters was small, or UPGMA when the required number of clusters was large. Poor partitions usually resulted from classifications that used resemblance measures and cover transformations emphasizing differences in species cover; this is not unexpected because OptimClass uses a presence/absence-based fidelity measure.
   Conclusions
   If the aim of a classification is to obtain clusters rich in faithful species, which can be subsequently used as diagnostic species for identification of community types, OptimClass is a suitable method for simultaneous choice of the optimal classification algorithm and optimal number of clusters. It can be computed in the JUICE program.

AB The compositions of bacterial communities in the gut of abalone were determined using the 16S rDNA clone library and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Sequencing of cloned 16S rDNA amplicons revealed a diverse community comprised Alpha-, Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria, and Mollicutes in the gut of artificial diet-fed abalone, and majority of Mollicutes, Fusobacteria, Alpha-and Gammaproteobacteria, in the gut of starved abalone. Biodiversity of gut bacterial community was rather high in artificial diet fed abalones than in Laminaria fed and starved animals. While, in situ abundance of the community composition determined by FISH revealed that 54% of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained bacteria were hybridized with a probe for Gammaprotcobacteria and 40% of DAPI-stained bacteria appeared to be of the Vibrio group. Alphaproteobacteria, which was frequent in clone libraries, was less abundant in artificial diet fed abalones determined by FISH. Our data show that the Vibrio group can be a dominant component in the gut microflora, of abalone. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Populations of a protandric limpet, Cymbula oculus, were compared between two South African Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), Dwesa and Tsitsikamma, and four exploited sites, and between sites exposed to or sheltered from strong wave action. Harvesting is decimating populations of this limpet. Compared with harvested sites, limpets in MPAs were 30-50% larger, adult densities 75% greater and biomass 30-90% greater. The female:male ratio was 0.58:1 inside the MPAs, but 0.11:1 at harvested sites. Growth rate and age-at-maturity were unaffected by harvesting, but survivorship was 10-fold higher inside MPAs, and reproductive output a staggering 80-fold higher. Conversely, recruitment was three times higher in harvested than protected areas, and inversely correlated with adult density. Wave action had negative effects of similar magnitude to harvesting. Limpets at sheltered sites were 65% larger, biomass 80% greater, female proportions 40% higher, survivorship 25% greater and growth 33% greater. Recruitment was, however, 45% greater at wave-exposed sites. All these effects were detected only inside the MPAs, being masked by harvesting elsewhere. The impacts of harvesting and wave action could never have been detected without the existence of MPAs, emphasizing their importance for base-line studies as well as protection. Dwesa MPA is under threat from poaching and demands for access to resources, but a strong case exists for retaining at least a core fully protected area. Our results clearly illustrate the need for MPAs among the tools used for coastal management. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stephens Island (Cook Strait, New Zealand) is home to large populations of fairy prions (Pachyptila turtur) and tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus, an ancient reptile), which share burrows in the ground. It has been assumed that guano deposition by seabirds increases nutrient availability to plants, and that large populations of the carnivorous tuatara are the result of flow-through effects from plants to invertebrate herbivores. We examined the within-island scale effects of seabirds and tuatara on for est soils and vegetation along a gradient of burrow densities. High burrow densities were correlated with extremely low soil pH (down to 3.4), very high soil P (up to 3.9 mg P g(-1)), and high litter deposition but low ground litter. Seedling numbers declined marginally as burrow numbers increased. Seedling emergence rates from field soils, and germination and growth of a phytometer species also decreased in soils from areas with high burrow densities. In contrast, soil available N (NO3- and NH4+) was high everywhere and did not change with burrow density. Furthermore, of three common shrub species examined (Macropiper excelsum, Coprosma repens and Melicytus ramiflorus), only one (Macropiper excelsum) showed an increase in leaf N concentration with increased burrow density, and only one (C. repens) showed increased herbivory (number of holes per leaf and area per leaf removed) with increased burrow density. Birds descending through trees may increase litter loss. There is little evidence for changes in herbivory or nutrient availability to herbivores along burrow density gradients. We suggest that, although overall nutrient availability may be increased by the presence of these animals, very high densities have negative effects on seedling populations.

AB The paper reviews the main findings of rocky shore and subtidal nearshore experimental marine ecology (EME) in cold and temperate marine ecosystems during the past four decades. It analyzes the role of EME in coastal management and conservation. The historical development of strategies for managing single or multispecies fisheries are reviewed. The published results show overexploitation and depletion of more than 60% of the fish stocks and a lack of connection between the management of fisheries and results derived from experimental marine ecology. This is mainly due to: (a) the different temporal and spatial scale at which most marine ecologists and fishery managers operate; (b) the lack of long-term fishery monitoring and adaptive techniques for management; and (c) limitations in the design of experiments on fisheries. Large-scale oceanic perturbations, due to combinations of excessive resource exploitation and environmental variability coupled with present trends in management approaches are discussed. Modern approaches and tools for management of fisheries, such as Adaptive Management (AM), Territorial User Rights in Fisheries (TURFs), Individual Transferrable Quotas and Non-Transferrable Quotas (ITQs, INTQs) are discussed in the context of small-scale fisheries and EME, Published views on limits of applied ecological research with regards to management of fisheries are discussed. Linkages between EME, marine conservation and the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and experimental exclusions of humans are highlighted. Results derived from MPAs, such as: (a) species or community trophic cascades, and (b) the role of key-stone species and species interaction strengths, are discussed. It is concluded that the role of EME in conservation has been greater than has been the case in management of fisheries. The potential to link EME, conservation and the management of fisheries is exemplified through the proposed establishment in Chile of a connected network of Scientific Reserves, MPAs and TURFs sites. The final conclusion is that to cross-fertilize EME, conservation and management, there are three main challenges: (1) to end the traditional view of approaching the management of fisheries and marine conservation as contradictory/antagonizing issues; (2) to improve communications between experimental marine ecology and the management of fisheries through the implementation of experimentation and adaptive management; (3) to improve linkages between marine conservation, the management of fisheries and social sciences.

AB New pollen-analytical data from the Navarres peatbog (Valencia, eastern Spain) show a synchronous Late-Quaternary fluctuation of P. pinaster- (cluster pine) and Quercus- (oak) dominated assemblages. During glacial times, P, pinaster survived in refugia together with other trees such as Corylus, Fraxinus Quercus, and a number of Mediterranean shrubs such as Arbutus, Erica arborea, Olea, Phyllirea, Pistacia terebinthus, Myrtus communis and Viburnum tinus. These nuclei of vegetation expanded around c. 30 000-27 000 BP invading areas formerly occupied by pine forests. P. pinaster retreated considerably during the last glacial maximum and the Younger Dryas event, but not as much as Quercus. During c. 10 000-6000 BP, a local pine forest resisted possible oak and P. pinaster invasion. Around 6000 BP, P. pinaster was involved in a post-fire change towards oak-dominated vegetation. This work supports the contention that P. pinaster is native to the Iberian Peninsula and that well-developed P. pinaster forests, particularly if mixed with oaks, are a natural feature of the landscape. The data presented here disagree with the floristic-phytosociological assumption that considers that the forest patches of P. pinaster and other Mediterranean species of pines are incidental and mainly derived from afforestation.

AB Microorganisms are fundamental to the functioning of Antarctic ecosystems. Although microbial biomass can be immense in Southern Ocean blooms and freshwater cyanobacterial mats, species richness is generally more restricted than it is in temperate regions. However, there are representatives of a broad variety of taxa providing a diverse gene pool. Species diversity may be low while metabolic flexibility is high so that a few strains can provide most necessary functions. In this context, biodiversity is the sum of biological potential. This Special Issue highlights aspects of microbial ecology that can be studied only in Antarctica or which are defined most clearly in Antarctic habitats. Relatively simple microbial communities, or conspicuous species within them, can be used as indicators of microbial processes and responses to environmental change. These include the palaeological record of benthic diatoms and response of soil cyanobacterial communities to regional warming and UV-B stress. The climatic conditions and relict habitats of the Antarctic dry valleys are a valuable analogue for detecting microbial life and diversity on Mars. The global microbial biodiversity initiative Diversitas and international Antarctic networks such as BIOTAS (Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems) harness taxonomic and ecophysiological expertize to understand better these unique polar ecosystems.

AB Many species in the family Pinaceae are invaders. These species are relatively easy to control because of some of their intrinsic characteristics and because they are highly visible and easy to eliminate. Many Pinaceae species have been well studied because of their use in forestry and their invasive behavior in many countries. The impacts of invasive Pinaceae are not only ecological, but also economic and social. We review the ecology and management of Pinaceae invasions and explore how restoration of invaded areas should be addressed. There are many ways to prevent invasions and to deal with them. Planting less invasive species, better site selection, and invasion monitoring are used successfully in different parts of the world to prevent invasion. Mechanical and chemical methods are used effectively to control Pinaceae invasions. Control is more effective at the early stages of invasion. Old invasions are more problematic as their elimination is more expensive, and the restoration of native vegetation is challenging. In some areas, native vegetation cannot thrive after Pinaceae have been removed, and weeds colonize cleared areas. More attention is needed to prevent the initiation and spread of invasions by focusing control interventions at early stages of invasion. Finding new ways of dealing sustainably with conflicts of interest between foresters and conservationists is crucial. Non-native Pinaceae are important parts of the economies and landscapes in several countries and they will continue to play such a role in the future. Despite the numerous challenges facing Pinaceae invasion management, several approaches can be successful at controlling them. Proper application of current techniques and development of more efficient ones is needed if the goal of maximizing benefits and minimizing negative impacts is to be achieved.

AB Temporal changes in net energy balance of animals strongly influence fitness; consequently, natural selection should favor behaviors that increase net energy balance by buffering individuals against negative effects of environmental variation. The relative importance of behavioral responses to climate-induced variation in costs vs. supplies of energy, however, is uncertain, as is the degree to which such responses are mediated by current stores of energy. We evaluated relationships among behavior, nutritional condition (i.e., energy state), and spatiotemporal variation in costs vs. supplies of energy available to a large-bodied endotherm, the North American elk (Cervus elaphus), occupying two ecosystems with contrasting climates and energy landscapes: a temperate, montane forest and an arid, high-elevation desert. We hypothesized that during spring through autumn, behavioral responses to the energy landscape would be both context dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the contrasting environmental conditions experienced by elk in the forest vs. the desert), and state dependent (i.e., would vary as a function of the energy balance of an individual). We tested several predictions derived from that hypothesis by combining output from a biophysical model of the thermal environment with data on forage quality, animal locations, and nutritional condition of individuals. At the population level, elk in the desert selected areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation over those that provided the highest-quality forage. In the forest, however, costs imposed by the thermal environment were less pronounced, and elk selected areas that increased access to high-quality forage over those that reduced costs of thermoregulation. At the individual level, nutritional condition did not influence strength of selection for low-cost areas or high-quality forage among elk in the forest. In the desert, however, strength of selection for low-cost areas (but not forage quality) was state dependent; individuals in the poorest condition at the end of winter showed the strongest selection for areas that reduced costs of thermoregulation during spring and summer, and also expended the least amount of energy on locomotion. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the roles of behavior and nutritional condition in buffering endotherms against direct and indirect effects of climate on fitness.

AB Bacteria and metazoan zooplankton (mainly crustaceans) are often viewed as 2 separate functional groups in the pelagic food webs indirectly linked via nutrient cycling and trophic cascades. Yet a zooplankter's body carries a high abundance of diverse bacteria, often at an equivalent concentration orders of magnitude higher than the ambient bacterial concentration. Zooplankton bodies are organic-rich micro-environments that support fast bacterial growth. Their physical-chemical conditions differ from those in the surrounding water and therefore select for different bacterial communities, including anaerobic bacteria that otherwise may not thrive in a well-oxygenated water column. The zooplankton body provides protection to the associated bacteria from environmental stresses similar to biofilms. Furthermore, migration by zooplankton enables rapid dispersal of bacteria over vast distances and across boundaries such as the pycnocline. In addition to live zooplankton molts, fecal pellets, and carcasses of zooplankton all influence water column and benthic microbial communities in various ways. We review the recent advances in the study of (crustacean) zooplankton-bacteria interactions and discuss future research opportunities and challenges. Traditional aquatic microbial ecology emphasizes free-living bacteria, which represent only a fraction of the microbial world. By transcending disciplinary boundaries, microbial ecologists and zooplankton ecologists can work together to integrate the two disciplines and advance our understanding in aquatic microbial ecology.

AB The relationship between marine reserve design and metapopulation persistence has been analyzed only for cases of spatially homogenous advective-diffusive larval dispersal. However, many coastlines exhibit more complex circulation, such as retention zones in which slower-moving currents shorten dispersal distances and larvae can accumulate. We constructed metapopulation models that incorporated 3 types of spatial variability in dispersal associated with retention zones: (A) reduction of both advective (L-A) and stochastic (L-S) length scales of dispersal within the retention zone, (B) reduction of LA only, and (C) accumulation of larvae in the retention zone, followed by redistribution along the coastline. For each scenario, we examined reserve networks with a range of size and spacing configurations. The scenarios differed in the relative number of self-persistent reserves, i.e. those which can survive in isolation, and network-persistent reserves, i.e. those which rely on connectivity through space and across generations to offset shortfalls in direct self-replenishment. When dispersal was dominated by stochastic movements (L-S > L-A in scenarios A and B), metapopulations typically consisted of self-persistent reserves. As dispersal became increasingly advective (L-A > L-S), retention aided persistence, and network persistence became more prevalent. Persistence in scenario C decreased with the amount of redistribution. The specific patterns of persistence depended on the size and number of reserves and demographic parameters, but self-persistence was always more likely for reserves in the retention zone. Thus, placing a reserve in a retention zone to promote population persistence is advisable for all 3 dispersal scenarios.

AB Ant-dispersed herbs (myrmecochores) can account for more than one-third of the stems in the temperate deciduous forests of eastern North America. Because many ant species have been observed collecting the seeds, this interaction is often described as a generalized mutualism. Here, we combine fieldwork and meta-analyses to test this assumption. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that Aphaenogaster ants (predominantly A. rudis) collect approximately 74 +/- 26% (mean +/- SD) of the myrmecochorous seeds in eastern North American forests where any encounters with Aphaenogaster were reported, and approximately 61 +/- 37% of the seeds in all the eastern forests where any seed collection has been monitored. This remarkable monopolization of seeds is due to at least two factors: 1) Aphaenogaster are significantly more likely to collect the ant-adapted seeds they discover than are ten other ant genera found in these forests and 2) the densities of Aphaenogaster and myrmecochorous plants are positively correlated at three nested spatial scales (within 20x20 m patches, among patches within a forest, and among 41 forests in the eastern United States). Although other ants can collect seeds, our analyses demonstrate that A. rudis is the primary seed dispersal vector for most of this rich temperate ant-dispersed flora. The low levels of plant partner diversity for myrmecochores demonstrated here rivals that of tropical ant-plants (myrmecophytes) and well exceeds that typically observed in temperate plant-frugivore and plant-pollinator mutualisms and myrmecochory in other biomes.

AB The formation of sea urchin 'barrens' on shallow temperate rocky reefs is well documented. However there has been much conjecture about the underlying mechanisms leading to sea urchin barrens, and relatively little experimentation to test these-ideas critically. We conducted a series of manipulative experiments to determine whether predation mortality is an important mechanism structuring populations of the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma in Tasmania. Tethered juvenile and adult sea urchins experienced much higher rates of mortality inside no-take marine reserves where sea urchin predators were abundant compared to adjacent fished areas where predators were fewer. Mortality of tagged (but not tethered) sea urchins was also notably higher in marine reserves than in adjacent areas open to fishing. When a range, of sizes of sea urchins was exposed to three sizes of rock lobsters in a caging experiment, juvenile sea urchins were eaten more frequently than larger sea urchins by all sizes of rock lobster, but only the largest rock lobsters (> 120 mm CL) were able to consume large adult sea urchins. Tagging (but not tethering) juvenile and adult sea urchins in two separate marine reserves indicated that adult sea urchins experience higher predation mortality than juveniles, probably because juveniles can shelter in cryptic microhabitat more effectively. In a field experiment in which exposure of sea urchins to rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and demersal reef fish predators was manipulated, rock lobsters were shown to be more important than fish as predators of adult sea urchins in a marine reserve. We conclude that predators, and particularly rock lobsters, exert significant predation mortality on H. erythrogramma in Tasmanian marine reserves, and that adult sea urchins are more vulnerable than smaller cryptic individuals. Fishing of rock lobsters is likely to reduce an important component of mortality in H. erythrogramma populations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Aims In the dry tropics, vegetative phenology varies widely with tree characteristics and soil conditions. The present work aims to document the phenological diversity of flowering and fruiting with reference to leafing events in Indian dry-tropical tree species.
   Methods Nine tree species, including one leaf-exchanging and eight deciduous showing varying leafless periods, were studied. Monthly counts of leaves, flowers and fruits were made on 160 tagged twigs on ten individuals of each species for initiation, completion and duration of different phenological events through two annual cycles.
   Key Results Variation in flowering relative to leaf flushing (which occurred just prior to or during a hot, dry summer) revealed five flowering types: summer flowering (on foliated shoots), rainy-season flowering (on foliated shoots following significant rains), autumn flowering (on shoots with mature leaves), winter flowering (on shoots undergoing leaf fall) and dry-season flowering (on leafless shoots). Duration of the fruiting phenophase was shortest (3-4 months) in dry-season and winter-flowering species, 6-9 months in rainy-and autumn-flowering species, and maximum (11 months) in summer-flowering species. A wide range of time lag (< 1 to > 8 months) between the start of vegetative (first-leaf flush) and reproductive (first-visible flower) phases was recorded in deciduous species; this time lag was correlated with the extent of the leafless period. A synthesis of available phenological information on 119 Indian tropical trees showed that summer-flowering species were most abundant (56% of total species) amongst the five types recognized.
   Conclusions The wide diversity of seasonal flowering and fruiting with linkages to leaf flush time and leafless period reflect the fact that variable reproductive and survival strategies evolved in tree species under a monsoonic bioclimate. Flowering periodicity has evolved as an adaptation to an annual leafless period and the time required for the fruit to develop. The direct relationship between leafless period (inverse of growing period) and time lag between onset of vegetative and reproductive phases reflects the partitioning of resource use for supporting these phases. Predominance of summer flowering coupled with summer leaf flushing seems to be a unique adaptation in trees to survive under a strongly seasonal tropical climate.

AB Aim The aim of this paper is to analyse fossil charcoal deposits, largely identified to the species level and spanning a sequence from the late Holocene to < 40,000 BP, in order to reconstruct Late Quaternary vegetation and climatic patterns in the western (winter-rainfall) fynbos biome of South Africa.
   Location The charcoals were excavated from the Elands Bay Cave (32 degrees 19S, 18 degrees 20E) on the semiarid (200-250 mmyr(-1)), winter-rainfall coastline of the western fynbos biome.
   Methods Patterns in the charcoal data set over time were sought by manual sorting of the charcoal x sample matrix, as well as by subjecting the data to multivariate analysis. Palaeoclimatic reconstruction was attempted by comparing the climatic controls on contemporary vegetation communities that resembled the fossil assemblages. Charcoal diversity was modelled using sample age and number of charcoal fragments as explanatory variables.
   Results The fossil assemblages ranged from xeric communities (similar to those presently occurring at the site) during the Holocene, to more mesic thicket and fynbos vegetation in the terminal Pleistocene, to Afromontane forest and riverine woodland communities after about 18,000 BP. Diversity of the charcoal samples increased monotonically with increasing sample age.
   Main conclusions The results suggest that, unlike the eastern fynbos biome, which is under fundamentally different climatic controls, soil moisture conditions in the western part of the biome were higher in the Last Glacial than during the Holocene. This scenario may help to explain the higher regional richness and associated diversification in the western than eastern part of the biome.

AB Sinking boreholes to tap groundwater supplies facilitated expansion of all-year round livestock production into the semi-arid Kalahari. Increased grazing and trampling pres sure around the boreholes often caused vegetation changes and range degradation. The long-term influences of cattle grazing on vegetation pattern around watering points in the southern part of the semi-arid Kalahari are investigated using a grid-based simulation model. Shrub-grass dynamics are modelled for two regimes with high and low rainfall and under various stocking rates. Results indicate the formation of distinct vegetation zones ('piosphere' zones) at the high rainfall site. Under all tested stocking rates distinct zones of bare soil, woody shrubs and a mixed grass-shrub savanna develop. The piosphere zones expand outwards at a rate correlated with the grazing pressure. At the lower-rainfall site zone development is limited and influenced by rainfall. Under abnormally high stocking rates an increase in shrub cover occurs within 50 yr under the low rainfall regime, leading to less distinct zones than under the high rainfall scenario. Modelling results suggest that the recovery potential of shrub-encroached piosphere zones after withdrawal of cattle is negligible in a time span of 100 yr.

AB Fire and herbivory are the two consumers of above-ground biomass globally. They have contrasting impacts as they differ in terms of selectivity and temporal occurrence. Here, we integrate continental-scale data on fire and herbivory in Africa to explore (i) how environmental drivers constrain these two consumers and (ii) the degree to which each consumer affects the other. Environments conducive to mammalian herbivory are not necessarily the same as those conducive to fire, although their spheres of influence do overlap-especially in grassy ecosystems which are known for their frequent fires and abundance of large mammalian herbivores. Interactions between fire and herbivory can be competitive, facultative or antagonistic, and we explore this with reference to the potential for alternative ecosystem states. Although fire removes orders of magnitude more biomass than herbivory their methane emissions are very similar, and in the past, herbivores probably emitted more methane than fire. We contrast the type of herbivory and fire in different ecosystems to define 'consumer-realms'.

AB A 30-day experiment was performed to investigate the effects of bioflocs on water quality, and survival, growth and digestive enzyme activities of the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Altogether 28 shrimp (7.4 +/- 0.1g) were stocked in each 150L tank. Two bioflocs treatments and one control were managed: bioflocs 1' and bioflocs 2' based on two different densities of the bioflocs, and clean water control without the bioflocs. Brown sugar was added to the bioflocs 1 and bioflocs 2 treatment tanks accounting for 28% and 80% of the shrimp feed respectively (corresponding to proximate C/N ratios of 10 and 14 in daily additions of organic matter respectively), so as to promote bioflocs production and approximately 14mLL-1 in treatment bioflocs 1 and 20mLL-1 in treatment bioflocs 2 were maintained from day 15. Monitoring of selected water quality parameters throughout the whole experiment period showed that all parameters remained within recommended levels for shrimp culture in the bioflocs treatments at zero-water exchange, especially low total ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen levels. By the end of the experiment, shrimp survival rates were above 86%, with no significant differences (0.05) among the three groups. Both weight gain rate and special growth rate tended to increase in the bioflocs treatments compared to those in the control. Meanwhile, the overall specific activities of protease, amylase, cellulase and lipase of the shrimp in the bioflocs treatments were all higher than those in the control; and for the specific activity of the same digestive enzyme, the differences between the bioflocs treatments and the control performed inconsistently among different organs: hepatopancreas, stomach and intestine. Present results suggest that the bioflocs can not only maintain favourable water quality conditions for shrimp culture and help shrimp grow well in zero-water exchange culture systems, but may also have a positive effect on digestive enzyme activities of the shrimp.

AB P>1. Savanna ecosystems are defined largely by tree-grass mixtures, and tree establishment is a key driver of community structure and ecosystem function in these systems. The factors controlling savanna tree establishment are understudied, but likely involve some combination of seed, microsite and predator/fire limitation. In African savannas, suppression and killing of adult trees by large mammals like elephants (Loxodonta africana Blumenbach, 1797) and giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis Linnaeus, 1758) can maintain tree-grass co-dominance, although the impacts of even these conspicuous herbivores on tree establishment also are poorly understood.
   2. We combined seed addition and predator exclusion experiments with a large-scale, long-term field manipulation of large herbivores to investigate the relative importance of seeds, microsites and predators in limiting establishment of a monodominant tree (Acacia drepanolobium Sjostedt) in a Kenyan savanna.
   3. Both wild and domestic (i.e. cattle; Bos taurus Linnaeus, 1758) large herbivores facilitated tree establishment by suppressing abundances of rodents, the most important seed and seedling predators. However, this indirect, positive effect of wild herbivores was negated by wild herbivores' suppression of seed production. Cattle did not have this direct, negative impact; rather, they further assisted tree establishment by reducing cover of understorey grasses. Thus, the impacts of both groups of large herbivores on tree establishment were largely routed through other taxa, with a negligible net effect of wild herbivores and a positive net effect of cattle on tree establishment.
   4. The distinction between the (positive) net effect of cattle and (neutral) net effect of wild herbivores is due to the inclusion of browsers and mixed feeders within the assemblage of wild herbivores. Browsing by wild herbivores limited seed production, which reduced tree recruitment; grazing by cattle was more pronounced than that by wild herbivores, and thus promoted germination and subsequent establishment of small trees.
   5. Our study is the first to link seed fates to tree establishment in savanna ecosystems in experimentally-manipulated herbivore communities. Further, our results highlight how large herbivores can modify a suite of independent factors - seed production, competition with understorey species, and seed and seedling predation - to collectively drive tree establishment.

AB Acacia dealbata Link is an Australian woody legume that has become a serious environmental problem in Northwest Spain where it forms dense monospecific patches modifying the structure of different native ecosystems and threatening native aboveground biodiversity. In spite of the dramatic changes observed in the vegetation of invaded sites little is known about the consequences of invasion for soil microorganisms. To investigate the effect of A. dealbata invasion on the structure of soil fungi and bacteria communities, samples were taken from invaded and non-invaded areas from three different ecosystems in Northwest Spain: pine forest, shrubland and grassland. In each ecosystem type, soil samples were taken in areas of native vegetation, areas invaded by A. dealbata and in the transition zone between native and invaded vegetation. Soil microorganisms were analyzed in the different samples by PCR-DGGE using general primers for eubacteria and fungi. Soil analyses were also performed to evaluate the effect of A. dealbata invasion on soil fertility.
   The invasion by A. dealbata consistently increased soil N, C, organic matter and exchangeable P content in the three studied ecosystems. A clear effect of the invasion on the overall structure of microorganism communities was only observed in the shrubland where soil fungal communities in the invaded and transition areas clustered together and apart from the native soil. Significant differences in soil microorganisms richness and diversity between invaded and not invaded soils were only found in the grassland. Grassland invasion by A. dealbata lead to a significant increase of bacterial richness and to a significant reduction in fungal richness and diversity. Our results show that although the changes on soil chemistry due to A. dealbata invasion are consistent among the studied ecosystems, the effect on soil microorganisms depends on the ecosystem type affected by the invasion.

AB For many years, tropical and subtropical forests have been deforested for agriculture, grazing, and timber extraction. Nevertheless in the last decade, several publications have suggested that some regions of Latin America are showing a process of forest transition. Forest transition theory predicts that industrialization and urbanization will lead to the abandonment of marginal agriculture lands and the recovery of natural systems such as forests. However, there are many ecological, economic, and social factors that could act as barriers to ecosystem recovery. To evaluate this hypothesis, we analyzed the socioeconomic and land-use changes during the last 30 years at the provincial and departmental level in the province of Misiones, Argentina. We described the changes in the distribution of urban and rural populations based on national population censuses from 1970, 1980, 1991, and 2001. Land-use change was based on a supervised analysis of four mosaics of Landsat Multispectral Scanner and Thematic Mapper satellite images from 1973, 1979, 1987/1989, and 2006. Although the change in the rural population varied greatly among the departments, there has been a dramatic increase in the urban population at the provincial level. The major land-use changes between 1973 and 2006 were an increase in monospecific plantations of mainly Pinus and Eucalyptus of 2702 km(2) and a loss of 4689 km(2) of natural forest. Misiones possesses the largest remnant of continuous Atlantic Forest, which is famous for its high level of biodiversity and endemism, but much of this forest now comprises monospecific plantations. Although demographic changes in Misiones are similar to those that have occurred other regions (i.e., rural-urban migration), and the increase in forest plantations helps to maintain forest cover, this cover has much lower ecological value than that of natural forest. To ensure the conservation of the high-diversity Atlantic Forest in Misiones requires a better effort to understand the interactions among the diverse factors that affect land-use patterns in this region.

AB Sea urchins are one of the most common seagrass macro-grazers in contemporary seagrass systems. Occasionally their grazing rates exceed seagrass growth rates, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as overgrazing. Because of a reported increasing frequency of overgrazing events, concomitant with loss of seagrass-associated ecosystem services, it has been suggested that overgrazing is one of the key threats to tropical and subtropical seagrasses. In light of this, we review the current knowledge on causes, consequences. and management of sea urchin overgrazing of seagrasses. Initially we argue that the definition of overgrazing must include scale and impairment of ecosystem services, since this is the de facto definition used in the literature, and will highlight the potential societal costs of seagrass overgrazing. A review of 16 identified cases suggests that urchin overgrazing is a global phenomenon, ranging from temperate to tropical coastal waters and involving at least 11 seagrass and 7 urchin species. Even though most overgrazing events Seem to affect areas of <0.5 km(2), and recovery often occurs within a few years, overgrazing can have a range of large, long-term indirect effects such as loss of associated fauna and decreased sediment stabilization. A range of drivers behind overgrazing have been suggested, including bottom-up (nutrient enrichment). top-down (reduced predation control due to e.g. overfishing), "side-in" mechanisms (e.g. changes in water temperature) and natural population fluctuations. Based on recent studies, there seems to be fairly strong support for the top-down and bottom-up hypotheses. However, many potential drivers often co-occur and interact, especially in areas with high anthropogenic pressure, suggesting that multiple disturbances-by simultaneously reducing predation control, increasing urchin recruitment and reducing the resistance of seagrasses-could pave the way for overgrazing. In management, the most common response to overgrazing has been to remove urchins, but limited knowledge of direct and indirect effects makes it difficult to assess the applicability and sustainability of this method. Based on the wide knowledge gaps, which severely limits management, we suggest that future research should focus on (1) identification and quantification of ecosystem and societal scale effects of overgrazing; (2) assessment of the relative importance and interactions of different drivers; and (3) development of a holistic proactive and reactive long-term management agenda.

AB The dynamics of animal populations can be influenced directly by prevailing resources, population density, and environmental conditions, and through the delayed effects of trophic interactions and, abiotic effects on habitat conditions. For large mammals, lagged effects can extend several years back in time. We attempted to establish the causal processes governing the population changes shown by I I ungulate species counted annually over a 20-year period in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Kudu, waterbuck, warthog, sable, tsessebe, roan, and eland declined progressively in abundance after 1986, while zebra, wildebeest, impala, and giraffe maintained high abundance levels. To identify lagged influences, we used statistical probes indexing (1) inferred changes in predator abundance as a consequence of past food availability, (2) effects on habitat conditions of prior rainfall, and (3) competitor impacts on shared food resources. Multiple linear regression models were fit to estimates of annual population growth derived from the count totals subdivided among four regions. The temporal pattern of the population declines by five species was most consistent with a lagged effect from past predator food, in addition to the direct effects of seasonal rainfall. However, models including the lagged effect of prior rainfall fit nearly as well. Species that maintained high abundance responded mainly to an immediate or lagged density feedback. Changing rainfall conditions apparently affect the relative susceptibility of ungulate species to predation. Hence, the top-down interaction with predators cannot readily be disentangled from extrinsic influences on population dynamics, mediated through resources. Population declines by some species became extreme because a prolonged period of low rainfall, especially in the dry-season component, followed a doubling in the food base supporting lions, and was coupled with widened prey distribution as a consequence of the augmentation of water points by managers. Changes. in population abundance within this multi-prey, generalist predator system arose from a complex interplay between changing climatic conditions, variable food production, shifting habitat conditions, varying vulnerability to predation, and spillover effects on other species.

AB Phenological patterns in tropical plants usually are associated with the clear seasonality of rainfall associated with very different wet and dry seasons. In southern Brazil, in a subtropical forest with no pronounced dry season (average annual precipitation = 1389 mm, minimum monthly average c. 75 mm), plant phenology was studied to test for patterns (periodicity), to examine how phenological patterns vary among life-forms, and to test whether phenological cycles are associated with climatic variables. Thirty-seven plant species in four life-forms (trees, shrubs, lianas and epiphytes) were studied for 2 yr (1996-98) in an Araucaria forest remnant in southern Brazil, in the state of Parana. Correlation and multiple regression methods established relationships between phenology and climate in terms of daylength, temperature and rainfall. In this Araucaria forest, plants showed seasonality in most life-forms and phenological phases. Leaf-fall, with its peak during the drier months (April to July), was the most seasonal. Flushing and flowering occurred during the wetter months (September to December), while fruiting occurred all year long. Phenologies varied among life-forms, and were strongly associated with daylength or temperature of preceding months, suggesting that plants receive their phenological cues well in advance of their phenological response. Phenologies in this Araucaria forest appear to be associated with the most predictable and highly correlated of the climatic variables, daylength and temperature and least so with rainfall, which is unpredictable.

AB Three introduced predators, the dingo (Canis lupus dingo), the fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the feral cat (Felis catus) are widespread throughout the and interior of Western Australia. While the dingo has been present for an estimated 3500-4000 years, the fox and the feral cat are relatively recent arrivals and have been implicated in the modern decline and in some cases extinction of and zone fauna, especially medium size mammals. This paper reports on a long-term, large-scale project aimed at developing control strategies for these introduced predators. Broad area control of foxes and dingoes in the Gibson Desert using 40-60g dried meat baits impregnated with the poison sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) and delivered by aircraft at a density of 5 baits km(-2) proved to be highly effective. Following a single aerial baiting of some 1600 km(2), foxes and dingoes were virtually eradicated from a core area for up to 15 months, but feral cats appeared to increase in abundance. Two aerial baitings (each 400 km(2)) carried out during periods of below average rainfall using a small (about 30 g) fresh meat bait developed to be attractive to feral cats reduced their abundance by an estimated 75% and 100% when baits were delivered at a density of 10 and 22 km(-2), respectively. A third aerial baiting at a density of I I baits km(-2) carried out during a period of above average rainfall reduced feral cat density by only 25% when surveyed 3 months after baiting. Baiting density, frequency and season are key factors likely to affect the impact of baiting on feral cat populations. Preliminary studies reveal that the home range of feral cats in this environment varies from about 700 to 1200 ha. Reptiles and small native mammals form the major dietary items of feral cats and the seasonal variation in abundance of these items is likely to affect bait uptake. These observations have important implications for control strategies. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In contrast to documented increases in woody plant dominance of former savannas and grasslands of North America, ecotones between oak (Quercus L.) woodlands and semi-desert grasslands of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico have been relatively stable over the past several centuries. Soil resource partitioning, wherein shallow-rooted grasses use summer precipitation and deep-rooted woody plants use winter precipitation, may have contributed to the stable coexistence of grasses and trees that form savannas at this ecotone. Thus, predicted changes in regional precipitation patterns and soil moisture caused by anthropogenic trace gas emissions have the potential to alter interactions between woody plants and grasses with potential ramifications fur their relative abundance and distribution.
   We used a field experiment to investigate the response of the dominant woodland and savanna tree Quercus emoryi to simulated potential scenarios of precipitation redistribution within the context of shifts in the woodland-grassland ecotone. Experimental soil volumes isolated from ambient precipitation and soil moisture were hand-watered between July 1994 and October 1996. Control plots received mean annual precipitation (602 mm), whereas treated plots received all possible combinations of 50% additions and reductions to mean summer and winter precipitation (n = 4). Increases in summer precipitation increased seedling emergence and recruitment rates as much as threefold, whereas emergence and recruitment were independent of altered winter precipitation regimes. Seedling survival, size, growth, and biomass allocation were largely independent of shifts in seasonal pre cipitation regimes.
   We conclude that Q. emoryi recruitment and subsequent abundance and distribution would more likely be affected by changes in summer precipitation than changes in winter precipitation. For example, increases in summer precipitation that increase rates of seedling emergence and establishment may facilitate downslope shifts in the woodland-grassland ecotone. Similarly, this mechanism may explain downslope shifts in this ecotone that occurred coincident with particularly high summer precipitation during the "Medieval Warm" period, 645-1295 yr BP. Further, whereas soil moisture resource partitioning between adult Q. emoryi and coexisting grasses may contribute to savanna maintenance, soil resource partitioning does not occur within the first three growing seasons after Q. emoryi germination. Results illustrate the importance of consideration of the regeneration niche, which is often overlooked when predicting thr response of woody plants to impending climate change.

AB Here we report concentrations of pollutants in floating plastics from the North Pacific accumulation zone (NPAC). We compared chemical concentrations in plastics of different types and sizes, assessed ocean plastic potential risks using sediment quality criteria, and discussed the implications of our findings for bioaccumulation. Our results suggest that at least a fraction of the NPAC plastics is not in equilibrium with the surrounding seawater. For instance, "hard plastic" samples had significantly higher PBDE concentrations than "nets and ropes". samples, and 29% of them had PBDE composition similar to a widely used flame-retardant mixture. Our findings indicate that NPAC plastics may pose a chemical risk to organisms as 84% of the samples had at least one chemical exceeding sediment threshold effect levels. Furthermore, our surface trawls collected more plastic than biomass (180 times on average), indicating that some NPAC organisms feeding upon floating particles may have plastic as a major component of their diets. If gradients for pollutant transfer from NPAC plastic to predators exist (as indicated by our fugacity ratio calculations), plastics may play a role in transferring chemicals to certain marine organisms.

AB A common approach to the conservation of farmland biodiversity and the promotion of multifunctional landscapes, particularly in landscapes containing only small remnants of non-crop habitats, has been to maintain landscape heterogeneity and reduce land-use intensity. In contrast, it has recently been shown that devoting specific areas of non-crop habitats to conservation, segregated from high-yielding farmland ("land sparing"), can more effectively conserve biodiversity than promoting low-yielding, less intensively managed farmland occupying larger areas ("land sharing"). In the present paper we suggest that the debate over the relative merits of land sparing or land sharing is partly blurred by the differing spatial scales at which it is suggested that land sparing should be applied. We argue that there is no single correct spatial scale for segregating biodiversity protection and commodity production in multifunctional landscapes. Instead we propose an alternative conceptual construct, which we call "multiple-scale landsparing," targeting biodiversity and ecosystem services in transformed landscapes. We discuss how multiple-scale land sparing may overcome the apparent dichotomy between land sharing and land sparing and help to find acceptable compromises that conserve biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality.

   BIOMASS
AB Many African protected areas (PAs) are not functioning effectively. We reviewed the performance of Zambia's PA network and provide insights into how their effectiveness might be improved. Zambia's PAs are under-performing in ecological, economic and social terms. Reasons include: a) rapidly expanding human populations, poverty and open-access systems in Game Management Areas (GMAs) resulting in widespread bushmeat poaching and habitat encroachment; b) underfunding of the Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) resulting in inadequate law enforcement; c) reliance of ZAWA on extracting revenues from GMAs to cover operational costs which has prevented proper devolution of user-rights over wildlife to communities; d) on-going marginalization of communities from legal benefits from wildlife; e) under-development of the photo-tourism industry with the effect that earnings are limited to a fraction of the PA network; f) unfavourable terms and corruption which discourage good practice and adequate investment by hunting operators in GMAs; g) blurred responsibilities regarding anti-poaching in GMAs resulting in under-investment by all stakeholders. The combined effect of these challenges has been a major reduction in wildlife densities in most PAs and the loss of habitat in GMAs. Wildlife fares better in areas with investment from the private and/or NGO sector and where human settlement is absent. There is a need for: elevated government funding for ZAWA; greater international donor investment in protected area management; a shift in the role of ZAWA such that they focus primarily on national parks while facilitating the development of wildlife-based land uses by other stakeholders elsewhere; and new models for the functioning of GMAs based on joint-ventures between communities and the private and/or NGO sector. Such joint-ventures should provide defined communities with ownership of land, user-rights over wildlife and aim to attract long-term private/donor investment. These recommendations are relevant for many of the under-funded PAs occurring in other African countries.

AB 1. Determining the extent to which coastal oceanographic processes facilitate connectivity of marine organisms underpins our understanding of the ecology and evolution of marine communities. Continental boundary currents are a dominant physical influence on marine connectivity, but determining their effect has proved elusive because of difficulties in achieving replication of currents within the distribution of a single species.
   2. Australia provides an unparalleled opportunity to address such questions because it has three replicate boundary currents within narrow latitudinal ranges that share continentally distributed species. We tested whether the strength of continental boundary currents influences coastal connectivity of a dominant foundation species (the kelp Ecklonia radiate).
   3. Variation in the strength of different boundary currents produced entirely different patterns of connectivity in kelp with high connectivity in strong currents and low connectivity in weak currents. Spatial patterns of genetic structuring were also correlated with the nature and strength of currents.
   4. Synthesis. This result has global implications; continental boundary currents are key drivers of marine connectivity and give predictive ability with which to understand variable ecologies of temperate coastlines world-wide.

AB Questions
   Does fuzzy clustering provide an appropriate numerical framework to manage vegetation classifications? What is the best fuzzy clustering method to achieve this?
   Material
   We used 531 releves from Catalonia (Spain), belonging to two syntaxonomic alliances of mesophytic and xerophytic montane pastures, and originally classified by experts into nine and 13 associations, respectively.
   Methods
   We compared the performance of fuzzy C-means (FCM), noise clustering (NC) and possibilistic C-means (PCM) on four different management tasks: (1) assigning new releve data to existing types; (2) updating types incorporating new data; (3) defining new types with unclassified releves; and (4) reviewing traditional vegetation classifications.
   Results
   As fuzzy classifiers, FCM fails to indicate when a given releve does not belong to any of the existing types; NC might leave too many releves unclassified; and PCM membership values cannot be compared. As unsupervised clustering methods, FCM is more sensitive than NC to transitional releves and therefore produces fuzzier classifications. PCM looks for dense regions in the space of species composition, but these are scarce when vegetation data contain many transitional releves.
   Conclusions
   All three models have advantages and disadvantages, although the NC model may be a good compromise between the restricted FCM model and the robust but impractical PCM model. In our opinion, fuzzy clustering might provide a suitable framework to manage vegetation classifications using a consistent operational definition of vegetation type. Regardless of the framework chosen, national/regional vegetation classification panels should promote methodological standards for classification practices with numerical tools.

AB The origin and affinities of southern African subtropical thicket have been misunderstood and neglected. This formation was only recognised as a biome distinct from savanna and karoo in the mid 1990s. One hypothesis states that it is a young vegetation type, assembled from forest, savanna and karoo elements after Holocene climatic amelioration. Others have suggested an ancient history for thicket. Here we review fossil and phylogenetic data in order to provide a better assessment of the origins of thicket. Albeit patchy, the fossil data are suggestive of a Palaeogene origin for this formation. A review of molecular phylogenetic data of extant thicket lineages indicated three major patterns: (i) ancient Cretaceous elements, including Encephalartos and the Strelitziaceae, (ii) basally branching lineages - many of which dominate contemporary thicket - that evolved in the Eocene (e.g. in the Celastraceae, Sapindaceae, Didiereaceae, Crassulaceae: Cotyledonoideae), and (iii) lineages derived from adjacent biomes that diversified in thicket in association with Neogene climatic deterioration (e.g. Aizoaceae, Asteraceae). We provide a narrative account of the evolution of thicket, which concludes that it is an ancient formation, extending back at least to the Eocene and derived initially from elements in the forest formations that prevailed in Upper Cretaceous and early Palaeogene times. As a biome, thicket is not uniquely southern African, being part of a formation that was globally widespread in the Eocene and which is extant in many parts of the world. Future research on the origins of thicket should focus on providing dates for major dichotomies as a complement to the rapid emergence of molecular phylogenies, as well as data on the genetic variation in populations of taxa categorised as ancient or young, and widespread or range-restricted.

AB The spatial and seasonal distribution of microcrustacean zooplankton of Lake Tana (Ethiopia) was monthly studied for 2 years. Concurrently, various environmental parameters were measured and related to zooplankton distribution. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to estimate the influence of abiotic factors and chlorophyll a content in structuring the zooplankton assemblage. Among the environmental factors, zooplankton abundance correlated most strongly with turbidity. Turbidity was negatively correlated with species abundance, especially for Daphnia spp. and to the least extent for Diaphanosoma spp. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine spatial (littoral, sublittoral and pelagic zone) and temporal (four seasons) variation in zooplankton abundance. We observed significant temporal differences in zooplankton abundance, with highest densities during dry season (November-April). Only cladocerans showed significant differences in habitat use (highest densities in the sublittoral zone).

AB Global environmental change is driven by multiple anthropogenic stressors. Conservation and restoration require understanding the individual and joint action of these stressors to evaluate and prioritize management measures. To date, most studies on multiple stressor effects have sought to identify potential stressor interactions, defined as deviations from null models, and related meta-analyses have focused on quantifying the relative proportion of stressor interactions across studies. These studies have provided valuable insights about the complexity of multiple stressor effects, but remain largely devoid of a theoretical framework for null model selection and prediction of effects. We suggest that multiple stressor research would benefit by (1) integrating and developing additional null models and (2) selecting null models based on their mechanistic assumptions of the stressor mode of action and organism sensitivities as well as stressor-effect relationships for individuals and populations. We present a range of null models and outline their underlying assumptions and application in multiple stressor research. Moving beyond mere description requires multiple stressor research to shift its focus from identifying statistically significant interactions to the use and development of mechanistic (null) models. Justified selection of the appropriate null model is a first step to achieve this.

AB Various definitions and indices have been proposed in the literature to identify keystone species. In this study, we intended to make the concept of keystone species operational for marine biodiversity conservation. We used an exclusive definition of keystone species, based on the original concept of keystone predator, and derived a new functional index of keystoneness (KS) from an ecosystem-modeling approach. First, several KS indices were formulated, by combining measures of the mixed-trophic impact (MTI) and biomass of species. Then, a meta-analysis was performed, based on 101 published Ecopath food-web models, selected with a scoring method, and representative of the variety of marine ecosystems worldwide. The indices were applied to the models, and two statistical methods were compared to select the most promising KS index. Rank correlation tests were performed to assess the balance between the contribution of the impact and biomass components to the different KS indices. In addition, a classification tree was implemented, based on ecosystem-specific thresholds applied to the latter species traits, and used to confirm the identified keystone species. The selected index obtained the highest number of models with positive results from both the rank correlation tests and the classification tree. We also demonstrated the limitations of existing KS indices previously applied in the literature. Species were ranked according to their estimates of keystoneness with the selected KS index, so that potential keystone species were quantitatively identified in the 101 modeled food webs. The standardized modeling approach allowed for a comparison of the identified keystone species across models: cartilaginous fishes and toothed whales obtained the highest occurrences. Finally, the selected KS index was applied to the well-known case study of Prince William Sound (Alaska, USA). Potentially significant anthropogenic (fishing) impacts on keystone species were also considered and discussed. The operational methodology presented is directly applicable to marine food webs, and may be adapted to other (freshwater or terrestrial) systems.

AB The resident microbiota of three oyster species (Crassostrea corteziensis, Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea sikamea) was characterised using a high-throughput sequencing approach (pyrosequencing) that was based on the V3-V5 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We analysed the changes in the bacterial community beginning with the postlarvae produced in a hatchery, which were later planted at two grow-out cultivation sites until they reached the adult stage. DNA samples from the oysters were amplified, and 31008 sequences belonging to 13 phyla (including Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes) and 243 genera were generated. Considering all life stages, Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum, but it showed variations at the genus level between the postlarvae and the adult oysters. Bacteroidetes was the second most common phylum, but it was found in higher abundance in the postlarvae than in adults. The relative abundance showed that the microbiota that was associated with the postlarvae and adults differed substantially, and higher diversity and richness were evident in the postlarvae in comparison with adults of the same species. The site of rearing influenced the bacterial community composition of C.corteziensis and C.sikamea adults. The bacterial groups that were found in these oysters were complex and metabolically versatile, making it difficult to understand the host-bacteria symbiotic relationships; therefore, the physiological and ecological significances of the resident microbiota remain uncertain.

AB The application of no-take marine-reserve status to an area is expected to increase spawning-stock biomass of species targeted by fisheries, and to help sustain fisheries external to the reserve. However, empirical evidence on rates and patterns of increase of density and biomass of target species following closures to fishing, and of decrease when reserve status is removed, remains rare. We have monitored density and biomass of large predatory coral-reef fish (Serranidae [Epinephelinae], Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae, and Carangidae, as a group) visually in two small no-take marine reserves and at two control (open to fishing) sites in the Philippines from 1983 to 2000. At Sumilon reserve a complex history of management allowed 13 measurements of density and biomass at durations of reserve protection of -3 yr (i.e., fished for 3 years after reserve status removed) to 9 yr. At Apo reserve 13 measurements were taken at durations of protection of 1-18 yr. We recorded 11 significant (P < 0.05) changes in density at the four sites over the 17 years, three declines and eight increases. All three significant declines occurred when reserve protection was removed. Four of the eight significant increases occurred when reserve status was applied. This represents some of the best evidence currently available that application of marine-reserve status causes increases in abundance of target species. Three of the four significant increases in density required 4-6 yr of protection. Significant positive linear correlations of mean density of large predators against years 4 reserve protection were observed at both reserves. The pattern of increase of mean biomass against years of reserve protection was exponential, with biomass initially increasing more slowly than density. Density and biomass increased by factors of 12.2 and 17.3, respectively, during 18 yr of continuous protection in Apo reserve. At Sumilon Island three bouts of unregulated fishing of 1.5-3 yr duration eliminated density and biomass gains accumulated over 5-9 yr of marine reserve protection.

AB We examined the relative nutritional values of natural phytoplankton and particulate detritus for zooplankton growth in a detritus-rich environment. Seston was collected seasonally from four different habitat types in a tidal freshwater system and fed to juvenile Daphnia magna under controlled culture conditions by use of a flow-through design. Seston particulate organic carbon (POC) and chlorophyll a contents ranged from similar to330 to 3,800 mug L-1 POC and 1.4 to 45 mug L-1 Chl a. A partial residual analysis revealed that detrital carbon concentrations were only weakly related to Daphnia growth, whereas Chl a proved to be highly predictive of Daphnia growth rates across all investigated habitat types. Overall, habitat type had a strong effect on growth rates, whereas season of seston collection did not, but differences among habitats could be attributed to differing Chl a concentrations. The results from this study imply that, even in systems with overwhelming amounts of detrital carbon from a variety of sources, nutritional factors associated with phytoplankton can be dominant in regulating zooplankton growth.

   SUCCESSION; COMMUNITY
AB Nitrogen-fixing plants, by altering the availability of soil N, potentially facilitate plant invasion. Here we describe how herbivore-driven mortality of a native N-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), increases soil N and light availability, which promotes Invasion by introduced grasses to the detriment of a native plant community.
   Soils under live and dead lupine stands contained large amounts of total N, averaging 3.14 mg N/g dry mass of soil (398 g/m(2)) and 3.45 mg N/g dry mass of soil (438 g/m(2)), respectively, over four years. In contrast, similar lupine-free soil was low in N and averaged only 1.66 mg N/g dry mass of soil (211 g/m(2)) over three years. The addition of N fertilizer to lupine-free soil produced an 81% increase in aboveground plant biomass compared to plots unamended with N. Mean rates of net N mineralization were higher under live lupine and where mass die-off of lupine had occurred compared to soils free of bush lupine. At all sites, only 2.5-4.2% of the total soil N pool was mineralized annually.
   Soil enriched by lupine is not available to colonists while lupines are alive. The dense canopy of lupine shades soil under shrubs, reducing average photon-flux density in late spring from 1725 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1) (full sunlight) to 13 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1) (underneath shrubs). Stand die-off due to insect herbivory exposed this bare, enriched soil. In January, when annual plants are establishing, average photon-flux density under dead lupines killed by insect herbivores was 370 mu mol m(-2) . s(-1), compared to the photon-flux density under live lupines of the same age, which averaged 83 mu mol . m(-2) . s(-1). The availability of bare, N-rich patches of soil enabled nonnative annuals (primarily Lolium multiflorum and Bromus diandrus) to colonize sites, grow rapidly, and dominate the plant assemblage until lupines reestablished after several years. The N content of these grasses was significantly greater than the N content of the mostly native plants that occupied adjacent coastal prairie devoid of bush lupine. Between 57 and 70% of the net amount of N mineralized annually was taken up by introduced grasses and subsequently returned to the soil upon the death of these annuals. Even in the absence of further N inputs, we estimate that it would take at least 25 yr to reduce the soil N pool by 50%, indicating that the reestablishment of the native prairie flora is likely to be long term.

AB The unparalleled biodiversity found in the American tropics (the Neotropics) has attracted the attention of naturalists for centuries. Despite major advances in recent years in our understanding of the origin and diversification of many Neotropical taxa and biotic regions, many questions remain to be answered. Additional biological and geological data are still needed, as well as methodological advances that are capable of bridging these research fields. In this review, aimed primarily at advanced students and early-career scientists, we introduce the concept of "trans-disciplinary biogeography," which refers to the integration of data from multiple areas of research in biology (e.g., community ecology, phylogeography, systematics, historical biogeography) and Earth and the physical sciences (e.g., geology, climatology, palaeontology), as a means to reconstruct the giant puzzle of Neotropical biodiversity and evolution in space and time. We caution against extrapolating results derived from the study of one or a few taxa to convey general scenarios of Neotropical evolution and landscape formation. We urge more coordination and integration of data and ideas among disciplines, transcending their traditional boundaries, as a basis for advancing tomorrow's ground-breaking research. Our review highlights the great opportunities for studying the Neotropical biota to understand the evolution of life.

AB To predict forest response to long-term climate change with high confidence requires that dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) be successfully tested against ecosystem response to short-term variations in environmental drivers, including regular seasonal patterns. Here, we used an integrated dataset from four forests in the Brasil flux network, spanning a range of dry-season intensities and lengths, to determine how well four state-of-the-art models (IBIS, ED2, JULES, and CLM3.5) simulated the seasonality of carbon exchanges in Amazonian tropical forests. We found that most DGVMs poorly represented the annual cycle of gross primary productivity (GPP), of photosynthetic capacity (Pc), and of other fluxes and pools. Models simulated consistent dry-season declines in GPP in the equatorial Amazon (Manaus K34, Santarem K67, and Caxiuana CAX); a contrast to observed GPP increases. Model simulated dry-season GPP reductions were driven by an external environmental factor, 'soil water stress' and consequently by a constant or decreasing photosynthetic infrastructure (Pc), while observed dry-season GPP resulted from a combination of internal biological (leaf-flush and abscission and increased Pc) and environmental (incoming radiation) causes. Moreover, we found models generally overestimated observed seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and respiration (Re) at equatorial locations. In contrast, a southern Amazon forest (Jaru RJA) exhibited dry-season declines in GPP and Re consistent with most DGVMs simulations. While water limitation was represented in models and the primary driver of seasonal photosynthesis in southern Amazonia, changes in internal biophysical processes, light-harvesting adaptations (e.g., variations in leaf area index (LAI) and increasing leaf-level assimilation rate related to leaf demography), and allocation lags between leaf and wood, dominated equatorial Amazon carbon flux dynamics and were deficient or absent from current model formulations. Correctly simulating flux seasonality at tropical forests requires a greater understanding and the incorporation of internal biophysical mechanisms in future model developments.

AB The seasonal climate drivers of the carbon cycle in tropical forests remain poorly known, although these forests account for more carbon assimilation and storage than any other terrestrial ecosystem. Based on a unique combination of seasonal pan-tropical data sets from 89 experimental sites (68 include aboveground wood productivity measurements and 35 litter productivity measurements), their associated canopy photosynthetic capacity (enhanced vegetation index, EVI) and climate, we ask how carbon assimilation and aboveground allocation are related to climate seasonality in tropical forests and how they interact in the seasonal carbon cycle. We found that canopy photosynthetic capacity seasonality responds positively to precipitation when rainfall is < 2000 mm yr(-1) (water-limited forests) and to radiation otherwise (light-limited forests). On the other hand, independent of climate limitations, wood productivity and litterfall are driven by seasonal variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration, respectively. Consequently, light-limited forests present an asynchronism between canopy photosynthetic capacity and wood productivity. First-order control by precipitation likely indicates a decrease in tropical forest productivity in a drier climate in water-limited forest, and in current light-limited forest with future rainfall < 2000 mm yr(-1).

AB Species should only persist in local communities if they have functional traits that are compatible with habitat-specific environmental conditions. Consequently, pronounced regional environmental gradients should produce environmental filtering, or a trait-based spatial segregation of species. It is critical to quantify the links between species' functional traits and their environment in order to reveal the relative importance of this process to community assembly and promote understanding of the impacts of ongoing environmental changes. We investigated this relationship using epigaeic ants in an environmentally heterogeneous region of Florida. We found evidence for environmental filtering as environmental conditions such as groundcover, surface temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and plant diversity were strongly correlated with assemblage composition. Certain species traits appeared particularly important to persistence: (1) ants in environments with less groundcover have relatively longer legs but do not differ in size, (2) ants in hotter environments exhibit greater thermal tolerances, and (3) ants in hotter and drier environments do not exhibit greater desiccation resistance. These findings show surface complexity and temperature may interact with morphology and physiology to impact the spatial distribution of ants and underscore the importance of climate change. Climate warming is predicted to alter assemblage composition, competitive dynamics, and consequently impact ecosystem processes. We suggest environmental filters acting at regional scales, as shown here, act in tandem with more frequently studied local-scale competitive interactions to delimit ant community assemblages.

AB Plantation forestry contributes to the economic growth of many regions, but may also produce ecological impacts (e.g. on biodiversity) that can be reduced with proper management. We assessed the value of eucalypt plantations to favor habitat connectivity at the landscape scale by determining their ability to provide habitat for species associated with the natural vegetation. For this purpose, we compared diversity and composition of understory vegetation in low-management eucalypt plantations in young, intermediate (ready for harvest) and mature stages with pine plantations, native forests and shrublands. We estimated the true species richness with Chao2 estimators and compared among habitats the average species richness (at two different local scales: per plot and per site), Shannon indices and biovolume of herbs, shrubs and trees in the understory using ANOVAs or GLZs, depending on data distributions. Differences among habitats in understory species composition and functional types were compared with PERMANOVA, and were graphically represented using NMDS ordinations. At local scales, diversity tended to be higher in native communities (native forests and shrublands) and lower in plantations (lowest in intermediate eucalypt plantations). Diversity across all study sites was again lowest in eucalypt plantations in intermediate age, but was relatively high in other plantations, due to a high species turnover in young and mature eucalypt plantations. Eucalypt plantations were similar to shrublands in understory species composition and functional types when young, becoming more distant to them when older, and more similar to pine plantations and native forests. Native forests were the most distinctive community, with pine plantations being the most similar to them. Native forests harbored the rarest species and were also associated with seed dispersal by vertebrates (internally). Ant- and wind dispersal were the most common in shrublands and eucalypt plantations. Given the prevalence of eucalypt plantations in some regions, determining (and improving, if feasible) their ability to harbor biodiversity of native communities becomes a crucial goal, in order to increase landscape connectivity and favor species persistence at regional scales. In the study region, eucalypt plantations provide habitat for species typical of shrublands when young but do not contribute significantly to the maintenance of the understory biodiversity associated with native forests. Considering the distinctiveness of native forests, we favor protection and, where feasible, restoration of native forests over managing eucalypt plantations for biodiversity to best improve conservation outcomes.

AB Coupled biological and physical oceanographic models are powerful tools for studying connectivity among marine populations because they simulate the movement of larvae based on ocean currents and larval characteristics. However, while the models themselves have been parameterized and verified with physical empirical data, the simulated patterns of connectivity have rarely been compared to field observations. We demonstrate a framework for testing biological-physical oceanographic models by using them to generate simulated spatial genetic patterns through a simple population genetic model, and then testing these predictions with empirical genetic data. Both agreement and mismatches between predicted and observed genetic patterns can provide insights into mechanisms influencing larval connectivity in the coastal ocean. We use a high-resolution ROMS-CoSINE biological-physical model for Monterey Bay, California specifically modified to simulate dispersal of the acorn barnacle, Balanus glandula. Predicted spatial genetic patterns generated from both seasonal and annual connectivity matrices did not match an observed genetic cline in this species at either a mitochondrial or nuclear gene. However, information from this mismatch generated hypotheses testable with our modelling framework that including natural selection, larval input from a southern direction and/or increased nearshore larval retention might provide a better fit between predicted and observed patterns. Indeed, moderate selection and a range of combined larval retention and southern input values dramatically improve the fit between simulated and observed spatial genetic patterns. Our results suggest that integrating population genetic models with coupled biological-physical oceanographic models can provide new insights and a new means of verifying model predictions.

AB Resource selection plasticity and behavioral dominance may in. fluence the ability of a species to respond to changes in resource availability, particularly if dominant species have highly specialized resource requirements. We examined the response of several dominant and subordinate cavity-nesting species to a reduction in the availability of an essential resource (nesting cavities) using the novel experimental approach of blocking the entrances to high-quality cavities. We monitored nest abundance on seven treatment and 13 control sites (aspen groves in a grassland matrix) in British Columbia, Canada, for two years pretreatment (2000-2001), two years during treatment (2002-2003), and two years posttreatment (cavities reopened; 2004-2005). At the community level, nest abundance declined by 50% on treatment sites following cavity blocking and returned to pretreatment levels following cavity reopening. Nest abundance of European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a dominant secondary cavity-nester (SCN), declined by 89% and failed to recover posttreatment. Conversely, nest abundance of Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides; a subordinate SCN) increased following cavity blocking and remained high following reopening. Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) were unaffected by cavity blocking. We suggest that starlings, while being the dominant SCN, may be limited by availability of suitable nest sites, whereas bluebirds may be limited by starling abundance. We propose that plasticity in nest site preferences of subordinate cavity-nesters may enable them to contend with natural variation in availability of critical resources, such as nest cavities and food, in addition to coping with interspecific competition. This is the. first community-level, multiyear study involving manipulation of nest site availability via experimental cavity blocking.

AB The decline of flower-visiting insects is a threat to ecological processes and to the services these insects provide. Roadside verges in the Netherlands span approximately 80,000 km and are often covered with semi-natural grasslands. As such, they also provide a suitable habitat for many insects, but this has received little attention so far. We investigated the effects of different management treatments on flower-visiting insects. We studied flower visitation in a 3 years old experimental set-up with five mowing treatments each replicated five times. Management types were: no management and mowing once or twice per year with and without the removal of hay, representing common forms of management and neglect. During an entire growing season, both flowers (number of species and inflorescences) as well as insects (total abundance and actual flower visits) were investigated. Mowing twice per year with removal of hay showed highest values for all measured variables and this effect persisted throughout the growing season. The early summer cut proved to be very important for insect feeding opportunities, due to the re-flowering of plants later in the growing season. Flower abundance showed high correlations with both plant species richness and the number of insect visits. Although overall, mowing twice a year with hay removal was the most beneficial treatment for flower-visiting insects, these plots were entirely devoid of flowers for some period right after mowing, indicating that a rotational scheme might further promote insect diversity and abundance.

AB Nutrient-poor soils often support low-stature grasslands, savannas and shrublands where the climate is warm enough and wet enough for closed forests. Though this pattern has long been recognised, the causes are debated and poorly explored. I tested the hypothesis that forest fails to develop where the total nutrient pool is too small to construct both the foliage and the wood. I estimated potential woody biomass from the difference between soil nutrient stocks and forest foliage stocks. Nutrient stocks required for foliage were estimated from leaf tissue concentrations and foliage biomass typical of Amazon forests. Potential wood biomass was estimated from wood nutrient concentrations typical of Amazon forests. Data on soil nutrient stocks were assembled from studies from South American and African forests and savannas and from south-western Australian and south-west African heathlands. According to these calculations, estimated nutrient stocks (kg ha(-1)) to build a forest would need to be > = P: 20-30, K 200-350, Ca 300-600 and Mg 55-65. Many surface soil horizons from both savanna and heathland sites were below these thresholds. However when deeper soil layers were included, most soils had adequate nutrient stocks. The nutrients in shortest supply were Ca and K and not P. This study suggests that nutrient stocks are usually adequate for constructing the wood needed to build a forest, except where soils are highly leached and very shallow. The implication is that, at steady state, low nutrient stocks seldom constrain forest development. The apparent failure of low nutrient stocks to explain the missing forests on nutrient-poor soils emphasises the need for new ideas on how nutrients, alone or in combination with other factors such as fire, influence vegetation structure.

AB Glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum) is a tree native to China that successfully invades forests of central Argentina. To fully understand glossy privet's ecological effects on native forest, it is necessary to accurately map the distribution of glossy privet stands and the changes in biodiversity and forest structure of the invaded areas. The objectives of this paper were (1) to map the distribution of glossy privet stands in an area representative of the Sierras Chicas (Crdoba, Argentina) and (2) compare composition, structure and regeneration between glossy privet invaded stands and native forest stands. Using four Landsat TM images (October 2005, March, May and July 2006) we mapped the distribution of a glossy privet-dominated stand using a support vector machine, a non-parametric classifier. We recorded forest structure variables and tree diversity on 105 field plots. Glossy privet-dominated stands occupied 3,407 ha of the total forested land in the study area (27,758 ha), had an average of 33 glossy privet trees (dbh > 2.5 cm) per plot and the cover of their shrub and herb strata was substantially reduced compared with native forest. Forest regeneration was dominated by glossy privet in native forest stands adjacent to glossy privet-dominated stands. We conclude that in the Sierras Chicas glossy privet has become a widespread invader, changing the patterns of vertical structure, diversity, and regeneration in native forests.

AB The study of interactions between small invertebrates and their larger plant and animal hosts has a long tradition. One persistent theme within this literature is that spatially-segregated populations of terrestrial and freshwater invertebrates commonly adapt to local hosts across their geographic ranges. Marine examples are rare, which leaves the impression that marine populations are less likely to adapt to locally abundant hosts and more likely to evolve generalized or phenotypically-plastic strategies. Here, I review a short but growing list of marine invertebrates that appear to display local adaptation in host use. As expected, most of the marine examples are brooded animals with weak dispersal potential. However, some species with pelagically dispersed larvae have apparently adapted to local hosts. This surprising result is consistent with recent evidence that pelagically-dispersed larvae are not always broadly dispersed, that strong selective pressures maintain local differences in host use, or both. The presence of host-mediated adaptation in the sea alters predictions on how marine communities respond to disturbance, supports the notion that marine consumer-prey interactions can coevolve, and indicates that hosts play fundamental roles in the differentiation and perhaps speciation of small marine invertebrates.

AB While deforestation in the tropics is a major source of atmospheric CO2 so the regeneration of these forests is a major sink of CO2. To determine the magnitude of this sink and assess the carbon balance of tropical forests at regional to global scales an accounting model is required that multiplies carbon flux by the area of each forest regeneration stage. The only feasible tool with which to estimate the area of forest regenerative stages at regional to global scales is remote sensing from spaceborne sensors. The role of remote sensing in studies of tropical deforestation and forest regeneration is reviewed and results from a study focused on tropical forests in Ghana, West Africa, are presented. Emphasis is placed on tropical forest regeneration, which may be characterized typically by increases in leaf biomass, wood biomass and canopy roughness. Remotely sensed red and near infrared radiation can be used to estimate leaf biomass; microwave backscatter can be used to estimate leaf biomass, wood biomass and canopy roughness and multi-angle measurements of radiation can be used to estimate canopy roughness. This paper focused attention on three limitations with the most widely used of these approaches, the use of reflected red and near infrared radiation: (i) the availability of satellite sensor data for tropical forests; (ii) the relationships between remotely sensed data in red and near infrared wavelengths and forest measures that relate to leaf biomass; and (iii) the feasibility of estimating the coverage of forest within a pixel for accurate estimation of forest area.
   It was found that the probability of obtaining a cloud-free image of Ghana was small, particularly in the wetter months. From the available data, however, some significant relationships between remotely sensed radiance and tree density, a measure related to leaf biomass, were observed. The correlation observed between AVHRR NDVI and tree density suggests that potentially these data could be used to estimate three broad classes of tree density at the regional scale. It was also found that the accuracy of areal estimates of forest coverage could be increased through the use of a spectral mixture model.

AB 1.  Suspended sediments often reduce cladoceran abundance in the field, and reduce the algal feeding rates of cladocerans in the laboratory.  This paper explores the behavioural mechanisms by which suspended clay reduces Daphnia feeding rates.  Feeding experiments using radiolabelled Cryptomonas cells showed that 50-200 mg 1(-1) coarse suspended clay (particle size < 2-mu-m) reduced the algal ingestion rate of Daphnia ambigua by 29-87%, but fine suspended clay (< 1-mu-m) had no effect.  Suspended clay decreased feeding rate by 60-70% at low algal concentrations (less-than-or-equal-to 5 x 10(3) cells ml-1), but by only 27% at high algal concentrations (20 x 10(3) cells ml-1).  Thus, the inhibitory effects of suspended clay are greater at low algal concentrations.  The sudden addition (or removal) of suspended clay caused immediate reductions (or increases) in algal ingestion rate.
   2.  Observations of the feeding behaviour of tethered D. pulex showed that the frequency of postabdominal rejections increased greatly in the presence of suspended clay.  The rejected boluses contained both algae and clay.  Thoracic feeding appendage beat frequency decreased in the presence of suspended clay, decreasing the volume of water searched for food particles.
   3.  These behavioural responses indicate that clay reduces cladoceran feeding rate by mechanically interfering with both the collection and ingestion of algal cells.  Both inhibitory effects are caused because cladocerans collect and ingest suspended clay particles.  The behavioural mechanisms by which cladocerans regulate their feeding rate in very high concentrations of algal cells (rejection of excess food and reduction in thoracic limb pumping movements) are the same mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of algal ingestion rate in the presence of high concentrations of suspended clay particles.

AB Whereas global patterns and predictors of species diversity are well known for numerous terrestrial taxa, our understanding of freshwater diversity patterns and their predictors is much more limited. Here, we examine spatial concordance in global diversity patterns for five freshwater taxa (i.e. aquatic mammals, aquatic birds, fishes, crayfish and aquatic amphibians) and investigate the environmental factors driving these patterns at the river drainage basin grain. We find that species richness and endemism patterns are significantly correlated among taxa. We also show that cross-taxon congruence patterns are often induced by common responses of taxa to their contemporary and historical environments (i.e. convergent patterns). Apart from some taxa distinctiveness (i.e. fishes), the climate/productivity' hypothesis is found to explain the greatest variance in species richness and endemism patterns, followed by factors related to the history/dispersion' and area/environmental heterogeneity' hypotheses. As aquatic amphibians display the highest levels of congruency with other taxa, this taxon appears to be a good surrogate' candidate for developing global freshwater conservation planning at the river drainage basin grain.

AB In central Argentina, the Chinese tree glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum) is an aggressive invasive species replacing native forests, forming dense stands, and is thus a major conservation concern. Mapping the spread of biological invasions is a necessary first step toward understanding the factors determining invasion patterns. Urban areas may function as propagule sources for glossy privet because it has been used as a landscaping tree for over a century. The objectives of this paper were to 1) map the patterns of glossy privet expansion from 1983 to 2006 using a time series of Landsat TM/ETM + images, and 2) analyze the spatial pattern of glossy privet stands with regard to urban extent. Using six summer Landsat TM images (1983, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2001, and 2006) the expansion of glossy privet was analyzed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a non-parametric classifier which we applied to a stack of all images simultaneously, a novel approach in its application to monitor non-native tree invasions. We then measured the area of glossy privet in a series of 200-m buffers at increasing distances around urban areas in 1983 and 2006, and compared it with the amount of privet expected in proportion to buffer area Glossy privet in the study area has spread very rapidly during the 23 years that we studied and the SVM resulted in highly accurate classifications (Kappa Index 0.88, commission error 0.07, omission error 0.16). Between 1983 and 2006 glossy privet area increased 50 times (from 50 to 2500 ha), and 20% of all forest in the study area is now dominated by glossy privet Most of the glossy privet dominated stands were located within 600 m of urban areas. However, the rate of glossy privet expansion accelerated substantially after 1992 and new glossy privet dominated stands tend to be located away from urban areas. This suggests that glossy privet is now self-sustaining, but expected urban growth in the area could further foster glossy privet invasion. Management and development plans should include mitigation efforts to contain this species and prevent invasion into native forests, and citizens should be informed about the risk of invasion associated with the use of glossy privet for landscaping.

AB We evaluated the impact of marine materials on the diet and abundance of arthropodivorous lizards inhabiting islands and the coast of the Gulf of California. Here, marine materials are brought onto land by seabirds and by tidal action, and both subsidy pathways cause arthropod abundance to increase. We evaluated Uta stansburiana (side-blotched lizard) diets in three habitats defined by having: (1) no marine subsidies available, (2) only seabird-derived subsidies, and (3) only tidal-derived subsidies. Stable isotope data indicated that lizard diets are subsidized indirectly by seabird and tidal activity. For example, in coastal areas we determined that 40% of a lizard's diet contains arthropods that have consumed algae. Such subsidies may explain why we found that lizards in coastal areas occupy a significantly higher trophic position than lizards in unsubsidized areas. We analyzed eight years of survey data on all arthropodivorous lizards to determine if diet subsidies result in increased lizard abundance. We found that lizards were more abundant in coastal areas than they were in inland habitats, and that they were more abundant on islands with seabirds than on islands without seabird populations. This study provides insight into the importance and effect of marine-derived nutrients from multiple sources on vertebrate consumers inhabiting islands and coastal areas.

AB Crude enzyme extracts were obtained from the digestive glands of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone), reared in oligotrophic well water and eutrophic shrimp pond water to compare digestive enzyme activity between the two groups. Specific activities of serine protease, collagenase, amylase, cellulase, lipase and acid phosphatase were significantly higher (P < 0.01) in pond water-reared shrimp (PW shrimp) than in well water reared-shrimp (WW shrimp). For most enzymes assayed, specific activity was more than two times higher in PW shrimp, and cellulase activity was over six times higher. In contrast, chitinase activity was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in WW shrimp. Higher specific activity of most digestive enzymes in PW shrimp was probably due to natural productivity in the pond water that served as a source of organic substrates, and this increased activity may contribute to the growth-enhancing effect of shrimp pond water.

AB Spatial dominance is maintained by the balance of three processes: mortality, recruitment, and growth. Patches of mussels facing high rates of mortality may show no change in percent cover (i.e., dominance) as long as growth by the remaining survivors can fill in the vacant space. A graphical model is developed to examine the possibility that growth may ameliorate the effects of predation and physical disturbance on spatial dominance. In the model, growth, mortality, and recruitment are depicted as Vectors on a set of isoclines for log percent cover. The 100% isocline is analogous to the self-thinning line. Self-thinning data for the mussel Mytilus edulis are used to establish the log-percent isoclines. A review of published growth and mortality data suggests mussels can use growth to offset the effects of mortality. Small mussels can easily double in length in 1 yr, and this is sufficient to withstand 60% mortality per year without a loss in percent cover. Since both growth and mortality tend to be size specific, the point at which growth can no longer offset mortality depends on the environmental conditions that affect rates of growth and mortality. The model and analysis can be easily extended to other species and suggest that species with rapid growth and large variation in body size need not rely on recruitment to maintain spatial dominance, even when faced with high rates of predation.

AB 1 The timing of appearance and the seasonal abundance of flower buds and flowers, and of green and ripe fruit of 61 species of native woody plants in the temperate rain forest of Chiloe Island (42 degrees 24 ' S), Chile, were recorded over the course of 2 years.
   2 We evaluated the effectiveness of climatic and ecological variables to predict phenological trends in this forest.
   3 Unimodal yearly patterns were found both for flowering and fruiting events in the community. In some species bimodal tendencies were detected at the population and/or individual level.
   4 Some species produced flowers and/or fruits all year long, but flowering was concentrated in spring and summer. Fruiting was less seasonal and more variable in the 2 years than flowering.
   5 Length of flowering and fruiting, and the peak of flowering were best correlated with ecological variables such as pollination and dispersal modes, and with family membership. Phenological differences between life forms were due to associated differences in family membership and pollination and dispersal modes. No effects could be ascribed to successional status or habitat preference of species.
   6 Mean monthly temperatures were strongly and positively correlated with the number of species in flower or in fruit, and flowering was negatively correlated with average air humidity and total monthly precipitation.
   7 The length of the fruit ripening period showed no correlation with mean fruit size.
   8 Reproductive phenology in Chiloe was largely constrained by seasonal climatic variables, but ecological variables also need to be considered to account for the observed patterns of flowering and fruiting in this temperate forest.

AB Aim: Woodlands make up a third of European territory and carry out important ecosystem functions, yet a comprehensive overview of their invasion by alien plants has never been undertaken across this continent. Location: Europe.
   Methods: We extracted data from 251,740 vegetation plots stored in the recently compiled European Vegetation Archive. After filtering (resulting in 83,396 plots; 39 regions; 1970-2015 time period), we analysed the species pool and frequency of alien vascular plants with respect to geographic origin and life-forms, and the levels of invasion across the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) woodland habitats.
   Results: We found a total of 386 alien plant species (comprising 7% of all recorded vascular plants). Aliens originating from outside of and from within Europe were almost equally represented in the species pool (192 vs. 181 species) but relative frequency was skewed towards the former group (77% vs. 22%) due, to some extent, to the frequent occurrence of Impatiens parviflora (21% frequency among alien plants). Phanerophytes were the most species-rich life-form (148 species) and had the highest representation in terms of relative frequency (39%) among aliens in the dataset. Apart from Europe (181 species), North America was the most important source of alien plants (109 species). At the local scale, temperate and boreal softwood riparian woodland (5%) and mire and mountain coniferous woodland (<1%) had the highest and lowest mean relative alien species richness (percentage of alien species per plot), respectively.
   Main conclusions: Our results indicate that European woodlands are prone to alien plant invasions especially when exposed to disturbance, fragmentation, alien propagule pressure and high soil nutrient levels. Given the persistence of these factors in the landscape, competitive alien plant species with a broad niche, including alien trees and shrubs, are likely to persist and spread further into European woodlands.

AB A general understanding of grazing effects on plant diversity in drylands is still missing, despite an extensive theoretical background. Cross-biome syntheses are hindered by the fact that the outcomes of disturbance studies are strongly affected by the choice of diversity measures, and the spatial and temporal scales of measurements. The aim of this study is to overcome these weaknesses by applying a wide range of diversity measures to a data set derived from identical sampling in three distinct ecosystems. We analyzed three fence-line contrasts (heavier vs. lighter grazing intensity), representing different degrees of aridity (from arid to semiarid) and precipitation regimes (summer rain vs. winter rain) in southern Africa. We tested the impact of grazing intensity on multiple aspects of plant diversity (species and functional group level, richness and evenness components, alpha and beta diversity, and composition) at two spatial scales, and for both 5-yr means and interannual variability. Heavier grazing reduced total plant cover and substantially altered the species and functional composition at all sites. However, a significant decrease in species alpha diversity was detected at only one of the three sites. By contrast, alpha diversity of plant functional groups responded consistently across ecosystems and scales, with a significant decrease at heavier grazing intensity. The cover-based measures of functional group diversity responded more sensitively and more consistently than functional group richness. Beta diversity of species and functional types increased under heavier grazing, showing that at larger scales, the heterogeneity of the community composition and the functional structure were increased. Heavier grazing mostly increased interannual variability of alpha diversity, while effects on beta diversity and cover were inconsistent. Our results suggest that species diversity alone may not adequately reflect the shifts in vegetation structure that occur in response to increased grazing intensity in the dryland biomes of southern Africa. Compositional and structural changes of the vegetation are better reflected by trait-based diversity measures. In particular, measures of plant functional diversity that include evenness represent a promising tool to detect and quantify disturbance effects on ecosystems.

AB In light of the global extent and cascading effect of our impact on the environment, we design and manage reserves to restore biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. Mobile organisms link important processes across ecosystems, however, their roles in providing these services are often overlooked and we need to know how they influence ecosystem functions in reserves. Herbivorous fish play a key role in coral reef seascapes. By removing algae, they promote coral growth and recruitment, and help to increase resilience. We examined how connectivity with mangroves affected herbivore populations and benthic succession on reefs in eastern Australia. We surveyed fish assemblages, examined reef composition and characterised benthic recruitment on reefs at multiple levels of connectivity with mangroves, in a no-take reserve and areas open to fishing. Our results show that connectivity enhanced herbivore biomass and richness in reserves, and that these connectivity and reserve effects interacted to promote herbivory on protected reefs near mangroves. Connectivity and reserve protection combined to double the biomass of roving herbivorous fish on protected reefs near mangroves. The increase in grazing intensity drove a trophic cascade that reduced algal cover and enhanced coral recruitment and reef resilience. Synthesis and applications. Our findings demonstrate that ecosystem resilience can be improved by managing both reefs and adjacent habitats together as functional seascape units. By understanding how landscapes influence resilience, and explicitly incorporating these effects into conservation decision-making, we may have greater success with environmental restoration and preservation actions.

AB The potentially important roles of intestinal bacteria on immune response, disease resistance, and nutrition for the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon have been increasingly investigated. However, so far, little is known about the intestinal bacterial community of the shrimp in the commercial aquaculture settings. In this study, the intestinal bacterial communities of juvenile P. monodon (70 individuals) from eight commercial farms in Thailand were examined using 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE, and seven 16S rDNA clone libraries from representative DGGE profiles were constructed. Bacteria in the gamma-Proteobacteria class were the only common bacteria group found in the intestinal tracts of shrimp from all farms. The dominant bacterial genera in the intestinal population of each shrimp varied among different farms, and these genera were Vibrio, Photobacterium, Aeromonas, or Propionigenium (phylum Fusobacteria). Other commonly found genera included Actinomyces, Anaerobaculum, Halospirulina, Pseudomonas, Mycoplasma, and Shewanella. Twelve phyla of bacteria including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Tenericutes, Deinococcus-Thermus, Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, Synergistetes, Thermotogae, and Verrucomicrobia were represented in the sequences. Additionally, strictly anaerobic bacteria such as Propionigenium and Fusibacter were found. These intestinal bacterial communities varied significantly among different commercial farms and were distinct from their rearing water. The results provide descriptive structures of the intestinal bacterial communities of P. monodon in commercial farms, which can further be applied to areas of research on the immunity, disease resistance, and nutrition of shrimp to improve aquaculture of the black tiger shrimp.

AB This study was undertaken to determine if use of stratified organic layers of intact litter, fragmented litter, and humus on the forest floor (LFH) improves establishment of upland native boreal plant species during oil sands reclamation in Alberta, Canada. The abundance and composition of vascular plant species in the soil propagule bank were determined for LFH and peat materials before salvage from donor sites and 18 months after application on the receiver site. Applications of 10 and 20 cm were evaluated. Various soil properties were assessed to determine impacts of donor materials. In the growth chamber, LFH donor material had significantly more plant species emerge (37) from the propagule bank than did peat donor material (19). In the field, LFH treatments had significantly higher species richness (49, 47, 24, and 25 species for LFH 10 cm, LFH 20 cm, peat 10 cm, and peat 20 cm treatments, respectively), plant abundance, and soil nutrients than peat treatments. Application thickness of peat had little effect, but 20 cm of LFH was more beneficial for plant community establishment than 10 cm. LFH treatments had narrower C:N ratios and higher soluble potassium and available phosphorus than peat. Applying 10 versus 20 cm of donor material increased admixing of fine-textured subsoil, reducing organic carbon, nitrogen, and potassium; these effects were greater for LFH than peat treatments. Thus, addition of LFH aids in creating diverse ecosystems on reclaimed upland landscapes by providing a source of propagules for revegetating upland boreal forest communities and improving nutrient availability for plants.

AB Objective: To present a non-classificatory technique of map representation of compositional patterns of vegetation as no two plant species assemblages are completely alike and gradations often occur. Variation is depicted as continuous fields instead of classes.
   Location: Murnauer Moos, Bavaria.
   Methods: The study combined vegetation ecology and remote sensing methods. The gradual representation of compositional patterns was based on techniques of ordination and regression, instead of mapping class fractions. The floristic field data were collected in releves and subjected to three-dimensional non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS). The reflectance information corresponding to plots was gathered from remotely sensed imagery with a high spectral resolution. Reflectance values in numerous wavelengths were related to NMS axes scores by partial least squares regression analysis. The regression equations were applied to the imagery and yielded three grey-scale images, one for each ordination axis. These three images were transformed into a red, green, and blue colour map with a specific colour for each position in the ordination space. Similar colours corresponded to similar species compositions.
   Results: Compositional variation was mapped accurately (R-2 = 0.79), using continuous fields. The results took account of various types of stand transitions and of heterogeneities within stands. The map representation featured relatively homogeneous stands and abrupt transitions between stands as well as within-stand heterogeneity and gradual transitions.
   Conclusions: The use of NMS in combination with imaging spectroscopy proved to be an expedient approach for non-classificatory map representations of compositional patterns. Ordination is efficiently extended into the geographic domain. The approach in abandoning pre-defined plant communities is able to reconcile mapping practice and complex reality.

AB We examined the effect of range size in commonly applied macroecological analyses using continental distribution data for all 550 Neotropical palm species (Arecaceae) at varying grain sizes from 0.5 degrees to 5 degrees. First, we evaluated the relative contribution of range-restricted and widespread species on the patterns of species richness and endemism. Second, we analysed the impact of range size on the predictive value of commonly used predictor variables. Species sequences were produced arranging species according to their range size in ascending, descending, and random order. Correlations between the cumulative species richness patterns of these sequences and environmental predictors were performed in order to analyse the effect of range size. Despite the high proportion of rare species, patterns of species richness were found to be dominated by a minority of widespread species (similar to 20%) which contained 80% of the spatial information. Climatic factors related to energy and water availability and productivity accounted for much of the spatial variation of species richness of widespread species. In contrast, species richness of range-restricted species was to a larger extent determined by topographical complexity. However, this effect was much more difficult to detect due to a dominant influence of widespread species. Although the strength of different environmental predictors changed with spatial scale, the general patterns and trends proved to be relatively stabile at the examined grain sizes. Our results highlight the difficulties to approximate causal explanations for the occurrence of a majority of species and to distinguish between contemporary climatic factors and history.

AB Most phenological Studies to dare have taken place ill Upland forest above the maximum food level of nearby streams and rivers. In this paper, we examine the phenological patterns of tree assemblages in a large Amazonian forest landscape, including both upland (terra firme) and seasonally flooded (varzea and igapo) forest. The abundance of vegetative and reproductive phenophases was very seasonal in all Forests types. Both types of flooded forest were more deciduous than terra firme, shedding most of their leaves during the inundation period. pulses of new leaves occurred mainly during the dry season in terra firme, whereas those in the two floodplain forests were largely restricted to the end of the inundation period. Flowering was concentrated in the dry season in ail forest types and was strongly correlated with the decrease in rainfall. The two floodplain forests concentrated their fruiting peaks during the inundation period, whereas trees in terra firme tended to bear fruits at the onset of the wet season. The results suggest that the phenological patterns of all forest types are largely predictable and that the regular and prolonged seasonal flood pulse is a major determinant of phenological patterns in varzea and igapo, whereas rainfall and solar irradiance appear to be important in terra firme. The three forest types provide a mosaic of food resources that has important implications for the conservation and maintenance of wide-ranging frugivore Populations in Amazonian forests.

AB Interaction potentials between soil microarthropods and microorganisms were investigated with Folsomia candida (Insecta, Collembola) in microcosm laboratory experiments. Microscopic analysis revealed that the volumes of the simple, rod-shaped guts of adult specimens varied with their feeding activity, from 0.7 to 11.2 nl, A dense layer of bacterial cells, associated with the peritrophic membrane, was detected in the midgut by scanning electron microscopy. Depending on the molting stage, which occurred at intervals of approximately 4 days, numbers of heterotrophic, aerobic gut bacteria changed from 4.9 x 10(2) to 2.3 x 10(6) CFU per specimen. A total of 11 different taxonomic bacterial groups and the filamentous fungus Acremonium charticola were isolated from the guts of five F. candida specimens. The most abundant isolate was related to Erwinia amylovora (96.2% DNA sequence similarity to its 16S rRNA gene). F, candida preferred to feed on Pseudomonas putida and three indigenous gut isolates rather than eight different type culture strains. When luciferase reporter gene-tagged bacterial strains were pulse fed to F. candida, gut isolates were continuously shed for 8 days to several weeks but Escherichia coli HB101 was shed for only 1 day. Ratios of ingested to released bacterial cells demonstrated that populations of nonindigenous gut bacteria like Sinorhizobium meliloti L33 and E. coli HB101 were reduced by more than 4 orders of magnitude but that the population of gut isolate Alcaligenes faecalis HR4 was reduced only 500-fold. This work demonstrates that F, candida represents a frequently changeable but selective habitat for bacteria in terrestrial environments and that microarthropods have to be considered factors that modify soil microbial communities.

   INFORMATION
AB With rapid increases in the global shrimp aquaculture sector, a focus on animal health during production becomes ever more important. Animal productivity is intimately linked to health, and the gut microbiome is becoming increasingly recognised as an important driver of cultivation success. The microbes that colonise the gut, commonly referred to as the gut microbiota or the gut microbiome, interact with their host and contribute to a number of key host processes, including digestion and immunity. Gut microbiome manipulation therefore represents an attractive proposition for aquaculture and has been suggested as a possible alternative to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in the management of disease, which is a major limitation of growth in this sector. Microbiota supplementation has also demonstrated positive effects on growth and survival of several different commercial species, including shrimp. Development of appropriate gut supplements, however, requires prior knowledge of the host microbiome. Little is known about the gut microbiota of the aquatic invertebrates, but penaeid shrimp are perhaps more studied than most. Here, we review current knowledge of information reported on the shrimp gut microbiota, highlighting the most frequently observed taxa and emphasizing the dominance of Proteobacteria within this community. We discuss involvement of the microbiome in the regulation of shrimp health and disease and describe how the gut microbiota changes with the introduction of several economically important shrimp pathogens. Finally, we explore evidence of microbiome supplementation and consider its role in the future of penaeid shrimp production.

TI Gaps in Border Controls Are Related to Quarantine Alien Insect Invasions
   in Europe

AB Alien insects are increasingly being dispersed around the world through international trade, causing a multitude of negative environmental impacts and billions of dollars in economic losses annually. Border controls form the last line of defense against invasions, whereby inspectors aim to intercept and stop consignments that are contaminated with harmful alien insects. In Europe, member states depend on one another to prevent insect introductions by operating a first point of entry rule - controlling goods only when they initially enter the continent. However, ensuring consistency between border control points is difficult because there exists no optimal inspection strategy. For the first time, we developed a method to quantify the volume of agricultural trade that should be inspected for quarantine insects at border control points in Europe, based on global agricultural trade of over 100 million distinct origin-commodity-species-destination pathways. This metric was then used to evaluate the performance of existing border controls, as measured by border interception results in Europe between 2003 and 2007. Alarmingly, we found significant gaps between the trade pathways that should be inspected and actual number of interceptions. Moreover, many of the most likely introduction pathways yielded none or very few insect interceptions, because regular interceptions are only made on only a narrow range of pathways. European countries with gaps in border controls have been invaded by higher numbers of quarantine alien insect species, indicating the importance of proper inspections to prevent insect invasions. Equipped with an optimal inspection strategy based on the underlying risks of trade, authorities globally will be able to implement more effective and consistent border controls.

AB Small filter-feeding zooplankton organisms like the cladoceran Daphnia spp. are key members of freshwater food webs. Although several interactions between Daphnia and bacteria have been investigated, the importance of the microbial communities inside Daphnia guts has been studied only poorly so far. In the present study, we characterised the bacterial community composition inside the digestive tract of a laboratory-reared clonal culture of Daphnia magna using 16S rRNA gene libraries and terminal-restriction length polymorphism fingerprint analyses. In addition, the diversity and stability of the intestinal microbial community were investigated over time, with different food sources as well as under starvation stress and death, and were compared to the community in the cultivation water. The diversity of the Daphnia gut microbiota was low. The bacterial community consisted mainly of Betaproteobacteria (e.g. Limnohabitans sp.), few Gammaproteobacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas sp.) and Bacteroidetes that were related to facultatively anaerobic bacteria, but did not contain typical fermentative or obligately anaerobic gut bacteria. Rather, the microbiota was constantly dominated by Limnohabitans sp. which belongs to the Lhab-A1 tribe (previously called R-BT065 cluster) that is abundant in various freshwaters. Other bacterial groups varied distinctly even under constant cultivation conditions. Overall, the intestinal microbial community did not reflect the community in the surrounding cultivation water and clustered separately when analysed via the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interaction model. In addition, the microbiota proved to be stable also when Daphnia were exposed to bacteria associated with a different food alga. After starvation, the community in the digestive tract was reduced to stable members. After death of the host animals, the community composition in the gut changed distinctly, and formerly undetected bacteria were activated. Our results suggest that the Daphnia microbiota consists mainly of an aerobic resident bacterial community which is indigenous to this habitat.

TI Towards unification of national vegetation classifications: A comparison
   of two methods for analysis of large data sets

DE Calthion; COCKTAIL; Czech Republic; European Vegetation Survey; Germany;
   phytosociological data base; TWINSPAN; wet meadow
AB In European phytosociology. national classifications of corresponding vegetation types show considerable differences even between neighbouring countries. Therefore, the European Vegetation Survey project urgently needs numerical classification methods for large data sets that are able to produce compatible classifications using data sets from different countries. We tested the ability of two methods, TWINSPAN and COCKTAIL, to produce similar classifications of wet meadows (Calthion, incl. Filipendulenion) for Germany (7909 releves) and the Czech Republic(1287 releves) in this respect.
   In TWINSPAN, the indicator ordination option was used for classification of two national data sets, and the extracted assignment criteria (indicator species) were applied crosswise from one to the other national data set. Although the data sets presumably contained similar community types, TWINSPAN revealed almost no correspondence between the groups derived from the proper classification of the national data set and the groups defined by the assignment criteria taken from the other national data set. The reason is probably the difference in structure between the national data sets, which is a typical, but hardly avoidable, feature of any pair of phytosociological data sets. As a result, the first axis of the correspondence analysis, and consequently the first TWINSPAN division, are associated with different environmental gradients; the difference in the first division is transferred and multiplied further down the hierarchy.
   COCKTAIL is a method which produces releve groups on the basis of statistically formed species groups. The user determines the starting points for the formation of species groups, and groups already found in one data set can be tested for existence in the other data set. The correspondence between the national classifications produced by COCKTAIL was fairly good. For some releve groups, the lack of correspondence to groups in the other national data set could be explained by the absence of the corresponding vegetation types in one of the countries, rather than by methodological problems.

   GUILD STRUCTURE; 6 SHRUBS; FIRE; DIVERSITY
AB South African fynbos ecosystems are under threat from alien plant invasions and transformations to alternative land uses. If large-scale habitat loss and species extinction are to be halted, restoration actions are urgently required. We postulate that by adopting an approach in which an understanding of community and ecosystem dynamics is applied to restoration practices, protocols can be developed which will lead to more efficient restoration. This understanding is based on a review of the relevant ecological literature, focusing on recruitment dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem function, which are particularly relevant to restoration. We develop a conceptual framework for restoration and apply our protocols to a case study area on the Cape Peninsula. Before ecological restoration can begin, the cause of transformation must first be removed or ameliorated. The next step is to ensure that the important ecological processes are functioning. We contend that a fully functioning community requires a good balance of the major growth-form, regeneration, and nutrient acquisition guilds. Fire is the natural disturbance event initiating recruitment in fynbos. It is, therefore, essential to either bunt a site or provide fire-related germination cues in order to stimulate recruitment. Where guilds are under-represented, corrective reintroductions will further improve the long-term resilience of the restored community. Many taxa have persistent soil-stored seed banks, so it is important to conserve topsoil and optimize use of this local species pool. Seed dispersal distances are generally very short, and in highly transformed sites it will be necessary to reintroduce seed of the major guilds in order to restore community structure and functioning. Post-fire succession in fynbos begins with the full complement of species; species gradually die out from the vegetation according to their respective life spans. In order to stimulate germination and promote successful establishment, it is important to sow seed after fire or site clearing in late summer or autumn. Introducing seed or plants at a later stage in the succession is very likely to fail. Because of the localized distributions of many taxa, extreme care must be taken when selecting species for reintroduction if local gene pools are to be conserved.

AB The spatial distribution of plants is often thought to be an indicator of underlying biotic and abiotic processes. However, there are relatively feu examples of spatial patterns being analysed to detect an underlying ecological process. Using the spacing of savanna trees in the southern Kalahari as an example. we applied methods of computer simulation modelling and point pattern analysis in an evaluation of their potential for identifying relevant pattern generating processes from snapshot pattern. We compared real tree patterns from the southern Kalahari, derived from aerial photographs, with patterns produced from computer simulation experiments in an investigation of the following questions: does the present pattern of tree distributions allow us to characterize (1) the relative importance of the major driving forces (e.g., competition for moisture, grass fire, herbivory), (2) the spatial dimensions and structures of the underlying processes, and (3) the actual dynamic status of the ecological system (a phase of decline, increase or constancy with respect to tree abundance)?
   The simulation experiments are based on a well established, spatially explicit. grid-based model that simulates the vegetation dynamics of the major life forms under a realistic rainfall scenario of the southern Kalahari and under the impact of grass fires. herbivory and the formation of localized clumps with increased tree seed availability. For a realistic range of parameters the simulation modal produces long-term coexistence of trees and grasses with tree densities that correspond with densities observed in the field. Both real tree distributions derived from aerial photographs and tree pattern produced bq the model are characterized by a tendency towards even spacing at small scales, clumping at intermediate scales and randomness or clumping at large scales. However. increasing the spatio-temporal correlation in the formation of seed patches in the model caused an increase in the tendency towards clumping in the tree distribution whereas an increase in seed patch numbers led to a decrease in clumping. Within single simulation runs the tree pattern could change in response to the variable rainfall sequences and the corresponding differences in grass fire frequency: periods of slightly increasing tree numbers caused bq higher precipitation were characterized by an increase in tree clumping whereas periods of slightly decreasing tree numbers showed a tendency towards random or even tree spacing. Simulating the transition of an open savanna to a savanna woodland show ed that the tree pattern in the transitional phase can be diagnostic of the underlying process: If the transition was caused by improved moisture conditions the transitional phase was characterized bq increased clumping in the tree pattern. In contrast, a transition caused by an increase in the number of localized tree wed patches led to a characteristic even spacing of trees.
   Even though the simulated savanna clearly showed non-equilibrium dynamics, simulation results indicate that the tree population in the stimulated area of the southern Kalahari is in a state of long-term tree-grass coexistence with the persisting structure of an open savanna system.

TI PHENOLOGY OF SEASONALLY DRY TROPICAL FOREST
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
LA English
DT Note
AB There exists considerable diversity in leaf flushing, leaf-fall, flowering, fruiting and fruit-fall among plant species in a seasonally dry tropical forest. Leaf-fall is initiated with the onset of the post-monsoon, low-temperature dry period, and leaf flushing begins with the rise in temperature and peaks in the hottest and driest period (May) of the year renovating the canopy before the onset of the monsoon. Although flowering is staggered, its peak coincides with the peak in leafing. The fruiting phenology follows closely the flowering phenology. Fruit-fall culminates before or just at the beginning of the monsoon season and thus ensures availability of sufficient moisture to seeds for germination and seedling establishment. The phenological clock of the seasonally dry tropical forest appears to be set during the interphase of winter and summer ensuring full advantage of the short rainy season that follows.

AB Invasive plant species can hinder the establishment and growth of native plants and impact several ecosystem properties, such as soil cover, nutrient cycling, fire regimes and hydrology. Controlling invasive plants is then a necessary, yet usually expensive, step towards the restoration of an ecosystem. A synthesis of literature is needed to understand variation in invasive plants' impacts and their practical control in restoration contexts, and to identify associated knowledge gaps. We reviewed 372 articles published from 2000 to 2019 covering the control of undesirable plants (both exotic invasive and overabundant native plant species) in ecological restoration to gather information on the main plants being controlled and methods used, and considering the distribution of studies among biomes and countries grouped according to the Human Development Index (HDI). Grasses and forbs were the most-studied invasive plant species in restoration sites, but invasive trees were well studied in the tropics.PoaceaeandAsteraceaewere the most studied families of invasive plants. Non-chemical interventions (mostly mowing and prescribed fire) were used in more than half of the reviewed studies globally, but chemical methods (mainly glyphosate spraying, used in 40% of projects using herbicides) are also common. The reviewed studies were mostly performed in countries with very high HDI. Countries with low and medium HDI used only non-chemical methods. Synthesis and applications. Decisions about which control method to use depend heavily on the invasive plant species' growth forms, the local economic situation where the restoration sites are located and resources available for control. More developed countries tend to use more chemical control, whereas less developed ones use mainly non-chemical methods. Since most of the reviewed studies were performed in countries with very high HDI, we lack information from developing countries, which concentrates global hotspots for biodiversity conservation and global commitments of forest and landscape restoration.

AB Removal of predators can have strong indirect effects on primary producers through trophic cascades. Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are major primary producers worldwide that may be influenced by predator removal through changes in grazer composition and biomass. CCA have been most widely studied in Caribbean and temperate reefs, where cover increases with increasing grazer biomass due to removal of competitive fleshy algae. However, each of these systems has one dominant grazer type, herbivorous fishes or sea urchins, which may not be functionally equivalent. Where fishes and sea urchins co-occur, fishing can result in a phase shift in the grazing community with subsequent effects on CCA and other substrata. Kenyan reefs have herbivorous fishes and sea urchins, providing an opportunity to determine the relative impacts of each grazer type and evaluate potential human-induced trophic cascades. We hypothesized that fish benefit CCA, abundant sea urchins erode CCA, and that fishing indirectly reduces CCA cover by removing sea urchin predators. We used closures and fished reefs as a large-scale, long-term natural experiment to assess how fishing and resultant changes in communities affect CCA abundance. We used a short-term caging experiment to directly test the effects of grazing on CCA. CCA cover declined with increasing fish and sea urchin abundance, but the negative impact of sea urchin grazing was much stronger than that of fishes. Abundant sea urchins reduced the CCA growth rate to almost zero and prevented CCA accumulation. A warming event (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) occurred during the 18-year study and had a strong but short-term positive effect on CCA cover. However, the effect of the ENSO on CCA was lower in magnitude than the effect of sea urchin grazing. We compare our results with worldwide literature on bioerosion by fishes and sea urchins. Grazer influence depends on whether benefits of fleshy algae removal outweigh costs of grazer-induced bioerosion. However, the cost-benefit ratio for CCA appears to change with grazer type, grazer abundance, and environment. In Kenya, predator removal leads to a trophic cascade that is expected to reduce net calcification of reefs and therefore reduce reef stability, growth, and resilience.

AB Forest fragmentation facilitates the invasion of exotic species. This threat may be especially severe if forest fragments are surrounded by plantations of exotic species like Pinus radiata, an aggressive colonizer and shade-intolerant tree that has invaded successfully several native ecosystems of the southern hemisphere. In this study, we experimentally tested if the conditions of a successful seedling establishment P. radiata are fulfilled at the Coastal Maulino forest, an endemic fragmented forest of central Chile. Results demonstrated that seeds are dispersed into the native forests, however seedling establishment occurs only at the edges. We conclude that this exotic species is not invading native forests up to date. However, we suggest to conduct evaluations of seed rain and seedling establishment in the long term, in order to monitor the fate of this exotic species in fragmented native forest of Central Chile.

AB Territorial aggression is a primary mode of population regulation among ants, and frequently leads to the formation of linear dominance hierarchies. However, few experimental studies have investigated the proximate mechanisms that underlie these hierarchies. In this study I examine the mechanisms underlying dominance relationships in interference competition for nest sites in a guild of acacia ants residing on Acacia drepanolobium. I show that (1) interspecific conflicts are fought as simple wars of attrition, with mortality ratios among combatant species approximating 1:1, (2) interspecific competitive outcomes, both within and between habitats, closely parallel differences in estimated average colony size among the four acacia ant species, and (3) experimental manipulation of colony size effectively reverses the dominance hierarchy. This is the first study to demonstrate experimentally that size asymmetries underlie dominance relationships in an entire guild of competitors. These results also highlight the contingent nature of ecological dominance in this community. Because dominance is dictated by characteristics of a trait shared by all ant species (colony size), interspecific competitive outcomes may vary if species differ in growth and/or mortality responses to factors such as disturbance or environmental conditions. Contingencies in competitive outcomes among these acacia ants may play an important role in promoting coexistence in this intensely nest-site-limited community.

ID SEMI-DECIDUOUS FOREST; COSTA-RICA; TREES; LOWLANDS
AB To examine the potential contribution of herbarium material to the description and analysis of tropical tree phenology, flowering times and geographical distribution were graphed for 1673 flowering collections from 18 species native to Neotropical dry forests and phenological differences between species were analysed. These include the timing and duration of flowering as well as morphological differences such as flowering on leafless twigs vs flowering on shoots bearing old or new foliage. Species-specific flowering periods of herbarium collections are similar to those observed in phenological field studies, but are often longer because of the larger geographical and temporal sampling range. Conspecific collections of different geographical origin show distinct differences in flowering periodicity, which are correlated with differences in the timing and intensity of the dry season. Interspecific differences in the timing of phenology relative to the dry season indicate differences in the control of phenology by seasonal drought. Herbaria thus represent a large potential source of phenological information which can either supplement and extend phenological field studies or provide phenological information for dry forest species not studied in the field but well represented in herbarium collections.

AB The feeding niche of Colostethus stepheni changes during ontogeny. Small individuals eat small arthropods, principally mites and collembolans, and larger frogs eat bigger prey of other types. The shift in prey types is not a passive effect of selection for bigger prey. There is a strong relationship between electivity for prey types and frog size, independent of electivity for prey size. Four indices of general activity during foraging (number of movements, velocity, total area utilized and time spent moving), which are associated with electivity for prey types in adult frogs and lizards, did not predict the ontogenetic change in the diet of C. stepheni. Apparently, the behavioral changes that cause the ontogenetic change in C. stepheni are more subtle than shifts in general activity during foraging. Studies of niche partitioning in communities of anurans that do not take into consideration ontogenetic changes in diet and seasonal changes in the size structures of populations present a partial and possibly erroneous picture of the potential interactions among species.

AB This study estimates the present and future distribution potential of 12 thermophilic and rare tree species for Europe based on climate-soil sensitive species distribution models (SDMs), and compares them to the two major temperate and boreal tree species (Fops sylvatica and Picea abies).
   We used European national forest inventory data with 1.3 million plots to predict the distribution of the 12 + 2 tree species in Europe today and under future warming scenarios of +2.9 and +4.5 degrees C. The SDMs that were used to calculate the distributions were in a first step only given climate variables for explanation. In a second step, deviations which could not be explained by the climate models were tested in an additional soil variable-based model. Site-index models were applied to the found species distribution to estimate the growth performance (site index) under the given climate.
   We find a northward shift of 461 km and 697 km for the thermophilic species over the regarded time period from 2060 to 2080 under a warming scenario of 2.9 degrees C and 4.5 degrees C, respectively. Potential winners of climatic warming have their distribution centroid below 48 degrees N. Fagus sylvatica and Picea abies will lose great parts of their potential distribution range (approx. 55 and 60%, respectively). An index of area gain and growth performance revealed Ulmus laevis, Quercus rubra, Quercus cerris and Robinia pseudoacacia as interesting alternatives in managed temperate forests currently dominated by F. sylvatica and P. abies.
   The 12 investigated species are already in focus in forestry and it has been shown that the changing climate creates conditions for a targeted promotion in European forests. Nevertheless, area winners exhibited lower growth performances. So, forest conversion with these warm-adapted species goes hand in hand with loss of overall growth performance compared to current species composition. So, the results are a premise for a further discussion on the ecological consequences and the consistency with forest socio-economic goals and conservation policies.

AB Despite the global trend in urbanization, little is known about patterns of biodiversity or provisioning of ecosystem services in urban areas. Bee communities and the pollination services they provide are important in cities, both for small-scale urban agriculture and native gardens. To better understand this important ecological issue, we examined bee communities, their response to novel floral resources, and their potential to provide pollination services in 25 neighborhoods across Chicago, IL (USA). In these neighborhoods, we evaluated how local floral resources, socioeconomic factors, and surrounding land cover affected abundance, richness, and community composition of bees active in summer. We also quantified species-specific body pollen loads and visitation frequencies to potted flowering purple coneflower plants (Echinacea purpurea) to estimate potential pollination services in each neighborhood. We documented 37 bee species and 79 flowering plant genera across all neighborhoods, with 8 bee species and 14 flowering plant genera observed on average along each neighborhood block. We found that both bee abundance and richness increased in neighborhoods with higher human population density, as did visitation to purple coneflower flower heads. In more densely populated neighborhoods, bee communities shifted to a suite of species that carry more pollen and are more active pollinators in this system, including the European honey bee (Apis mellifera) and native species such as Agapostemon virescens. More densely populated neighborhoods also had a greater diversity of flowering plants, suggesting that the positive relationship between people and bees was mediated by the effect of people on floral resources. Other environmental variables that were important for bee communities included the amount of grass/herbaceous cover and solar radiation in the surrounding area. Our results indicate that bee communities and pollination services can be maintained in dense urban neighborhoods with single-family and multi-family homes, as long as those neighborhoods contain diverse and abundant floral resources.

AB 1. Competition is considered a key factor structuring many communities, and has been described as the 'hallmark' of ant ecology. Dominant species are thought to play a key role structuring local ant assemblages through competitive exclusion.
   2. However, while there have been many studies demonstrating competitive exclusion and consequently reduced richness at baits, it is not clear whether such regulation of 'momentary' diversity at clumped food resources can scale up to the regulation of richness at the site or assemblage level.
   3. In this study, ant assemblages were sampled in three different savanna habitats in South Africa using both baiting and pitfall trapping.
   4. As has been found in previous studies, there was a unimodal relationship between dominant ants and species richness at baits, with high abundances of dominant ants regulating species richness through competitive exclusion. Analysis of pitfall samples revealed strong convergence in pattern, and results from null model co-occurrence analyses supported the findings.
   5. The importance of competition in structuring local ant assemblages was, however, only apparent at one of the three savanna habitats suggesting that a full range of extreme environments is needed to produce the full unimodal relationship at the assemblage level.
   6. Although the relative importance of competition varied with habitat type, the study demonstrated that in some habitats, dominant ants can control species richness at the assemblage level.

AB Aim Propagule size and output are critical for the ability of a plant species to colonize new environments. If invasive species have a greater reproductive output than native species (via more and/or larger seeds), then they will have a greater dispersal and establishment ability. Previous comparisons within plant genera, families or environments have conflicted over the differences in reproductive traits between native and invasive species. We went beyond a genus-, family- or habitat-specific approach and analysed data for plant reproductive traits from the global literature, to investigate whether: (1) seed mass and production differ between the original and introduced ranges of invasive species; (2) seed mass and production differ between invasives and natives; and (3) invasives produce more seeds per unit seed mass than natives.
   Location Global.
   Methods We combined an existing data set of native plant reproductive data with a new data compilation for invasive species. We used t-tests to compare original and introduced range populations, two-way ANOVAs to compare natives and invasives, and an ANCOVA to examine the relationship between seed mass and production for natives and invasives. The ANCOVA was performed again incorporating phylogenetically independent contrasts to overcome any phylogenetic bias in the data sets.
   Results Neither seed mass nor seed production of invasive species differed between their introduced and original ranges. We found no significant difference in seed mass between invasives and natives after growth form had been accounted for. Seed production was greater for invasive species overall and within herb and woody growth forms. For a given seed mass, invasive species produced 6.7-fold (all species), 6.9-fold (herbs only) and 26.1-fold (woody species only) more seeds per individual per year than native species. The phylogenetic ANCOVA verified that this trend did not appear to be influenced by phylogenetic bias within either data set.
   Main conclusions This study provides the first global examination of both seed mass and production traits in native and invasive species. Invasive species express a strategy of greater seed production both overall and per unit seed mass compared with natives. The consequent increased likelihood of establishment from long-distance seed dispersal may significantly contribute to the invasiveness of many exotic species.

AB For most carnivore populations, territoriality is the regulating social system ultimately determined by food abundance and/or strife. However, in some food-based territorial felid species such as the jaguar (Panthera onca), the influence of food availability on territoriality remains unclear and may be lessened because of a tendency for individuals to occur at high densities across the landscape. We examined spatial organization and use of food in a population of jaguars in the southern region of the Pantanal, Brazil (2003-04). We predicted that if territoriality plays an important role in determining jaguar population dynamics, exclusive use of territories should be observed and thereby influence prey selection patterns. We determined that home range sizes were comparable between sexes and overlapped little at the core area level. Line transect surveys revealed that large mammals comprised the bulk of available wild prey for jaguars, and scat analysis indicated that jaguars relied mostly on large mammalian prey. The most common wild species killed by jaguars were capybara (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris) and caiman (Caiman yacare). We estimated that the wild prey base was adequate to support the jaguar population. Larger wild prey species were considerably more likely to die from predation than from other causes, and predation was more likely to occur in jaguar core areas than in areas of home range overlap. Modest cattle depredation rates had little demographic importance to the local jaguar population. We conclude that spacing patterns in the local jaguar population were likely based on exclusion through territoriality rather than food limitation. 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The size, density and biomass of coral reef fish in 4 fully closed marine protected areas (MPAs) with different ages were studied over a 17 yr period. Space-for-time substitution samples were available for d period of 4 yr before, and 36 yr after the closure. Both the height of the size structure graph (which is a value of overall abundance-biomass) and the assemblage biomass graph are convex polynomials with a maximum biomass of 1200 kg ha(-1) at 22 yr. This suggests that full recovery of coral reef fish assemblages in terms of abundance-biomass is considerably longer than generally believed. Beyond 25 yr, there can be a small loss in biomass, which we suggest is due to reduced net primary production associated with the increased abundance of calcifying algae attributable to intense grazing. Size spectra slopes were variable at all times, changed quickly, and were probably influenced by local environmental conditions, which made concise predictions for equilibrium coral reef size structure rather difficult.

AB We tested whether cropping or digestion by Thomson's gazelles (Gazella thomsoni) constrains daily energy intake under sward conditions normally encountered during the growing season. Distinguishing between these alternatives is important in understanding grass-grazer interactions and modeling grazer energetics. Grazing trials on artificial swards showed that gazelles had a monotonically saturating functional response, but that relationships between grazing rate and forage density changed with grass height. Grazing rate was positively related to biomass on short swards, yet there was no significant relationship for tall swards. Bite mass and bite rate also differed in their relationship to biomass across sward heights, with the strongest relationships being found on short swards. Bite rate and bite mass were inversely related, as predicted by current theory for dense grass swards. Voluntary energy intake on a daily basis was a positive function of the digestible energy content of forage, but a negative function of sward biomass. Therefore, our results indicate that daily energy intake is constrained by digestive processes on swards with biomass >25 g/m(2), whereas intake is constrained by cropping processes at lower sward biomass. Our data additionally suggest that variation in bite rate and bite mass with sward height could permit a small ruminant to select high-quality grass, thereby achieving high energy gain on immature swards.

AB In order to understand the variation of Estonian calcareous thin-soil grasslands on Ordovician or Silurian lime stone (alvars), 58 stands, distributed over the whole alvar region of Estonia, were described and clustered numerically using TABORD. Alvars are characterized by a high species richness. These mainly semi-natural communities have mostly developed after clear-cutting of forests. Grazing by domestic animals and removal of woody plants is needed for their maintenance. Primary (natural) alvar grasslands are found in a few places in coastal regions or in areas with thin-soil on monolithic bedrock. In data processing a whole stand, described by several small releves, was used in the classification as one description, including species frequencies as a quantitative measure. Seven clusters were separated and their configuration checked in a PCA-ordination. The resulting classification agreed with the previous 'rough' classification. Both geographical and ecological factors were related with the clustering and the ordination. The broad classification units, suggested for Estonian alvar grasslands, were quite similar to the ones described earlier for alvar vegetation on Oland, Sweden. Clusters differed in their species richness, environmental conditions and life-form spectra. Differences in species richness were defined by regional species pools. Compared to earlier surveys, only a small fraction of alvars still remains in Estonia. Active conservation, i.e. suitable manage ment is needed to protect the still surviving valuable plant communities. The present study can provide guidelines on how to protect and manage different types of alvars in Estonia.

AB The flora in China is highly endemic. Decisions about conservation and management of biodiversity based on hotspots and conservation gaps of endemic seed plant species diversity in China are essential. In this paper, based on a species distribution data set with 12,824 Chinese endemic plants, we measured Chinese endemic seed plant diversity using five indices: endemic species richness (ER), weighted endemism (WE), phylogenetic diversity (PD), phylogenetic endemism (PE), and biogeographically weighted evolutionary distinctiveness (BED). Five percent of China's total land area with the highest biodiversity was used to identify hotspots for each index. In total, 19 hotspots covering 7.96% of China's total land area were identified. Most hotspots are located in mountainous areas, mainly in the Qinling Mountains and further south or in the Hengduan Mountains and to the east in China. Nine hotspots are identified with all five indices. These hotspots include the Hengduan Mountains, the Xishuangbanna Region, the Qinling Mountains, southwest Chongqing, and five mountainous areas (located in east Chongqing and west Hubei; in east Yunnan and west Guangxi; in north Guangxi, southeast Guizhou and southwest Hunan; in north Guangdong and south Hunan; and in southeast Tibet, respectively). Furthermore, we detected conservation gaps for hotspots of Chinese endemic seed flora by overlaying national nature reserves with the identified hotspots, and we designated priority conservation gaps for hotspots by overlaying global biodiversity hotspots with conservation gaps for hotspots. Most hotspots for Chinese endemic seed plant species are badly protected. Only 26.48% of the hotspot areas of Chinese endemic seed plant species were covered by nature reserves. We suggest that it is essential to pay more attention to herbaceous plants in biodiversity conservation, and to promote a network function of nature reserves within these hotspots in China.

AB Globally, both climatic patterns and nitrogen deposition rates show directional changes over time. It is uncertain how woody seedlings, which coexist with herbaceous plants in savannas, respond to concurrent changes in water and nutrient availability.
   We investigated competition effects between herbaceous vegetation and tree seedlings (Colophospermum mopane) under changed water and nutrient (fertilized) conditions in a garden experiment situated in a semi-arid savanna.
   Herbaceous competition significantly suppressed woody seedling growth. The effect of herbaceous competition on woody seedling growth remained constant with both increasing water and nutrient availability. However, during a wet-season drought, herbaceous competition apparently caused premature leaf senescence in non-irrigated treatments. Fertilization exacerbated negative competition effects during the drought, while irrigation prevented leaf loss of tree seedlings in spite of herbaceous competition and fertilization.
   Based on a conceptual model, we propose that the vigorous response of herbaceous plants to increased nutrient availability leads to faster depletion of soil water, which increasingly causes water stress in woody seedlings if the interval between watering events is prolonged, e.g. during wet-season droughts.
   Synthesis. Our data support the notion that changes in drought frequency are of greater importance to woody recruitment success than changes in annual rainfall amount. Based on the water and nutrient interactions observed in our experiment, we suggest that the effect of increased nitrogen deposition on woody seedling recruitment is contingent on water availability.

AB The impressive Pleistocene coastal aeolianite exposures in sea cliffs east of Still Bay on the west-southern coast of South Africa host a rich archive of fossil mammalian trackways, including the African elephant (Loxodonta africana). Neither the ichnofossils nor their host sediments have been described in any detail and chronologies remained uncertain. This paper presents a new optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and amino acid racemisation (AAR) chronology (the first joint application of OSL/AAR dating in South Africa). This provides a temporal framework for assessing the palaeoenvironmental significance of dune sedimentation pattems, pedogenesis and ichnology.
   The Pleistocene aeolianite exposures at Still Bay represent the recently eroded remnants of a dune cordon, mainly built by coalesced parabolic dune systems. Sedimentary facies are dominated by large-scale planar cross-stratification formed by foreset progradation in the nose and trailing arms of the dunes and low-angle bedding, chiefly representing sedimentation in low relief interdune terrain. The main dune building wind regime was westerly, associated with cyclonic polar frontal systems (as at the present time). The OSL and AAR dating demonstrate ages ranging from MIS 5e to 5b and termination of Pleistocene aeolian sedimentation at similar to 90 ka. The Pleistocene acolianite is separated from the overlying Holocene dunes (dated to similar to 8 ka), by a major hiatus recorded by a horizon of intense pedogenesis.
   Elephant footprints were seen in profile, as casts on the underside of beds and as natural impressions. The taphonomic processes controlling the morphology and preservation of these unique ichnofossils were found to e complex. The presence of Loxodonta africana at Still Bay represents the southernmost occurrence of this species recorded to date and possibly, a closer proximity of woodland during MIS 5. This and other- observations may indicate a higher moisture regime than at present. There is no available evidence that the elephants were predated by contemporary Middle Stone Age people.

AB Riparian habitats in many parts of South Africa are severely degraded by invasive alien plants, especially trees. These invasions reduce water yields from catchments and affect riverine functioning and biodiversity. Initiatives are underway countrywide to clear alien plants from watercourses and surrounding catchments. Current understanding of key processes that regulate riparian functioning and define options for restoration is rudimentary. We review the impacts of riparian invasions and identify factors limiting the recovery of natural vegetation following alien clearance. We propose a framework of strategic interventions for optimizing restoration success. The framework identifies abiotic and biotic barriers to restoration at the scales of catchments and local reaches. In highly transformed catchments, interventions at the reach scale may fail if important barriers at the catchment scale are not addressed. The extent to which propagule supply and microsite conditions inhibit vegetation recovery is unknown. We also know little of the relative importance of dispersing vegetative propagules, dispersing seeds and soil-stored seed banks in vegetation dynamics, particularly after severe disturbances such as dense invasion by alien plants. The importance of geomorphological and hydrological factors in mediating recovery of riparian vegetation has not been adequately explored for all climatic areas in South Africa. More research is needed to determine the influence of different alien species and clearing treatments on the recovery of riparian vegetation. The literature strongly suggests that in highly alien-transformed catchments, the re-introduction of riparian species is required to promote recovery and suppress re-invasion. However, such interventions are unlikely to be widely implemented unless the cost: benefit ratios are favourable.

AB This study explored the determinants of spread of four alien Pinus species and the ability of models to predict invasion dynamics in a complex fragmented landscape. The role of environmental factors, natural and anthropogenic disturbance in relation to invasion history was assessed for different stages in the invasion process using a Geographic Information System. Pines escaped from plantations over the past 30 years and spread into the natural semi-arid shrubland (renosterveld). The pattern of spread was compared with a simulated random distribution using two different techniques, a standard logistic regression, and a new recursive modelling approach (Formal Inference-based Recursive Modelling; FIRM). FIRM analysis improved the accuracy of predictions and revealed interactive effects of variables hidden by the logistic regression analysis. More than 80% of isolated pine individuals were found in 20% of the habitat classified as suitable by the models. Soil pH was the most important predictor for the distribution of isolated trees, whereas the establishment of dense pine stands was largely determined by fire history. Differences in invasive behaviour could be explained by species attributes such as limited dispersal for P. canariensis, and better drought-tolerance for P. halepensis. Sixty-five percent of the current pine distribution was accurately predicted by the spatial distribution of the first trees to have invaded. Such models could be used to predict potential spread of invasive plants and gain a better understanding of the main factors driving the invasion process. However, the spread of invasive species in fragmented landscapes, strongly modified by human activities, is very complicated, and the spread remains difficult to predict in the long term. The dynamics of invasion are discussed in relation to changes in land use and disturbance regime.

   BIODIVERSITY; COMPETITION; DISTURBANCE; INVASIBILITY; PRODUCTIVITY;
   ECOSYSTEMS
AB Exotic plant invasions represent a threat to natural and managed ecosystems. Understanding of the mechanisms that determine why a given species may invade a given ecosystem, or why some biomes and regions seem more prone to invasions, is limited. One potential reason for this lack of progress may lie in how few studies have addressed invasion mechanisms from the point of view of the invaded community. On the other hand, the renewed debate about the relationship between ecological diversity and ecosystem stability offers the opportunity to revisit existing theory and empirical evidence, and to attempt to investigate which characteristics of plant communities, including their diversity, contribute to their invasibility. Empirical studies have shown both positive and negative relationships between species diversity of resident plant communities and their invasibility by external species. Rather than attempting to build a larger collection of case studies, research now needs to address the mechanisms underlying these relationships. Previous knowledge about the mechanisms favouring invasion needs to be coupled with community theory to form the basis of these new investigations. Modern community theory offers hypotheses and techniques to analyse the invasibility of communities depending on their diversity and other factors, such as species' life histories and environmental variability. The body of knowledge accumulated in invasion ecology suggests that the role of disturbances, in interaction with fertility, and the importance of interactions with other trophic levels, are specific factors for consideration. In addition, it is essential for future studies to explicitly tease apart the effects of species richness per se from the effects of other components of ecological diversity, such as functional diversity (the number of functional groups) and trophic diversity (the number of interactions among trophic levels).

AB Developmental trade-offs in resource allocation across life-history stages and between different body parts are predicted by life-history theories. However, there is very little empirical evidence that these occur. We investigated these trade-offs in caddis flies by experimentally manipulating larval case construction and thereby silk expenditure. Case building diverts protein resources away from larval stores, which are of major importance to adult development in species with little or no adult feeding. We induced fifth-instar Odontocerum albicorne to build new cases and examined the consequences for the morphology of the resulting adults. Rebuilding did not alter larval food consumption or the date of entering pupation, but shortened the duration of the pupal period. Adults that had been induced to expend more silk as larvae had lighter thoraces and smaller wings than the controls, but their abdomens did not differ significantly in mass or nitrogen content. These results suggest a trade-off between larval silk production and the pattern of resource allocation within the adult. The maintenance of the abdomen is likely to preserve reproductive potential, while the reduction in thoracic and wing investment will have negative consequences for flight and associated activities, and possibly for adult longevity.

AB Aim: We identify the main forest vegetation types in Taiwan, provide their formal definitions and describe their species composition, habitat affinities and distribution.
   Location: Taiwan.
   Methods: A data set of 9822 vegetation plots with environmental characteristics recorded in the field or derived from digital maps in GIS was compiled from historical literature and an extensive field survey. Using expert knowledge, 6574 of these plots were used to build a classification into broad vegetation types. The units of the resulting classification were formally defined using a Cocktail determination key, which can be used for the automatic assignment of new vegetation plots to these vegetation types.
   Results: Twelve vegetation types of zonal forests and nine types of azonal forests were distinguished. Zonal types in the subtropical region, from high mountains to foothills, are Juniperus subalpine coniferous woodland, Abies-Tsuga upper-montane coniferous forest, Chamaecyparis montane mixed cloud forest, Fagus montane deciduous broad-leaved cloud forest, Quercus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest, Machilus-Castanopsis sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest, Phoebe-Machilus sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest and Ficus-Machilus semi-evergreen foothill forest. Zonal types in the tropical region, from high mountains to foothills, are Pasania-Elaeocarpus montane evergreen broad-leaved cloud forest, Drypetes-Helicia sub-montane evergreen broad-leaved forest, Dysoxylum-Machilus foothill evergreen broad-leaved forest and Aglaia-Ficus foothill evergreen broad-leaved forest. Azonal types are Illicium-Cyclobalanopsis tropical winter monsoon forest, Pyrenaria-Machilus subtropical winter monsoon forest, Diospyros-Champereia tropical rock-outcrop forest, Zelkova-Quercus subtropical rock-outcrop forest, Pinus successional woodland, Alnus successional woodland, Trema-Mallotus successional woodland, Scaevola-Hibiscus seashore woodland and Kandelia mangrove.
   Conclusions: The diversity of forest vegetation in Taiwan is strongly structured by the temperature and moisture gradient. Along the temperature gradient, five altitudinal zones can be recognized. Azonal forest types develop at sites affected by the winter monsoon, on steep slopes, rocky soils, in seashore saline habitats and in places disturbed by fire, landslides and human activities. Zonal vegetation contains a higher ratio of endemic and Pacific species and occurs in wetter habitats, whereas azonal vegetation contains co-existing species from different regions and usually occurs in drier habitats.

AB The area of forests planted with exotic tree species is increasing worldwide in order to fulfill various economic and environmental demands. Numerous species currently used in forest plantations are considered to be invasive in many parts of the world. Exotic plantation tree species are endowed with a series of life-history traits that are characteristic of invasive species: easy establishment, fast growth, high propagule pressure, and low or intermediate shade tolerance. In addition, plantation forestry presents many features that increase ecosystem invasibility, including a regime of frequent and intensive canopy disturbances, a dense network of roads and trails with continuous traffic, and wide plantation areas. Exotic trees planted for production purposes have strong direct positive economic impacts on the local and national economies of many countries, often leading to notable conflicts of interest when the species becomes invasive, as well as to negative impacts on the ecosystem. Studies and management programs mainly focus on Pinus and Acacia, which are used as model species. Complementary management strategies have been established to control these species at different stages of the invasion process. Knowledge gained is useful to predict problems in other regions of the world with the same species and to guide research or management actions on other problematic but less studied tree species.

AB Population size and trends of large carnivores are difficult to determine, but are often needed to inform conservation actions. Direct counts maintained over long time periods are extremely difficult to achieve. Indices of population sizes can be used to estimate large carnivore abundances, but are often case-, species- and site-specific. Here, we test the general applicability of track-based indices to estimate large carnivore abundance. We surveyed 15 306.4 km of roads associated with 339 transects across a wide geographical scale, large range of densities and variable substrates for tracks of African large carnivores. A combined model for all carnivore species on sandy soils serves as a robust approach to predict large carnivore densities. Thus, indices based on track counts can provide useful estimates of carnivore abundance. We found consistent relationships between track densities and the actual carnivore densities, having taken account of substrate.

AB Ant-plant interactions represent a diversity of strategies, from exploitative to mutualistic, and how these strategies evolve is poorly understood. Here, we link physiological, ecological, and phylogenetic approaches to study the evolution and coexistence of strategies in the Acacia-Pseudomyrmex system. Host plant species represented 2 different strategies. High-reward hosts produced significantly more extrafloral nectar (EFN), food bodies, and nesting space than low-reward hosts, even when being inhabited by the same species of ant mutualist. High-reward hosts were more effectively defended against herbivores and exploited to a lower extent by nondefending ants than low-reward hosts. At the phenotypic level, secretion of EFN and ant activity were positively correlated and a mutualistic ant species induced nectar secretion, whereas a nondefending exploiter did not. All of these mechanisms contribute to the stable association of high-reward hosts with defending ant species. However, exploiter ants are less dependent on the host-derived rewards and can colonize considerable proportions of the low-reward hosts. Mapping these strategies onto phylogenetic trees demonstrated that the low-reward hosts represent the derived clade within a monophyletic group of obligate ant plants and that the observed exploiter ant species evolved their strategy without having a mutualistic ancestor. We conclude that both types of host strategies coexist because of variable net outcomes of different investment-payoff regimes and that the effects of exploiters on the outcome of mutualisms can, thus, increase the diversity within the taxa involved.

AB Explanations for species coexistence in ant communities have traditionally focused on niche partitioning, particularly relating to differences in diet, foraging times and nesting requirements. Although niche separation is undoubtedly important, it seems insufficient to account for the high levels of local species richness that are commonly observed. This paper explores alternative explanations for ant species coexistence, focusing on factors that prevent competitive exclusion in diverse ant communities experiencing high levels of behavioural dominance, such as characteristically occurs in Australia. Very high species densities require two conditions to be met: first, a large number of species must successfully establish; and second, there must be a high rate of species persistence once established. In this context I advance five propositions based around three sets of arguments. First, ant sociality and modularity confers a high level of persistence once colonies are established, so that species coexistence is determined to a significant extent by processes operating at the establishment phase, rather than just by interactions between established colonies. Second, competitive outcomes are highly conditioned by environmental variation, which severely limits competitive exclusion. Finally, dominant species are highly patchy in space, and cannot comprehensively monopolize resources, such that there will usually be room for low densities of subordinate species. These propositions have relevance to neutral theories of community ecology, and to understanding intercontinental differences in local species richness.

AB Fire and herbivory are important determinants of nutrient availability in savanna ecosystems. Fire and herbivory effects on the nutritive quality of savanna vegetation can occur directly, independent of changes in the plant community, or indirectly, via effects on the plant community. Indirect effects can be further subdivided into those occurring because of changes in plant species composition or plant abundance (i.e., quality versus quantity). We studied relationships between fire, herbivory, rainfall, soil fertility, and leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sodium (Na) at 30 sites inside and outside of Serengeti National Park. Using structural equation modeling, we asked whether fire and herbivory influences were largely direct or indirect and how their signs and strengths differed within the context of natural savanna processes. Herbivory was associated with enhanced leaf N and P through changes in plant biomass and community composition. Fire was associated with reduced leaf nutrient concentrations through changes in plant community composition. Additionally, fire had direct positive effects on Na and nonlinear direct effects on P that partially mitigated the indirect negative effects. Key mechanisms by which fire reduced plant nutritive quality were through reductions of Na-rich grasses and increased abundance of Themeda triandra, which had below-average leaf nutrients.

In importing countries, three types of biosecurity activities can be carried out: border surveillance targets the arrival stage of a non-native species at points-of-entry for commodities; post-border surveillance and containment target the establishment stage, but post-border surveillance is carried out on a large spatial scale, whereas containment is carried out around infested areas. In recent years, several surveillance approaches, such as baited traps, sentinel trees, biosurveillance with sniffer dogs or predatory wasps, electronic noses, acoustic detection, laser vibrometry, citizen science, genetic identification tools, and remote sensing, have been developed to complement routine visual inspections and aid in biosecurity capacity. Here, we review the existing literature on these tools, highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and identify the biosecurity surveillance categories and sites where each tool can be used more efficiently. Finally, we show how these tools can be integrated in a comprehensive biosecurity program and discuss steps to improve biosecurity.

AB Loss of megafauna, an aspect of defaunation, can precipitate many ecological changes over short time scales. We examine whether megafauna loss can also explain features of lasting ecological state shifts that occurred as the Pleistocene gave way to the Holocene. We compare ecological impacts of late-Quaternarymegafauna extinction in five American regions: southwestern Patagonia, the Pampas, northeastern United States, northwestern United States, and Beringia. We find that major ecological state shifts were consistent with expectations of defaunation in North American sites but not in South American ones. The differential responses highlight two factors necessary for defaunation to trigger lasting ecological state shifts discernable in the fossil record: (i) lost megafauna need to have been effective ecosystem engineers, like proboscideans; and (ii) historical contingencies must have provided the ecosystem with plant species likely to respond to megafaunal loss. These findings help in identifying modern ecosystems that are most at risk for disappearing should current pressures on the ecosystems' large animals continue and highlight the critical role of both individual species ecologies and ecosystem context in predicting the lasting impacts of defaunation currently underway.

AB Biological invasions occur worldwide, and have been the object of ecological and socio-economic research for decades. However, the manner in which different stakeholder groups identify the problems associated with invasive species and confront invasive species management under different policies remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted an econometric analysis of the social factors influencing willingness to pay for invasive alien species management under two different regimes: eradication and prevention in the Doana Natural Protected Area (SW Spain). Controlling for the participation of local residents, tourists and conservationists, email and face-to-face questionnaires were conducted. Results indicated that respondents were more willing to pay for eradication than prevention; and public support for invasive alien species management was influenced by an individual's knowledge and perception of invasive alien species, active interest in nature, and socio-demographic attributes. We concluded that invasive alien species management research should confront the challenges to engage stakeholders and accept any tradeoffs necessary to modify different conservation policies to ensure effective management is implemented. Finally, our willingness to pay estimates suggest the Department of Environment of Andalusian Government has suitable social support to meet the budgetary expenditures required for invasive alien species plans and adequate resources to justify an increase in the invasive alien species management budget.

AB Climate change represents a major challenge to the maintenance of global biodiversity. To date, the direction and magnitude of net changes in the global distribution of plant diversity remain elusive. We use the empirical multi-variate relationships between contemporary water-energy dynamics and other non-climatic predictor variables to model the regional capacity for plant species richness (CSR) and its projected future changes. We find that across all analysed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenarios, relative changes in CSR increase with increased projected temperature rise. Between now and 2100, global average CSR is projected to remain similar to today (+0.3%) under the optimistic B1/+1.8 degrees C scenario, but to decrease significantly (-9.4%) under the 'business as usual' A1FI/+4.0 degrees C scenario. Across all modelled scenarios, the magnitude and direction of CSR change are geographically highly non-uniform. While in most temperate and arctic regions, a CSR increase is expected, the projections indicate a strong decline in most tropical and subtropical regions. Countries least responsible for past and present greenhouse gas emissions are likely to incur disproportionately large future losses in CSR, whereas industrialized countries have projected moderate increases. Independent of direction, we infer that all changes in regional CSR will probably induce on-site species turnover and thereby be a threat to native floras.

AB P>1. The coexistence of leguminous trees and C-4 grasses in many African savannas forces competition between these two distinct plant life-forms. The nature of tree-grass coexistence and the consequent competition for resources remains poorly understood.
   2. We hypothesized that grass suppression of tree seedling growth was due to competition for N in plants not capable of fixing N-2 and due to the costs of N-2 fixation in those capable of nodulation.
   3. Growth and N-2 fixation of nodulating (Acacia karroo, Acacia nilotica, Acacia tortilis and Acacia nigrescens) and non-nodulating (Acacia ataxacantha Acacia brevispica and Acacia schweinfurthii) Acacia spp. in response to soil characteristics and fertilizer variations in irrigated field experiments were compared. The extent of N-2 fixation was determined from delta 15N values.
   4. Grass suppressed the growth of all species, but particularly of the non-nodulating species. The N-2-fixing tree seedlings had high tissue N and high water-use efficiencies (WUE, based on delta 13C) relative to non-nodulating legumes, making the N-2-fixing species strong competitors with C-4 grasses, which have low tissue N contents and high WUE. The suppression of seedling growth by grass was smaller for plants grown in a soil with 66 mg kg-1 than in a soil with 9 mg kg-1 of Bray II P. The tissue N : P ratios (15.1) indicated that P-limitation constrained growth of seedlings in soils with low Bray II P when grass was present, rather than the energetic costs of N-2 fixation.
   5.Synthesis. In Acacia savannas and in the absence of water limitation, competition for N is the main constraint imposed by grass on growth of Acacia seedlings and that the ability to fix N-2 overcomes this limitation. However, the growth of N-2 fixing Acacias may be additionally limited by grass competition for P.

AB Floristic data from paired roadside-paddock analyses from grassland in central Queensland, Australia, were ordinated. The mean direction of the vectors between these pairs was almost perfectly aligned with the indirect gradient represented by the first axis of Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling. It confirms anecdotal evidence of a trend from infrequently grazed roadsides to constantly grazed paddocks. The increasing abundance of annual herbs and grasses along this putative gradient is consistent with documented trends from elsewhere in the world. The response patterns of individual species along the disturbance gradient is consistent with ecological theory predicting unimodal peaks in abundance along physical environmental gradients. The ancestral perennial dominants of the grasslands, Dichanthium sericeum and D. queenslandicum, exhibited a declining response to grazing disturbance. Even the generally unpalatable perennial grass Aristida leptopoda declined considerably in the upper segments of the grazing disturbance gradient. A suite of herbaceous trailing legumes had peaks in their abundance near the middle of the grazing disturbance gradient, trends that can be readily explained by the combination of their palatability and intolerance to competition from tall perennial grasses. Several species including the noxious exotic herb Parthenium hysterophorus showed increasing abundance along the grazing disturbance gradient. The methodology may have application as a rapid method of assessing disturbance impacts elsewhere, and is most suited where a management differential between paired plots can be reliably generalized and where the physical environment is relatively monotonous.

AB With global biodiversity in decline, there is now an urgent requirement to take ameliorative action for endangered species in the form of re-introductions. For the highly diverse orchid family, many species face imminent extinction. Successful re-introductions that result in self-sustaining populations require not only an understanding of existing threats, but an in-depth understanding of species ecology. Increasingly, translocations, ranging from re-introductions to assisted colonisation, are being adopted as recovery actions. Do these translocations mitigate threatening processes and account for the two key ecological attributes for orchid survival; pollinator and mycorrhizal presence? Here, we conducted a literature review identifying the known threats to orchid survival and their necessary mitigation strategies. Next, we evaluated the success of 74 published international orchid translocations on 66 species against a consideration of orchid ecological attributes. Lastly, we empirically tested an additional 22 previously unpublished re-introductions on 12 species undertaken since 2007 against a re-introduction process that accounts for identified threats and orchid ecological attributes. We identified habitat destruction, weed invasion, herbivory, illegal collection, pollinator decline, pathogens and climate change as critical threats to orchid survival. In our global review based on published translocations, the average survival rate, 1-year post translocation was 66 % yet only 2.8 % of studies reported natural recruitment in field sites. Although survival of translocated orchids is clearly being achieved, these programmes did not relate orchid growth and development to key ecological requirements of orchid population resilience, pollinator and mycorrhizal ecology. Ensuring pollinator and mycorrhizal presence shows that these two factors alone are key factors influencing survival and persistence in an Australian review of 22 previously unpublished orchid re-introductions. In the Australian review flowering in the year following, out-planting was observed for 81 % of the re-introductions with seed set occurring in 63 % of re-introductions within the length of the study. Recruitment was observed in 18 % of the Australian re-introduced populations indicating a degree of population resilience. As orchid re-introductions will be a major strategy for wild orchid conservation in the future, we present a framework for orchid re-introductions, including criteria for success. We recommend symbiotic propagation and, for specialised pollination syndromes, the study of pollinator interactions prior to site selection and re-introduction of plants.

AB Termite mounds contribute to the spatial heterogeneity of ecological processes in many savannas, but the underlying patterns and determinants of mound distributions remain poorly understood. Using the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO), we mapped the distribution of termite mounds across a rainfall gradient within a river catchment (similar to 27 000 ha) of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We assessed how different factors were associated with the distribution and height of termite mounds at three spatial scales: the entire catchment, among three broad vegetation types, and on individual hillslope crests. Abiotic factors such as the underlying geology and mean annual precipitation shaped mound densities at broad scales, while local hillslope morphology strongly influenced mound distribution at finer scales, emphasising the importance of spatial scale when assessing mound densities. Fire return period had no apparent association with mound densities or height. Mound density averaged 0.46 mounds ha(-1), and exhibited a clustered pattern throughout the landscape, occurring at relatively high densities (up to 2 mounds ha(-1)) on crests, which are nutrient-poor elements of the landscape. Mounds exhibited significant over-dispersion (even spacing) at scales below 60 m so that evenly spaced aggregations of termite mounds are embedded within a landscape of varying mound densities. The tallest mounds were found in dry savanna (500 mm yr(-1)) and were positively correlated with mound density, suggesting that dry granitic savannas are ideal habitat for mound-building termites. Mound activity status also varied significantly across the rainfall gradient, with a higher proportion of active (live) mounds in the drier sites. The differential spacing of mounds across landscapes provides essential nutrient hotspots in crest locations, potentially sustaining species that would otherwise not persist. The contribution to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning that mounds provide is not uniform throughout landscapes, but varies considerably with spatial scale and context.

AB The use of body size as an index of prey rank in zooarchaeology has fostered a widely applied approach to understanding variability in foraging efficiency. This approach has, however been critiqued-most recently by the suggestion that large prey have high probabilities of failed pursuits. Here, we clarify the logic and history of using body size as a measure of prey rank and summarize empirical data on the body size return rate relationship. With few exceptions, these data document strong positive relationships between prey size and return rate. We then illustrate, with studies from the Great Basin, the utility of body size-based abundance indices (e.g., the Artiodactyl Index) when used as one component of multidimensional analyses of prehistoric diet breadth. We use foraging theory to derive predictions about Holocene variability in diet breadth and test those predictions using the Artiodactyl Index and over a dozen other archaeological indices. The results indicate close fits between the predictions and the data and thus support the use of body size-based abundance indices as measures of foraging efficiency. These conclusions have implications for reconstructions of Holocene trends in large game hunting in western North America and for zooarchaeological applications of foraging theory in general.

AB Understanding the transport and distribution of marine larvae by ocean currents is one of the key goals of population ecology. Here we investigate circulation in the East Australian Current (EAC) and its impact on the transport of larvae and coastal connectivity. A series of Lagrangian particle trajectory experiments are conducted in summer and winter from 1992-2006 which enables us to investigate seasonal and inter-annual variability. We also estimate a mean connectivity state from the average of each of the individual realisations. Connectivity patterns are related to the movement of five individual larval species (two tropical, two temperate and one invasive species) and are found to be in qualitative agreement with historical distribution patterns found along the coast of SE Australia.
   We use a configuration of the Princeton Ocean Model to investigate physical processes in the ocean along the coast of SE Australia where the circulation is dominated by the EAC, a vigorous western boundary current. We assimilate hydrographic fields from a similar to 10-km global analysis into a similar to 3-km resolution continental shelf model to create a high-resolution hindcast of ocean state for each summer and winter from 1992-2006. Particles are released along the coast of SE Australia, and at various isobaths across the shelf (25-1000 m) over timescales ranging from 10-90 days. Upstream of the EAC separation point across-shelf release location dominates the particle trajectory length scales, whereas seasonality dominates in the southern half of the domain, downstream of the separation point.
   Lagrangian probability density functions show dispersion pathways vary with release latitude, distance offshore and the timescale of dispersion. Northern (southern) release sites are typified by maximum (minimum) dispersal pathways. Offshore release distance also plays a role having the greatest impact at the mid-latitude release sites. Maximum alongshore dispersion occurs at the mid-latitude release sites such as Sydney. Seasonal variability is also greatest at mid-latitudes, associated with variations in the separation point of the EAC. Climatic variations such as El Nino and La Nina are also shown to play a role in dictating the connectivity patterns. La Nina periods have a tendency to increase summer time connectivity (particularly with offshore release sites) while El Nino periods are shown to increase winter connectivity.
   The EAC acts as a barrier to the onshore movement of particles offshore, which impacts on the connectivity of offshore release sites. Consequentially particles released inshore of the EAC jet exhibit a greater coastal connectivity than those released offshore of the EAC front. The separation point of the EAC also dictates connectivity with more sites being connected (with lower concentration) downstream of the separation point of the EAC. These results can provide a useful guide to the potential connectivity of marine populations, or the spread of invasive pests (via ballast water or release of propagules from established populations).

AB The mechanisms by which even the clearest of keystone or dominant species exert community-wide effects are only partially understood in most ecosystems. This is especially true when a species or guild influences community-wide interactions via changes in the abiotic landscape. Using stable isotope analyses, we show that subterranean termites in an East African savanna strongly influence a key ecosystem process: atmospheric nitrogen fixation by a monodominant tree species and its bacterial symbionts. Specifically, we applied the N-15 natural abundance method in combination with other biogeochemical analyses to assess levels of nitrogen fixation by Acacia drepanolobium and its effects on co-occurring grasses and forbs in areas near and far from mounds and where ungulates were or were not excluded. We find that termites exert far stronger effects than do herbivores on nitrogen fixation. The percentage of nitrogen derived from fixation in Acacia drepanolobium trees is higher (55-80%) away from mounds vs. near mounds (40-50%). Mound soils have higher levels of plant available nitrogen, and Acacia drepanolobium may preferentially utilize soil-based nitrogen sources in lieu of fixed nitrogen when these sources are readily available near termite mounds. At the scale of the landscape, our models predict that termite/soil derived nitrogen sources influence >50% of the Acacia drepanolobium trees in our system. Further, the spatial extent of these effects combine with the spacing of termite mounds to create highly regular patterning in nitrogen fixation rates, resulting in marked habitat heterogeneity in an otherwise uniform landscape. In summary, we show that termite-associated effects on nitrogen processes are not only stronger than those of more apparent large herbivores in the same system, but also occur in a highly regular spatial pattern, potentially adding to their importance as drivers of community and ecosystem structure.

AB Aims Both human and non-human determinants have shaped Mediterranean forest structure over the last few millennia. The effects of recent human activities on forest composition, however, remain poorly understood. We quantified changes in forest composition during the past century in the mixed forests of Quercus suber (cork oak) and Q. canariensis (Algerian oak), and explored the effects of forest management and environmental (climate, topography) factors on forest structure at various spatial and temporal scales.
   Location Mountains north of the Strait of Gibraltar (southern Spain).
   Methods First, we quantified 20th-century changes in species composition from a series of inventories in nine mixed forests (c. 40,000 ha), and examined them in terms of the management practices and environmental conditions. Second, we analysed present-day Q. suber and Q. canariensis stand structure along environmental gradients at two spatial scales: (1) that of the forest landscape (c. 284 ha), combining local inventories and topographic variables and using a digital elevation model; and (2) regional (c. 87,600 km(2)), combining data from the Spanish Forest Inventory for the Andalusia region and estimates of climatic variables. Results Historical data indicate anthropogenic changes in stand composition, revealing a sharp increase in the density of cork oaks over the last century. Forest management has favoured this species (for cork production) at the expense of Q. canariensis. The impact of management is imprinted on the present-day forest structure. The abundance of both species increases with annual mean precipitation, and they coexist above 800 mm (the minimum threshold for Q. canariensis). Quercus suber dominates in most of the stands, and species segregation in the landscape is associated with the drainage network, Q. canariensis being clearly associated with moister habitats near streams.
   Main conclusions Our study quantitatively exemplifies a recent human-mediated shift in forest composition. As a result of forest management, the realized niche of the cork oak has been enlarged at the expense of that of Q. canariensis, providing further evidence for humans as major drivers of oak forest composition across the Mediterranean. Recent regeneration problems detected in Q. suber stands, a reduced demand for wood products, conservation policies, and climate change augur new large-scale shifts in forest composition.

AB This review summarizes the key factors of a series of articles about animal plankton in rivers, a topic that remains poorly investigated. Running water, in which sampling processes are variable and often difficult, acts as a constraint as well as a resource for plankton. Assessment of the potamoplankton reveals that good swimmers of the true plankton are mixed with numerous poor swimmers among littoral and epibenthic forms. Small taxa dominate communities in most of rivers all over the world and, in comparison with crustaceans; the successful development of rotifers rests on their shorter development times. According to hydraulic and geomorphological features, the diversity of the habitats and the ability of individuals to avoid washout was examined, decrease in flow creating standing zones favourable to zooplankton development. Many species can find suitable conditions for the development of dense populations in stream habitats and examples of taxa-specific response, regardless of the habitat structure, are observed. While the challenge for riverine plankton remains eat to be fruitful and multiply', their activities have been poorly investigated in turbulent conditions, those able to continue growing in a current of 20 cm s(-1), such as brachionid species, being usually dominant in rivers. Examination of the distribution of plankton populations, in the Middle Loire and in other rivers, showed that the flow regime, which plays a central role in organizing river habitats, explains the presence/absence of these fast-growing organisms. While reservoirs are major sources of crustaceans, lateral exchanges as well as downstream transport are important in determining the plankton. These ecosystems are primarily governed by abiotic factors, biological control taking place after physical control has happened. Because animals arrive by chance in any habitat during dispersion, zooplankton in rivers remains primarily governed by unpredictable physical processes and depends on the age of the water and the availability of habitats. In this way, the hydro-dynamics of river habitats need to be more documented with regard to their key role in the planktonic life. Preservation of the lentic areas remaining at the heart of the matter, the contrasting ecology of the rotifers should be a reliable tool with which to estimate the changes in habitats diversity of main channels, particularly during droughts, while crustacean's diversity would be more representative of flood plain annexes, particularly during flood events.

AB Due to bush encroachment the grazing capacity of large areas of the southern African savanna has declined, often to such an extent that many previously economic livestock properties are now no longer economically viable. Attempts at restoring encroached areas by the removal of some or all of the woody plants will normally result in an increase of grass production and thus also the grazing capacity. However, the results of woody plant removal may differ between vegetation types, with the outcome determined by both negative and positive responses to tree removal. The rapid establishment of tree seedlings after the removal of some or all of the mature woody plants may reduce the effective time span of restoration measures. In many cases the resultant re-establishment of new woody seedlings may in time develop into a state that is worse than the original state. This paper is an attempt to summarize existing knowledge on the importance of woody plants in savanna and explore measures, based on ecosystem dynamics, which can be utilized to restore encroached areas more successfully. It is hypothesized that a more stable environment can be created by maintaining or restoring savanna structure (large trees). In a structured savanna, large trees are able to suppress the establishment of new seedlings, while maintaining the other benefits of woody plants like soil enrichment and the provision of food to browsing herbivore species. Effective restoration of encroached areas should not be considered a once-off event, but rather a long-term commitment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Co-evolved plant pathogens play an important role in shaping natural ecosystems. However, plants used in agriculture and forestry have been distributed globally, and their associated pathogens have moved with them. Eucalypts constitute the largest component of global hardwood plantations, and they are increasingly plagued by numerous pathogens, all of which are inconsequential in the native forests. Eucalypts provide a particularly interesting model to study tree diseases because plantations have been established in countries where these trees are exotic but also in Australia adjacent to native eucalypt forests. These situations present opportunities for pathogen movement between the two systems. We present seven different scenarios considering pathogen movement, important disease epidemics, and biosecurity risks, illustrated with examples of well-known eucalypt pathogens and research largely from our laboratories. The overview shows that vigilant biosecurity is required to protect the biodiversity of native forests and the sustainability of eucalypt plantations.

AB Like all obligately ectomycorrhizal plants, pines require ectomycorrhizal fungal symbionts to complete their life cycle. Pines introduced into regions far from their native range are typically incompatible with local ectomycorrhizal fungi, and, when they invade, coinvade with fungi from their native range. While the identities and distributions of coinvasive fungal symbionts of pine invasions are poorly known, communities that have been studied are notably depauperate. However, it is not yet clear whether any number of fungal coinvaders is able to support a Pinaceae invasion, or whether very depauperate communities are unable to invade. Here, we ask whether there is evidence for a minimum species richness of fungal symbionts necessary to support a pine/ectomycorrhizal fungus coinvasion. We sampled a Pinus contorta invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, using molecular barcoding to identify ectomycorrhizal fungi. We report that the site has a total richness of four species, and that many invasive trees appear to be supported by only a single ectomycorrhizal fungus, Suillus luteus. We conclude that a single ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungus can suffice to enable a pine invasion.

AB Aim
   Dispersal distances of insect pollinators are critical in defining their contribution to landscape-wide pollen movement and ultimately gene flow in natural and agricultural systems. We ask whether bee and fly pollinator taxa differ in their dispersal distances and transport of viable pollen in a human-modified system.
   Location
   Canterbury and Otago region, South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods
   We captured pollen-carrying insects travelling outside of a model mass-flowering agricultural crop, Brassica rapa, using insect flight intercept traps at five distances (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 m) from the pollen source. We examined pollen loads and pollen viability to determine whether pollen transport distance and viability differ among pollinator taxa.
   Results
   A total of 5453 insects were collected of which 717 individuals from 26 insect taxa were positively identified as dispersing pollen up to 400 m from the source. These taxa consisted of four species from two bee families (Hymenoptera: Apidae and Halictidae), and eight species from four fly families (Diptera: Bibiondae, Stratiomyidae, Syrphidae and Tachinidae). Apidae generally carried higher pollen loads and more viable pollen than most fly taxa. Taxa in the fly families Stratiomyidae and Syrphidae, however, carried pollen to 400 m, which is further than both bee families.
   Main conclusions
   A diverse array of wild and managed flower visitors can transport viable pollen from a pollen source to at least 400 m. Knowledge of the differences in transport distances among generalist pollinators in human-modified environments is crucial to understand the potential extent to which (1) pollen transport can facilitate gene flow and (2) unwanted hybridization may occur between crops and related weeds.

AB Resource partitioning among mammalian savanna herbivores is thought to be predominantly driven by differences in body size. In general, large herbivore species utilize abundant low quality forage while small herbivores focus on scarcer high quality food items. However, in a natural system other factors such as digestive strategy, season and the presence of megaherbivores (body size. 1000 kg) are likely to complicate allometric predictions. Non-ruminants are probably better able to cope with abundant low quality food than ruminants of the same size causing a non-ruminant to act 'larger' than allometrically predicted. Also, the effect of alternating seasons with high and low food availability on diet choice and hence the competitive interactions between co-occurring herbivores is still poorly understood. Lastly, how megaherbivores deviate from allometric predictions (based on smaller species) is still not well quantified.
   In this study we examine resource partitioning among three ruminant and three non-ruminant grazers: impala, wildebeest, buffalo, warthog, zebra and white rhinoceros (megaherbivore) in the savanna of Hluhluwe iMfolozi Park, South Africa. We analysed habitat and diet overlap, specifically grass species (something not commonly investigated) and grass height eaten, in both the wet and the dry seasons. We found that habitat utilization differences among the species were generally small and did not vary between seasons. Diets within feeding patches overlapped during the wet season but highly diverged during the dry season. Body mass differences among species explained their dry season resource partitioning for all species except for comparisons with the megaherbivore (white rhino), while differences in digestive strategy were not related to niche overlap in either season. We conclude that savanna herbivores in this system coexist mostly through body size-driven resource partitioning in the dry-season, with the exception of the white rhino (megaherbivore).

AB A large variety of aquatic animals was found to emit the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide when nitrate was present in the environment. The emission was ascribed to denitrification by ingested bacteria in the anoxic animal gut, and the exceptionally high N2O-to-N-2 production ratio suggested delayed induction of the last step of denitrification. Filter- and deposit-feeding animal species showed the highest rates of nitrous oxide emission and predators the lowest, probably reflecting the different amounts of denitrifying bacteria in the diet. We estimate that nitrous oxide emission by aquatic animals is quantitatively important in nitrate-rich aquatic environments like freshwater, coastal marine, and deep-sea ecosystems. The contribution of this source to overall nitrous oxide emission from aquatic environments might further increase because of the projected increase of nitrate availability in tropical regions and the numeric dominance of filter- and deposit-feeders in eutrophic ecosystems.

AB Invertebrates host numerous bacteria, with interactions ranging from pathogenesis to symbiosis. While certain symbiotic relationships have been well studied, little is known about the dynamics of these bacterial communities. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to examine the bacterial microflora associated with the eusocial wasp Vespula germanica . DGGE profiles of larval guts revealed a variable microflora, suggesting that V. germanica is not dependent on a particular suite of mutualists. The variation in profiles was not related to season, nest size or macrohabitat. Sequences corresponding to Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, a novel Leuconostoc and two Rickettsiella grylli strains were obtained. DGGE proved to be a useful technique for characterizing the wasp microflora. Given the importance of microbial communities to invertebrates, there is much to be gained from the application of such techniques.

AB For a new approach to the phytogeography of the Namib region three sets of data are analyzed, (a) distribution data of ca. 1700 taxa, (b) habitat informations of a large number of taxa, collected in course of an extensive phytosociological survey, (c) distribution data of characteristic life form spectra and plant formations.
   In this paper, as a first step of a comprehensive phytochorological analysis, phytochoria and their limits are proposed as derived from frequently observed areas of distribution, while a numerical analysis of the complete flora of these phytochoria is in preparation.
   Considering with emphasis the flora of zonal habitats (Walter 1986), two major phytochorological units are recognized:
   1. The Succulent Karoo Region (Greater Cape Flora) 1.1 Namaqualand-Namib Domain 1.2 Southern Karoo Domain 2. The Nama Karoo Region (Palaeotropis) 2.1 Namaland Domain 2.2 Eastern Karoo Domain 2.3 Damaraland-Kaokoland Domain

   DERIVATION; SEQUENCES; SELECTION; ANIMALS; CARIDEA
AB Growing evidence points out that the capacity of organisms to acclimate or adapt to new habitat conditions basically depends on their phenomic plasticity attributes, of which their gut commensal microbiota might be an essential impact factor. Especially in aquatic organisms, which are in direct and continual contact with the aquatic environment, the complex and dynamic microbiota have significant effects on health and development. However, an understanding of the relative contribution of internal sorting (host genetic) and colonization (environmental) processes is still unclear. To understand how microbial communities differ in response to rapid environmental change, we surveyed and studied the environmental and gut microbiota of native and habitat-exchanged shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Corresponding with microbial diversity of their living water areas, the divergence in gut microbes of lake-to-river shrimp (CK) increased, while that of river-to-lake shrimp (KC) decreased. Importantly, among the candidate environment specific gut microbes in habitat-exchanged shrimp, over half of reads were associated with the indigenous bacteria in native shrimp gut, yet more candidates presented in CK may reflect the complexity of new environment. Our results suggest that shrimp gut microbiota has high plasticity when its host faces environmental changes, even over short timescales. Further, the changes in external environment might influence the gut microbiome not just by providing environment-associated microbes directly, but also by interfering with the composition of indigenous gut bacteria indirectly.

AB Interactions among species, which range from competition to facilitation, have profound effects on ecosystem functioning. Large carnivores are of particular importance in shaping community structure since they are at the top of the food chain, and many efforts are made to conserve such keystone species. Despite this, the mechanisms of carnivore interactions are far from understood, yet they are key to enabling or hindering their coexistence and hence are highly relevant for their conservation. The goal of this review is thus to provide detailed information on the extents of competition and facilitation between large carnivores and their impact in shaping their life histories. Here, we use the example of spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta) and lions (Panthera leo) and provide a comprehensive knowledge of their interactions based on meta-analyses from available literature (148 publications). Despite their strong potential for both exploitation and interference competition (range and diet overlap, intraguild predation and kleptoparasitism), we underline some mechanisms facilitating their coexistence (different prey-age selection and scavenging opportunities). We stress the fact that prey abundance is key to their coexistence and that hyaenas forming very large groups in rich ecosystems could have a negative impact on lions. We show that the coexistence of spotted hyaenas and lions is a complex balance between competition and facilitation, and that prey availability within the ecosystem determines which predator is dominant. However, there are still many gaps in our knowledge such as the spatio-temporal dynamics of their interactions. As both species' survival becomes increasingly dependent on protected areas, where their densities can be high, it is critical to understand their interactions to inform both reintroduction programs and protected area management.

AB In this study, the intestinal microbiota of Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) was examined by molecular analysis of the 16S rDNA. The aims of the study were to evaluate the use of molecular-based techniques, Polymerase Chain Reaction/Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and clone library analyses, and compare the results obtained by the two methods. Total DNA was extracted from the intestine of Chinese shrimp. Then population fingerprints of the predominant microbiota were generated by DGGE analysis of universal V3 16S rDNA PCR amplicons, and 22 distinct bands from DGGE were sequenced. In addition, bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with universal bacterial primers 27F and 1387R. Amplicons were ligated into cloning vectors and near-full-length 16S rRNA gene inserts were analyzed. A clone library was constructed and 72 clones were sequenced. The results suggested that PCR DGGE and clone library analysis were effective techniques for monitoring and analyzing the intestinal microbial diversity of Chinese shrimp. The two different molecular biological methods gave similar results, but clone library analysis was more representative of the community to some extent. According to the two methods, Vibrio sp. was the predominant bacterial population in the intestine of Chinese shrimp. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In South American temperate rainforests, five endemic understory birds (four Rhinocryptidae and one Furnariidae) are often associated with the main understory plant, the native bamboo Chusquea valdiviensis (Poaceae: Bambusoideae). We studied the effects of bamboo cover on species abundance and richness of those understory birds and explored the functions of bamboo as food resource and escape cover. In Chiloe Island (42degreesS), southern Chile, we selected four old-growth forest patches >100 ha and in each patch conducted bird surveys in six plots with >70% understory cover. Three plots were dominated by native bamboo and three plots had a sparse bamboo cover. Bird abundance (point counts) was significantly correlated with both total understory cover and percentage of bamboo cover but was not correlated with other kinds of understory plant cover. Bird species richness was positively correlated with bamboo cover and negatively correlated with other kinds of understory cover but unrelated to total understory cover. Leaf-gleaners Magellanic Tapaculos (Scytalopus magellanicus), Ochre-flanked Tapaculos (Eugralla paradoxa), and Des Murs's Wiretails (Sylviorthorhynchus desmursii), and the ground-gleaner Chucao Tapaculos (Scelorchilus rubecula) were more abundant in high-bamboo plots; but the ground-gleaner Black-throated Huet-huet (Pteroptochos tarnii) was recorded more times in plots with low-bamboo cover.
   Availability of invertebrates per unit of understory dry mass did not differ between high- and low-bamboo plots; but plant biomass was greater in high-bamboo plots, so total invertebrate abundance per plot was higher there. Ground-litter invertebrate abundance was similar in all plots. To examine escape-cover preferences, nine captured Chucao Tapaculos were released in front of two different understory scenarios (high-bamboo cover or bamboo-free understory); 88% of released birds moved into bamboo cover. We suggest that the structure of native bamboo understory is critical for the maintenance of four of those species, and retaining bamboo cover in managed stands may help minimize the effect of logging on understory birds.

AB In this paper the current status of coral reefs, predictions concerning the ecological state of coral reefs to the 2025 time horizon and the research needs that can help understanding and management activities that might alleviate detrimental ecological changes are evaluated and discussed. The present rate of CO2 emissions will produce an atmospheric concentration in 100 years not experienced during the past 20 million years and water temperatures above those of the past interglacial 130 000 years before present. Human influences on water temperatures, seawater chemistry (toxic substances, nutrients and aragonite saturation), the spread of diseases, removal of species and food web alterations are presently changing reef ecology. A significant ecological reorganization is underway and changes include a reduction in calcifying and zooxanthellae-hosting organisms, their obligate symbionts, and species at higher trophic levels, with an increase in generalist species of low trophic level that are adapted to variable environments. Late-successional fleshy brown algae of low net productivity or non-commercial invertebrates such as sea urchins, starfish and coral-eating snails will dominate many reefs. These changes will be associated with a loss of both net benthic and fisheries production and inorganic carbonate deposition; this will reduce reef complexity, species richness, reef growth and increase shoreline erosion. To avert these changes management is needed at both global and local levels. Both levels need to reduce greenhouse gases and other waste emissions and renew efforts to improve resource management including restrictions on the use of resources and globalization of resource trade, run-off and waste production, and balancing potential reef production and resource consumption.

AB Alexander von Humboldt is a key figure in the history of ecology and biogeography who contributed to shape what is today ecology, as well as the environmentalist movement. His observation that the world's vegetation varies systematically with climate was one of his many contributions to science. Here, we question to what extent Humboldt's view biased our vision of nature. The current emphasis on the role of climate and soils in ecological and evolutionary studies, and the emphasis on forests as the potential and most important vegetation, suggests that we still view nature through the eyes of Humboldt. Over the last 20 years, diverse studies have shown that many open non-forested ecosystems (savannas, grasslands, and shrublands) cannot be predicted by climate and are ancient and diverse systems maintained by fire and/or vertebrate herbivory. Paleoecological and phylogenetic studies have shown the key role of these plant consumers at geological time scales. This has major implications for how we understand and manage our ecosystems. Synthesis. We need to consciously probe the long-standing idea that climate and soils are the only major factors shaping broad-scale patterns in nature. We propose to move beyond the legacy of Humboldt by embracing fire and large mammal herbivory as additional key factors in explaining the ecology and evolution of world vegetation.

AB New climate change agreements emerging from the 21st Conference of the Parties and ambitious international commitments to implement forest and landscape restoration (FLR) are generating unprecedented political awareness and financial mobilization to restore forests at large scales on deforested or degraded land. Restoration interventions aim to increase functionality and resilience of landscapes, conserve biodiversity, store carbon, and mitigate effects of global climate change. We propose four principles to guide tree planting schemes focused on carbon storage and commercial forestry in the tropics in the context of FLR. These principles support activities and land uses that increase tree cover in human-modified landscapes, while also achieving positive socioecological outcomes at local scales, in an appropriate contextualization: (1) restoration interventions should enhance and diversify local livelihoods; (2) afforestation should not replace native tropical grasslands or savanna ecosystems; (3) reforestation approaches should promote landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity; and (4) residual carbon stocks should be quantitatively and qualitatively distinguished from newly established carbon stocks. The emerging global restoration movement and its growing international support provide strong momentum for increasing tree and forest cover in mosaic landscapes. The proposed principles help to establish a platform for FLR implementation and monitoring based on a broad set of socioenvironmental benefits including, but not solely restricted, to carbon mitigation and wood production.

TI The global distribution of ammonia emissions from seabird colonies
SO ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Coastal nitrogen; Seabird colony; Bioenergetic modelling; Emission map;
   Temperature; Climate change
AB Seabird colonies represent a significant source of atmospheric ammonia (NH3) in remote maritime systems, producing a source of nitrogen that may encourage plant growth, alter terrestrial plant community composition and affect the surrounding marine ecosystem. To investigate seabird NH3 emissions on a global scale, we developed a contemporary seabird database including a total seabird population of 261 million breeding pairs. We used this in conjunction with a bioenergetics model to estimate the mass of nitrogen excreted by all seabirds at each breeding colony. The results combined with the findings of mid-latitude field studies of volatilization rates estimate the global distribution of NH3 emissions from seabird colonies on an annual basis. The largest uncertainty in our emission estimate concerns the potential temperature dependence of NH3 emission. To investigate this we calculated and compared temperature independent emission estimates with a maximum feasible temperature dependent emission, based on the thermodynamic dissociation and solubility equilibria. Using the temperature independent approach, we estimate global NH3 emissions from seabird colonies at 404 Gg NH3 per year. By comparison, since most seabirds are located in relatively cold circumpolar locations, the thermodynamically dependent estimate is 136 Gg NH3 per year. Actual global emissions are expected to be within these bounds, as other factors, such as non-linear interactions with water availability and surface infiltration, moderate the theoretical temperature response. Combining sources of error from temperature (+/- 49%), seabird population estimates (+/- 36%), variation in diet composition (+/- 23%) and non-breeder attendance (+/- 13%), gives a mid estimate with an overall uncertainty range of NH3 emission from seabird colonies of 270 [97-442] Gg NH3 per year. These emissions are environmentally relevant as they primarily occur as "hot-spots" in otherwise pristine environments with low anthropogenic emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation classification is a useful tool for basic and applied research as well as for environmental management. As classification of vegetation serves many different purposes, there is no single approach to defining vegetation types. Establishing formalized standard procedures is desirable, however, because the purposes and uses of vegetation classifications are similar in different countries and regions. With the aim of promoting methodological standardization in classification across countries and vegetation scientists, this manuscript is centered on two ideas: (1) the need to explicitly distinguish between the conceptual activities involved in the definition of vegetation types (membership determination, characterization, validation and naming); and (2) the need to perform assignments of new vegetation observations to previously defined vegetation types in accordance with how these types were originally defined, a concept that we refer to as consistency in assignment. We demonstrate that our conceptual framework provides a useful tool to better understand what classification methods do. In order to manage and use classifications in a better way, vegetation scientists should produce, store and report the rules that provide consistent assignments to vegetation types.

AB Large mammalian herbivores significantly alter the functioning of a range of ecosystems worldwide. One family of herbivores in particular, deer (Cervidae), have become widespread throughout temperate regions over the last century. Culling is frequently used to reduce the ecological impacts of deer, but recent studies demonstrate that the recovery of herbivore-disturbed vegetation is often a protracted process on the order of decades. Here, we ask why increases in deer-preferred plants occur slowly following culling and what generalities can inform management of the responses of vegetation to deer culling? Vegetation changes following deer population reduction may be slow because of the: (i) slow growth rate of plants relative to the amount of biomass consumed by herbivores; (ii) depletion of seed sources of deer-preferred plants; (iii) formation of alternate vegetation types under high deer browsing; (iv) preferential browsing of forage even under low deer densities; (v) variation in browse damage of deer-preferred species with plant community composition (e.g. associational resistance or susceptibility); (vi) suppression of trophic cascades; and (vii) changes in abiotic conditions associated with other ecological processes. Managers can accelerate recovery through different active management strategies that directly address the reasons behind slow recovery. However, while the ecology behind the impacts of deer, and to a certain extent their mitigation, are largely understood, a significant obstacle to achieving recovery often lies in implementing science-based management recommendations, e.g. culling, and their societal acceptance. Bridging the science-policy-practice gap requires that applied ecologists share common language and values with policymakers and the public. Recovery may hinge as much on bridging this communication gap as on improving our ecological understanding of deer impacts and ecosystem recovery. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim We explored morphological and ecophysiological traits that enable invasive Australian acacias to compete with native species for resources (light, water and nutrients) necessary to support the substantial growth associated with successful invasions.
   Location Global.
   Results Invasive Australian acacias grow large and seed prolifically in invaded regions. The greater capacity for vegetative growth is underpinned by their ability to acquire and efficiently use resources in non-native habitats. Key biological traits that enhance acquisition include (1) rapid and substantial allocation to root mass (up to 6-fold more than co-occurring native species) directed towards deep roots (at least 50% longer than those of natives) and to extensive shallow root networks; (2) heteroblasty, in most species, conferring high relative growth rates as bipinnate seedlings but long-lived, nutrient-conserving phyllodes as adults and (3) strong N-2-fixation abilities.
   Main conclusions The ecophysiological traits that govern the competitive interaction of invasive Australian acacias with native species are an important component of the recognized suite of factors including introduction history, human use and enemy release that combine to produce successful invasions. Traits interact to give Australian acacias competitive advantage over many native species. One such interaction is that of N-2 fixation, which when coupled with slow decomposition of sclerophyllous phyllodes results in alteration of soil nutrient cycling. The lasting legacy of soil N-enrichment hinders the competitive ability of native species and further enhances invasions. The importance of edaphic factors and competitive interactions in determining invasive success should be considered in predictive modelling of species distributions.

AB Island biogeography theory predicts that species richness increases with habitat area and declines with isolation. We expand this framework to address changes in the number of links and species in pollination webs from 12 isolated hills, ranging in area from tens to thousands of hectares, immersed in the agriculture matrix of the Argentine Pampas. We also studied whether total interaction frequency is partitioned more evenly among individual links in richer webs. Our results reveal a direct effect of area on the number of links and species present in each pollination web. However, link richness increased twofold faster than species richness with area. These area effects were not confounded by sampling effort or correlated incidence of exotic species, despite widespread habitat disturbance. Habitat proximity, an inverse measure of isolation, had a marginally significant influence on link but not on species richness. Increased link number was associated with decreasing dominance by any particular interaction and increasing interaction evenness. Despite the strong area effect, a rich pollination web sampled from a small, protected sierra suggests that simple conservation measures, such as reduced grazing and fire suppression, may effectively preserve much local interaction diversity.

AB Habitat perturbations play a major role in shaping community structure; however, the elements of disturbance-related habitat change that affect diversity are not always apparent. This study examined the effects of habitat disturbances on species richness of coral reef fish assemblages using annual surveys of habitat and 210 fish species from 10 reefs on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Over a period of 11 years, major disturbances, including localised outbreaks of crown-of-thorns sea star (Acanthaster planci), severe storms or coral bleaching, resulted in coral decline of 46-96% in all the 10 reefs. Despite declines in coral cover, structural complexity of the reef framework was retained on five and species richness of coral reef fishes maintained on nine of the disturbed reefs. Extensive loss of coral resulted in localised declines of highly specialised coral-dependent species, but this loss of diversity was more than compensated for by increases in the number of species that feed on the epilithic algal matrix (EAM). A unimodal relationship between areal coral cover and species richness indicated species richness was greatest at approximately 20% coral cover declining by 3-4 species (6-8% of average richness) at higher and lower coral cover. Results revealed that declines in coral cover on reefs may have limited short-term impact on the diversity of coral reef fishes, though there may be fundamental changes in the community structure of fishes.

AB Grazing lawns are characteristic for African savanna grasslands, standing out as intensely grazed patches of stoloniferous grazing-tolerant grass species. Grazing lawn development has been associated with grazing and increased nutrient input by large migratory herds. However, we argue that in systems without mass migrations disturbances, other than direct grazing, drive lawn development. Such disturbances, e.g. termite activity or megaherbivore middens, also increase nutrient input and keep the bunch vegetation down for a prolonged time period. However, field observations show that not all such disturbances lead to grazing lawns. We hypothesize that the initial disturbance has to be of a minimal threshold spatial scale, for grazing intensity to be high enough to induce lawn formation. We experimentally tested this idea in natural tall savanna grassland. We mowed different-sized plots to simulate initial disturbances of different scales (six times during one year) and applied fertilizer to half of the plots during two years to simulate increased nutrient input by herbivores or termite activity. Allowing grazing by naturally occurring herbivores, we followed the vegetation development over more than three years. Grazing kept bunch grass short in coarser, fertilized plots, while grasses grew out toward their initial height in fine-scale and unfertilized plots. Moreover, lawn grasses strongly increased in cover in plots with an increased nutrient input but only after coarser scale disturbance. These results support our hypothesis that an increased nutrient input in combination with grazing indeed induces grazing lawn formation, but only above a threshold scale of the initial disturbance. Our results provide an alternative mechanism for the development of grazing lawns in systems that lack mass migrating herds. Moreover, it gives a new spatial dimension to the processes behind grazing lawn development, and hence help to understand how herbivores might create and maintain spatial heterogeneity in grassland systems.

AB This paper presents an historical analysis (1974-97) of associations between land-cover change and socio-economic factors for three villages in a former bantustan region of South Africa. The notion of social-ecological systems is used as the conceptual framework for this analysis, in which the former bantustan region of Bushbuckridge is posited as a cultural landscape. The local landscape showed distinctive modifications over the study period, broad trends including the growth of human settlements and the decrease in woodland cover. However, changes were not uniform across sites, and the direction and magnitude of changes in land cover were often nonlinear and site-specific. Analysis of associations between biophysical and socio-economic changes at different scales revealed a range of important interacting forces such as population growth, drought, shortages of land, grazing and wood resources, weakening institutional governance of natural resources, and the diversification of livelihood strategies, including the sale of fuelwood, concurrent with declining employment security and cattle ownership. Evidence suggests a possible erosion of resilience in these social-ecological systems at various scales, with important implications for socio-economic development and sustainable resource management.

AB Amphibians in general are considered poor dispersers and thus their dispersal curve should be dominated by short movements. Additionally, as male toads do not compete for females and sexual selection is by female choice, dispersal should be male-biased. Furthermore, since adults are site-loyal and polygynous, juveniles should move farther and faster than adults. We tested the hypotheses that dispersal would be limited and both sex- and age-biased in a population of Fowler's toads Bufo fowleri at Lake Erie, Ontario, Canada. Based on a mark-recapture study of 2816 toads, 1326 recaptured at least once, we found that although the toads did show high site fidelity, the dispersal curve was highly skewed with a significant "tail" where the maximum distance moved by an adult was 34 km. Dispersal was neither sex-biased nor age-biased despite clear theoretical predictions that dispersal should be biased towards males and juveniles. We conclude that the resource competition hypothesis of sex-biased dispersal does not predict dispersal tendencies as readily for amphibians as for mammals and birds. Toad dispersal only appears to be juvenile-biased because the juveniles are more abundant than the adults, not because they are the more active dispersers.

AB The present paper aims at identifying and assessing indicators of the effects of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in coral reef regions, based on a bibliography review in ecology, economics and social sciences. First the various effects Studied within each of these domains and the variables used to measure them were censused. Potential ecological indicators were assessed through their link with the question used (here termed "relevance") and their "effectiveness" which encompasses the issues of precision, accuracy and statistical power. Relevance and effectiveness were respectively measured by the frequency of use of each indicator and the proportion of significant results in the reviewed articles. For social and economic effects, the approach was not possible due to the low number of references: we thus discussed the issue of finding appropriate indicators for those fields. Results indicate: 1- the unbalance in literature between disciplines: 2- the need for protocols and methodologies which include controls in order to assess MPA effects: 3- an important proportion of ecological indicators with low effectiveness: 4- the large number of ecological effects still not studied or not demonstrated at present.

AB Sex allocation theory predicts that mothers in good condition should bias their brood sex ratio in response to the differential benefits obtained from increased maternal expenditure in sons and daughters. Although there is well-documented variation of offspring sex ratios in several bird species according to maternal condition, the assumption that maternal condition has different fitness consequences for male and for female offspring remains unclear. The blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii) is a sexually size-dimorphic seabird, with females approximately 31% heavier than males. It has been reported that the sex ratio is male biased in years with poor feeding conditions, which suggests that either females adjust their sex ratio in accordance with their condition or that they suffer differential brood mortality before their sex can be determined. In this study I tested whether the condition of mothers affected their daughters' fitness more than their sons' fitness. I manipulated maternal investment by trimming the flight feathers and thereby handicapping females during the chick-rearing period. Adult females in the handicapped group had a poorer physical condition at end of chick growth, as measured by mass and by the residuals of mass on wing length compared to control birds. Female chicks were affected by the handicapping experiment, showing a lower mass and shorter wing length (reduced approximately 8% in both measures) than controls. However, this effect was not found in male chicks. Hatching sex ratios were also related to female body condition at hatching. The brood sex ratio of females in poor condition was male biased but was female biased for females in good condition. Overall, these results suggest that the variation in the sex ratio in blue-footed boobies is an adaptive response to the disadvantage daughters face from being reared under poor conditions.

AB The non-native tree species Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) from N America and Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle) from E Asia are invading both anthropogenic and near-natural habitats throughout Europe. So far, few studies have focused on their invasion into forests and none has addressed the influence of coppice management, which is characterized through regular clear-cuts. To retrace the invasion during the last 50 years, we studied the abundance in the canopy as well as the natural regeneration of these species in the coppice forest of Gargazon (South Tyrol, Northern Italy), which was ideal due to its patchy mosaic of different forest age (time since last coppicing). We analyzed which factors favor the presence and abundance of A. altissima and R. pseudoacacia regeneration. Tree saplings were sampled on 113 plots each measuring 7 m(2) in a total study area of 25.5 hectares. On each plot, the following environmental variables were recorded: canopy cover per species, total herb layer cover, distance to clearing, stone cover, slope, and aspect. Soil moisture was derived from herbaceous indicator species. Hurdle models were used for data analysis to account for the zero-inflated data structure. The results showed that R. pseudoacacia has established earlier in the studied forest than A. altissima, but A. altissima has been spreading with higher speed during the last 30 years. Our study exemplifies the invasion of both species synchronously to the coppice cycle, that means they colonize fresh clear-cuts, establish, and remain. We conclude that the currently applied coppice management, which consists of repeated clear cuttings each 20-30 years, favors the spread of both invasive species. Thus, an adaptation of the management system is needed to avoid further invasion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent decades have seen substantial expansions in the global air travel network and rapid increases in traffic volumes. The effects of this are well studied in terms of the spread of directly transmitted infections, but the role of air travel in the movement of vector-borne diseases is less well understood. Increasingly however, wider reaching surveillance for vector-borne diseases and our improving abilities to map the distributions of vectors and the diseases they carry, are providing opportunities to better our understanding of the impact of increasing air travel. Here we examine global trends in the continued expansion of air transport and its impact upon epidemiology. Novel malaria and chikungunya examples are presented, detailing how geospatial data in combination with information on air traffic can be used to predict the risks of vector-borne disease importation and establishment. Finally, we describe the development of an online tool, the Vector-Borne Disease Airline Importation Risk (VBD-Air) tool, which brings together spatial data on air traffic and vector-borne disease distributions to quantify the seasonally changing risks for importation to non-endemic regions. Such a framework provides the first steps towards an ultimate goal of adaptive management based on near real time flight data and vector-borne disease surveillance.

AB Widespread reports of low pollination rates suggest a recent anthropogenic decline in pollination that could threaten natural and agricultural ecosystems. Nevertheless, unequivocal evidence for a decline in pollination over time has remained elusive because it was not possible to determine historical pollination rates. Here we demonstrate a widely applicable method for reconstructing historical pollination rates, thus allowing comparison with contemporary rates from the same sites. We focused on the relationship between the oil-collecting bee Rediviva peringueyi (Melittidae) and the guild of oil-secreting orchid species (Coryciinae) that depends on it for pollination. The guild is distributed across the highly transformed and fragmented lowlands of the Cape Region of South Africa. We show that rehydrated herbarium specimens of Pterygodium catholicum, the most abundant member of the guild, contain a record of past pollinator activity in the form of pollinarium removal rates. Analysis of a pollination time series showed a recent decline in pollination on Signal Hill, a small urban conservation area. The same herbaria contain historical species occurrence data. We analyzed this data and found that there has been a contemporaneous shift in orchid guild composition in urban areas due to the local extirpation of the non-clonal species, consistent with their greater dependence on seeds and pollination for population persistence.

AB We studied the effects of a lactic acid bacterium, Pediococcus acidilactici (strain MA 18/5M, CNCM), as a dietary probiotic on growth performance and some nutritional and microbiological aspects of the shrimp Litopenaeus stylirostris. Experimental shrimp culture was carried out over 10 weeks, using floating cages of 14 m(2) each set in earthen ponds, in a New Caledonia farm affected by "Summer syndrome", a septicaemic vibriosis caused by Vibrio nigripulchritudo. The experiment design testing probiotic-coated pellets against control was replicated in two earthen ponds. High mortalities, characteristic of Summer syndrome, were observed during the first 2 weeks of the trial. The probiotic improved production in the treated cages from both ponds with increases in the survival rate (7% and 15% respectively) and final biomass (8% and 12% respectively). No differences were recorded among treatments on growth performances, but significant lower food conversion ratios were obtained with probiotic treatment. After 5 weeks of rearing, the Hepatosomatic Index and the adjusted dry weight of the digestive gland were significantly increased by 10% and by 9% respectively in shrimps treated with probiotic. In the meantime, the specific activities of alpha amylase and trypsin in the digestive gland showed a significant effect of the probiotic treatment with respective increases by 35% and 55%. The rise in total trypsin activity following morning feeding was also enhanced by the probiotic treatment (P < 0.001).
   The highest concentration of probiotic (between 10(4)-10(5) CFU g(-1) of fresh gut) in the shrimp gut was obtained 2 h after feeding. The concentration remained high for 4 h after feeding before decreasing until the next meal. Total bacterial counts on Marine agar and TCBS in the gut were significantly lowered by the probiotic treatment over the 10 weeks of the experiment. Additionally, during the first 2 weeks, prevalence and load of V nigripulchritudo strains in haemolymph was lower in animals fed with the probiotic diet.
   This study demonstrated, under pond conditions, that feeding shrimp with live terrestrial lactic acid bacteria can be an effective treatment for improving shrimp culture affected by vibriosis. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although dispersal distances of marine larvae influence gene flow and the establishment of population structure, few data on realized dispersal distances exist for marine species. We combined otolith microstructure and micro chemistry of black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) to assess their potential to provide relative estimates of larval dispersal distance. In 2001 and 2002 we measured trace elements at discrete otolith regions, representing the (i) egg/early-larval, (ii) pelagic larval, and (iii) late-larval/early-juvenile periods of fish collected at three locations 120-460 km apart. Discriminant-function analyses based on geochemical signatures at each otolith region accurately grouped an average of 85% (jackknife = 67%) and 87% (jackknife = 81%) of the fish to collection location in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Age at collection ranged from 83 to 174 days and parturition dates within each site were spread over a 22- to 66-day period. Therefore, individuals within sites were not released at similar times. A probable explanation of these data is that larvae from different geographic locations did not mix during ontogeny and possibly did not disperse long distances alongshore. Larval dispersal distances may be appreciably shorter, <120 km, than previously assumed based on models of passive dispersal.

TI Alien plant invasions in South Africa: driving forces and the human

AB Invasive alien plants pose a substantial threat to the rich biodiversity of South Africa, and to the sustained delivery of a wide range of ecosystem services. Biological invasions are driven by human activities and mediated by culturally shaped values and ethics. This paper explores the human dimensions of alien plant invasions in South Africa. We consider four primary forces, those which directly influence the likelihood and rate of invasion - arrival of propagules; changes in disturbance regimes; changes in the availability of limiting factors; and fragmentation of the landscape - and the roles of 22 secondary driving forces in shaping the outcomes of the four primary driving forces. Human societies and their dynamics and activities are an integral part of each of the secondary driving forces. A map of the interactions between and among the primary and secondary driving forces shows how they are interlinked and influence each other-either positively or negatively, or switching between the two. There are two key points for intervention: prevention of the introduction of propagules of potentially invasive species and developing collaborative initiatives with enterprises that rely largely on alien species (for example, horticulture, agriculture and forestry, including community forestry) to minimize the introduction and use of potentially invasive species. An example of the first type of intervention would be to implement more effective inspection systems at international border and customs posts. This type of intervention can only be effective if those who are directly affected-whether businessmen, tourists or migrants - understand the requirement for these measures, and collaborate. The need to build public awareness of the critical importance of the human dimension of invasions emerges as a key theme from this analysis and is the basis for better-informed decisions, more effective control programmes and a reduction of further invasions.

TI ALGINATE DEGRADATION BY BACTERIA ISOLATED FROM THE GUT OF SEA-URCHINS

ID MICROFLORA; SEQUENCE; LYASES; ALGAE
AB Degradation of alginate and its constituents, polymannuronate (polyM) and polyguluronate (polyG), by gut bacteria isolated from sea urchins and abalones in the northern part of Japan, were investigated. Bacterial counts in the guts of sea urchin S. intermedius, were 10(5) to 10(8) CFU/g, and in abalone H. discus hannai, counts ranged from 10(6) to 10(9) CFU/g. More than 80% of total 600 isolates were found to have alginolytic activity. The alginolytic bacteria were predominantly fermentative, but some differences were observed in their substrate specificity as well as between the flora in the gut of sea urchins and the abalones. Seventy percent of the alginolytic bacteria from the sea urchins showed no degrading preference for polyM or polyG blocks, and were able to degrade both the substrates simultaneously. Most of the alginolytic bacteria (96.6%) from sea urchins belonged to the genus Vibrio. The majority of alginolytic bacteria (68.0% on average) from abalones only degraded polyG and they were predominantly non-motile fermenters. From these results, it appeared that a different type of association exists between alginolytic gut microflora and the marine algal feeders with respect to the level of contribution by bacteria to the host's digestion of alginate.

AB This paper analyses the edaphic and biological aspects of plant endemism in floristic lists from five edaphically matched sites, and the taxonomic aspects in regional floras, from the Agulhas Plain, South Africa and the Barrens, south western Australia. The two regions are very closely matched in terms of their mediterranean-type climates, landforms, soil types and disturbance regimes. Both regions have large neo-endemic floras.
   At the flora level, the incidence of local and regional endemism was almost identical on both continents (c. 6% and 22%, respectively) and endemics were not a random assemblage taxonomically. Endemics were over-represented among taxa speciose only in Australia (e.g. Myrtaceae) and only in South Africa (e.g. Mesembryanthemaceae), as well as among taxa richly represented on both continents (Proteaceae, Ericaceae/Epacridaceae). In both regions different edaphic sites supported floristically distinct sclerophyllous shrublands. Levels of narrow endemism on the various substrata were similar on both continents, ranging from near zero on the relatively fertile calcareous sands to 30% on the highly infertile quartzites and siliceous sands. Relative to Australia, however, endemics on limestone were significantly over-represented in South Africa. On bath continents more than 90% of endemics were edaphic specialists. There were differences for the two regions in the biological profiles of endemics. South African endemics were most likely to be low shrubs with soil-stored and ant-dispersed seed. Australian endemics were concentrated among low to medium height shrubs with either canopy-stored or soil-stored seed. Differential diversification of lineages with different ecological traits probably accounts for these different profiles. Nonetheless, the strong overall similar ities in patterns of endemism on the two continents suggests similar speciation histories in phylogenetically distantly related floras.

   analysis
AB Background: Population connectivity, which is essential for the persistence of benthic marine metapopulations, depends on how life history traits and the environment interact to influence larval production, dispersal and survival. Although we have made significant advances in our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of these individual processes, developing an approach that integrates the entire population connectivity process from reproduction, through dispersal, and to the recruitment of individuals has been difficult. We present a population connectivity modelling framework and diagnostic approach for quantifying the impact of i) life histories, ii) demographics, iii) larval dispersal, and iv) the physical seascape, on the structure of connectivity and metapopulation dynamics. We illustrate this approach using the subtidal rocky reef ecosystem of Port Phillip Bay, were we provide a broadly-applicable framework of population connectivity and quantitative methodology for evaluating the relative importance of individual factors in determining local and system outcomes.
   Results: The spatial characteristics of marine population connectivity are primarily influenced by larval mortality, the duration of the pelagic larval stage, and the settlement competency characteristics, with significant variability imposed by the geographic setting and the timing of larval release. The relative influence and the direction and strength of the main effects were strongly consistent among 10 connectivity-based metrics.
   Conclusions: These important intrinsic factors (mortality, length of the pelagic larval stage, and the extent of the precompetency window) and the spatial and temporal variability represent key research priorities for advancing our understanding of the connectivity process and metapopulation outcomes.

AB Acacia dealbata Link (Fabaceae) is one of the most invasive species in the Mediterranean ecosystems of Europe, Africa and America, where it has been proved to exert strong effects on soil and plant communities. In Italy A. dealbata has been largely used for ornamental and forestry purpose and is nowadays spreading in several areas. The present study was addressed to evaluate the impacts on soil chemical properties, soil microbial communities and understory plant communities and to assess the relationships among these compartments after the invasion of A. dealbata in a typical Mediterranean shrubland.
   Towards these aims, a soil and vegetation sampling was performed in Elba Island where A. dealbata is invading the sderophyllous native vegetation. Three levels of invasion status were differentiated according to the gradient from invaded, to transitional and non-invaded vegetation.
   Quantitative and qualitative alterations of soil chemical properties and microbial communities (i.e. bacterial and fungal communities) and above-ground understoty plant communities were found. In particular, the invaded soils had lower pH values than both the non-invaded and transitional ones. High differences were detected for both the total N and the inorganic fraction (NH4+ and NO3-) contents, which showed the ranking: invaded > transitional > non-invaded soils. TOC and C/N ratio showed respectively higher and lower values in invaded than in non-invaded soils. Total plant covers, species richness and diversity in both the non-invaded and transitional subplots were higher than those in the invaded ones. The contribution of the nitrophilous species was significantly different among the three invasion statuses, with a strong increase going from native to transitional and invaded subplots. All these data confirm that A. dealbata modifies several compartments of the invaded ecosystems, from soil chemical properties to soil and plant microbial communities determining strong changes in the local ecosystem processes.

AB The precarious state of many nearshore marine ecosystems has prompted the use of marine protected areas as a tool for management and conservation. However, there remains substantial debate over their design and, in particular, how to best account for the spatial dynamics of nearshore marine species. Many commercially important nearshore marine species are sedentary as adults, with limited home ranges. It is as larvae that they disperse greater distances, traveling with ocean currents sometimes hundreds of kilometers. As a result, these species exist in spatially complex systems of connected subpopulations. Here, we explicitly account for the mutual dependence of subpopulations and approach protected area design in terms of network robustness. Our goal is to characterize the topology of nearshore metapopulation networks and their response to perturbation, and to identify critical subpopulations whose protection would reduce the risk for stock collapse. We define metapopulation networks using realistic estimates of larval dispersal generated from ocean circulation simulations and spatially explicit metapopulation models, and we then explore their robustness using node-removal simulation experiments. Nearshore metapopulations show small-world network properties, and we identify a set of highly connected hub subpopulations whose removal maximally disrupts the metapopulation network. Protecting these subpopulations reduces the risk for systemic failure and stock collapse. Our focus on catastrophe avoidance provides a unique perspective for spatial marine planning and the design of marine protected areas.

AB P> Savanna ecosystems - defined by the coexistence of trees and grasses - cover more than one-fifth the world's land surface and harbour most of the world's rangelands, livestock and large mammal diversity. Savanna trees can have a variety of effects on grasses, with consequences for the wild and domestic herbivores that depend on them.
   Studies of these effects have focused on two different spatial scales. At the scale of individual trees, many studies have shown net positive effects of trees on sub-canopy grass nutrient concentrations and biomass. At the landscape scale, other studies have shown negative effects of high tree densities on grass productivity. These disparate results have led to different conclusions about the effects of trees on forage quality and ungulate nutrition in savannas.
   We integrate these approaches by examining the effects of trees on grasses at both spatial scales and across a range of landscape-scale tree densities. We quantified grass biomass, species composition and nutrient concentrations in these different contexts in an Acacia drepanolobium savanna in Laikipia, Kenya.
   Individual trees had positive effects on grass biomass, most likely because trees enrich soil nitrogen. Grass leaf phosphorus in sub-canopy areas, however, was depressed. The effects of individual trees could explain the effects of increasing landscape-scale tree cover for the biomass of only two of the four dominant grass species.
   The negative effects of trees on grass and soil phosphorus, combined with depressed grass productivity in areas of high tree cover, suggest that ungulate nutrition may be compromised in areas with many trees.
   Synthesis. We conclude that few, isolated trees may have positive local effects on savanna grasses and forage, but in areas of high tree density the negative landscape-scale effects of trees are likely to outweigh these positive effects. In savannas and other patchy landscapes, attempts to predict the consequences of changes in patch abundances for ecosystem services (e.g. rangeland productivity and carbon sequestration) will depend on our understanding of the extent to which local, patch-scale dynamics do or do not predict landscape-scale dynamics.

AB Caladenia is very unusual in that it contains species that attract pollinators by two different strategies, food and sexual deception. Among the sexually deceptive species, baiting for pollinators has shown that within populations orchid species are typically pollinated by a single species of thynnine wasp. However, some wasp species can be pollinators of more than one species of orchid usually when their ranges do not overlap. There is a trend for closely related orchids to exploit wasps from the same genus, with different lineages of orchids often pollinated by different genera. Very little is known about pollination of food-deceptive Caladenia species, although it is evident they attract a suite of generalist food-seeking insects. Food-deceptive species have a higher pollination rate than do sexually deceptive species. Studies of population genetics and pollen movements are few, although they suggest a pattern of fine-scale genetic structuring within populations, owing to predominantly restricted seed dispersal and low genetic differentiation among populations as a consequence of rare long-distance seed-dispersal events. Both evolutionary and ecological research of Caladenia will greatly benefit from a better understanding of the insect species involved in pollination, their ecological requirements and the ecological and genetic consequences of food and sexual deception.

AB Droughts can have serious ecological and economic consequences and will pose an increasing challenge to rangeland users as the global climate is changing. Finding ways to reduce ecological and economic impacts of drought should thus be a major research thrust. Resilience, defined as the amount of perturbation a social or ecological system can absorb without shifting to a qualitatively different state, has emerged as a prominent concept in ecosystem ecology and more recently as a conceptual framework for understanding and managing complex social-ecological systems. This paper discusses the application and relevance of resilience to understanding and managing ecosystem change, and enhancing the capacity of land users to adapt to droughts. Drought can trigger vegetation change and factors such as grazing management can influence the likelihood of such transitions. Drought can cause differential mortality of perennial plants and this could provide an opportunity for rangeland restoration by opening up establishment sites for desirable species. The capacity of land users to cope with drought is influenced by the resilience of their agro-ecosystems, the diversity of livelihood options, access to resources and institutional support. By these criteria, current agricultural development approaches in South Africa, particularly in communal rangelands and areas of land reform, are unlikely to enhance land users' resilience to drought and other perturbations.

AB European buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica), a prevalent invasive shrub in relict woodlands throughout Northeastern Illinois, alters certain soil properties in a manner that may have importance for the long-term conservation management of these systems. We found that soil in areas of the woodland where buckthorn dominates have higher percentage of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C), modified nitrogen mineralization rates, elevated pH, and higher soil moisture than those areas where buckthorn was not present. Although there were small C:N ratio differences at two of the three sites, there was no overall difference in C:N ratios between the sites. Since the long-term management for these systems often calls for restoration to pre-invaded conditions, the likelihood that the invasive shrub is creating a legacy effect of altered ecosystems properties may call for reassessed management strategies.

AB Niche partitioning of resources by plants is believed to be a fundamental aspect of plant coexistence and biogeochemical cycles; however, measurements of the timing and location of resource use are often lacking because of the difficulties of belowground research. To measure niche partitioning of soil water by grasses, planted saplings, and trees in a mesic savanna (Kruger National Park, South Africa), we injected deuterium oxide into 102,000 points in 15, 154-m(2) plots randomly assigned to one of five depths (0-120 cm) and one of three time periods during the 2008/2009 growing season. Grasses, saplings and trees all demonstrated an exponential decline in water uptake early in the season when resources were abundant. Later in the season, when resources were scarce, grasses continued to extract the most water from the shallowest soil depths (5 cm), but saplings and trees shifted water uptake to deeper depths (30-60 cm). Saplings, in particular, rapidly established roots to at least 1 m and used these deep roots to a greater extent than grasses or trees. Helping to resolve contradictory observations of the relative importance of deep and shallow roots, our results showed that grasses, saplings and trees all extract the most water from shallow soils when it is available but that woody plants can rapidly shift water uptake to deeper soils when resources are scarce. Results highlight the importance of temporal changes in water uptake and the problems with inferring spatial and temporal partitioning of soil water uptake from root biomass measurements alone.

AB The probability of dispersal from one habitat patch to another is a key quantity in our efforts to understand and predict the dynamics of natural populations. Unfortunately, an often overlooked property of this potential connectivity is that it may change with time. In the marine realm, transient landscape features, such as mesoscale eddies and alongshore jets, produce potential connectivity that is highly variable in time. We assess the impact of this temporal variability by comparing simulations of nearshore metapopulation dynamics when potential connectivity is constant through time (i.e., when it is deterministic) and when it varies in time (i.e., when it is stochastic). We use mathematical analysis to reach general conclusions and realistic biophysical modeling to determine the actual magnitude of these changes for a specific system: nearshore marine species in the Southern California Bight. We find that in general the temporal variability of potential connectivity affects two important quantities: metapopulation growth rates when the species is rare and equilibrium abundances. Our biophysical models reveal that stochastic outcomes are almost always lower than their deterministic counterparts, sometimes by up to 40%. This has implications for how we use spatial information, such as connectivity, to manage nearshore (and other) systems.

AB Grazing management is important for sustaining the productivity and health of rangelands. However, the effects of grazing management on herbage growth and species composition in the tropical savannas of northern Australia are not well known. In this eight-year study the influences of utilization rate and resting pastures from grazing on vegetation dynamics were measured at three sites in northeast Queensland, Australia. The sites had high, medium, and low soil fertility, and there were two land condition classes (States I and II) at each site. Severe drought occurred during the first four years, but above-average rainfall was received in the second half of the study. High utilization rates reduced biomass, perennial grass basal area, and ground cover. The reduction in biomass was due to both higher consumption and decreased primary production. State I condition plots at the high and medium soil fertility sites were initially dominated by decreaser perennial grasses, but these declined at all utilization levels, particularly the high rate. They were largely replaced by exotic perennial grasses. At the low fertility site there were no exotic grasses, and the decreaser grasses increased in all treatments, with the increases greatest in plots with low utilization or medium utilization plus resting. In the State II condition plots at the high and medium fertility sites, low or moderate utilization, led to an increase in both decreaser and exotic perennial grasses; with high utilization the decreaser perennial grasses declined and were replaced largely by exotic perennial grasses. This study clearly demonstrated that either conservative stocking with year-round grazing or a grazing system that includes some wet-season resting will help maintain land in a desirable state or help facilitate the transition from a less desirable ecological state to one more desirable for pastoral production and rangeland condition.

AB Tree invasions cause important conservation problems, such as changes in plant community composition, reduced regeneration rates of native species, and alteration in landscape structures. One of the most invasive tree genera in the world is Acacia (Fabaceae). In Chile, Acacia dealbata Link is distributed in the mediterranean zone, mostly associated with roadsides and anthropogenic disturbances. In this paper we address the following questions: How does A. dealbata perform across a gradient of native forest and invasive stands? Will it be capable of establishing itself in non-invaded native forests and regenerating under its own canopy in the absence of disturbances? From a contrasting viewpoint, will native species such as Cryptocarya alba (Molina) Looser and Nothofagus obliqua (Mirb.) Oerst be able to survive in an A. dealbata stand, allowing re-colonization of the invaded area? We conducted survival and growth experiments on A. dealbata seedlings in three sites near Concepcion, Chile (36 degrees S-72 degrees W) under three conditions: under Acacia stand, in a close native forest and on an intermediate matrix between these two conditions. We compared this to the performance of two native trees (Cryptocarya alba and Nothofagus obliqua). Results showed that A. dealbata and C. alba have high growth and establishment capacities within the native forest, but on the intermediate matrix only A. dealbata can grow and survive. C. alba survives at significantly higher rates than A. dealbata within Acacia stand. Nothofagus obliqua only survive at a very low rate in the native forest. Without disturbances, A. dealbata would be successful on the intermediate matrix and within native forest, while C. alba seems capable of surviving and establishing itself in invaded areas, thereby contributing to recovery and restoration of natural spaces. The interplay between Acacia dealbata and the native vegetation may show us a larger picture of how invasive species are capable of expanding even into forested ecosystems and, furthermore, how we can restore native vegetation and avoid further invasion.

AB Grazing lawns are recognized as important components of many savanna ecosystems, but there is no clarity on their origin or their stability in space and time. Some researchers believe sod nutrients control grazing lawn distributions. Others believe feedbacks created by herding mammals grazing in patches can promote the spread of grazing lawns without sod nutrient differences. This in turn is affected by rainfall and fire. We presented a simulation model that tests the conditions required for the initiation and spread of grazing lawns. Lawns were shown to develop in a homogeneous soil substrate, but only during periods of low rainfall, high grazer densities, and infrequent fires. Including heterogeneity in the model did not increase grazing lawn area but did reduce the effectiveness of frequent fires in preventing their establishment. We compared these results with conditions in a typical savanna park in Southern Africa. Running the model under current fire, grazing, and rainfall conditions reproduced the current grazing lawn proportions in the park. Using lower fire frequencies and higher grazer densities-such as were experienced in the park in the last 100 years-could more than double the proportion of grazing lawns in the park.

AB We document patterns of fruit and vertebrate abundance within an extensive, virtually undisturbed mosaic of seasonally flooded (varzea and igapo) and unflooded (terra firme) forests of central Amazonia. Using phenological surveys and a standardised series of line-transect censuses we investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of immature and mature fruit availability and how this may affect patterns of habitat use by vertebrates in the landscape. All habitats showed marked peaks in fruiting activity, and vertebrate detection rates varied over time for most species both within and between forest types. Many arboreal and terrestrial vertebrates used both types of flooded forest on a seasonal basis, and fluctuations in the abundance of terrestrial species in varzea forest were correlated with fruit availability. Similarly, the abundance of arboreal seed predators such as buffy saki monkeys (Pithecia albicans) and macaws (Ara spp.) were closely linked with immature fruit availability in terra firme forest. We conclude that highly heterogeneous landscapes consisting of terra firme, varzea and igapo forest appear to play an important role in the dynamics of many vertebrate species in lowland Amazonia, but the extent to which different forest types are used is highly variable in both space and time.

AB 1. Indigenous species of Acacia are common in African savannas that have N-rich soils. This raises doubt regarding the extent of plant dependence on N-2 -fixation. Why would Acacia spp. enjoy an advantage over other tree species on N-replete soils?
   2. We tested the hypothesis that competition by grass for nutrients would induce increased nodulation of Acacia karroo, A. nilotica, A. tortilis and A. nigrescens seedlings that would enable them to survive better than a non-nodulating congeneric species (A. ataxacantha). A glasshouse pot experiment was conducted to determine the capacity of the Acacia spp. to nodulate. The Acacia spp. were also grown in a randomized field plot experiment in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park with and without grass coexistence, and biomass accumulation and delta N-15 values were determined. We also sampled a range of legume and non-legume saplings from the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park for delta N-15 values.
   3. In the pot experiment all species, except A. ataxacantha, which is a forest margin species, nodulated and consequently had lower delta N-15 isotope values than A. ataxacantha. In the field experiment the delta N-15 values of the plants grown with grass were significantly lower (delta N-15 = 0.77 +/- 0.08 parts per thousand) than those grown without grass (delta N-15 = 5.0 +/- 0.16 parts per thousand) for all species, except A. ataxacantha. The delta N-15 isotope abundances of field-collected leaves of legume saplings were found to be significantly lower than those of non-legume species (legume delta N-15 = 0.98 +/- 0.32 parts per thousand, non-legume delta N-15 = 2.15 +/- 0.32 parts per thousand).
   4. These data confirm that A. karroo, A. nilotica, A. tortilis and A. nigrescens seedlings are capable of nodulating, and do so in their native habitat. The decreased delta N-15 in plants grown with grass indicates that N-2 fixation was strongly enhanced by competition with grass for N.
   5. N-2 fixation may thus be an important attribute allowing legume tree seedlings to survive competition with grass through a critical period when tree roots and grass roots must compete for nutrients.

AB The tropical savanna landscape of northern Australia is perhaps the most extensive and flammable ecosystem in the world. Like savannas worldwide, there still remains uncertainty as to the functioning of much of this system and the mechanisms maintaining a state between open grassland and woodland. We use the development of a process-based model to examine the processes operating on the eucalypt dominated tree component of the northern Australian savannas, focussing on the interaction of water availability and fire.
   A process-based, tree population dynamics model (FLAMES) has been developed to understand the interactive effects of fire and rainfall variability on trees in Australian savanna ecosystems where there has been limited modelling to date. This paper shows that the model is capable of simulating the range of tree populations found in northern Australia by considering soil properties (texture and depth) and rainfall distribution. The model indicates that seasonal variability and inter-annual variability in rainfall is critical in defining the structure and density of tree stands in northern Australia. We also show that fire plays an important role in defining tree structure by removing the most sensitive (the very young and old) trees and that frequent fronting fires will lead to ongoing reductions in tree populations. While fire is an important factor in northern Australia, the model indicates its effects on tree populations at a sub-continental scale are secondary to the impact of rainfall variability.

AB Suspension-feeding bivalves increase the quantity and quality of sedimenting organic matter through the production of faeces and pseudofaeces that are remineralised in coastal sediments and thus increase sediment oxygen demand and nutrient regeneration. Bivalves are intensively cultivated worldwide; however, no bivalve biodeposit decay rates are available to parameterise models describing the environmental effects of bivalve culture. We examined sediment biogeochemical changes as bivalve biodeposits age by incubating coastal sediments to which we added fresh mussel (Perna canaliculus) biodeposits and measured O-2 and nutrient fluxes as well as sediment characteristics over an 11-day period. Biodeposits elevated organic matter, chlorophyll a, phaeophytin a, organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the surface sediments. Sediment oxygen consumption (SOC) increased significantly (P=0.016) by similar to 1.5 times to 1,010 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) immediately after biodeposit addition and remained elevated compared to control cores without additions for the incubation period. This increase is in the range of observed in situ oxygen demand enhancements under mussel farms. To calculate a decay rate for biodeposits in sediments we fitted a first-order G model to the observed increase in SOC. The significant model fit (P=0.001, r(2) =0.72) generated a decay rate of 0.16 day(-1) (P=0.033, SE=0.05) that corresponds to a half-life time of 4.3 day. This decay rate is 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than published decay rates of coastal sediments without organic enrichment but similar to rates of decaying zooplankton faecal pellets. NH4+ release increased rapidly on the day of biodeposit addition (P=0.013) and reached a maximum of 144 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) after 5 days which was 3.6 times higher compared to control cores. During this period NH4+ release was significantly (P < 0.001 to P=0.043) higher in the cores with biodeposit additions than in control cores.

AB In the last two centuries, several species of Australian eucalypts (e.g. Eucalyptus camaldulensis and E. globulus) were introduced into the Iberian Peninsula for the production of paper pulp. The effects of the introduction of exotic root-symbitotic fungi together with the eucalypts have received little attention. During the past years, we have investigated the biology of ectomycorrhizal fungi in eucalypt plantations in the Iberian Peninsula. In the plantations studied, we found fruit bodies of several Australian ectomycorrhizal fungi and identified their ectomycorrhizas with DNA molecular markers. The most frequent species were Hydnangium carneum, Hymenogaster albus, Hysterangium inflatum, Labyrinthomyces donkii,, Laccaria fraterna, Pisolithus albus, P. microcarpus, Rhulandiella berolinensis, Setchelliogaster rheophyllus, and Tricholoma eucalypticum. These fungi were likely brought from Australia together with the eucalypts.. and they seem to have facilitated the establishment of eucalypt plantations and their naturalization. The dispersion of Australian fungal propagules may be facilitating the spread of eucalypts along watercourses in semiarid regions increasing the water lost. Because ectomycorrhizal fungi are obligate symbionts. their capacity to persist after eradication of eucalypt stands, and/or to extend beyond forest plantations, would rely on the possibility to find compatible native host trees, and to outcompete the native ectomycorrhizal fungi. Here we illustrate the case of the Australasian species Laccaria fraterna. which fruits in Mediterranean shrublands of ectomycorrhizal species of Cistus (rockroses). We need to know which other Australasian fungi extend to the native ecosystems, if we are to predict environmental risks associated with the introduction of Australasian ectomycorrhizal fungi into the Iberian Peninsula.

AB 1. The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis proposes that exotic plants often become invasive because they have evolved reduced allocation to defence and increased allocation to growth and reproduction in response to low herbivore loads. Previous studies with Chinese tallow tree Sapium sebiferum support EICA predictions of invasive North American ecotypes displaying rapid growth, poorly defended leaves and considerable compensation after defoliation. In contrast, native Asian ecotypes are comparatively slow growing with highly defended leaves and are negatively impacted by mechanical leaf damage. The effects of root damage on the different ecotypes are unknown.
   2. We conducted a full-factorial pot experiment designed to assess the effects of soil fertility, competition with ryegrass Lolium multiflorum and mechanical root damage on Sapium seedlings derived from seed collections obtained in the ancestral range (native Chinese ecotype) and introduced range (invasive Texas ecotype).
   3. The results, consistent with EICA predictions, revealed that Chinese ecotypes were negatively affected by severing roots, while Texas ecotypes were able to compensate for root damage.
   4. Fertilization increased growth of Chinese ecotypes, but did not reduce the negative effects of root damage enough to allow the seedlings to compensate completely. Competition increased the stem height growth of Chinese ecotypes, but did not affect shoot or root mass. Texas ecotypes were not significantly affected by any experimental treatments.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The results of this study are consistent with previous studies indicating that invasive Sapium has undergone a shift away from possessing costly herbivore defences to producing relatively inexpensive tissues that are capable of rapidly compensating for damage. Evolutionary change is increasingly being recognized as an important factor contributing to the success of exotic plant invaders. Understanding that herbivory tolerance and the compensatory capacity for damage may differ between native and introduced plant ecotypes will be essential for implementing effective control strategies for problematic invasive species.

AB Encrusting marine algae are found at all depths in the photic zone from polar to tropical seas worldwide, yet little is known about their ecology. Crusts (including red, brown, and green algae as well as lichens and Cyanobacteria) tend to predominate in areas of high disturbance (e.g. from herbivores or sand scour) or high stress (= low potential productivity, e.g. high on the shore). Patterns of crust and herbivore distribution and abundance were quantified in the intertidal zone in Washington state, and then the two environmental parameters predicted to be critical to among-crust variation in survival were manipulated: disturbance potential by varying abundances of herbivores, or by eliminating herbivores and artificially disturbing crusts with nylon and steel brushes; productivity potential by transplanting crusts along an environmental gradient from the high to the low intertidal zone and onto a submerged raft. Within-functional-group variation among crusts was studied by transplanting eight species (varying in calcification, thickness, tightness of construction, and other characters), and measuring their survival and growth over 2-3 yr in the different environments. Crusts varied widely in their responses to both disturbance and productivity potential. In general, thick, calcified, or very tightly constructed crusts withstood being steel-brushed at regular intervals. Nylon brushing sometimes actually benefitted these crusts relative to the controls (unbrushed but cleaned monthly), probably because of the reduction in fouling. In contrast, thinner or more loosely-constructed species showed poor survival when steel-brushed and often suffered significant losses even when nylon-brushed. Most crusts tended to do best in habitats having higher productivity potential (lower intertidal zone), showing mortality or reduced growth when transplanted into more stressful areas, although two species were healthiest under ''stressful'' conditions, i.e. desiccated or submerged in high pools. Experiments in the laboratory with herbivores (littorinid snails, limpets, and a chiton) demonstrated that they did not always consume the species that are mechanically easiest to remove (as indicated by the steel brushing experiments). Three species were avoided, including a brown known to contain high concentrations of phenolics, a blue-green crust, and a lichen with a blue-green phycobiont. All crusts grew very slowly, even in their optimal habitats; the fastest species grew laterally at < 20 mm/yr, and the slowest measurable at < 0.5 mm/yr. Some species showed no lateral growth over 2 yr. This low ability to sequester space, and their two-dimensional growth form, means that crusts often rely on grazers or other disturbance to keep from being overgrown. In other cases, they grow in areas where desiccation or low light levels apparently eliminate other algal forms. Crusts survive disturbance by either resisting it (through calcification or toughness), tolerating it (by being thick or regenerating rapidly), or avoiding it (by having an opportunistic life history, living in refugia such as crevices or high tidepools, or being unpalatable). Their life histories are highly variable, allowing them to exploit habitats in different ways.
   For example, in the mid intertidal zone in Washington the three dominant crust species include: (1) a fast-growing, frequently-recruiting brown (Ralfsia pacifica Hollenberg) that senesces after several years and sloughs away; (2) a fast-growing but rarely-recruiting red (''Petrocelis'') that lives for decades; and (3) a very slow-growing and rarely-recruiting red [Hildenbrandia rubra (Sommerfelt) Meneghini] that persists even when overgrown, and regenerates following disturbance. These diverse morphologies and life history strategies help make this morphology an ecological success.

ID SIZE
AB The post-fledging survival of a total Of I277 Young Guillemots Uria aalge ringed in 6 years was assessed using sightings Of 267 individuals back at the natal colony and recoveries of 46 ringed birds. In two years there was a significant decline in survival prospects with estimated hatching date, the first time such a trend has been demonstrated in the Alcidae. In these years pairs breeding early had a 2-3 times greater chance of having a young survive to return to the colony than pairs breeding three weeks later. Hatching date had no effect on survival prospects in the other four seasons and in none of the years did chick body condition have a demonstrable effect on post-fledging survival.

AB A biome is a key community ecological and biogeographical concept and, as such, has profited from the overall progress of community ecology, punctuated by two major innovations: shifting the focus from pure pattern description to understanding functionality, and changing the approach from observational to explanatory and, most importantly, from descriptive to predictive. The functional focus enabled development of mechanistic and function-focused predictive and retrodictive modelling; it also shaped the current understanding of the concept of a biome as a dynamic biological entity having many aspects, with deep roots in the evolutionary past, and which is undergoing change. The evolution of the biome concept was punctuated by three synthetic steps: the first synthesis formulated a solid body of theory explaining the ecological and biogeographical meaning of zonality and collated our knowledge on drivers of vegetation patterns at large spatial scales; the second translated this knowledge into effective mechanistic modelling tools, developing further the link between ecosystem functionality and biogeography; and the third (still in progress) is seeking common ground between large-scale ecological and biogeographic phenomena, using macroecology and macroevolutionary research tools.

AB African savannas are complex socio-ecological systems with diverse wild and domestic herbivore assemblages, which adapt spatially to intra- and interannual variation in forage quantity and quality, predation and disease risks. As African savannas become increasingly fragmented by growing human populations and their associated ecological impacts, adaptive foraging options for wild and domestic herbivore populations are correspondingly limited, resulting in declining wildlife populations and impoverished pastoral societies. In addition, competition for grazing by expanding domestic herbivore populations threatens the viability of wild herbivore populations occupying similar grazing niches. Conservation initiatives are further impacted by conflicts between wildlife and local communities of people who often receive little benefit from adjacent protected areas, creating conflict between the livelihood-orientated goals of communities and the conservation-oriented goals of the international community and those with vested interests in wildlife. Conservation strategies facilitating the alignment of these opposing goals of communities and conservationists are needed.Synthesis and applications. Key to understanding facilitative and competitive interactions between wild and domestic herbivores are the concepts of niche differentiation and functional resource heterogeneity. Uncontrolled incursions of burgeoning domestic herbivore populations into protected areas (PAs) threaten the conservation of wild herbivore biodiversity. However, domestic herbivores can be managed to minimize competition with wild herbivores and to enhance habitat by maximizing grassland structural heterogeneity (greater adaptive foraging options), creation of nutrient hotspots in the landscape and facilitation of high-quality grazing. Ecosystem service benefits to communities through controlled access to grazing resources in PAs, associated with appropriate disease management, can provide a conservation payment to promote communities' support of conservation of key wildlife migratory ranges and corridors outside PAs.

AB Biological invasions are often complex phenomena because many factors influence their outcome. One key aspect is how non-natives interact with the local biota. Interaction with local species may be especially important for exotic species that require an obligatory mutualist, such as Pinaceae species that need ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. EM fungi and seeds of Pinaceae disperse independently, so they may use different vectors. We studied the role of exotic mammals as dispersal agents of EM fungi on Isla Victoria, Argentina, where many Pinaceae species have been introduced. Only a few of these tree species have become invasive, and they are found in high densities only near plantations, partly because these Pinaceae trees lack proper EM fungi when their seeds land far from plantations. Native mammals (a dwarf deer and rodents) are rare around plantations and do not appear to play a role in these invasions. With greenhouse experiments using animal feces as inoculum, plus observational and molecular studies, we found that wild boar and deer, both non-native, are dispersing EM fungi. Approximately 30% of the Pinaceae seedlings growing with feces of wild boar and 15% of the seedlings growing with deer feces were colonized by non-native EM fungi. Seedlings growing in control pots were not colonized by EM fungi. We found a low diversity of fungi colonizing the seedlings, with the hypogeous Rhizopogon as the most abundant genus. Wild boar, a recent introduction to the island, appear to be the main animal dispersing the fungi and may be playing a key role in facilitating the invasion of pine trees and even triggering their spread. These results show that interactions among non-natives help explain pine invasions in our study area.

AB Blooms of the stalked diatom Didymosphenia geminata (Lyngbye) M. Schmidt, 1899 have been increasingly reported worldwide since the 1990s. In 2004, the appearance of blooms in New Zealand, for the first time, highlighted the invasive nature of this organism. In the absence of previous reliable records for this species, D. geminata was assumed to be non-indigenous and a nationally coordinated biosecurity response was initiated in an attempt to contain it. We examined the spread of D. geminata over five years using presence/absence data from national and regional delimiting surveys, combined with information from local agencies on potential vectors and data from national recreational angling surveys. Use of a rigorous sampling method raised confidence in the accuracy of negative results. Survey results supported the 2004 assumption that D. geminata was a recent arrival. Incremental but rapid spread to many South Island rivers from two main foci (the Mararoa and Buller Rivers) suggested mass dispersal of an invasive organism via human vectors. The distribution of affected rivers relative to angler usage data for 2007-08 was consistent with angler-mediated dispersal from catchment to catchment. This conclusion was supported by local information about likely vectors of D. geminata to individual sites. Other potential vectors were considered important (e. g., kayaking and power boats) but no river usage datasets were available to verify the patterns. At the time of writing D. geminata had not been detected in the North Island. Although D. geminata has been detected in a high proportion of South Island rivers, blooms have a more restricted distribution. The extent, drivers and impacts of these blooms are the subject of ongoing studies.

AB Ungulate populations in African conservation areas (CAs) are in widespread decline, which can largely be attributed to a lack of functionality of the area encompassed by the CAs themselves. We present evidence from a wide range of African CAs showing that they do not encompass both the functional wet- and dry-season resources that ungulates traditionally migrated between. Before human populations and economic development had grown to levels where they interfered with migrations outside the CAs, ungulates were able to make use of their traditional seasonal resources but this is becoming increasingly difficult and we are now seeing the effects of this restriction of movement on ungulate population numbers. New innovative strategies are required for the conservation of African wildlife. An urgent Africa-wide survey is needed to establish past and present functional resources in and around CAs and to prioritize conservation regions that are most functional. In addition, innovative attempts need to be made to reconsolidate functional seasonal resources within revised expanded protected areas.Resume
   Les populations d'ongules dans les aires de conservation africaines (AC) sont largement en declin, ce que l'on peut en grande partie attribuer au manque de fonctionnalite de la superficie englobee par les AC elles-memes. Nous presentons des preuves tirees d'une large gamme d'AC africaines qui montrent qu'elles ne comprennent pas l'ensemble des ressources fonctionnelles de saison des pluies et de saison seche entre lesquelles les ongules ont l'habitude de migrer. Avant que les populations humaines et le developpement economique n'aient atteint des niveaux ou ils interferent avec les migrations qui se font en dehors des AC, les ongules etaient a meme d'utiliser leurs ressources saisonnieres traditionnelles, mais ceci est devenu de plus en plus difficile, et nous voyons desormais les effets de cette restriction des deplacements sur les chiffres des populations d'ongules. Il est urgent de realiser une etude a l'echelle du continent pour etablir quelles sont les ressources fonctionnelles passees et presentes dans et autour des AC et pour prioriser les regions de conservation qui sont les plus fonctionnelles. De plus, il faut innover pour consolider les ressources fonctionnelles saisonnieres au sein d'aires protegees revisees et elargies.

AB Refugia featured prominently in shaping evolutionary trajectories during repeated cycles of glaciation in the Quaternary, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere instead experienced cycles of severe aridification but little is known about the temporal presence and role of refugia for arid-adapted biota. Isolated mountain ranges located in the Australian arid zone likely provided refugia for many species following Mio/Pliocene (< 15 Ma) aridification; however, the evolutionary consequences of the recent development of widespread sand deserts is largely unknown. To test alternative hypotheses of ancient vs. recent isolation, we generated a 10 gene data set to assess divergence history among saxicolous geckos in the genus Heteronotia that have distributions confined to major rocky ranges in the arid zone. Phylogenetic analyses show that each rocky range harbours a divergent lineage, and substantial intraspecific diversity is likely due to topographic complexity in these areas. Old divergences (similar to 4 Ma) among lineages pre-date the formation of the geologically young sand deserts (< 1 Ma), suggesting that Pliocene climate shifts fractured the distributions of biota long before the spread of the deserts.

TI Predicted Impact of Barriers to Migration on the Serengeti Wildebeest
   Population
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article

AB The Serengeti wildebeest migration is a rare and spectacular example of a once-common biological phenomenon. A proposed road project threatens to bisect the Serengeti ecosystem and its integrity. The precautionary principle dictates that we consider the possible consequences of a road completely disrupting the migration. We used an existing spatially-explicit simulation model of wildebeest movement and population dynamics to explore how placing a barrier to migration across the proposed route (thus creating two disjoint but mobile subpopulations) might affect the long-term size of the wildebeest population. Our simulation results suggest that a barrier to migration-even without causing habitat loss-could cause the wildebeest population to decline by about a third. The driver of this decline is the effect of habitat fragmentation (even without habitat loss) on the ability of wildebeest to effectively track temporal shifts in high-quality forage resources across the landscape. Given the important role of the wildebeest migration for a number of key ecological processes, these findings have potentially important ramifications for ecosystem biodiversity, structure, and function in the Serengeti.

AB Transformation of South African succulent thicket in response to grazing is widespread and characterized by the extensive replacement of dense closed-canopy thicket with a 'pseudo-savanna' of remnant trees with an ephemeral field layer. In this study, we examined the patterns of transformation in a semi-arid succulent thicket ecosystem using replicated fence line contrasts. We quantified the changes in plant species and functional diversity, physiognomy and biomass. We tested whether the remnant tree guild of the transformed thicket is in a stable state, using aerial photographs and ground-truthing to track the survivorship of canopy trees over 60 years in transformed landscapes. We investigated the impacts of transformation on recruitment into the canopy tree guild by measuring seedling establishment across the fence line contrasts. Transformation results in a significant loss of plant and functional diversity. There is a significant reduction in the biomass and structural complexity of the vegetation, both vertically and horizontally. The canopy tree guild in transformed thicket is not stable owing to ongoing adult mortality and little successful recruitment. These results are interpreted in a framework of ecosystem functioning and long-term stability. We suggest that the pseudo-savanna typical of transformed succulent thicket is not a stable alternative state to intact thicket, but rather an intermediate stage in a trajectory towards a highly desertified state where only the ephemeral grasses and forbs persist.

AB Aim Patterns of species turnover along environmental gradients are better studied than their causes. Competitive interactions, or physiological tolerance are most often cited as determinants of turnover. Here we investigate differential tree species response to disturbance by fire and mammal browsing as causes of changing dominance of species within and among sites along an altitudinal gradient.
   Methods We documented the distribution of two Acacia species using maps and sample transects. We explored possible causes of species turnover by studying differences between the species in tolerance to grass competition using pot experiments, to browsers by observing patterns of shoot damage, and to fire by comparing the size structure of populations burnt at different frequencies and intensities.
   Results Acacia karroo woodlands were rare and occur at higher elevations than the much more common A. nilotica woodlands. Woodland composition seems set to change in future since the pattern of dominance was reversed in juvenile stages. A. karroo juveniles were very widespread and far more abundant than A. nilotica juveniles. A. karroo juveniles were most abundant in tall fire-prone grasslands and were rare on grazing lawns whereas A. nilotica showed the reverse pattern. In the pot experiments, growth of both species was suppressed by grasses but there were no significant differences in response between the two species. Juveniles of A. karroo were more heavily browsed than those of A. nilotica. However juveniles of A. nilotica were less tolerant of frequent intense burns than juvenile A. Karroo.
   Main conclusions Disturbance gradients, from high fire frequency and low herbivore density at high altitudes, to lower fire frequency and higher herbivore density at low altitudes, are responsible for the shift in community structure along the spatial gradient. Differential responses to browsing and fire may also explain temporal turnover from A. nilotica in the past to A. karroo in the present. Changes in the area burnt annually, and in faunal composition, suggest a landscape-scale shift from grazing-dominated short-grass landscapes in the 1960s, favouring A. nilotica, to fire-dominated tall grasslands in the 1990s favouring A. karroo. We suggest that species turnover due to differential responses along disturbance gradients may be much more widespread than the current paucity of studies suggests.

AB Lowland dry forests are unique in Hawaii for their high diversity of tree species compared with wet forests. We characterized spatial and temporal partitioning of soil water resources among seven indigenous and one invasive dry forest species to determine whether the degree of partitioning was consistent with the relatively high species richness in these forests. Patterns of water utilization were inferred from stable hydrogen isotope ratios CFD of soil and xylem water, zones of soil water depletion, plant water status, leaf phenology, and spatial patterns of species distribution. Soil water delta D values ranged from -20 parts per thousand near the surface to -48 parts per thousand at 130 cm depth. Metrosideros polymorpha, an evergreen species, and Reynoldsia sandwicensis, a drought-deciduous species, had xylem sap delta D values of about -52 parts per thousand, and appeared to obtain their water largely from deeper soil layers. The remaining six species had xylem FD values ranging from -33 to -42 parts per thousand, and apparently obtained water from shallower soil layers. Xylem water delta D values were negatively correlated with minimum annual leaf water potential and positively correlated with leaf solute content, an integrated measure of leaf water deficit. Seasonal patterns of leaf production ranged from dry season deciduous at one extreme to evergreen with near constant leaf expansion rates at the other. Species tapping water more actively from deeper soil layers tended to exhibit larger seasonality of leaf production than species relying on shallower soil water sources. Individuals of Myoporum sandwicense were more spatially isolated than would be expected by chance. Even though this species apparently extracted water primarily from shallow soil layers, as indicated by its xylem FD values, its nearly constant growth rates across all seasons may have been the result of a larger volume of soil water available per individual. The two dominant species, Diospyros sandwicesis and Nestegis sandwicensis, exhibited low leaf water potentials during the dry season and apparently drew water mostly from the upper portion of the soil profile, which may have allowed them to exploit light precipitation events more effectively than the more deeply rooted species. Character displacement in spatial and temporal patterns of soil water uptake was consistent with the relatively high diversity of woody species in Hawaiian dry forests.

AB Multiple stressors, such as warming and invasions, often occur together and have nonadditive effects. Most studies to date assume that stressors operate in perfect synchrony, but this will rarely be the case in reality. Stressor sequence and overlap will have implications for ecological memory ? the ability of past stressors to influence future responses. Moreover, stressors are usually defined in an anthropocentric context: what we consider a short-term stressor, such as a flood, will span multiple generations of microbes. We argue that to predict responses to multiple stressors from individuals to the whole ecosystem, it is necessary to consider metabolic rates, which determine the timescales at which individuals operate and therefore, ultimately, the ecological memory at different levels of ecological organization.

AB Tropical Africa is home to an astonishing biodiversity occurring in a variety of ecosystems. Past climatic change and geological events have impacted the evolution and diversification of this biodiversity. During the last two decades, around 90 dated molecular phylogenies of different clades across animals and plants have been published leading to an increased understanding of the diversification and speciation processes generating tropical African biodiversity. In parallel, extended geological and palaeoclimatic records together with detailed numerical simulations have refined our understanding of past geological and climatic changes in Africa. To date, these important advances have not been reviewed within a common framework. Here, we critically review and synthesize African climate, tectonics and terrestrial biodiversity evolution throughout the Cenozoic to the mid-Pleistocene, drawing on recent advances in Earth and life sciences. We first review six major geo-climatic periods defining tropical African biodiversity diversification by synthesizing 89 dated molecular phylogeny studies. Two major geo-climatic factors impacting the diversification of the sub-Saharan biota are highlighted. First, Africa underwent numerous climatic fluctuations at ancient and more recent timescales, with tectonic, greenhouse gas, and orbital forcing stimulating diversification. Second, increased aridification since the Late Eocene led to important extinction events, but also provided unique diversification opportunities shaping the current tropical African biodiversity landscape. We then review diversification studies of tropical terrestrial animal and plant clades and discuss three major models of speciation: (i) geographic speciationviavicariance (allopatry); (ii) ecological speciation impacted by climate and geological changes, and (iii) genomic speciationviagenome duplication. Geographic speciation has been the most widely documented to date and is a common speciation model across tropical Africa. We conclude with four important challenges faced by tropical African biodiversity research: (i) to increase knowledge by gathering basic and fundamental biodiversity information; (ii) to improve modelling of African geophysical evolution throughout the Cenozoicviabetter constraints and downscaling approaches; (iii) to increase the precision of phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular dating of tropical African clades by using next generation sequencing approaches together with better fossil calibrations; (iv) finally, as done here, to integrate data better from Earth and life sciences by focusing on the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of tropical African biodiversity in a wider geodiversity context.

AB Landscape services can be understood as the spatial explicit and human action produced ecosystem services at the landscape scale. Mapping multiple landscape services of agricultural land at various spatiotemporal scales can reveal the distribution and evolution of landscape services. However, further investigation into the spatiotemporal evolution and driving force of agricultural landscape multifunctionality is still needed. In this study, six landscape services (food supply, habitat maintenance, habitat connectivity, soil retention, landscape aesthetics, and population carrier) were quantified in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, China. Then, Spearman's rank correlation, partial correlation, principal component analysis and geographically weighted regression were used to identify the driving forces of agricultural landscape multifunctionality. The results showed that agricultural landscape multifunctionality generally increased during 2000-2010. The vegetation factor of NDVI was the most important natural indicator influencing landscape multifunctionality, while the gross domestic product was the most related social indicator. In a spatial non-stationary background, the vegetation component positively influenced multifunctionality; the impacts of the social component were negative in the center of the study area, but positive in the north and east. Because multifunctional landscapes are regarded as one spatial approach to achieving landscape sustainability, far more attentions should be paid to spatial non-stationarity of driving forces associated with agriculture landscape multifunctionality.

AB Aim Endemic species are hypothesized to particularly occur in areas with relatively stable climates during the Quaternary glacial-interglacial oscillations (orbitally forced species' range dynamics hypothesis). This hypothesis has received support in global studies and studies from regions highly affected by glaciations. Here, we test its applicability to Chinese endemic species, thereby testing it in a region that was relatively mildly affected by glaciations.
   Location China.
   Methods We tested for associations between endemic species richness and Quaternary climate change, current climate and topography. Changes in mean annual temperature (MAT) and annual precipitation (MAP) between the Last Glacial Maximum and present were used to describe Quaternary climate change. We used simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models to account for spatial autocorrelation in predictors, and Random Forest modelling to deal with non-linear relationships and better handle multicollinearity among predictor variables. To get a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved we also performed analyses based on growth-form (woody versus herbaceous plants) and species age (palaeo- and neoendemics).
   Results Single-predictor SAR models showed that glacial-interglacial MAT velocity always has higher explanatory power than current climate (with a pseudo r(2) difference of 0.581-0.604 between the best palaeoclimate and current climate predictors for models for all endemic plants). Model selection on multivariate SAR models (based on Akaike weights) and Random Forest modelling (based on correlations between predicted and observed species richness) always included at least one variable representing Quaternary climate change as well as one or more current climate variables. Quaternary climate-change variables were generally of similar strength to the current climate predictors. Notably, the summed Akaike weight across all models in the relevant model set was always 1 for glacial-interglacial MAT velocity. There were no clear differences with respect to growth forms or species age in the estimated importance of Quaternary climate change.
   Main conclusions The consistent association between long-term climatic stability and high plant endemism in China provides strong evidence for the importance of Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate changes in shaping the distribution of endemic species, even in regions relatively mildly affected by glaciations. Hence, even moderate climate changes may have strong, long-term effects on species diversity patterns.

AB Hopper (Plant Soil 322:49-86, 2009) introduced landscape age, climate buffering, and soil nutrient status as descriptors for a continuum between old, climatically buffered landscapes characterised by low soil fertility (OCBIL) and young, often disturbed landscapes characterised by fertile soils (YODFEL). Hopper (Plant Soil 322:49-86, 2009) provided an important framework for biodiversity and conservation. We argue that Hopper's (Plant Soil 322:49-86, 2009) conceptual framework includes five areas worthy of further consideration. These include: (1) The appropriateness of the original three dimensions; (2) The need for deeper consideration of rejuvenation and disturbance within OCBILs. (3) Broadening the globally relevant range of environments. (4) Operationalising the definitions or dimensions. (5) Revisiting the scale and compatibility of the predictions. Here, we address the first four of these areas and offer an alternative conceptual framework based on the idea of Old Stable Landscapes (OSLs). We redefine Hopper's climate buffering as a dimension of climate stability, identify soil-impoverishment as a function of landscape age, and recognise fire regime predictability as a large-scale, long-term evolutionarily important dimension. In so doing, we construct a globally-relevant, qualitative template to enable the testing of evolutionary-ecological hypotheses concerning biodiversity (e.g. species diversity, diversity gradients, endemism, speciation and extinction rates, cladogenesis, persistence of old lineages, refugial phenomena). Our template is characterised by having operationally defined dimensions, which can be used to design surveys and experiments to address the issues of biodiversity conservation, recovery, and restoration under variations in landscape age, climatic stability and fire regime.

AB Aim
   Sustaining biological diversity requires the protection of the ecological, evolutionary and landscape-level processes that generate it. Here, we identify areas of high neoendemism in a global diversity hotspot, the California flora, using range size data and molecular-based estimates of taxon age.
   Location
   California, USA.
   Methods
   We compiled distribution and range size data for all plant taxa endemic to California and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based age estimates for 337 putative neoendemics (15% of the endemic flora). This information was combined to identify areas in the state with high proportions of young and restricted-range taxa. We overlaid the distribution of neoendemic hotspots on maps of currently protected lands and also explored correlations between our diversity measures and climate.
   Results
   The central coast of California, the Sierra Nevada and the San Bernardino Range contained endemics with the most restricted distributions on average, while areas in the Desert and Great Basin provinces found within the state were composed of the youngest neoendemics on average. Diversity measures that took age and range size into account shifted the estimate of highest endemic diversity in the state towards the Desert and Great Basin regions relative to simple counts of endemic species richness. Our diversity measures were poorly correlated with climate and topographic heterogeneity.
   Main conclusions
   Substantial portions of California with high levels of plant neoendemism fall outside of protected lands, indicating that additional action will be needed to preserve the geographic areas apparently associated with high rates of plant diversification. The neoendemic flora of the deserts appears particularly young in our analyses, which may reflect the relatively recent origin of desert environments within the state.

AB Entrained phenology patterns of tropical trees are expected to be sensitive to short-term fluctuations in typical rainfall and temperature. We examined 47 mo of data on the flowering, fruiting, and new leaf phenology for 797 trees from 38 species in the Tai National park, Cote d'Ivoire. We determined the timing of the phenology cycles in relation to seasonal rainfall, temperature, and solar radiation. Regression analysis was used to examine how variations in rainfall and temperature influenced deviations in the peaks and troughs of phenology cycles. We also investigated whether populations that fruit during periods of community-wide fruit scarcity were those populations with relatively long- or short-fruiting duration. Flower, Fruit, and leaf-flushing phenophases all exhibited I 2-mo cycles. The broad peak in flowering began with the northward zenithal passing in April and ended with the southward zenithal passing in September. Fruiting peaks occurred in the long dry season, and leaf flushing peaked in the long dry season but Continued into the wet season. Deviations front phenology cycles were largely attributable to short-term fluctuations in rainfall and/or temperature. Fruiting durations of species were related to the mean diameter at breast height. Species with long- and short-fruiting durations contributed equally to fruit abundance during periods of community-wide fruit scarcity.

AB Recent declines in commercial harvests of soft-shell clams, Mya arenaria L., in Maine, USA, have prompted state and local officials to consider enhancing wild stocks with hatchery-reared seed. We conducted two manipulative field experiments in the soft-bottom intertidal zone during 19901991 in eastern Maine to assess effects of predation, intraspecific competition, and initial planting size on the survival and growth of cultured individuals of Mya. Experiment I (23 June 1990 to 13 June 1991) tested interactive effects of two planting sizes (small=8.5 mm shell length (SL); large=11.8 mm SL) and protective netting on fate and growth of clams. Animals of each size were added to separate experimental units within each of 60 1-m(2) areas delimited by a wooden box. To deter predators, 50 boxes were covered with a specific type of plastic netting that differed in aperture size (4.2, 6.4 and 12.8 mm) and degree of rigidity (flexible vs. extruded) while 10 boxes served as controls (without netting). Small clams grew at a faster rate than large clams, but both added approximately 18 mm of new shell by the end of the study. Growth was unaffected by netting size and rigidity, but 13% more clams were recovered alive after a year in protected vs. unprotected treatments (84% vs. 71%). Survival was independent of netting type. The presence of netting resulted in nearly a 3 x enhancement of wild spat (<15 mm SL) compared to unprotected controls (568.8+/-24.4 vs. 199.6+/-22.8 m(-2)). This result suggests that the decline of wild stocks in eastern Maine may not be related to recruitment failure, but to post-settlement events, such as predation, which remove clams from the intertidal. In Experiment II (15 April to 6 October 1991), clam (14.6+/-0.2 mm SL) density was manipulated across four levels from 333 to 2664 m(-2) in protected (extruded netting, 12.8 mm aperture) and unprotected 1-m(2) boxes. Survival within unprotected boxes was independent of stocking density (79%), but was inversely density-dependent in protected boxes (77% in the lowest density treatment increasing to a mean of 88% in the other three treatments). A negative cubic relationship explained the effect of density on growth. We present the first mariculture strategy for public stock enhancement or private entrepreneurs interested in rearing M. arenaria in Maine and the northeast US. Hatchery-reared juveniles 8-10 mm SL should be planted in the spring near or below mid tide levels at densities between 333 and 666 m(-2) and protected with flexible netting (6.4 mm aperture) raised several centimeters above the sediment surface. Netting should be removed from mud flats in the late fall before the threat of ice and severe winter storms. Animals should attain sizes between 25 and 30 mm SL during this time and reach a size refuge from burrowing and other predators. Growth to legal, commercial size (50.8 mm SL) should take another 2-4 years depending on geographic location and mean seawater temperature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The non-native invasive plant Chromolaena odorata (Asteraceae) was studied at 6 sites, with a chronosequence of ages from <1 to greater than or equal to 15 years, at St Lucia, South Africa. C. odorata density, biomass, seed production and soil seed banks were quantified in three microsites: sun, semi-shade and shade. C. odorata density decreased with invasion age, apparently as a self-thinning process. Biomass per unit area and seed production/plant increased over the first 10 years, but declined greatly at greater than or equal to 15 years. C. odorata plants grew larger and had much greater seed production in the sun relative to semi-shade, with small plants producing few if any seeds in the shade. Seed production in the sun varied from 2000 (<1-year old site) to 260 000 (10 year) seeds m(-2) annum(-1). About 20-46% of seeds produced were germinable and showed the same trend with age of invasion, but was particularly low after greater than or equal to 15 years. Assessment of soil seed banks immediately prior to seed production (seed greater than or equal to 10 months old), indicates that about 5-10% of seeds in the sun and 11-22% in the shade were still germinable, resulting in germinable seed densities of 12-385 and 158-511 m(-2), respectively (excluding the greater than or equal to 15-year old site). A greenhouse trial showed that burial of seeds, relative to those at the surface, and provision of less water, significantly improved seed persistence in the soil, while light intensity had no effect. Control of C. odorata is difficult due to rapid attainment of reproductive maturity, large production of wind-dispersed seeds and a short-term persistent seed bank. An integrated control strategy either excluding fire (coastal forest sites) or using fire prior to seed release in July/August to kill plants and soil-stored seeds immediately prior to seed production, together with biological, chemical and/or physical control, should be explored.

AB Aim Biomes worldwide are shifting with global change. Biomes whose extents are limited by temperature or precipitation, such as the tundra and savanna, may be particularly strongly affected by climate change. While woody plant encroachment is prevalent across both biomes, its relationship to temperature and precipitation change remains unknown. Here, we quantify the degree to which woody encroachment is related to climate change and identify its main associated drivers.
   Location Tundra and savanna biomes.
   Time period 1992 +/- 20.27-2010 +/- 5.62 (mean +/- SD). 1876-2016 (range).
   Major taxa studied Woody plants (shrubs and trees).
   Methods We compiled a dataset comprising 1,089 records from 899 sites of woody plant cover over time and attributed drivers of woody cover change across these two biomes. We calculated cover change in each biome and assessed the degree to which cover change corresponds to concurrent temperature and precipitation changes using multiple climate metrics. Finally, we conducted a quantitative literature review of the relative importance of attributed drivers of woody cover change.
   Results Woody encroachment was widespread geographically and across climate gradients. Rates of woody cover change (positive or negative) were 1.8 times lower in the tundra than in the savanna (1.8 vs. 3.2%), while rates of woody cover increase (i.e., encroachment) were c. 1.7 times lower in the tundra compared with the savanna (3.7 vs. 6.3% per decade). In the tundra, magnitudes of woody cover change did not correspond to climate, while in the savanna, greater cover change corresponded with increases in precipitation. We found higher rates of woody cover change in wetter versus drier sites with warming in the tundra biome, and higher rates of woody cover change in drier versus wetter sites with increasing precipitation in the savanna. However, faster rates of woody cover change were not associated with more rapid rates of climate change across sites, except for maximum precipitation in the savanna.
   Main conclusions Woody encroachment was positively related to warming in the tundra and increased rainfall in the savanna. However, cover change rates were not predicted by rates of climate change, which can be partially explained by climate interactions in both biomes. Additional likely influences include site-level factors, time-lags, plant-specific responses, and land use and other non-climate drivers. Our findings highlight the complex nature of climate change impacts in biomes limited by seasonality, which should be accounted for to realistically estimate future responses across open biomes under global change scenarios.

AB Savanna ecosystems are an integral part of the African landscape and sustain the livelihoods of millions of people. Woody encroachment in savannas is a widespread phenomenon but its causes are widely debated. We review the extensive literature on woody encroachment to help improve understanding of the possible causes and to highlight where and how future scientific efforts to fully understand these causes should be focused. Rainfall is the most important determinant of maximum woody cover across Africa, but fire and herbivory interact to reduce woody cover below the maximum at many locations. We postulate that woody encroachment is most likely driven by CO2 enrichment and propose a two-system conceptual framework, whereby mechanisms of woody encroachment differ depending on whether the savanna is a wet or dry system. In dry savannas, the increased water-use efficiency in plants relaxes precipitation-driven constraints and increases woody growth. In wet savannas, the increase of carbon allocation to tree roots results in faster recovery rates after disturbance and a greater likelihood of reaching sexual maturity. Our proposed framework can be tested using a mixture of experimental and earth observational techniques. At a local level, changes in precipitation, burning regimes or herbivory could be driving woody encroachment, but are unlikely to be the explanation of this continent-wide phenomenon.

AB The surface of nanoparticles (NP) is often functionalized with a capping agent to increase their colloidal stability. Having a strong effect on the characteristics of NP, the coating might already determine the risk from NP to organisms and the environment. In this study identical iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP; phi 5-6 nm) were functionalized with four different coatings: ascorbate (ASC-IONP), citrate (CIT-IONP), dextran (DEX-IONP), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-IONP). Ascorbate and citrate stabilize NP via electrostatic repulsion whereas dextran and polyvinylpyrrolidone are steric stabilizers. All IONP were colloidally stable over several weeks. Their acute effects on neonates of the waterflea Daphnia magna were investigated over 96 h. The highest immobilizing effect was found for ASC- and DEX-IONP. In the presence of neonates, both agglomerated or flocculated and adsorbed to the carapace and filtering apparatuses, inducing high immobilization. Lower immobilization was found for CIT-IONP. Their effect was hypothesized to partly originate from an increased release of dissolved iron and the ability to form reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, incomplete ecdysis occurred at high concentrations of ASC-, DEX-, and CIT-IONP. PVP-IONP did not induce any negative effect, although high quantities were visibly ingested by the daphnids. PVP-IONP had the highest colloidal stability without any occurring agglomeration, adsorption, or dissolution. Only strong swelling of the PVP coating was observed in medium, highly increasing the hydrodynamic diameter. Each coating caused individual effects. Toxicity cannot be correlated to hydrodynamic diameter or the kind of stabilizing forces. Effects are rather linked to decreasing colloidal stability, the release of ions from the core material or the ability to form ROS, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ecosystems change between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal vegetation dominance over anthropological and geological time scales, yet consequences for ecosystem function are unclear. We review four hypotheses for the effect of mycorrhizal status on ecosystem function. Specifically, that differences between ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal dominated ecosystems are driven by (1) foliar trait differences, (2) positive plant-soil feedback in ectomycorrhizal plants, (3) differences in the ability to dissolve rocks as a source of nutrition, and (4) differences in the ability to use organic nutrients. We find no universal difference in foliar traits with mycorrhizal status. A spatial simulation suggests that positive plant-soil feedback in ectomycorrhizal plants is unlikely to drive ecosystem differences. However, negative feedback appears to be more common in arbuscular mycorrhizal trees than ectomycorrhizal trees and may represent an important ecosystem difference. Rock dissolution occurs under both mycorrhizal types but may differ in rate. Hypothesis 4 was the best supported: a model and some field evidence suggest that decoupling of carbon and nutrients in ectomycorrhizal decomposition leads to inhibition of saprotrophic mineralization, with context-dependent effects. Greater understanding of organic nutrient utilization differences may be key to improving incorporation of mycorrhizas in ecosystem ecology.

AB Invasive plants can have a major impact on local plant and animal communities. However, effects of plant invasions on arthropod communities and the potential drivers have rarely been studied. We present a meta-analysis of 56 studies on the impact of plant invasions on abundance and richness of local arthropod communities. Moreover, we study the role of five invader and habitat attributes to assess their influence on the direction and magnitude of effect on arthropod communities: the time since introduction; woody vs. herbaceous invaders; presence of native congeners; canopy cover of the invader; and single vs. multiple invaders. We found that overall invaded habitats had a 29% lower arthropod abundance and a 17% lower taxonomic richness compared with non-invaded habitats. Woody invaders had a stronger negative impact on arthropod communities than herbaceous invaders, reducing abundance and richness by as much as 55% and 21%, respectively.Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that arthropod communities are negatively affected by plant invasions, which may have substantial effects on other ecosystem features, such as pollination, food web dynamics, decomposition as well as habitat heterogeneity. Loss of arthropod diversity is generally directly associated with loss of plant species richness. Therefore, the reduction we see could be causally connected to the effect of the invader on the habitat. The physical dominance of woody invaders compared with herbaceous invaders could be a main driver for this effect.

AB Key to the predictive understanding of many nearshore marine ecosystems is the transport of larvae by ocean circulation processes. Many species release thousands to billions of larvae to develop in pelagic waters, but only a few lucky ones successfully settle to suitable habitat and recruit to adult life stages. Methodologies for predicting the larval dispersal are still primitive, and simple diffusive analyses are still used for many important applications. hi this study, we investigate mechanisms of larval dispersal using idealized simulations of time-evolving coastal circulations in the California Current system with Lagrangian particles as models for planktonic larvae. Connectivity matrices, which describe the source-to-destination relationships for larval dispersal for a given larval development time course, are used to diagnose the time-space dynamics of larval settlement. The resulting connectivity matrices are shown to be a function of several important time scales, such as the planktonic larval duration, the frequency and duration of larval release events and inherent time scales for the coastal circulations. Many important fishery management applications require knowledge of fish stocks on a year-to-year or generation-to-generation basis. For these short time scales (typically less than I year), larval dispersal is generally far from a simple diffusive process and the consideration of the stochastic and episodic nature of larval dispersal is required. This work. provides new insights into the spatial-temporal dynamics of nearshore fish stocks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. We estimated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loading into wetlands by carnivorous waterbirds with alternative physiological models using a food-intake and an excreta-production approach. The models were applied for non-breeding and breeding Dutch inland carnivorous waterbird populations to quantify their contribution to nutrient loading on a landscape scale.
   2. Model predictions based on food intake exceeded those based on excretion by 59-62% for N and by 2-36% for P, depending on dietary assumptions. Uncertainty analysis indicated that the intake model was most affected by errors in energy requirement, while the excretion model was dependent on faecal nutrient composition.
   3. Per capita loading rate of non-breeders increased with body mass from 0.3-0.8 g N day(-1) and 0.15 g P day(-1) in little gulls Larus minutus to 4.5-11.5 g N day(-1) and 2.1-3.2 g P day(-1) in great cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo. For breeding birds, the estimated nutrient loading by a family unit over the entire breeding period ranged between 17.6-443.0 g N and 8.6 g P for little tern Sterna albifrons to 619.6-1755.6 g N and 316.2-498.1 g P for great cormorants.
   4. We distinguished between external (i.e. importing) and internal (i.e. recycling) nutrient loading by carnivorous waterbirds. For the Netherlands, average external-loading estimates ranged between 38.1-91.5 tonnes N and 16.7-18.2 tonnes P per year, whilst internal-loading estimates ranged between 53.1-140.5 tonnes N and 25.2-39.2 tonnes P and per year. The average contribution of breeding birds was estimated to be 17% and 32% for external and internal loading respectively. Most important species were black-headed gull Larus ridibundus and mew gull Larus canus for external loading, and great cormorant and grey heron Ardea cinerea for internal loading.
   5. On a landscape scale, loading by carnivorous waterbirds was of minor importance for freshwater habitats in the Netherlands with 0.26-0.65 kg N ha(-1) a(-1) and 0.12-0.16 kg P ha(-1) a(-1). However, on a local scale, breeding colonies may be responsible for significant P loading.

AB The introduction of exotic plants can have large impacts on ecosystem functions such as soil nutrient cycling. Since these impacts result from differences in traits between the exotic and resident species, novel physiological traits such as N cycling may cause large alterations in ecosystem function. It is unclear, however, whether all members of a given functional group will have the same ecosystem effects. Here we look at a within functional group comparison to test whether an annual (Lupinus luteus) and a perennial (Acacia saligna) N-fixing exotic species cause the same effects on soil N cycling in the fynbos vegetation of South Africa. We measured litterfall quantity and quality, and soil total nitrogen and organic matter for each vegetation type as well. Available nitrogen was quantified using ion exchange resin bags monthly for I year. We used microcosms to evaluate litter decomposition. Although both exotic species increased the available nitrogen in the soil, only Acacia increased the total soil N and organic matter. This could be explained by the slow decomposition of Acacia litter in the microcosm study, despite the fact that Acacia and Lupinus litter contained equivalent N concentrations. Presumably, low carbon quality of Acacia litter slows its decomposition in soil, resulting in retention of organic nitrogen in Acacia stands after clearing for restoration purposes. The differences in long term impacts of these annual and perennial species highlight the fact that not all N-fixing exotic species exert equivalent impacts. Ecologists should consider multiple traits rather than broadly defined functional groups alone when predicting invader impacts.

AB We discuss the search for optimal stocking regimes in semi-arid grazing lands. We argue that 'one size does not fit all' and that different stocking regimes are appropriate under different conditions. This paper is an attempt to move beyond polarization of the current debate towards a more integrative and flexible approach to grazing management. We propose five different conditions as major influences on grazing regimes: environmental variability and predictability; degradation and thresholds; property right regimes; discount rates; and market stability and prices. We suggest a lack of connection between the micro-economics literature and natural science and social-anthropological literature. it is timely to achieve greater integration around some key questions and hypotheses, and recognize that policy prescriptions at national or even regional levels are likely to have limited value due to context specificity.

AB Oceanic currents and larval accumulation potentially have large impacts on the choice of locations for marine reserves. Larval settlement of benthic invertebrates was greater in the lee than on the windward side of a small headland during the height of upwelling in central California during 2001 and 2002. Strong upwelling during the study was indicated by mean seasonal Bakun indices of 149 to 176 m(3) s(-1) per 100 m of coastline in 2001-2002. Weekly sampling of near-surface and near-bottom settlement in the lee of Bodega Head from August 2000 to September 2001 revealed that most larvae of 7 crab taxa settled during spring and summer, which coincides with the upwelling season. Comparison of sites in the protected (lee) and exposed (windward) sides of the headland (2 sites each) during the peak settlement season in 2001 showed that most larvae settled in the lee of the headland, including 91% of crabs, 89% of barnacles, and 80% of mussels in weekly samples. During 2002, weekly sampling at 1 protected and 1 exposed site also demonstrated that most settlement occurred in the lee of the headland, including 74% of crabs, 82% of barnacles, and 65% of mussels. Crabs settled mostly at the surface, whereas barnacles and mussels primarily settled near the bottom, indicating that postlarvae in both surface and bottom waters accumulate in the lee of the headland. Larval accumulation zones should be included in networks of marine reserves to supply adult populations with propagules in recruitment-limited upwelling regions.

AB The objectives of the study, conducted during the 2000/01 growing season in the Middle Awash Valley of Ethiopia, were to quantify the effects of two dominant woody species (Acacia tortilis and Balanites aegyptica) on grass species composition, grass dry matter (DM) yield and soil under light, medium and heavy grazing. At each study site two sub-habitats were distinguished, viz. under tree canopies and open grassland. The nutrient status of soil under the canopies of both woody species was found to be higher than the open grassland, especially with regard to soil pH, total N and organic carbon. This was more pronounced in the top 50 mm of soil and on the lightly grazed site. Due to the observed association of Panicum maximum with tree canopies, the grass DM yield was higher under tree canopies, but again only at the lightly grazed site. Heavy grazing proved to be a strong overriding effect of the positive influences of the woody plants. The grass species found at the heavily grazed site were mostly annuals and less desirable. This emphasizes the importance of conservative stocking rates and proper pasture management. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Succulent thicket is an important centre of endemism for succulents and geophytes. Both inside and outside reserves, this component is threatened by megaherbivore and goat grazing, respectively. Goat grazing has greatly reduced the cover and diversity of endemic geophytes and succulent shrubs in succulent thicket has in the Addo Elephant National Park. Elephant grazing has had a more moderate effect on these plants and has not reduced the rich Crassulaceae flora in shrub microsites. A endemics noted in the study were present in ungrazed sites but fewer were recorded in the elephant- (63%) and goat- (53%) grazed treatments.
   There are several solutions to this problem: more botanical (ungrazed) reserves should be established; reserves should be enlarged to reduce the stocking density of elephants; and elephant and other game farming should be encouraged as an alternative to goat-farming outside reserves.

AB The number of invasions by non-native species and their negative impacts is increasing, especially in developing megadiverse countries. The current catalogue of hypotheses, concepts and management policies related to invasions was typically created and evaluated in temperate and economically rich regions. So what we know about invasion biology may not provide a general pattern applicable to developing megadiverse regions. All recent reviews have indicated a demand for more studies in tropical and megadiverse regions. Additionally, potential differences in the quality and availability of data may preclude any comparative analyses between developing and developed nations and hinder global strategies to combat invasions. Therefore, it is important to synthesize the existing knowledge on the subject in order to aid conservation activities in such regions. We conducted a systematic review of non-native species and invasions in Brazil and found geographical bias towards the most populated regions and biomes. Plants and fish were the most studied groups and were, for the most part, intentionally introduced, usually to meet some economic interest. We also noted the dominance of studies concerning terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Most studies did not address species interactions and, in the few cases where they did, the most frequently studied were between non-native and native species. There was a paucity of research beyond the level of species records and descriptive patterns. We highlight major vectors of introduction, the number of non-native species (proxy to colonization pressure) and papers (proxy to propagule pressure) related to each vector and the need for designed surveys and experiments focusing on specific invasion hypotheses and/or species interactions. We indicate major gaps and biases nationally that should be the focus for future studies, and that can serve as examples for other megadiverse countries.

AB In this paper, we investigate how climate, land use, habitat characteristics, and socioeconomic activities contribute to predict the current potential distributions of the "100 among the world's worst invasive alien species". We calculated the predictive power of each of the 41 variables for the 95 species including a large number of plants, vertebrates and invertebrates. We then calibrated the species distribution models with a set of appropriate variables for each invasive alien species to predict the potential distribution of these species and identify the major regions of origin of the invasive alien species. We found that climate variables were primarily predictors of the distribution of the global invaders studied. In addition, the habitat characteristics were also important predictors following by the socioeconomic variables such as the nearest distance to airports, seaports and human population density. We show that the potential areas at the highest risk of invasions from these species are located in Western Europe, Eastern United States, Central America, the eastern coast of Australia, and some Indonesian islands. We argue that these potential hotspots of invasions should be monitored in priority to prevent new invasions from these species. This study provides evidence of the importance of considering both habitat characteristics, socioeconomic and climate change factors for the current and future predictions of biological invasions.

AB Like many of the world's subtropical regions, southern Africa is highly sensitive to changes in the earth's climate system, but a dearth of reliable palaeoenvironmental records means that relatively little is known about how regional environments have been affected over centennial to multi-millennial timescales. To a large extent this sensitivity is a function of the position of these regions at the interface between temperate and tropical circulation systems. The resulting seasonality and irregularity of rainfall have limited the development of suitable archives, such as lakes and wetlands, for the preservation of palaeoenvironmental proxies.
   This paper reviews and evaluates the value of rock hyrax middens as novel palaeoenvironmental archives in southern Africa. Considered are (1) the contemporary taxonomy, distribution and ecology of hyraxes, (2) the mechanisms of hyrax midden development, their physical and chemical structure, rates of accumulation and age; and (3) the palaeoenvironmental proxies preserved within hyrax middens, including fossil pollen, stable isotopes and biomarkers. The interpretive constraints and opportunities offered by these various midden characteristics are assessed with a view to demonstrating the potential of these deposits, widespread as they are through arid and semi-arid southern Africa, in providing a more detailed and chronologically resolved view of late Quaternary palaeoenvironments across the subcontinent.

AB The rapidly increasing area of tree plantations, especially in the tropics and subtropics, has raised expectations and concerns as to their impact on ecosystem services. We studied the effect of the establishment of eucalyptus and pine plantations on local people's social valuations of ecosystem services in a case study in Uruguay. We also assessed the social and political restrictions that might limit the establishment of new markets for ecosystem services. Our study showed that the rapid change in land use in Uruguay over the past 20 years, from grassland to plantations, has affected people's perceptions of landscape's capacity to produce ecosystem services. The ecosystem services of plantations that showed the greatest discrepancy between local people's valuations and both recognition by experts and current scientific evidence were biodiversity, water effects, and carbon cycling. We found that in particular regulating services, and some provisioning ones, are quite well recognized by substance specialists, but are sometimes rather unfamiliar to the general public. The proper planning of plantations may improve the provision of ecosystem services, such as biodiversity enhancement, wood availability for fire and energy, water quality, and carbon sequestration, while at the same time diluting some others. The selection of ecosystem services to be taken into account in plantation management depends both on local cultural values and on the particular environmental pressures considered to be most in need of mitigation.

AB 1. Simple indices based on the number of encounters with a study object are used throughout ecology, conservation and natural resource management (e.g. indices of abundance used in animal surveys or catch per unit effort (CPUE) data in fisheries management). All forms of encounter data arise through the interaction of two sets of behaviours: those of the data generators and those of the data collectors. Analyses of encounter data are prone to bias when these behaviours do not conform to the assumptions used to model them.
   2. We review the use of CPUE indices derived from patrol data, which have been promoted for the study of rule-breaking in conservation, highlighting potential sources of bias and noting how similar problems have been tackled for other forms of encounter data.
   3. We identify several issues that must be addressed for analyses of patrol data to provide useful information, including the definition of suitable measures of catch and effort, the choice of appropriate temporal and spatial scales, the provision of suitable incentives for ranger patrols and the recording of sufficient information to describe the spatial pattern of sampling. The same issues are also relevant to encounter data more generally.
   4. Synthesis and applications. This review describes a common conceptual framework for understanding encounter data, based on the interactions that produce them. We anticipate that an appreciation of these commonalities will lead to improvements in the analysis of encounter data in several fields, by highlighting the existence of methodological approaches that could be more widely applied, and important characteristics of these data that have so far been neglected.

AB Customary management systems (i.e., management systems that limit the use of marine resources), such as rotational fisheries closures, can limit harvest of resources. Nevertheless, the explicit goals of customary management are often to influence fish behavior (in particular flight distance, i.e., distance at which an organism begins to flee an approaching threat), rather than fish abundance. We explored whether the flight distance of reef fishes targeted by local artisanal fishers differed between a customary closure and fished reefs. We also examined whether flight distance of these species affected fishing success and accuracy of underwater visual census (UVC) between customary closed areas and areas open to fishing. Several species demonstrated significant differences in flight distance between areas, indicating that fishing activity may increase flight distance. These relatively long flight distances mean that in fished areas most target species may stay out of the range of spear fishers. In addition, mean flight distances for all species both inside and outside the customary-closure area were substantially smaller than the observation distance of an observer conducting a belt-transect UVC (mean [SE] = 8.8 m [0.48]). For targeted species that showed little ability to evade spear fishers, customary closures may be a vital management technique. Our results show that customary closures can have a substantial, positive effect on resource availability and that conventional UVC techniques may be insensitive to changes in flight behavior of fishes associated with fishing. We argue that short, periodic openings of customary closures may allow the health of the fish community to be maintained and local fishers to effectively harvest fishes.

AB The outstanding diversity of biota of the Cape region is expressed differently in major groups: flowering plants and bees show high species richness in few clades combined with high endemism and remarkable functional adaptations; mammals and reptiles have a rich diversity of distinct intra-specific genetic lineages; and fresh-water fish are characterized by a high level of endemism but a low local species richness. Diversification has been promoted by the physical complexity of the Cape environment, as well as biotic interactions, such as those between bees and flowering plants. Endemism has been promoted by the uniqueness of local climate and soils, and, in the case of fishes, by the history of connections between the short Cape river systems. Maintenance of Cape biodiversity requires that key environmental factors that promote diversification are identified and retained.

AB Rimicaris exoculata dominates the megafauna of several Mid-Atlantic Ridge hydrothermal sites. Its gut is full of sulphides and iron-oxide particles and harbours microbial communities. Although a trophic symbiosis has been suggested, their role remains unclear. In vivo starvation experiments in pressurized vessels were performed on shrimps from Rainbow and Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse sites in order to expel the transient gut contents. Microbial communities associated with the gut of starved and reference shrimps were compared using 16S rRNA gene libraries and microscopic observations (light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy and FISH analyses). We show that the gut microbiota of shrimps from both sites included mainly Deferribacteres, Mollicutes, Epsilon- and Gammaproteobacteria. For the first time, we have observed filamentous bacteria, inserted between microvilli of gut epithelial cells. They remained after starvation periods in empty guts, suggesting the occurrence of a resident microbial community. The bacterial community composition was the same regardless of the site, except for Gammaproteobacteria retrieved only in Rainbow specimens. We observed a shift in the composition of the microbiota of long-starved specimens, from the dominance of Deferribacteres to the dominance of Gammaproteobacteria. These results reinforce the hypothesis of a symbiotic relationship between R. exoculata and its gut epibionts.

AB Ant communities often consist of many species with apparently similar niches. We present a mathematical model of the dominance-discovery trade-off, the trade-off between the abilities to find and to control resources, showing that it can in principle facilitate the coexistence of large numbers of species. Baiting studies of dominance and discovery abilities in an ant community from the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona indicate that real communities fail to fit the assumptions of the simple model in several ways: ( 1) dominance depends on the size of the food resource; ( 2) for some ants, dominance depends on the presence or absence of specialist parasitoids; ( 3) pairwise dominance is not an all-or-nothing trait; and ( 4) a consistent negative relationship between pairwise differences in per capita discovery rates and dominance can be detected for only one bait type. Extended models incorporating these factors successfully predict the coexistence of five of the six most abundant members of this community but fail to accurately predict their relative abundances. Sensitivity analysis indicates that each complicating factor enhances the extent of coexistence.

TI A rapid assessment of the invasive status of Eucalyptus species in two
   South African provinces
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Gum trees, or eucalypts (Eucalyptus species), have been targeted for invasive alien plant clearing programmes in many parts of South Africa. This has caused some dissatisfaction where the species concerned also have useful characteristics, and stakeholders contend that some of these useful species are not invasive. A rapid assessment of the invasive status of Eucalyptus species at 82 sites in South Africa (54 in the Western Cape and 28 in Mpumalanga) indicated that only Red River gum (E. camaidutensis) and flooded gum (E. grandis) are clearly invasive. Surveys were not undertaken in parts of the Western Cape known to be invaded by spider gum (E. lehmannii); the invasive status of this species is well known and is not contested. Red River gum has transformed long stretches of rivers and its importance as a major weed has been underestimated in previous reviews of alien plant invasions in South Africa. Most other species were naturalized. We recommend that projects aimed at clearing eucalypts should focus on riparian areas and nature reserves (where all eucalypts have deleterious effects), but that clearing projects outside these areas should only target species known to be invasive until such time as the invasive status of the other eucalypts (notably sugar gum, E. cladocalyx, and karri, E. diversicolor) can be ascertained with a greater degree of confidence.

AB The accumulation of selected N, K, and P forms in soils within three perennial colonies of black cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) and grey heron (Ardea cinerea) located in northern and eastern Poland were investigated. Soil samples were collected beneath the nests from the most representative for each colony plots. Control samples were taken outside the colonies within sites adjacent to the nesting areas but not affected by bird excrement. From each genetic horizon (20 horizons) in soil profiles, a cumulative sample of about 25-30 kg of soil was taken for analysis. Nitrogen by Kjeldahl, ammonium ions (N-NH4), nitrates (N-NO3), exchangeable potassium (K-ex), available potassium (K-av), and available phosphorus (P-av) were determined. The soils affected by birds demonstrated a very strong enrichment with N, K, and P in comparison to the control sites, especially in the topsoil horizons. The content of N-NH4 in individual soil horizons from the colonies was from 1.7 to 10.1 times higher than the respective control, N-NO3 from 2.9 to 215.7, K-ex from 2.0 to 35.1, K-av from 1.1 to 48.1, and P-av in the range from 2.4 to 53.0 times. The highest increment of chemical elements was noticeable in the soils of territories inhabited by cormorants and the least in forest occupied by herons. Some relationships between soil texture and accumulation of biogenic nutrients were determined. Clay loam soil showed the greatest enrichment with analysed forms of elements with the exception of N-NH4. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the 21st century, aquaculture is generally characterized as a foe to conservation efforts. Yet, much has changed in the two seemingly disparate practices over the last two decades, motivating an updated evaluation of the scientific evidence for how aquaculture currently impacts conservation, as well as prospects for further alignment and research. Here we present a new perspective on conservation aquaculture, which we redefine as "the use of human cultivation of an aquatic organism for the planned management and protection of a natural resource." Looking across scales of conservation aquaculture that include single species to ecosystem level benefits (and limitations), we highlight ways aquaculture has historically, and is currently being integrated into conservation (e.g., habitat restoration of oyster beds) and areas that could be improved for the protection of critical species and habitats (e.g., aquarium trade of coral reef species). With a more strategic focus, there appears to be notable conservation aquaculture potential via the cultivation of species for harvest that could provide wild harvest alleviation through replacement or supplement particularly for over-exploited species and/or ecosystem services, such as improved water quality and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry on the planet, aligning farming practices with conservation objectives is particularly pressing to ensure that growth happens in the service of conservation in the most effective and sustainable way possible. The sheer potential of conservation aquaculture suggests a tale of redemption for aquaculture and opportunity for conservationists to bring in a new age of collaborative practices to address global issues.

AB Larval dispersal by ocean currents is a critical component of systematic marine protected area (MPA) design. However, there is a lack of quantitative methods to incorporate larval dispersal in support of increasingly diverse management objectives, including local population persistence under multiple types of threats (primarily focused on larval retention within and dispersal between protected locations) and benefits to unprotected populations and fisheries (primarily focused on larval export from protected locations to fishing grounds). Here, we present a flexible MPA design approach that can reconcile multiple such potentially conflicting management objectives by balancing various associated treatments of larval dispersal information. We demonstrate our approach based on alternative dispersal patterns, combinations of threats to populations, management objectives, and two different optimization strategies (site vs. network-based). Our outcomes highlight a consistently high effectiveness in selecting priority locations that are self-replenishing, inter-connected, and/or important larval sources. We find that the opportunity to balance these three dispersal attributes flexibly can help not only to prevent meta-population collapse, but also to ensure effective fisheries recovery, with average increases in the number of recruits at fishing grounds at least two times higher than achieved by standard habitat-based or ad-hoc MPA designs. Future applications of our MPA design approach should therefore be encouraged, specifically where management tools other than MPAs are not feasible.

AB Biofloc technology is considered as a method that degrades organic waste by microorganisms and produces microbial flocs. A 30-day experiment was performed to investigate the effects of partial replacement of daily feeding intake with biofloc on the growth performances, digestive enzymes activity and liver histology of the common carp Cyprinus carpio L. fingerlings. Two hundred and eight healthy fingerlings (58.6 +/- A 0.2 g) were randomly distributed in 12 tanks (30 L) at a density of 25.4 kg m(-3) and fed experimental treatments (100 % daily feeding rate as a control, biofloc + 75 % daily feeding rate, biofloc + 50 % daily feeding rate, biofloc + 25 % daily feeding rate). At the end of experiment, the results indicated that the highest weight gain was observed in the fish fed BFT 75 % and control which differed significantly from those fed BFT 25 % (P < 0.05). Diet BFT 75 % improved total protease and pepsin activity compared with BFT 25 and 50 % (P > 0.05). No significant difference was observed in case of lipase, amylase and alkaline phosphatase activity between the treatments. In the liver, histological alterations were found in the treatments, and feeding the fish with BFT 75 % significantly improved hepatocellular quantification and qualification than the other groups. The results obtained in this experiment suggest that the biofloc improves growth performances, digestive enzyme activity and liver condition of the common carp fingerlings when 25 % of daily feeding rate (BFT 75 %) was replaced with one carbohydrate such as molasses in zero-water exchange system.

AB Different marine species and their larvae have characteristics that can expand or contract their potential dispersal, which can add complexity to the management of species assemblages. Here we used a multi-scale biophysical modeling framework, the Connectivity Modeling System, for the analysis of network connectivity for 5 Caribbean coral reef-associated species in order to gauge similarities and dissimilarities among species as well as among Caribbean regions. We estimated local dispersal and retention to assess regional exchanges, and our results revealed that the population structures of coral and fish are different and should thus have dissimilar management requirements in many regions, with some notable exceptions. Populations of Porites astreoides corals appear fragmented, suggesting that loss of adult colonies in any region may significantly impact regional recruitment success and connectivity. At the other end of the spectrum, populations of bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum are highly connected, and removal of adults in any single region would not imply future recruitment failure in that region. We suggest using a 'diversity of exogenous settlement' index as a proxy of recolonization potential, which is related to the stability of regional connectivity networks. We demonstrate that resolving multispecies larval transport dynamics helps identify regions of both network stability for multi-generational connectivity (e.g. stable larval sources and corridors) pertinent to regional-level management and network inconsistencies among species which are pertinent to the success of local management.

AB Although research on population carrying capacity has made significant progress, research on urban carrying capacity still has a weak theoretical basis and uses, imperfect regulation mechanisms and estimation methods. This study proposes a new method for evaluating urban population carrying capacity based on spatial analysis with GIS, which utilizes spatial classification and spatial grading of land use. The results demonstrate that urban construction and industrial development subspaces have most of the population, accounting for about 86.4% of the total population carrying capacity, across 40.7% of the total land area. Therefore, urban construction and industrial development subspaces are the centers of the population concentration, industrial agglomeration and wealth concentration in the Shanghai metropolis. The agricultural production and ecological protection subspaces, as noncommercial and ecological conservation areas of the metropolis, should not carry too much industrial development or added-value activities. In addition, under the current conditions of socio-economic and technological development in China, the gross population carrying capacity of Shanghai is estimated to be about 27.1732-30.3308 million persons, based on 2009 data. The actual population of Shanghai was 22.1028 million persons in 2009; thus, the population can continue to grow before reaching the population carrying capacity. The estimation in this paper takes into account both the internal disparities in carrying capacity of heterogeneous land spaces and composite factors such as natural resources, the environment, economic resources and social resources. Consequently, this method not only addresses defects in the existing research and estimation methods but also improves the credibility of the estimate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Marine species in the Indo-Pacific have ranges that can span thousands of kilometres, yet studies increasingly suggest that mean larval dispersal distances are less than historically assumed. Gene flow across these ranges must therefore rely to some extent on larval dispersal among intermediate stepping-stone populations in combination with long-distance dispersal far beyond the mean of the dispersal kernel. We evaluate the strength of stepping-stone dynamics by employing a spatially explicit biophysical model of larval dispersal in the tropical Pacific to construct hypotheses for dispersal pathways. We evaluate these hypotheses with coalescent models of gene flow among high-island archipelagos in four neritid gastropod species. Two of the species live in the marine intertidal, while the other two are amphidromous, living in fresh water but retaining pelagic dispersal. Dispersal pathways predicted by the biophysical model were strongly favoured in 16 of 18 tests against alternate hypotheses. In regions where connectivity among high-island archipelagos was predicted as direct, there was no difference in gene flow between marine and amphidromous species. In regions where connectivity was predicted through stepping-stone atolls only accessible to marine species, gene flow estimates between high-island archipelagos were significantly higher in marine species. Moreover, one of the marine species showed a significant pattern of isolation by distance consistent with stepping-stone dynamics. While our results support stepping-stone dynamics in Indo-Pacific species, we also see evidence for nonequilibrium processes such as range expansions or rare long-distance dispersal events. This study couples population genetic and biophysical models to help to shed light on larval dispersal pathways.

AB Heavy infestations of a non-indigenous shrub, Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) are frequently linked to poor individual performance and reduced species diversity. We used chronosequence methods and analysis of forest strata to investigate potential impacts of L. maackii on 1) species richness, 2) density of sub-canopy recruitment layers, 3) indicator species affinity, and 4) within- and among-strata compositional similarities. We compared sites ranging from 12 to 26 years since initial invasion as well as non-invaded, control sites. When assessing non-invaded versus long-invaded sites, we found significantly (P <= 0.05) reduced densities in the herb (-57%), seedling (-58%), and sapling layers (-90%), and also reduced species richness in the seedling (-34%), and sapling (-58%), and herbaceous layers (-4%). Interestingly, the germinable seed bank density showed significant increases among non-invaded and long-invaded sites (+78%), while the species richness of the seed bank demonstrated a marked decrease (-41%). Indicator species analysis found that most species had greater frequencies and abundances in non-invaded sites, and nearly all species had greater affinities for the non-invaded sites, especially in the seedling, sapling, and seed bank layers. Responses were species-specific in the herbaceous layer. Within-layer species similarity decreased with increased time of L. maackii occupancy in all sub-canopy strata. This pattern was also found with reductions in between-layer compositional similarity for the long-invaded (r = 0.16) versus the recently-invaded (r = 0.37) and non-invaded (r = 0.51) sites. Our data suggest that in many invaded sites, habitats are experiencing wholesale alterations in species composition, structure, and successional trajectory, and invasion may also change competitive interactions in forest understories as well as alter between-layer species linkages. These results validate the candidacy of L. maackii sites for increased removal and restoration efforts.

TI Towards the 2012 marine protected area targets in Eastern Africa
SO OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CORAL; RESERVES; POPULATIONS; BENEFITS
AB The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity has set ambitious targets for the establishment and management of protected areas. For the oceans, the overall aim is to establish, by 2012, an effectively managed, representative, global system of marine protected areas (MPAs) covering 10% of all marine ecological regions, comprising both multiple use areas and strictly protected areas. An analysis of data for three countries in Eastern Africa, where considerable efforts to promote MPAs by many agencies have been made over the past decade, shows that rapid progress has been made towards achieving this target. Since the first MPAs were established in the 1960s and 1970s, 8.7% of the continental shelf in Kenya, 8.1% in Tanzania and 4.0% in Mozambique has been designated, with the size of recently protected sites markedly larger than earlier sites. Commitments to expand the MPA networks in these countries would, if implemented, largely achieve the 10% coverage target. The location of existing marine protected areas shows good correlation with known sites of high species diversity; and coral reefs and Important Bird Areas are well represented. Management effectiveness of MPAs is also improving. However, there are major constraints to meeting the MPA target in these countries. Many habitats and species are not yet fully represented, the area closed to fishing is less than the recommended 20-30%, and capacity building is needed to improve many aspects of management. Furthermore, despite considerable investment in monitoring of coral reefs and other coastal habitats, the data available do not show clearly whether biodiversity and socioeconomic objectives are being met. Although East African countries need to be congratulated for their vision, the results thus far indicate the urgency of both improving monitoring systems for measuring progress towards the targets, and also taking further steps to expand and improve management of existing MPAs.

AB Wildfires are an increasing threat to tropical rainforests, yet little is known about their effects on fruit production and forest wildlife. We examined the effects of both single and recurrent wildfires on fruit production and large vertebrate abundance in a central Amazonian terra firme forest for 3 years following a large fire event. The estimated mortality of 42 and 74% of stems >= 10 cm in once- and twice-burnt forest led to a substantial loss of fruiting tree basal area (29 and 62% were lost in once- and twice-burnt forest, respectively) and crown coverage of fruiting woody lianas (89 and 97% were lost in once- and twice-burnt forest, respectively). Some important tree families producing fleshy fruits were less abundant than expected in once- and twice-burnt forest, suggesting that tree mortality was non-random in terms of species composition. Asynchronous fruit production was affected, and burnt forest transects sustained a much lower fruiting basal area, and fewer fruiting species during the dry season period of fruit scarcity. The number of fruiting trees in once- and twice-burnt forest was higher than the number predicted from actual levels of tree mortality recorded in each fire disturbance treatment, suggesting some surviving trees which may have benefited from higher irradiance levels and lower competition for resources. Many large frugivores and other vertebrate species declined in response to single fires, and most primary forest specialists were extirpated from twice-burnt forest, which sustained a higher number of species associated with second growth and other disturbed habitats.

AB Environmental policies in African rangelands affect development and welfare as well as environmental measures. Biodiversity is widely perceived as declining, and environments as undergoing degradation, through rural population growth and resource use. These assumptions are often underpinned by environmental discourses contesting control of natural resources, rather than by objectively measured trends and causalities. Orthodox biodiversity conservation policy advocates fortress conservation. Savanna species do better where they can disperse across wider landscapes with conservation-compatible rural land uses, rather than isolated in protected areas, but community-based conservation initiatives have been disappointing. Policies addressing land degradation, and their underlying assumptions, are subject to similar challenges. The paper outlines a natural experiment investigating biodiversity and land cover changes 1975-1995 for 100,000 km(2) cross-border rangeland including the Serengeti-Mara conservation areas and their buffer zones. Ecological, ethnic and micro-economic continuities make it possible to control for confounding factors and identify main drivers of change. Privatisation of formerly communal rangeland, and its conversion to commercial monoculture, have driven drastic land cover and wildlife declines in Kenya. Population growth and agropastoral land use were not significant factors. The gap between natural and social science, and western versus local understandings, needs bridging to achieve more effective environmental policy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Community-level approaches to biological conservation are now recognized as a major advance in most current single-species conservation and management practices. Existing approaches for modeling bio-logical communities, have limited utility, however, because they commonly examine community metrics (e.g., species richness, assemblage "types") and consequently do not consider the identity of the species that compose the community. This is a critical shortcoming because the functional differences among species ultimately translate into the differential vulnerability of biological communities to natural and human-related environmental change. To address this concern I present a novel, species-specific approach to modeling communities using a multiresponse, artificial neural network. This provides an analytical approach that facilitates the development of a single, integrative model that predicts the entire species membership of a community while still respecting differences in the functional relationship between each species and its environment. I used temperate-lake fish communities to illustrate the utility of this modeling approach and found that predictions of community composition by the neural network were highly concordant with observed compositions of the 286 study lakes. Average similarity between observed and predicted community composition was 80% (22 out of the 27 species correctly classified), and the model predicted a significant portion of the community composition in 91% of the lakes. I discuss the importance of the lake habitat variables for predicting community composition and explore the spatial distribution of model predictions in light of recent species invasions. The proposed modeling approach provides a powerful, quantitative tool for developing community predictive models that explicitly consider species membership, and thus each species' functional role in the community. Such models will contribute significantly to the study and conservation of biological communities.

ID ENVIRONMENTS; ALASKA; FLUX
AB During the austral summers of 1999 and 2000, we made measurements of methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from tundra soils in maritime Antarctica, using a static open chamber technique. N2O and CH4 fluxes from the non-ornithogenic moss soils averaged 0.8 and -8.7 mug m(-2) h(-1), respectively, in the summer of 1999 and 1.4 and 26.7 mug m(-2) h(-1), respectively, in the summer of 2000. N2O flux from the ornithogenic soils was approximately two orders of magnitude greater than that from moss soils and averaged 89.7 mug m(-2) h(-1), and CH4 flux was approximately one order of magnitude greater and averaged 227.9 mug m(-2) h(-1), indicating that high organic carbon and nitrogen compound of penguin droppings deposition in the soils resulted in high CH4 and N2O emissions as a result of biologic transformation. The relationships between the fluxes and environmental factors were discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anthropogenic perturbations to the global nitrogen (N) cycle now exceed those to any other major biogeochemical cycle on Earth, yet our ability to predict how ecosystems will respond to the rapidly changing N cycle is still poor. While northern temperate forest ecosystems have seen the greatest changes in N inputs from the atmosphere, other biomes, notably semi-arid and tropical regions of the globe, are now experiencing increases in N deposition. These systems are even less well understood than temperate forests, and are likely to respond to excess N in markedly different ways. Here, we present a new integrated terrestrial biophysics-biogeochemical process model, TerraFlux, and use this model to test the relative importance of factors that may strongly influence the productivity response of both humid tropical and semi-arid systems to anthropogenic N deposition. These include hydrological losses of dissolved inorganic and organic N, as well as multiple nutrient interactions with deposited inorganic N along the hydrological pathway. Our results suggest that N-rich tropical forests may have reduced productivity following excess N deposition. Our simulations of semi-arid systems show increases in productivity following N inputs if water availability is sufficient and water losses are moderate. The most important model controls over the carbon cycle response in each simulation were interactions that are not represented in the most common terrestrial ecosystem models. These include parameters that control soil solute transport and nutrient resorption by plants. Rather than attempt prognostic simulations, we use TerraFlux to highlight a variety of ecological and biogeochemical processes that are poorly understood but which appear central to understanding ecosystem response to excess N.

AB Early drying of pools on a granite escarpment in subtropical south-eastern Botswana is a major threat to pool biota through abortive hatching. The fairy shrimp Branchipodopsis wolfi is a striking inhabitant of these small rock pools. Both in the laboratory and in the field, egg bank characteristics have been noted which may aid in the species persistence in this unpredictable environment. Delayed hatching of part of the egg bank may serve as a hedge against subsequent drought-related reproductive failure. Under laboratory conditions (27 degrees C), hatching continued for 16 hydration/drying cycles. Emergence was cued by light, conductivity and temperature. Within a temperature range of 5-30 degrees C, maximal hatching (up to 80 %) occurred at 15 degrees C, which is below the average temperature (27/28 degrees C) during the rainy season. Low hatching (<10%) at natural average temperatures probably reflects limited averaged chances for successful recruitment. Only at sub-optimal temperatures for hatching was there a significant negative effect (p < 0.05) of increasing conductivity in the natural range of 5-60 mu S/cm. Low temperature and conductivity values, which occur when pool basins fill, are reliable cues for synchronising the life cycle of B. wolfi to the short suitable growth period. Eggs, furthermore, only responded to the initial incubation temperature, restricting hatching to the early phases of filling or dilution with additional rains. Extra hatching of immersed eggs or dried eggs on the edges of the pools was associated with a decrease in conductivity after additional rainfall. In spite of the frequent nightly rains, emergence is almost entirely inhibited in darkness. This light requirement is believed to prevent hatching of buried eggs as confirmed by laboratory simulations. Egg banks with conditional responsiveness to cues, restricting hatching to initial or additional rains, result in an association between hatching and the likelihood of completing a life: cycle.

AB We examined size-related dietary patterns in a Queensland population of the Australian freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnstoni). In three consecutive dry seasons, we stomach flushed crocodiles (n = 324) to record the numerical frequency and percent occurrence of prey items, Prey included spiders, aquatic insects, terrestrial insects, shrimp, fish, anurans, turtles, snakes, mammals, and birds. The diet of C. johnstoni showed ontogenetic shifts as the cranium broadened and once body size exceeded 60 cm SVL. With increasing crocodile size, the ingestion of spiders, insects, and anurans declined strongly whereas the consumption of fish, turtles, and snakes increased strongly, Shrimp were eaten at low and variable levels by all size classes of crocodile, The low overall prevalence of mammals and birds suggested that they were consumed opportunistically by the larger crocodiles, With increasing crocodile size, there were overall increases in prey richness and significant declines in realized dietary niche, dietary breadth, and mean number of prey items per crocodile. There were no significant changes in dietary diversity, evenness, or number of equally common prey species.

Diseases such as Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and avian influenza cause economic losses at the global level and jeopardize diplomatic relations between countries. As wildlife are the source of at least 70% of all emerging diseases and given the on-going concerns associated with wildlife trade as a disease transmission mechanism, we provide a 'global snapshot' of the legal trade in live wild animals and take stock of the potential health risks that it poses to global human health. Our analysis showed that 11,569,796 individual live wild animals, representing 1316 different species were exported from 189 different countries between 2012 and 2016. China was the largest exporter of live mammals (with 98,979 animals representing 58.7% of global trade). Nicaragua was the largest exporter of live amphibians (with 122,592 animals representing 53.8% of global trade). South Africa was the largest exporter of live birds (with 889,607 animals representing 39.2% of global trade). Peru was the largest exporter of live reptiles (with 1,675,490 animals representing 18.8% of global trade). Our analysis showed that mostly the USA and other high-income countries, the largest importers, drive the live animal trade. High-income countries and not the countries where wildlife diseases and pathogens are more likely to occur reported almost all of the disease reports to the World Organisation for Animal Health. Based on our findings, we discuss how maximising trade bans; working on human behaviour change and improving regulatory efforts to improve surveillance will decrease the risk of future pandemics, epidemics and outbreaks.

ID VEGETATION HEALTH
AB Nearly, a quarter of the world's population does not have enough food for normal living and nearly 1 billion people become hungry every year. One of the reasons for undernourishment and hunger is drought, which reduces agricultural production leading to food insecurity situation. In half of the years of the twenty-first century, drought was the main cause of shortage in world grain production compared to its consumption, creating problem with food security. In November 2017, a new generation of NOAA operational satellite, JPSS-1, with VIIRS instrument on board was launched. Regarding land cover monitoring, the system was designed to advance drought detection, and improve prediction of grain loss using the highest resolution vegetation health (VH) method. The VIIRS-based VH will detect drought early, monitor accurately at 0.5km(2) resolution, provide drought intensity, duration and predict agricultural loss 2 months ahead of crop harvest. Such early estimates will predict food security situation. Examples in this article prove high accuracy of vegetation health assessment, drought-triggered crop stress and the resulting grain production loss. These applications provide 2-4 months of advanced predictions of global food insecurity and early assessments of food assistance for the countries in need.

AB Aim: To delineate bioregions in tropical Africa and determine whether different plant growth forms (trees, terrestrial herbs, lianas and shrubs) display the same pattern of regionalization, diversity and endemism as the whole flora.
   Location: Tropical Africa (excl. Madagascar), from 20 degrees N to 25 degrees S.
   Taxon: Vascular plants.
   Methods: Analyses were based on occurrences of 24,719 vascular plant species distributed across tropical Africa extracted from the RAINBIO database. The majority of species (93%) were classified into four growth forms: terrestrial herbs, trees, shrubs and lianas. Biogeographical regions (bioregions) were delimited using a bipartite network clustering approach on the whole dataset and then separately for each growth form. Relationships among bioregions were investigated using non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination, flora nestedness and endemism patterns.
   Results: Analyses of the whole dataset identified 16 bioregions and 11 transition zones. These were congruent with most of the currently recognized phytogeographical classifications, and also highlighted previously under-recognized bioregions. Bioregion endemism rates were lower and species richness higher when compared to estimates from the White/Association pour l'Etude Taxonomique de la Flore d'Afrique Tropicale (AETFAT) classification. Analysed separately, plant growth forms showed contrasting geographical patterns. Bioregionalization was better resolved for closed forest types using trees and lianas and for open vegetation types using terrestrial herbs, while shrubs showed good discriminative power in all vegetation types.
   Main conclusions: We show that distribution patterns based on solely trees are not sufficient to define floristic bioregions in tropical Africa. Analyses of spatial patterns using different growth forms are complementary, likely reflecting different evolutionary processes and ecological relationships. The contribution of growth forms to delimit geographical floristic patterns across tropical Africa is of critical importance for land use planning and management, and for selecting priority conservation areas.

AB AimTerrestrial invertebrates comprise a large proportion of alien species world-wide, yet a quantitative global synthesis of their effects on native species and ecosystems has not been explored. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the ecological impacts of terrestrial invertebrate invaders and to test how impacts are modulated by the invader's trophic position, habitat attributes (i.e. insularity and disturbance) and the study methodology (observational versus experimental).
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe investigated the effects of terrestrial invertebrate invaders on populations, communities and ecosystems by conducting a random effects meta-analysis using 112 articles reporting data from 710 field and laboratory studies. The analysis included 16 insect, 11 earthworm, 7 slug and 1 nematode invaders.
   ResultsOn average, across invaders, the presence of invaders reduced plant fitness (52%), animal diversity (33%) and animal abundance (29%). Leaf litter decomposition was 41% higher in the presence of invaders, while other ecosystem-level variables such as nutrient cycling were not affected in a consistent direction. Invasive predators and detritivores decreased animal abundance, whereas herbivores and omnivores had limited impacts. Single invaders increased soil nitrogen pools while multiple species did not. Insularity and disturbance did not affect the magnitude of the impacts significantly, mainly because there was a large variation among studies.
   Main conclusionsOverall, our study indicates that terrestrial invertebrate invaders have significant consistent effects on populations, communities and ecosystems, with islands and disturbed sites not being more prone to impacts. However, effects vary considerably depending on the type of impact being examined and the trophic position of the invader. There is no evidence that invaders cause larger impacts when multiple species of invaders, rather than single invaders, are involved.

AB Microbiota presumably plays an essential role in inhibiting pathogen colonization and in the maintenance of health in oysters, but limited data exist concerning their different growth phases and conditions. We analyzed the bacterial microbiota composition of two commercial oysters: Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea corteziensis. Differences in microbiota were assayed in three growth phases: post-larvae at the hatchery, juvenile, and adult at two grow-out cultivation sites. Variations in the microbiota were assessed by PCR analysis of the 16S rRNA gene in DNA extracted from depurated oysters. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles were studied using Dice's similarity coefficient (Cs) and statistical principal component analysis (PCA). The microbiota composition was determined by sequencing temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) bands. The RFLP analysis of post-larvae revealed homology in the microbiota of both oyster species (Cs > 88 %). Dice and PCA analyses of C. corteziensis but not C. gigas showed differences in the microbiota according to the cultivation sites. The sequencing analysis revealed low bacterial diversity (primarily beta-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Spirochaetes), with Burkholderia cepacia being the most abundant bacteria in both oyster species. This study provides the first description of the microbiota in C. corteziensis, which was shown to be influenced by cultivation site conditions. During early growth, we observed that B. cepacia colonized and remained strongly associated with the two oysters, probably in a symbiotic host-bacteria relationship. This association was maintained in the three growth phases and was not altered by environmental conditions or the management of the oysters at the grow-out site.

AB The view that biodiversity-rich areas partially or largely managed by local residents, sometimes referred to as community-conserved areas (CCAs), can be effective in biological conservation has gained considerable ground over the past decade. In this paper, we review available scientific information on the conservation effectiveness of such areas globally. We compiled studies undertaken during the last 5 years (2004-2009) that use quantifiable ecological attributes to: (1) compare CCAs with strictly protected areas (SPAs); (2) compare CCAs with open-access ecosystems and (3) study trends in biological attributes of CCAs over time. We found that there were few consistent differences in diversity/species richness of flora or fauna protected under the two types of management or in deforestation rates. However, CCAs tend to harbour a species complement distinct from that of SPAs and show lowered abundances of monitored taxa that are of conservation importance. CCAs conserve biological values more effectively than open-access areas. Also, biological values tend to decline in CCAs over time. We conclude that CCAs could represent a significant improvement over open-access areas in terms of conservation effectiveness, yet fall short of the needs of comprehensive biological conservation. While extremely few studies have been undertaken in India, the trends seen largely concur with global ones. This review, based on a limited sample size, is only a beginning, and is expected to serve as an invitation for further research to address both the question of biological effectiveness of diverse forest governance regimes as well as the socio-economic, demographic and institutional reasons underlying these differences.

AB P>1. Vegetation fires can have major social, economic and ecological consequences. Research into fire behaviour has aimed to give managers greater ability to predict and control fires. Fire and grazing are important and interacting disturbances in grasslands. Fire is known to widely affect grazing patterns, but the effects of grazing on the incidence of fire are less well known. There have been few tests of the idea that 'grazing reduces blazing', which has popular and political currency in some countries. This study addresses the hypothesis that grazing affects fire potential in native grasslands.
   2. Paired grazed and ungrazed quadrats were established at five lawn and five tussock grassland sites. Fuel load, percentage dead fuel and the number of days sustaining fires where possible were compared between treatments.
   3. In lawn grasslands, grazing markedly reduced fire potential through the removal of plant biomass and by preventing the vegetation escaping into the unpalatable and flammable tussock state. Grazing led to increased fire potential in tussock grasslands where animals selectively removed live shoots, leaving a high proportion of dead fuel.
   4. The difference in flammability responses to grazing between lawn and tussock grassland appeared to be due to differences in palatability that in turn may relate to soil fertility and the constancy of intense grazing. These differences mean that grazing lawns and tussock grasslands are likely to be subject to differing disturbance regimes. This association between disturbance regime and vegetation structural type suggests that lawns and tussock grasslands represent alternative stable states within the grassland ecosystem.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Grazing is only likely to reduce the probability of fire where the bulk of the vegetation consists of potential food for grazing animals. It is likely that the negative relationship between vegetation palatability and fire potential applies to grasslands generally and possibly to many other vegetation types. Grassland managers may need to manipulate disturbance regimes in order to maintain vegetation structural heterogeneity and thereby promote landscape-scale biodiversity.

AB This study evaluated the dynamics of bush cover in relation to the role played by seasonally grazed traditional enclosures compared to grazed rangelands. The result showed that herbaceous biomass was higher in enclosures than in the open grazed areas. Enclosures also showed more diversity and evenness of herbaceous species than open grazed areas. Herbaceous species richness declined with increased age of enclosures compared to the recent and medium age of enclosures. The frequencies of herbaceous species were relatively similar in both management and across enclosures age. A total of 26 herbaceous and 29 woody species were recorded within both enclosures and open grazed sites. Of the total woody plants, 38% of the species were invasive, while the rest (i.e. 62%) were non-invasive. Generally, grazed areas were less threatened by invasive species than enclosures. The density of invasive woody population (63.4% of the total density of woody population) was 2665 stems ha(-1). Commiphoro africana accounted for most of the increase in cover of woody population, on average contributing 86% to the total invasive woody cover in the study area. A reintroduction of fire is recommended together with the integration of traditional range enclosures in order to control invasion of bush encroachment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While many studies have investigated the link between primary productivity and species richness, the link between primary productivity and species abundance is still poorly understood. We explored how primary productivity, assessed by the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index, influenced density estimates in 13 African ungulate species. We found that primary productivity generally correlated positively with density estimates. However, this link was more pronounced for some species than for others, and information regarding the area surveyed needed to be taken into account to highlight this functional relationship. Detailed consideration of measurements of productivity in broadscale studies identify a general link between primary productivity and abundance of African ungulates and highlight remote-sensing-based analyses as a potentially crucial tool in assessing the population consequences of future changes in primary productivity on this continent.

AB To determine leopard Panthera pardus (Linnaeus) food habits in the Lope National Park in Gabon, Central Africa, 196 leopard scats were collected and analysed. Prey items were determined using undigested matter isolated from the scats, and a reference collection of hairs and bones from potential prey species. A minimum of 30 different prey species were identified, 27 of which were mammalian. Leopards preyed mainly on ungulates, which made up 59%, of the biomass consumed. Diurnal primates (18%) and large rodents (17%) were also heavily preyed upon. The mean prey weight estimated from scats was 29.2 kg. The most important single prey species was found to be red river hog Potamochoerus porcus (Linnaeus), making up 20% of the biomass consumed, followed by forest buffalo Syncerus caffer nanus (Boddaert) and cane rat Thryonomys swinderianus (Temminck), each comprising 13% of biomass consumed.

AB The phenotypic plasticity and the competitive ability of the invasive Acacia longifolia v. the indigenous Mediterranean dune species Halimium halimifolium and Pinus pinea were evaluated. In particular, we explored the hypothesis that phenotypic plasticity in response to biotic and abiotic factors explains the observed differences in competitiveness between invasive and native species. The seedlings' ability to exploit different resource availabilities was examined in a two factorial experimental design of light and nutrient treatments by analysing 20 physiological and morphological traits. Competitiveness was tested using an additive experimental design in combination with N-15-labelling experiments. Light and nutrient availability had only minor effects on most physiological traits and differences between species were not significant. Plasticity in response to changes in resource availability occurred in morphological and allocation traits, revealing A. longifolia to be a species of intermediate responsiveness. The major competitive advantage of A. longifolia was its constitutively high shoot elongation rate at most resource treatments and its effective nutrient acquisition. Further, A. longifolia was found to be highly tolerant against competition from native species. In contrast to common expectations, the competition experiment indicated that A. longifolia expressed a constant allocation pattern and a phenotypic plasticity similar to that of the native species.

AB Factors limiting tree invasion in the Inland Pampas of Argentina were studied by monitoring the establishment of four alien tree species in remnant grassland and cultivated forest stands. We tested whether disturbances facilitated tree seedling recruitment and survival once seeds of invaders were made available by hand sowing. Seed addition to grassland failed to produce seedlings of two study species, Ligustrum lucidum and Ulmus pumila, but did result in abundant recruitment of Gleditsia triacanthos and Prosopis caldenia. While emergence was sparse in intact grassland, seedling densities were significantly increased by canopy and soil disturbances. Longer-term surveys showed that only Gleditsia became successfully established in disturbed grassland. These results support the hypothesis that interference from herbaceous vegetation may play a significant role in slowing down tree invasion, whereas disturbances create microsites that can be exploited by invasive woody plants. Seed sowing in a Ligustrum forest promoted the emergence of all four study species in understorey and treefall gap conditions. Litter removal had species-specific effects on emergence and early seedling growth, but had little impact on survivorship. Seedlings emerging under the closed forest canopy died within a few months. In the treefall gap, recruits of Gleditsia and Prosopis survived the first year, but did not survive in the longer term after natural gap closure. The forest community thus appeared less susceptible to colonization by alien trees than the grassland. We conclude that tree invasion in this system is strongly limited by the availability of recruitment microsites and biotic interactions, as well as by dispersal from existing propagule sources.

AB We aimed to explore the farm scale effects of three landuse types, communal grazing, wildlife management and commercial cattle farming, on the woody vegetation of a semiarid savanna.
   Location The study farms were located within a single bioclimatic zone in semiarid savanna, South Africa.
   Methods The species composition and structure of woody vegetation on three farms of each of three landuse types were sampled.
   Results We found that communal grazing land sites were classified outside the topland-bottomland vegetation dichotomy characteristic of this region. Comparisons of size class distributions showed the communal grazing lands had fewer small and large individuals; suggesting both lower levels of regeneration and regenerative capacity in the communal grazing lands. The species richness and biomass of woody plants was lower on communal grazing lands than on private game reserves and commercial cattle farms. The longevity of tree species explains the observed lag between changes in abundance and species loss; we consequently predict that there will be future losses of species in the communal grazing lands. By classifying species into a range of use-categories we showed that utilization and species loss was not limited to certain plant use categories. Higher levels of wood harvesting measured in the communal grazing lands are likely to be responsible for the observed differences.
   Main conclusions It is concluded that communal grazing management at this study site has substantially changed the composition and structure of woody plant communities, and that these changes have reduced the current availability of natural resources and will reduce resource production in the future.

   DIFFERENTIATION
AB A phylogenetic hypothesis for the patellid limpets is reconstructed by cladistic analysis of morphological characters from 37 species, representing all but one of the living members of the family. Characters included in the analysis are derived from shell shape and microstructure, headfoot and pallial complex, radula and sperm. The species fall into four clades, providing the basis for a new phylogenetic classification into four monophyletic genera: Helcion (four species; southern Africa), Cymbula (eight species; southern Africa, eastern Atlantic, southern Indian Ocean), Scutellastra (17 species; southern and southwestern Africa, Australia, Indo-West Pacific, Eastern Pacific) and Patella (nine species; northeastern Atlantic and Mediterranean). The analysis suggests sister-group relationships between Helcion and Cymbula, and between Scutellastra and Patella. In combination with present-day patterns of geographical distribution, this phylogenetic hypothesis is used to discuss the historical biogeography of the Patellidae. Scutellastra may have originated in southern Africa and dispersed across the Pacific, or alternatively may be a primitively Tethyan group. Both Helcion and Cymbula appear to have originated in southern Africa, but three Cymbula species have dispersed respectively to northwest Africa, St Helena and the southern Indian Ocean. The patellids of the northeastern Atlantic form a single clade, Patella (including P. pellucida), which may have arrived by northward dispersal of an ancestor from southern Africa, or possibly by vicariance of a widespread ancestral Tethyan distribution. The known fossil record of patellids is tao fragmentary to permit choice between these alternatives.

AB Coral reef fishes differ in their intrinsic vulnerability to fishing and rates of population recovery after cessation of fishing. We reviewed life history-based predictions about the vulnerability of different groups of coral reef fish and examined the empirical evidence for different rates of population recovery inside no-take marine reserves to (1) determine if the empirical data agree with predictions about vulnerability and (2) show plausible scenarios of recovery within fully protected reserves and periodically-harvested fishery closures. In general, larger-bodied carnivorous reef fishes are predicted to be more vulnerable to fishing while smaller-bodied species lower in the food web (e.g., some herbivores) are predicted to be less vulnerable. However, this prediction does not always hold true because of the considerable diversity of life history strategies in reef fishes. Long-term trends in reef fish population recovery inside no-take reserves are consistent with broad predictions about vulnerability, suggesting that moderately to highly vulnerable species will require a significantly longer time (decades) to attain local carrying capacity than less vulnerable species. We recommend: (1) expanding age-based demographic studies of economically and ecologically important reef fishes to improve estimates of vulnerability; (2) long term (20-40 years), if not permanent, protection of no-take reserves to allow full population recovery and maximum biomass export; (3) strict compliance to no-take reserves to avoid considerable delays in recovery; (4) carefully controlling the timing and intensity of harvesting periodic closures to ensure long-term fishery benefits; (5) the use of periodically-harvested closures together with, rather than instead of, permanent no-take reserves.

AB The dominant vegetation over much of the global land surface is not predetermined by contemporary climate, but also influenced by past environmental conditions. This confounds attempts to predict current and future biome distributions, because even a perfect model would project multiple possible biomes without knowledge of the historical vegetation state.
   Here we compare the distribution of tree- and grass-dominated biomes across Africa simulated using a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). We explicitly evaluate where and under what conditions multiple stable biome states are possible for current and projected future climates.
   Our simulation results show that multiple stable biomes states are possible for vast areas of tropical and subtropical Africa under current conditions. Widespread loss of the potential for multiple stable biomes states is projected in the 21st Century, driven by increasing atmospheric CO2. Many sites where currently both tree-dominated and grass-dominated biomes are possible become deterministically tree-dominated.
   Regions with multiple stable biome states are widespread and require consideration when attempting to predict future vegetation changes. Testing for behaviour characteristic of systems with multiple stable equilibria, such as hysteresis and dependence on historical conditions, and the resulting uncertainty in simulated vegetation, will lead to improved projections of global change impacts.

AB Aim Pine trees (genus Pinus) represent an ancient lineage, naturally occurring almost exclusively in the Northern Hemisphere, but introduced and widely naturalized in both hemispheres. As large trees of interest to forestry, they attract much attention and their distribution is well documented in both indigenous and naturalized ranges. This creates an opportunity to analyse the relationship between indigenous and naturalized range sizes in the context of different levels of human usage, biological traits and the characteristics of the environments of origin.
   Location Global.
   Methods We combined and expanded pre-existing data sets for pine species distributions and pine species traits, and used a variety of regression techniques (including generalized additive models and zero-inflated Poisson models) to assess which variables explained naturalized and indigenous range sizes.
   Results Indigenous and naturalized range sizes are positively correlated but there are many notable exceptions. Some species have large indigenous ranges but small or no naturalized ranges, whereas others have small indigenous ranges, but have naturalized in many regions. Indigenous range is correlated to factors such as seed size (-), age at first reproduction (-), and latitude (+, supporting Rapoport's rule), but also to the extent of coverage of species in the forestry literature (+). Naturalized range size is strongly influenced by the extent of coverage of species in the forestry literature (+), a proxy for propagule pressure. Naturalization was also influenced by average elevation in the indigenous range (-) and age at first reproduction (-).
   Main conclusions The macroecological and evolutionary pressures facing plant groups are not directly transferable between indigenous and naturalized ranges. In particular, there are strong biases in species naturalization and expansion in invasive ranges that are unrelated to factors determining indigenous range size. At least for Pinus, a new set of macroecological patterns are emerging which are profoundly influenced by humans.

AB Urbanization is a widespread and rapidly growing threat to biodiversity, therefore we need a predictive understanding of its effects on species and ecosystem processes. In this paper we study the impact of urbanization on a guild of nectar-feeding birds in a biodiversity hotspot at the Cape of Africa. The guild of four bird species provides important ecosystem services by pollinating 320 plant species in the Cape Floral Region. Functional diversity within the guild is related to differences in bill length. The long-billed Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa) plays an irreplaceable role as the exclusive pollinator of plant species with long nectar tubes. We analyzed the composition of the guild in suburban gardens of Cape Town along a gradient of increasing distance from the nearest natural habitat. Urbanization reduces the functional diversity of the nectarivore guild. Malachite Sunbirds did not penetrate more than 1 km into the city, whereas only the short-billed Southern Double-collared Sunbirds (Cinnyris chalybea) occurred throughout the urbanization gradient. The lack of data precludes conclusions regarding the detailed responses of Orange-breasted Sunbirds (Anthobaphes violacea) and Sugarbirds (Promerops cafer), however their absence across the entire gradient is suggestive of high sensitivity. The functional diversity of this guild of pollinators can potentially be restored, but the pros and cons of this conservation action need to be considered.

AB Aim The genetic makeup and evolutionary potential of alien species can be profoundly influenced by their introduction history, but without detailed historical records, it can be difficult to ascertain the strength of this historical contingency. We explore how the known introduction histories combined with phylogeographic patterns in the native range have affected the genetic diversity in the invasive range for five Australian trees introduced to South Africa (Acacia cyclops, Acacia mearnsii, Acacia pycnantha, Acacia saligna and Paraserianthes lophantha).
   Location Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales (native and invasive ranges), and South Africa and the Hawaiian Islands (invasive range).
   Methods DNA sequence data were generated for all study species for either the external transcribed spacer (ETS) or plastid rpl32-trnL((UAG)) gene regions (combined total of 180 DNA sequences). Using statistical parsimony networks and genetic diversity indices, we compared genetic structure and variation in native and invasive ranges.
   Results Australian acacia species tend to have high genetic diversity at the population level in their native ranges, often showing high intra-specific divergence. In most instances, these species have similar levels of population genetic diversity in their adventive ranges in South Africa, but lack structure. For A. cyclops, A. saligna and P. lophantha, we found evidence for intra-specific hybridization between mixed genetic entities in the invasive range, arguably as a result of the structured native range being broadly sampled prior to introduction.
   Main conclusions Invasive species that have been extensively used in forestry often have complex introduction histories resulting in equally complex genetic signatures in the invasive range. Our results show that extreme caution should be taken when using indirect inferences (molecular genetic data) of introduction histories in the absence of detailed introduction records.

AB Some of the most important demographic parameters underlying the resilience of coral communities are determined by their patterns of reproduction. In this study, a variety of methods were used to investigate the patterns of spawning, larval development and dispersal for scleractinian corals at an isolated reef system off northwestern Australia. Two distinct periods of gamete maturation and multi-specific spawning occurred each year, during Spring and Autumn, in contrast to the single season of mass spawning described on most other reefs around Australia. The subsequent rates of embryogenesis and larval development were among the fastest described for corals, with pre-competency periods of approximately 3 days. Within 3 days of spawning, slicks of spawn and current drifters had dispersed up to 5 km, and up to 10 km after 6 days, while the times taken for drifters to travel between adjacent (> 240 km) reef systems were similar to or greater than the upper competency periods of most coral larvae. Thus, under these conditions, the entire reef system, and to some extent the reefs within the system, may largely be self-seeded; rates of immigration from other systems are probably insufficient to rapidly increase the recovery of communities within years of a major disturbance. These results have implications for the management of isolated reef systems, highlighting the need to minimize local stressors and maximize community resilience to the increasing scale of disturbance and habitat fragmentation.

AB Biodiversity is spatially unevenly distributed and so is the information on its spatial patterns. This uneven distribution of information on species occurrences is an important impediment to the conservation of biodiversity. Based on 185 427 collection records of 5873 plant species in sub-Saharan Africa, we analyse the availability of distribution data suitable for the GIS-based mapping of plant diversity patterns at a one-degree resolution. Using the bioclimatic model GARP, distribution ranges for each species were modelled. In order to identify data-deficient areas, the documented and modelled diversity patterns were compared. Only for a few, well-known centres of plant diversity are there comparatively many data collection records available. For several of the areas with very few collection records, such as the Guinean montane forests, the north-western Congolian lowland forests, and the southern Albertine Rift montane forests, the model predicts a species richness much higher than currently documented. In many of the data deficient areas, difficult conditions for scientific research appear to have limited collection activities for decades. Only strategic field collections can fill these gaps. Another cause of data deficiency is that data collected and digitized do not match the quality requirements for GIS-based work at the super-regional scale. In particular, regional databases documenting partial ranges of species are rarely connected. One challenge for the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation is therefore to establish international collaborative structures and technical standards that will allow analysis of biogeographical patterns across political boundaries.

We looked for indirect evidence (faeces, tracks, dens) of fragment use (occurrence) by the species and analysed whether occurrence could be related to four groups of variables: local (vegetation structure and patch size), landscape (distance to possible colonisation sources), regional (fragment location on the northern or southern plateau) and the vegetation type of the fragments. We analysed the differential response of species according to their life-history and behavioural traits. The relationship between use by each species and the factors studied was analysed using stepwise logistic regressions. Results indicate that three factors are crucial to explain fragment use: fragment size, geographic location and vegetation type. Large fragments are used more than smaller ones, the northern plateau is more suitable than the southern plateau, and holm oak and broad-leaved oak forests are more used than pine woods. The effects and magnitude varied slightly among species, depending on habitat requirements or life-history traits. Data indicate that conservation strategies in fragmented environments must take into account elements functioning at different spatial scales, and that it is essential to consider each case within a characteristic regional context.

AB The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the use of self-feeders in rainbow trout production. The basic idea with self-feeders is that the fish themselves control the feeding level, which is thereby set by their feeding motivation. To determine the limitations of the technique, this work has focused on characterising: (1) how self-feeding activity is related to food demand; and (2) how the self-service food supply is related to growth and feed conversion ratios.
   For the feeding system to function correctly, rainbow trout must first learn how to operate it. Trout reared in tanks in groups of 100-300 individuals require about 25 days to reach a stable level of self-feeding. Under large-scale rearing conditions (e.g. in cages with group sizes of 1000-2000 ind.), however, learning seems to be of minor importance for the ability of fish to operate the system. When reared in small tanks in groups of up to about 300 ind., self-feeding activity in trout is strongly influenced by the development of dominance hierarchies. Under such situations, a small number of fish will dominate the actuation of the trigger and thereby have a disproportionately greater influence on the food supply of the group as a whole. Any change in temperature is quickly followed by a corresponding change in self-feeding activity up to about 15 degrees C. Above this temperature, trout lower their activity, indicating that self-feeding activity reaches a maximum at around 15 degrees C. The reward level (amount of food received in response to one trigger actuation) is the single most important factor requiring proper adjustment in order to optimise growth and feed conversion ratios when using self-feeding systems. The optimal reward is discussed in relation to differences in dietary energy content, number of fish, and water temperature. High-density conditions reduce the self-feeding activity of trout, and the recommended maximum rearing density is about 30 kg m(-3). An evaluation of growth and feed conversion data indicates that self-feeders have the potential to function well with rainbow trout under commercial rearing conditions.

AB We currently face both an extinction and a biome crisis embedded in a changing climate. Many biodiverse ecosystems are being lost at far higher rates than they are being protected or ecologically restored. At the same time, natural climate solutions offer opportunities to restore biodiversity while mitigating climate change. The Bonn Challenge is a U.N. programme to restore biodiversity and mitigate climate change through restoration of the world's degraded landscapes. It provides an unprecedented chance for ecological restoration to become a linchpin tool for addressing many environmental issues. Unfortunately, the Forest and Landscape Restoration programme that underpins the Bonn Challenge, as its name suggests, remains focused on trees and forests, despite rising evidence that many non-forest ecosystems also offer strong restoration potential for biodiversity and climate mitigation. We see a need for restoration to step back to be more inclusive of different ecosystem types and to step up to provide integrated scientific knowledge to inform large-scale restoration. Stepping back and up will require assessments of where to restore what species, with recognition that in many landscapes multiple habitat types should be restored. In the process, trade-offs in the delivery of different ecosystem services (e.g. carbon, biodiversity, water, albedo, livestock forage) should be clearly addressed. We recommend that biodiversity safeguards be included in policy and implemented in practice, to avoid undermining the biophysical relationships that provide ecosystem resilience to climate change. For ecological restoration to contribute to international policy goals will require integrated large-scale science that works across biome boundaries.

AB Laurel wilt is an extraordinarily destructive exotic tree disease in the southeastern United States that involves new-encounter hosts in the Lauraceae, an introduced vector (Xyleborus glabratus) and pathogen symbiont (Raffaelea lauricola). USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data were used to estimate that over 300 million trees of redbay (Persea borbonia sensu lato) have succumbed to the disease since the early 2000s (ca 1/3 of the pre-invasion population). In addition, numerous native shrub and tree species in the family are susceptible and threatened in the Western Hemisphere. Genetic markers were used to test the hypothesis that the vector and pathogen entered North America as a single introduction. With a portion of the cytochrome oxidase I gene, a single X. glabratus haplotype was detected in the USA. Similarly, Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms indicated that 95% (54 of 57) of the isolates of R. lauricola that were examined were of a single clonal genotype; only minor variation was detected in three polymorphic isolates. Similar levels of disease developed after swamp bay (P. palustris) was inoculated with each of the four genotypes of R. lauricola. It is proposed that a single founding event is responsible for the laurel wilt epidemic in the United States.

AB In polluted environments, contaminant effects may be manifested via both direct toxicity to the host and changes in its microbiota, affecting bacteria host interactions. In this context, particularly relevant is exposure to antibiotics released into environment. We examined effects of the antibiotic trimethoprim on microbiota of Daphnia magna and concomitant changes in the host feeding. In daphnids exposed to 0.25 mg L-1 trimethoprim for 24 h, the microbiota was strongly affected, with (1) up to 21-fold decrease in 16S rRNA gene abundance and (2) a shift from balanced communities dominated by Curvibacter, Aquabacterium, and Limnohabitans in controls to significantly lower diversity under dominance of Pelomonas in the exposed animals. Moreover, decreased feeding and digestion was observed in the animals exposed to 0.25-2 mg L-1 trimethoprim for 48 h and then fed C-14-labeled algae. Whereas the proportion of intact algal cells in the guts increased with increased trimethoprim concentration, ingestion and incorporation rates as well as digestion and incorporation efficiencies decreased significantly. Thus, antibiotics may impact nontarget species via changes in their microbiota leading to compromised nutrition and, ultimately, growth. These bacteria-mediated effects in nontarget organisms may not be unique for antibiotics, but also relevant for environmental pollutants of various nature.

AB We present extensions to the agent-based agricultural policy simulator (AgriPoliS) model that make it possible to simulate the consequences of agricultural policy reform on farmers' land use decisions and concomitant impacts on landscape mosaic, biodiversity and ecosystem services in a real agricultural region. An observed population of farms is modelled as a multi-agent system where individual farm-agent behaviour and their interactions-principally competition for land-are defined through an optimization framework with land use and landscape impacts resulting as emergent properties of the system. The model is calibrated to real data on the farms and the landscape to be studied. We illustrate the utility of the model by evaluating the potential impacts of three alternative frameworks for the European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on landscape values in two marginal agricultural regions. Mosaic value was found to be sensitive to the choice of policy scheme in one of the landscapes, whereas significant trade-offs were shown to occur in terms of species richness by habitat and species composition at the landscape scale in both regions. The relationship between food production and other ecosystem services was found to be multifaceted. Thus illustrating the difficulty of achieving landscape goals in a particular region with simple or general land management rules (such as the current rules attached to CAPs direct payments). Given the scarcity of funding for conservation, the level and conditions for allocating direct payments are, potentially, of great importance for preserving landscape values in marginal agricultural regions (subject to levels of other support).

AB In humid savannas, the transition from juvenile to mature tree sizes is thought to be a major demographic bottleneck because smaller plants are topkilled by frequent fires. Species with the highest net rates of sapling growth should dominate the tree component of savannas by reaching fire-proof sizes, escape size, more rapidly than competitors. However, tests of this prediction have failed to explain eucalypt dominance in Australian savannas as eucalypt mean growth rates are low. We tested the escape hypothesis directly by recording the number and identity of tagged individuals reaching escape size in a long-term study. Results were consistent with the escape hypothesis with greater than six times more eucalypts reaching escape height than non-eucalypts in frequently burnt savannas. The pattern was reversed where fires were excluded for 5 years, with more non-eucalypts emerging than eucalypts. We conclude that mean growth rates alone are a poor predictor of the rates at which juvenile savanna trees transition to mature tree size. Only the fastest growing individuals make the transition to mature trees whereas mean values include many suppressed individuals. Measures of maximum growth rates will provide more robust estimators of demographically important effects on mature tree cover. The mechanistic basis for the remarkable ability of juvenile eucalypts to escape frequent fires is not yet understood.

AB The number of no-take marine protected areas (here referred to as no-take areas, NTAs) on coral reefs has increased considerably in recent decades. Coincident with accelerating degradation of coral reefs, expectations of the benefits that NTAs can provide for coastal societies and sustainability of marine ecosystems has grown. These include increasing abundance of reef organisms both inside and outside NTAs, protecting key ecosystem functions, and providing social and economic benefits through improved fisheries and tourism. However, there is a lack of convincing evidence for many of these expectations. This is the first attempt to synthesize all potential costs and benefits of coral reef NTAs and critically examine evidence of their impacts on both ecosystems and societies. NTAs with high compliance consistently increase the diversity, density and biomass of exploited reef fishes and certain groups of motile invertebrates within their boundaries and have benefits for reef-associated tourism. Some NTAs provide small increases in the abundance of corals and decreases in macroalgal cover. The effects of NTAs on genetic diversity and connectivity among meta-populations are variable or as yet unquantified. There is limited evidence of NTAs providing social benefits through increased fishery yields and tourism revenue. There are examples of both positive and negative effects on social well-being. Finally, sharks, marine megafauna and microbial communities showed few tangible benefits from NTAs. Substantial gaps in the science of coral reef NTAs remain, especially in their capacity to provide socioeconomic benefits. A crucial research priority is understanding how the cumulative effects of climate change will influence the various benefits that NTAs provide. To be effective, NTAs must be used in conjunction with a range of other management tools and applied according to local environmental and societal contexts.

AB In frequently burnt savannas, saplings face the formidable challenge of both recovering from, and eventually growing tall enough to escape from, frequent fire damage. The aim of this study was to explore how saplings allocate carbon to achieve these ends through carbon partitioning, storage and remobilization. Lignotuber total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations and delta C-13 values of Acacia karroo (Fabaceae; Mimosoideae) were determined in plants from two different juvenile stages. These were one year after a fire when the plant consisted of numerous leafy shoots or coppices ("coppicing" stage), and three years after a fire when the plant consisted of one pole-like stem ("Gulliver" stage). Gulliver lignotubers were found to have significantly larger TNC pools (150 g vs. 97 g) and larger TNC concentrations (33% vs. 24%, w/w) than coppice lignotubers showing that post-coppice Gullivers recharged TNC in the lignotuber. delta C-13 values from the stems of plants in the Gulliver stage were significantly enriched (> 1aEuro degrees) in C-13 compared to both coppicing (P < 0.01) and adult (P < 0.05) plants. Changes in both the amount of stored carbon and in the delta C-13 values indicated dependence on stored carbon reserves, and partially heterotrophic growth for initial resprouting. The plants appeared to use both current photosynthate and stored carbon reserves for growth of the Gulliver stem. The use of stored carbon is hypothesized to promote fast stem growth rates to a height where saplings escape fire injury.

AB On the south coast of South Africa, the invasive alien mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis shows partial habitat segregation with the indigenous mussel Perna perna. P. perna predominates in the lower mussel zone and M. galloprovincialis in the upper zone, with mixed beds where the two overlap. We examined competitive interactions between these species by translocating mussels into small plots at high densities. Treatments involved different combinations of species and densities placed in each zone. Mortality was monitored regularly and at the end of each experiment, growth and condition index were measured. The experiment was attempted three times. The first two attempts were disrupted by wave action, especially winter storms, but provided information on species-specific effects of wave action. In experiment one, wave induced mortality decreased from a mean for both species of approximately 90% on the low shore to ca. 50% on the high shore, and was 15-30% lower for P. perna than M. galloprovincialis in each zone. In experiment two, M. galloprovincialis mortality was not affected by zone (Kruskal-Wallis test, P > 0.05), but was higher than P. perna mortality in the low zone (P < 0.05). P. perna survival was significantly (P < 0.05) lower on the high than mid and low zones, apparently due to the effects of greater emersion. Condition index showed a similar pattern, being lowest in the low zone for M. galloprovincialis and in the high zone for P. perna (3-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). Growth rates were fastest for both species in the low zone (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05 in both cases). The third experiment was run for 12 months in the low zone only and provided evidence of intraspecific competition for P. perna and of interspecific competition. Condition was significantly greater for P. perna in all treatments (2-way ANOVA), as was growth (Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.05). Significant treatment effects indicated that P. perna had a negative effect on M. galloprovincialis survival (Kruskal-Wallis, P < 0.05). Again wave action was important; by the end of the experiment all mussels had been removed from plots stocked only with M. galloprovincialis. Thus P. perna improves survival of M. galloprovincialis on the low shore in the short term, by providing protection against wave action, but excludes it competitively in the longer term. The results show that partial habitat segregation is likely to be a permanent feature on the south coast, with M. galloprovincialis unable to dominate the low shore due to the effects of waves and competitive exclusion by P. perna. This study is the first attempt to examine the mechanisms of interaction between invasive and indigenous marine mussel species and provides evidence of the importance of environmental conditions in the mediation of this interaction.

AB We studied soil and forest floor conditions, regeneration patterns of trees, and forest structure and floristic composition along a gradient of dominance by Pinus spp. in disturbed stands in the highlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Seedlings, saplings, and adults of tree species were counted and measured in 2-3 circular plots (1000 m(2) each) in 36 forest stands (a total of 38 tree species). Dominance of broadleaved trees other than Quercus spp. was negatively correlated with basal area of Pinus spp. (P < 0.001). Soils of pine-dominated stands were more compacted, less acidic, and less fertile (lower C. E. C., nitrogen, and organic matter content). Numerous broadleaved trees may depend on an oak-dominated canopy to regenerate, and changes associated to pinelands expansion may compromise their long-term persistence. However, seedlings and saplings of Quercus spp. were abundant in stands with both an oak- or pine-dominated canopy. The results suggest that a plan for sustainable forest utilization in the study region, and in other similar populated tropical highlands, could take advantage of the abundant oak regeneration and coexistence with pines in the canopy.

AB We conducted a food supplementation field experiment to test two hypotheses: (1) fecundity of the fishing spider Dolomedes triton is limited by a shortage of prey, and (2) the increased movement of adult female D. triton exhibited upon maturation is a foraging adaptation to lessen the impact of food limitation on egg production. Free ranging, uniquely marked adult female fishing spiders were assigned either to a food-supplemented group that received crickets in addition to their natural diet, or to a control group. Juvenile female spiders were also marked and their movement patterns were recorded, but juveniles were not offered supplemental food. Food-supplemented adult females gained weight at a faster rate and hatched more than twice as many offspring as control females. Adult females in the control group moved greater distances per day than did juvenile females. Supplemented adult females moved shorter distances per day than control females, and the movement pattern of fed adults did not differ from that of juveniles. These results support the hypotheses that adult female D. triton are food limited, and that the increased movement of adult females is a switch in foraging behavior that occurs during the reproductive period. Our finding that natural prey shortages limit egg production contrasts with laboratory-based studies of food limitation in the genus Dolomedes, and contradicts a basic assumption of a recent hypothesis that sexual cannibalism in Dolomedes is non-adaptive. These discrepancies highlight the importance of insights gained from field experiments with natural populations.

AB To assess the consequences of increased recreational activity in wilderness areas, we studied the effects of human activity on breeding behavior of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) in interior Alaska. Activity budgets of breeding eagles changed considerably when humans were camped fur 24 h at a distance of 100 m from nests (treatment) compared to when they were camped 500 m from nests (control) (P = 0.0036). With humans near nests, adult eagles decreased the time they preened (percentage change from control to treatment = -53%), slept (-56%), maintained nests (-50%), and fed themselves and their nestlings (-30%) and increased the time they brooded nestlings (+14%). Further, overall activity (total number of behaviors performed by adults at nests per day) decreased by 27% with humans near nests, as did the amount of prey adults consumed (-26%) and fed to nestlings (-29%). In contrast, nest attendance did not change with humans near nests (percentage change = 0.3%, P = 0.9); however, the time adults were absent from the nest area (greater than or equal to 200 m from nests) increased by 24% with humans near nests (P = 0.013). Throughout 24-h treatments, eagle responses to nearby humans diminished, suggesting that eagles habituated to the disturbance. During the last 4 h of treatment, however, adults still vocalized twice as frequently as controls, indicating continued agitation. Human activity near nests caused clear and consistent changes in behaviors of breeding eagles, suggesting that frequent human activities near nests could adversely affect nestling survival, and therefore reproductive success.

AB Explanations for distinct adjacent ecosystems that extend across hilly landscapes typically point to differences in climate or land use. Here we document-within a similar climate-how contrasting regional plant communities correlate with distinct underlying lithology and reveal how differences in water storage capacity in the critical zone (CZ) explain this relationship. We present observations of subsurface CZ structure and groundwater dynamics from deep boreholes and quantify catchment-wide dynamic water storage in two Franciscan rock types of the Northern California Coast Ranges. Our field sites have a Mediterranean climate, where rains are out of phase with solar energy, amplifying the importance of subsurface water storage for periods of peak ecosystem productivity in the dry season. In the deeply weathered (similar to 30 m at ridge) Coastal Belt argillite and sandstone, ample, seasonally replenished rock moisture supports an evergreen forest and groundwater drainage sustains baseflow throughout the summer. In the Central Belt argillite-matrix melange, a thin CZ (similar to 3 m at ridge) limits total dynamic water storage capacity (100-200 mm) and rapidly sheds winter rainfall via shallow storm and saturation overland flow, resulting in low plant-available water (inferred from predawn tree water potential) and negligible groundwater storage that can drain to streams in summer. This storage limitation mechanism explains the presence of an oak savanna-woodland bounded by seasonally ephemeral streams, despite >1,800 mm of average precipitation. Through hydrologic monitoring and subsurface characterization, we reveal a mechanism by which differences in rock type result in distinct regionally extensive plant communities under a similar climate.
   Plain Language Summary The ability of the subsurface critical zone-extending from the ground surface down to fresh, unweathered bedrock-to store and release water to plants and streams is a key variable explaining ecosystem composition and function. The storage and release of water are particularly important in Mediterranean climates, where rain arrives in winter and summers are typically warm and dry. Here plants rely half the year on seasonally replenished water from belowground. We documented how the subsurface structure of the critical zone determines how water is shed from landscapes and how much water can be seasonally stored. We found that locations with a thicker critical zone had higher water storage capacity, more productive ecosystems, deeper groundwater runoff generation, and greater summer streamflow. Where the critical zone is thin and storage capacity is limited, the subsurface completely saturates, and the landscape sheds incoming rain via surface runoff. This water storage limitation explains the presence of an oak savanna-woodland in the Northern California Coast Ranges, where rainfall is ample, and neighboring areas experiencing similar climate have towering forest canopies. Rock type governed these variations, highlighting its importance in determining the distribution of ecosystems and water runoff pathways to streams.

AB 1. The role of novel ecological interactions between mammals, fungi and plants in invaded ecosystems remains unresolved, but may play a key role in the widespread successful invasion of pines and their ectomycorrhizal fungal associates, even where mammal faunas originate from different continents to trees and fungi as in New Zealand.
   2. We examine the role of novel mammal associations in dispersal of ectomycorrhizal fungal inoculum of North American pines (Pinus contorta, Pseudotsuga menziesii), and native beech trees (Lophozonia menziesii) using faecal analyses, video monitoring and a bioassay experiment.
   3. Both European red deer (Cervus elaphus) and Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) pellets contained spores and DNA from a range of native and non-native ectomycorrhizal fungi.
   4. Faecal pellets from both animals resulted in ectomycorrhizal infection of pine seedlings with fungal genera Rhizopogon and Suillus, but not with native fungi or the invasive fungus Amanita muscaria, despite video and DNA evidence of consumption of these fungi.
   5. Native L. menziesii seedlings never developed any ectomycorrhizal infection from faecal pellet inoculation.
   6. Synthesis. Our results show that introduced mammals from Australia and Europe facilitate the co-invasion of invasive North American trees and Northern Hemisphere fungi in New Zealand, while we find no evidence that introduced mammals benefit native trees or fungi. This novel tripartite 'invasional meltdown', comprising taxa from three kingdoms and three continents, highlights unforeseen consequences of global biotic homogenization.

AB Given its biological significance, determining the dispersal kernel (i.e., the distribution of dispersal distances) of spore-producing pathogens is essential. Here, we report two field experiments designed to measure disease gradients caused by sexually-and asexually-produced spores of the wind-dispersed banana plant fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis. Gradients were measured during a single generation and over 272 traps installed up to 1000 m along eight directions radiating from a traceable source of inoculum composed of fungicide-resistant strains. We adjusted several kernels differing in the shape of their tail and tested for two types of anisotropy. Contrasting dispersal kernels were observed between the two types of spores. For sexual spores (ascospores), we characterized both a steep gradient in the first few metres in all directions and rare long-distance dispersal (LDD) events up to 1000 m from the source in two directions. A heavy-tailed kernel best fitted the disease gradient. Although ascospores distributed evenly in all directions, average dispersal distance was greater in two different directions without obvious correlation with wind patterns. For asexual spores (conidia), few dispersal events occurred outside of the source plot. A gradient up to 12.5 m from the source was observed in one direction only. Accordingly, a thin-tailed kernel best fitted the disease gradient, and anisotropy in both density and distance was correlated with averaged daily wind gust. We discuss the validity of our results as well as their implications in terms of disease diffusion and management strategy.

AB Fires have played an important role in creating and maintaining savannas over the centuries and are also one of the main natural disturbances in forests. The functional role of fires in savannas and forests can be investigated through examining sedimentary charcoal in order to reconstruct long-term fire history. However, the relationship between charcoal and vegetation structure in tropical grassy ecosystems remains to be elucidated. Here, we compared recent charcoal records from lake sediments in three tropical ecosystems (forest, savanna, and forest-savanna mosaic) with land cover inferred from remote-sensing images. Charcoal width-to-length (W/L) ratio is a good proxy for changes in fuel type. At one of the lakes, a significant W/L modification from values >0.5 (mainly wood) to <0.5 (similar to grass) was recorded simultaneously with changes in land cover. Indeed, a significant deforestation was recorded around this lake in the remote-sensing imagery between 1984 and 1994. The results also indicate that a riparian forest around a lake could act as a physical filter for charcoal accumulation; we used the mean charcoal size as a proxy to evaluate this process. Charcoal Accumulation Rates (CHAR), a burned biomass proxy, were combined with W/L ratio and the mean charcoal size to investigate the land-use history of the landscapes surrounding the study sites. This combined approach allowed us to distinguish between episodic slash-and-burn practices in the forest and managed fields or pastures burning frequently.

AB Nitrogen fixing plant species are among the most invasive species worldwide. However, field studies directly estimating the differential effect of native versus invasive exotic N-2-fixing plants on plant communities are lacking. The exotic leguminous shrub Acacia longifolia invades coastal dunes across Portugal often co-existing with the native N-2-fixer Stauracanthus spectabilis. Moreover, this co-existence with native species is possible due to a relatively low cover of Acacia species particularly in the south of Portugal where drought is intense. In this study we compare the impact of two different legume species (native and exotic) on the nitrogen status of a protected Mediterranean dune system. We document how presence of the exotic invader A. longifolia impacted community structure, soil properties and the foliar nitrogen concentrations and growth rates of native species. A. longifolia invaded areas had decreased biodiversity, fewer seedlings and altered soil properties (e.g., increased soil organic matter, NO3- and NH4+). A. longifolia presence was also associated with significant increases in foliar nitrogen content and delta N-15 of the endemic shrub Corema album while presence of the native legume Stauracanthus spectabilis had no discernible impact on C. album. Furthermore, a strong correlation between increased foliar nitrogen and enhanced growth rates in C. album indicate a facilitative effect of A. longifolia on this native shrub. We posit that the combination of nitrogen fixation, a rapid growth rate and production of a thick litter layer result in a very substantial impact of the invader in invaded ecosystems.

AB Late Quaternary vegetation history and environmental changes in a biodiverse tropical ecosystem are inferred from pollen, charcoal and carbon isotope evidence derived from a similar to 48,000-yr sedimentary record from the Uluguru Mountains, a component of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Kenya and Tanzania. Results indicate that Eastern Arc forest composition has remained relatively stable during the past similar to 48,000 yr. Long-term environmental stability of the Eastern Arc forests has been proposed as a mechanism for the accumulation and persistence of species during glacial periods, thus resulting in the diverse forests observed today. The pollen and isotope data presented here indicate some marked changes in abundance but no significant loss in moist forest taxa through the last glacial maximum, thereby providing support for the long-term environmental stability of the Eastern Arc. Anthropogenic activities, including burning and forest clearance, were found to play a moderate role in shaping the mosaic of forest patches and high-altitude grasslands that characterise the site today: however, this influence was tempered by the inaccessibility of the mountain.

AB Stable nitrogen isotope ratios (delta N-15) were measured in invertebrates and fish collected from 82 river sites located in the Saint-Lawrence Lowlands in Quebec, Canada, to examine the relationship between aquatic biota delta N-15 and anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loads. Mean delta N-15 values of all three trophic levels examined (primary consumers, predatory invertebrates and invertebrate-feeding fish) were highly correlated with total anthropogenic N loads on the watershed (kg N km(-2) year(-1); r(2)> 0.61, p < 0.0001) and with N loads originating from livestock manure (r(2)> 0.62, p < 0.0001), synthetic fertilizers (r(2)> 0.45, p < 0.000 1), and human population (r(2)> 0.29, p < 0.0001), respectively. Significant relationships were also observed between primary consumer delta N-15 and N loads originating from each of the three livestock species examined (bovines, pigs and poultry; p < 0.000 1). Furthermore, all three animal species contributed significantly and independently in elevating primary consumer delta N-15 (multiple r(2)=0.67, p < 0.0001). Curvilinear regressions were observed at all levels of analysis, delta N-15 values increasing slowly over a wide range of low levels of N loads, but increasing much faster as N loads grew larger. The three anthropogenic N sources examined were highly correlated with one another, preventing us from statistically isolating their respective effects on delta N-15. When these loads were expressed as a proportion of total N load, delta N-15 of aquatic biota was still highly correlated with N from livestock and fertilizers, but not with N from human population. Overall, these results suggest that delta N-15 values of aquatic consumers could be used as indicators of the intensity of anthropogenic N loading on watersheds, but not as tracers of the relative importance of individual N sources.

AB 1 Vegetation change induced by large herbivores is driven by the effects of grazers on populations of individual plant species. Short-term experimental or demographic studies may be insufficient when investigating the population responses of long-lived clonal plant species
   2 We therefore examined the effects of grazing on such a plant (Veratrum album) by comparing the spatial and genetic structure of populations in grasslands subject to long-term grazing or mowing for hay.
   3 V. album is a locally dominant species that is avoided by large herbivores due to its toxicity. RA-PD-phenotypes of a subsample of c: 50 shoots, and co-ordinates and dry weight of all shoots, were determined in a 5 x 10 m plot in each of four meadow and four pasture populations.
   4 The breeding system of the genus Veratrum was previously unknown but our experimental finding that cross-pollinated but not self-pollinated or unpollinated flowers produced as many seeds as freely pollinated flowers suggested that V. album is a predominantly cross-pollinating species.
   5 Both the spatial and genetic population structure differed markedly between the two grassland types. Clonal expansion of established plants in pastures led to populations consisting of larger shoots that were significantly more aggregated at a small spatial scale. Populations also had a higher proportion of flowering shoots, less seedling recruitment and a lower genotypic diversity in pastures than hay meadows.
   6 The differences in population structure appear to be due to hay meadow populations reproducing primarily by seeds, whereas clonal reproduction accounts for half of the population growth in pastures. We suggest that, as livestock selectively avoids V. album shoots, grazing indirectly promotes plant growth, which results in an enhanced vegetative reproduction as well as a higher seed production. Experimental studies are, however, needed to determine why and how grazing adversely affects seedling recruitment.
   7 Detailed information on population level responses of unpalatable dominant plant species, such as provided by the present study, may help us understand and predict vegetation change in response to changing levels of herbivory.

AB In proximity of shelters, grazing by sea urchins plays a fundamental role in establishing and maintaining areas dominated by encrusting corallines. Much attention has been given to the effects of urchins on algal assemblages in shallow subtidal reefs, but few studies attempted to clarify the role played by encrusting coralline algae in this system. It has been shown that encrusting corallines are able to reduce settlement of potential competitors, suggesting that they do not rely on grazing by herbivores to prevent swamping by erect algal species. In shallow subtidal reefs of the Mediterranean Sea, the sea urchins Para centrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula are the main herbivores, whose grazing commonly leads to a mosaic of areas dominated alternatively by encrusting corallines and turf-forming algae. This study aims to separate the effects of urchins and encrusting corallines on the re-colonisation of encrusting coralline-dominated patches (barren habitat) by surrounding erect algal species (turf-forming algae). Different hypotheses were tested by means of multivariate and univariate analyses. The multivariate hypothesis was that the algal assemblage developing when encrusting corallines and urchins are simultaneously removed would be more similar to that establishing in stands of turf-forming algae, than that developing when none or only 1 of the 2 factors is manipulated. The univariate hypotheses tested were: (1) that there is a negative effect of sea urchins and encrusting corallines on the re-colonisation of barren areas by surrounding turf-forming algal species and (2) that the effects of encrusting corallines are weaker than those of urchins, but that they operate in the same direction. These hypotheses were tested by means of an orthogonal manipulation of urchins and encrusting corallines. At each of 3 study sites, 2 replicate barren patches were assigned to each of these treatments: (1) +corallines+urchins; (2) +corallines-urchins; (3) -corallines+urchins; (4) -corallines-urchins. The results suggest that the occurrence of areas dominated by encrusting corallines on shallow subtidal reefs in the northwest Mediterranean is not simply the result of grazing by sea urchins on turf-forming species. The removal of encrusting corallines also affected the abundance of dominant algal species and determined the development of an algal assemblage resembling those occurring within stands of algal turfs. The effects of the removal of urchins on turf-forming species were generally positive, while those of encrusting corallines varied from negative (Padina pavonica) to positive (Acetabularia acetabulum and filamentous algae). Therefore, the role played by encrusting corallines in maintaining alternative habitats on shallow subtidal reefs should be taken into account, thus avoiding the overestimation of the effects of grazing by sea urchins.

AB Phenological studies in plant communities have generally focused on taxonomically heterogeneous species assemblages, and have only occasionally examined the evolutionary and ecological constraints on the phenological patterns of species within a single family or a genus. Here, we determine relative importance of phylogenetic versus other constraints on the flowering and fruiting periods of 12 species and the germination ecology of 10 species of Myrtaceae sympatric to the temperate rainforest of Isla Grande de Chiloe (42 degrees 30' S), in southern Chile.
   We found that, for most species in the family Myrtaceae, flowering was strongly aggregated in January and February. Although this pattern is consistent with the expectation of the 'facilitation' hypothesis (i.e., interspecific overlaps are maximized to attract pollinators), available evidence suggests that pollinators, mainly hymenopterans and dipterans, do not limit fruit production in these species of Myrtaceae in the temperate rainforest. In contrast to flowering, fruiting occurred all-year-round, showing greater segregation in time among the species. According to the their temporal patterns of fruit ripening, two functional groups were defined within the Myrtaceae: those that ripen their fruits immediately after flowering (species in the subtribe Myrtinae) and those in which green fruit develops slowly for several months before ripening (subtribe Myrciinae). Seed germination in the field occurred mainly between August and October. Lab assays showed that the species of Myrtaceae, subtribe Myrtinae, exhibited a long seed dormancy (>40 days), while the seeds of species in the subtribe Myrciinae often germinated within one week after harvesting. The analysis of the phenology of reproductive events in the species of Myrtaceae in this rainforest suggests that: (1) flowering periods patterns are constrained mainly by phylogenetic inertia at the family level, and (2) differences in fruiting patterns and dormancy periods are determined mainly by fruit and seed size, which in turn are associated primarily with phylogenetic closeness within the family, and secondarily with the activity of vertebrate seed dispersers.

AB Zooplankton composition and growth in the river Marne (France) were studied on a space scale of 300 km in July 1991. There were three distinct areas along the river: the immediate reservoir outlet (pK 652), the natural river called middle Marne (from pK 652 to pK 799 downstream) and the channeled river (from pK 799 to pK 975 downstream). A typical lake community, characterized both by an abundance of microcrustaceans and a high zooplankton concentration was found immediately downstream of the reservoir Marne (Der-Chantecocq Lake). Here, large microcrustaceans (copepods, daphnids), and large rotifers (Keratella cochlearis robusta and Polyarthra dolichoptera-vulgaris) rapidly disappeared, and small rotifer species (<120 mu m) dominated the plankton. Their populations (specially Keratella c. cochlearis) proliferated in the middle Marne as far as 100 km downstream (up to 288 ind. 1(-1)) but were considerably reduced (20 to 35 ind. 1(-1)) where the river is channeled, algal resources decline and turbidity increases.
   The dominance of small organisms such as rotifers, in river plankton is assumed to be the result of fish predation on large zooplankton as well as of a short generation time which allows their in situ reproduction, in spite of a short residence time of the water.

AB The structure of communities on cliff sections with and without overhead seabird colonies was compared to assess whether local nutrient enrichment by birds affected the abundances of rocky-shore species in the San Juan archipelago of Washington state. In the presence of guano, the vertical distribution of orange lichens (Caloplaca marina Wedd. and Xanthoria elegans (Link.) Th. Fr.) was elevated and gray lichens (Physcia (Schreb.) Michx.) were eliminated in the supralittoral fringe. In the splash and upper intertidal zones, guano appeared to directly enhance the abundance of the green alga Prasiola meridionalis S. & G. and fleshy crustose algae (Mastocarpus papillatus (C. Ag.) Kutzing, Ralfsia pacifica Hollenb., and Hildenbrandia Nardo spp.), but to directly reduce the amount of area covered by Fucus distichus L., and Ulva L. spp. By directly affecting the abundance of these species, guano indirectly affected other species: Verrucaria mucosa Wahl. declined because of enhanced competition with Prasiola in the splash zone, and Balanus glandula Darwin declined because of increased desiccation in areas with reduced Fucus canopy. Overall, guano positively influenced only four of the eighteen taxa examined in the study, suggesting that, with the exception of species that live in unusual situations with low nutrient transport, macronutrients probably do not limit the abundance of species in this community.

AB The iconic primeval bird Archaeopteryx was so far mainly known from the Altmuhltal Formation (early Tithonian) of Bavaria, southern Germany, with one specimen having been found in the overlying Mornsheim Formation. A new specimen (the 12th skeletal specimen) from the earliest Tithonian Painten Formation of Schamhaupten (Bavaria) represents the so far oldest representative of the genus. The new specimen shows several interesting anatomical details, including the presence of a postorbital in contact with the jugal, the presence of a separate prefrontal and coronoid, and opisthocoelous mid-cervical vertebrae. Based on observations on the new specimen, we discuss several problematic issues concerning Archaeopteryx, including the monophyly and diagnosis of the genus, the absence/presence of the sternum, the position of the gastralia, and variation in morphometrics and dental morphology in that genus. Based on a new diagnosis for the genus Archaeopteryx, the Berlin, Eichstatt, Solnhofen, Munich, Daiting, Thermopolis, 11th, and 12th specimens can be referred to this genus with high certainty. The Maxberg specimen is very probably also an Archaeopteryx, based on overall similarity, although none of the diagnostic characters can be evaluated with certainty. The ninth specimen ('chicken wing') might be Archaeopteryx, but cannot be referred to the genus with any certainty. In comparison with other paravians, the presence of distally thickened anterior pectoral ribs indicates that a rather large cartilagenous sternum was present in this taxon. In contrast to non-opisthopubic theropods, opisthopubic taxa, such as Archaeopteryx and many other paravians, have the posterior end of the gastral basket preserved at about half-length of the pubis, which might reflect the post-mortem collapse of enlarged abdominal air sacs in these taxa. Specimens that can be referred to Archaeopteryx show a high amount of variation, both in the morphometrics of the limb bones as well as in the dentition. In respect to the latter aspect, variation is found in tooth number, spacing, orientation, and morphology, with no two specimens showing the exact same pattern. The significance of this variation is unclear, and possible explanations reach from high intraspecific (and possibly ontogenetic and/or sexual dimorphic) variation to the possibility that the known specimens represent a 'species flock' of Archaeopteryx, possibly due to island speciation after the initial dispersal of the genus into the Solnhofen Archipelago.

AB The Antarctic Peninsula is one of three regions of the planet that have experienced the highest rates of climate warming over recent decades. Based on a comprehensive large-scale resurvey, allowing comparison of new (2009) and historical data (1960s), we show that the two native Antarctic vascular plant species have exhibited significant increases in number of occupied sites and percent cover since the 1960s: Deschampsia antarctica increasing in coverage by 191 % and in number of sites by 104 %. Colobanthus quitensis increasing in coverage by 208 % and number of sites by 35 %. These changes likely occurred in response to increases of 1.2 A degrees C in summer air temperature over the same time period. Both species exhibited changes with elevation due to the interaction of multiple drivers (climatic factors and animal disturbance), producing heterogeneity of responses across an elevation gradient. Below an elevation of 20 m fur seal activity exerted negative impacts. Between 20 and 60 m, both plant species underwent considerable increases in the number of sites and percent cover, likely influenced by both climate warming and nutrient input from seals. Above an elevation threshold of 60 m the maximum elevation of the sites occupied decreased for both species, perhaps as a consequence of physical disturbance at higher elevations due to the permafrost conditions and/or the snow cover thickness and persistence. Understanding the role of disturbance drivers for vegetation change in cold regions may become a research priority to enable improved forecasting of biological responses and feedbacks of climate warming on ecosystems in these globally influential regions.

AB Tree populations in mesic (>650 mm precipitation/yr) savannas of the world have strong demographic bottlenecks to the transition of subadult trees to the canopy layer. Although such bottlenecks are a major determinant of savanna physiognomy, the factors that allow subadults to traverse the bottleneck are little studied. In a landscape-scale field experiment in a northern Australia savanna, we determined the survival and growth of 1506 permanently marked juveniles (<150 cm tall) and saplings (150-599 cm tall) of canopy species in response to season of fire (early dry season, late dry season, wet season, and unburned), and understory type (herbaceous forbs vs. sorghum [native annual grass]) that differ in seasonal growth patterns and competitive regimes. Trees were assessed before fires and at the end of the following growing season, without repeat fires. We used Akaike-information-criterion-based model selection and multi-model inference for data analyses. Initial height was an important explanatory variable for all responses except genet mortality wherein fire season was important for juveniles and understory type for saplings. Fire season was important to height growth of large juveniles and small saplings (enhanced the year following dry-season fires). Fire season x understory interactions were important for height growth of small juveniles and for the proportion of juveniles transitioning to saplings. Changes in stem numbers were affected by all explanatory variables. All fires topkilled most juveniles (fewer in early dry-season fires in herbaceous understory), but genet death was rare. Late dry-season fires topkilled most saplings; they failed to regain previous height and some died the following year. Given no further fires, persistent large juveniles can grow to sapling size within a year; whereas sapling success is severely hampered by late-dry-season fires, especially in grassy understory. Differences in seasonal phenological patterns of both understory vegetation and trees that vary with size and life history stage are among suggested explanatory mechanisms. Weighted averaged model coefficients for all responses to the explanatory variables are provided for use in population dynamics models. A conceptual framework links landscape-scale variables to tree attributes and responses, with implications for population ecology and community assembly.

AB Human-wildlife conflicts are a global problem, and are occurring in many countries where human and wildlife requirements overlap. Conflicts are particularly common near protected areas where societal unrest is large. To ease conflict, integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) have been implemented. The Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) is an example of an ICDP. We hypothesized that (i) a higher perceived effectiveness of CAMPFIRE would be associated with a decline in human-wildlife conflicts, and (ii) local communities with higher perceived effectiveness of CAMPFIRE programs would have more favorable attitudes towards problematic wild animals. Four focus group discussions and interviews with 236 respondents were conducted in four local communities adjacent to northern Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe from December 2010 to August 2011. Moreover, we included data on recorded incidences of human-wildlife conflicts and CAMPFIRE financial returns to study communities between 2000 and 2010. Our results indicate that local communities showed considerable differences in how CAMPFIRE effectiveness was perceived. Local communities with higher ratings of CAMPFIRE effectiveness generally perceived a decline in human-wildlife conflicts, although some people had experienced problems with wild animals. Attitudes towards main problematic wild animals varied across the study communities and were partly associated with perceived CAMPFIRE effectiveness. Our findings partly support both of our study hypotheses. Contextual factors across the four local communities seemed to influence the perceived effectiveness of CAMPFIRE programs and attitudes towards problematic wildlife species. We recommend that decisions and actions regarding the control of problem animals be devolved to the community level in order to help reduce human-wildlife conflicts in community-based natural resources management programs.

AB Local habitat structure and resource availability appear to be of great importance for the diversity, abundance, and community structure of bees. We examined the contribution of three different habitat types (farmland, forest edge, forest understory) to bee diversity in a tropical forest-agriculture mosaic in Western Kenya and analysed differences and overlap in plant-bee community interactions between nearby habitats. We used network properties (network size and specialization indices) and bee species turnover to examine temporal and spatial variation of flower-visitation interaction networks in general and in bee species composition in detail across habitats. In total we found 121 bee and 89 plant species involved in the interactions. Results suggest that bees were limited by floral resources because the largest networks, highest diversity, and largest abundances were found at the forest edge and in the farmland which hosted higher amounts of flowers and a more homogeneous distribution of resources in space and time. Forest in the study area is characterized by (1) lower flower density and (2) more humid conditions relative to the farmland. We therefore suggest that the species-rich and structurally diverse farmland acts as a "pollinator rescue" which supports bee communities in the natural forest. We advise conservation managers and politicians to conserve the structural richness of the farmland to (1) preserve bee diversity within the farmland and (2) conserve positive effects of the farmland on bee activity in the forest remnant.

AB Pollination webs have recently deepened our understanding of complex ecosystem functions and the susceptibility of biotic networks to anthropogenic disturbances. Extensive mutualistic networks from tropical species-rich communities, however, are extremely scarce. We present fully quantitative pollination webs of two plant-pollinator communities of natural heathland sites, one of which was in the process of being restored, on the oceanic island of Mauritius. The web interaction data cover a full flowering season from September 2003 to March 2004 and include all flowering plant and their pollinator species. Pollination webs at both sites were dominated by a few super-abundant, disproportionately well-connected species, and many rare and specialised species. The webs differed greatly in size, reflecting higher plant and pollinator species richness and abundance at the restored site. About one fifth of plant species at the smaller community received < 3 visits. The main pollinators were insects from diverse taxonomic groups, while the few vertebrate pollinator species were abundant and highly linked. The difference in plant community composition between sites appeared to strongly affect the associated pollinator community and interactions with native plant species. Low visitation rate to introduced plant species suggested little indirect competition for pollinators with native plant species. Overall, our results indicated that the community structure was highly complex in comparison to temperate heathland communities. We discuss the observed differences in plant linkage and pollinator diversity and abundance between the sites with respect to habitat restoration management and its influence on pollination web structure and complexity. For habitat restoration to be successful in the long term, practitioners should aim to maintain structural diversity to support a species-rich and abundant pollinator assemblage which ensures native plant reproduction.

AB Microbial communities play an important role in stream ecosystem processes, such as breakdown of senescent leaf litter, and as a primary nutritional source for detritivorous macroinvertebrates. Antibiotics may affect stream microbial communities and associated ecosystem processes, especially because recent stream and river monitoring programs have indicated the presence of antibiotics downstream of wastewater treatment plants. In the current study, effects of chronic exposure to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin (Cipro) were examined on stream microbial community-level physiological profiles and growth indices of detritivorous amphipods (Gammarus spp.) and caddisflies (Lepidostoma liba). Microcosm experiments were conducted using stream sediments and water, senesced leaf material (Acer saccharum), and macroinvertebrates. A shift in function of leaf-associated microbial communities (based on carbon source utilization) was observed for samples exposed to 100 mu g/L of Cipro for 12 d compared to control and treatments exposed to 1 and 10 mu g/L of Cipro. This was attributable to carbohydrate substrates, which had 2.7- to 3.5-fold lower microbial respiration than the lower concentrations and control (p < 0.001). For detritivores, Gammarus spp. condition index did not differ among control, 0.1, and 1.0 mu g/L treatments after 30-d exposures (p > 0.05). Similarly, L. liba growth rate did not vary among control, 10, and 100 mu g/L treatments after 45-d exposures (p > 0.05). These results suggest that Cipro may affect leaf-associated microbial communities, but at concentrations four orders of magnitude above those detected in streams. However, effects of the antibiotic on growth and condition of detritivores were not observed. Future work should focus on identifying specific changes in stream microbial communities as a result of Cipro exposure and impacts on other aquatic species.

AB Understanding patterns of connectivity among marine fish populations with demersal adults and pelagic larvae is critical for effective conservation of west coast rockfishes. The brown rockfish (Sebastes auriculatus) occurs in nearshore habitat and is common from northern Baja California, Mexico to northern California, rare off the outer coast of Oregon and Washington and again common in the inland waters of Puget Sound, Washington. Here we examine patterns of microsatellite DNA diversity from throughout the species' range as an indirect measure of long-term trends in larval dispersal. Genetic divergence was large and highly significant over all populations (F-ST=0.056, P < 0.0001), and was significantly correlated with geographic distance when considering coastal populations. The best estimates of mean coastal dispersal distance were on the order of 10 km or less per generation. Diversity was relatively low in the Puget Sound, suggesting that Puget Sound rockfish populations experienced a post-glacial founder effect followed by genetic isolation and low effective population size. Puget Sound individuals appeared to have recent mixed ancestry as a result of introgression with S. maliger and S. caurinus. Genetic isolation of Puget Sound fish provides a basis for consideration as a Distinct Population Segment (DPS) under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act. We recommend that coastal brown rockfish fisheries be managed at regional rather than coast-wide scales, and that design of marine reserve networks considers the surprisingly low realized dispersal distance of some species with high dispersal potential.

AB The mechanisms leading to structure in local assemblages are controversial. On the one hand, assemblage structure is thought to be the outcome of local interactions determined by the properties of species and their responses to the local environment. Alternatively, this structure has been shown to be an emergent property of assemblages of identical individuals or of random sampling of a regional assemblage. In ants at baits, a combination of environmental stress and interspecific competition is widely held to lead to a unimodal relationship between the abundance of dominant ants and species richness. It is thought that in comparatively adverse environments, both abundance and richness are low. As habitats become more favorable, abundance increases until the abundance of dominant ants is so high that they exclude those that are subordinate and so depress richness. Here we demonstrate empirically that this relationship is remarkably similar across three continents. Using a null model approach, we then show that the ascending part of the relationship is largely constrained to take this form not simply as a consequence of stress but also as a result of the shape of abundance frequency distributions. While the form of the species-abundance frequency distribution can also produce the descending part of the relationship, interspecific competition might lead to it too. Scatter about the relationship, which is generally not discussed in the literature, may well be a consequence of resource availability and environmental patchiness. Our results draw attention to the significance of regional processes in structuring ant assemblages.

AB Although tropical rain forests represent the most species-rich terrestrial ecosystem on the planet, the three main rain forest regions (Neotropics, South-East Asia and continental Africa) are not equally diverse. Africa has been labeled the "odd man out" because of its perceived lower species diversity when compared to the Neotropics or South-East Asia. Understanding why, within a biome, certain regions have higher or lower species diversity provides important insights into the evolution of biodiversity. I review the evidence in favor of an "odd man out" pattern and the different hypotheses that have been advanced to explain and test this pattern using recent ecological, biogeographical and diversification studies. The "odd man out" pattern has yet to be formally tested using extensive inventory plot data (including non woody species) between all three major rain forest regions based on appropriate statistics in an area controlled manner. The lower species diversity is not the result of a single cause, but is probably linked to numerous intricate causes related to present and past events. Future comparative studies should combine numerous variables including novel ones such at plant functional diversity. Finally, though more extinction in Africa is apparent from the fossil record, it is still hard to precisely quantify to what degree extinction varied between the three major regions. Diversification studies of important tropical plant lineages tend to support higher speciation rates in the Neotropics and South-East Asia instead of higher extinction in Africa as the main cause explaining the differences in species diversity. The lower species diversity of African rain forests remains an understudied question with numerous preconceived and largely untested ideas for which we are still far from having a synthetic explanation. This review highlights that there are still very little intercontinental rain forest comparisons of plant species diversity hindering any solid conclusions. To better address this, an integrative approach involving archeologists, climatologists and biologists coupled with data from all three regions should be privileged.

AB We review the current state of knowledge of quantified impacts of invasive alien plants on water quality, with a focus on South Africa. In South Africa, over 200 introduced plant species are regarded as invasive. Many of these species are particularly prominent in riparian ecosystems and their spread results in native species loss, increased biomass and fire intensity and consequent erosion, as well as decreased river flows. Research on the impact of invasive alien plants on water resources has historically focused on water quantity. However, although invasive alien plants also affect the quality of water, this aspect has not been well documented. Alien invasive plants increase evaporation rates, and reduce stream flow and dilution capacity. The biomass inputs of alien invasive plants, especially nitrogen fixers such as Acacia spp., alter nutrient cycles and can elevate nutrient concentrations in groundwater. Alien plant invasions alter the fire regimes in invaded areas by changing the size, distribution and plant chemistry of the biomass. More intense fires increase soil erosion and thereby decrease water quality. In contrast to riparian invasions, aquatic invasive plants have been more extensively studied in South Africa and their impacts on water quality have been relatively well monitored. Water quality in South Africa is rapidly deteriorating, and all factors that influence this deterioration need to be taken into account when formulating actions to address the problem. The changes in water quality brought about by alien plant invasions can exacerbate the already serious water quality problems.

AB Aim
   Evidence indicates that species are responding to climate change through distributional range shifts that track suitable climatic conditions. We aim to elucidate the role of meso-scale dispersal barriers in climate-tracking responses.
   Location
   South coast of England (the English Channel).
   Methods
   Historical distributional data of four intertidal invertebrate species were logistically regressed against sea surface temperature (SST) to determine a climate envelope. This envelope was used to estimate the expected climate-tracking response since 1990 along the coast, which was compared with observed range expansions. A hydrodynamic modelling approach was used to identify dispersal barriers and explore disparities between expected and observed climate tracking.
   Results
   Range shifts detected by field survey over the past 20 years were less than those predicted by the changes that have occurred in SST. Hydrodynamic model simulations indicated that physical barriers produced by complex tidal currents have variably restricted dispersal of pelagic larvae amongst the four species.
   Main conclusions
   We provide the first evidence that meso-scale hydrodynamic barriers have limited climate-induced range shifts and demonstrate that life history traits affect the ability of species to overcome such barriers. This suggests that current forecasts may be flawed, both by overestimating range shifts and by underestimating climatic tolerances of species. This has implications for our understanding of climate change impacts on global biodiversity.

AB P>1. The management of the habitat of insectivorous species often targets increasing the availability of arthropod prey. However, this may be hindered by lack of knowledge of the mechanisms that determine food availability for insectivores. Prey abundance is often used as a surrogate for availability, but this may be incorrect wherever habitat factors limit access to prey. Ground vegetation clutter is likely to be such a limiting factor for ground foraging insectivorous bats, and we investigated this possibility using Myotis myotis as a model.
   2. We performed captivity experiments to determine how ground vegetation density affects foraging. Bats were provided with crickets hidden in sparse, medium and dense grass cover. In addition, we used bat radio tracking data, prey abundance measurements, and geographic information system (GIS) modelling to determine if clutter influences how bats select foraging areas in a Mediterranean region.
   3. The experiments demonstrated that ground vegetation clutter greatly reduces access to prey, affecting both capture success and time to capture. Bats detected prey in the dense vegetation, but did not attempt to capture them or did so only after a prolonged delay. Their attempts often failed, because the bats landed over prey with open wings, presumably to increase the catching surface, and the dense vegetation prevented them from reaching the ground.
   4. In the study area, cover types with the densest ground vegetation harboured the most prey, but clutter made access to prey by M. myotis difficult. Corroborating this, the GIS models showed that bats avoided foraging in habitats with high prey abundance but in which availability was decreased by dense ground vegetation.
   5. Ungrazed grasslands reach vegetation densities that limit access to prey by ground foraging bats, as observed in the study area. However, grazing by cattle reduced clutter to levels equivalent to the sparse treatment in our captive experiments, in which bats captured prey easily.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Conservation of ground foraging bats may require the management of their feeding grounds, to increase or maintain prey availability, particularly near important colonies. While dense ground vegetation may promote prey density, it dramatically reduces access to prey and usage by bats; hence, this should be considered by managers. Moderate grazing can be used to reduce ground vegetation cover to levels that permit foraging by bats.

AB Mechanisms controlling the successful invasion of resource demanding species into low-resource environments are still poorly understood. Well-adapted native species are often considered superior competitors under stressful conditions. Here we investigate the competitive ability of the resource demanding alien Acacia longifolia, which invades nutrient-poor Mediterranean sand dunes such as in coastal areas of Portugal. We explore the hypothesis that drought may limit invasion in a factorial competition experiment of the alien invasive versus two native species of different functional groups (Halimium halimifolium, Pinus pinea), under well-watered and drought conditions. Changes in biomass, allocation pattern, and N-uptake-efficiency (via N-15-labeling) indicated a marked drought sensitivity of the invader. However, highly efficient drought adaptations of the native species did not provide a competitive advantage under water limiting conditions. The competitive strength of H. halimifolium towards the alien invader under well-watered conditions turned into a positive interaction between both species under drought. Further, low resource utilization by native species benefited A. longifolia by permitting continued high nitrogen uptake under drought. Hence, the N-fixing invader expresses low plasticity by continuous high resource utilization, even under low resource conditions. The introduction of novel traits into a community like N-fixation and high resource use may promote A. longifolia invasiveness through changes in the physical environment, i.e., the water and nutrient cycle of the invaded sand dune system, thereby potentially disrupting the co-evolved interactions within the native plant community.

AB In the Ross Sea region of Antarctica, ornithogenic soils form on land under Adelie Penguin rookeries. Compared with mineral soils of the Ross Sea region, ornithogenic soils are generally high in microbial biomass, organic carbon, and total nitrogen and phosphorus, with high electrical conductivity and large variations in pH. The objective of this study was to assess the bacterial composition of ornithogenic soils from Cape Hallett and Cape Bird in the Ross Sea region using culture-independent methods. Soil clone libraries were constructed and those clones that occurred >= 3 times were sequenced. The bacterial diversity of the soils was dependent on the presence of penguins. Firmicutes most closely related to the endospore-formers (e. g., Oceanobacillus profundus and Clostridium acidurici) and (or) Gammaproteobacteria belonging to the genus Psychrobacter dominated soils currently occupied with penguins. In contrast, Gammaproteobacteria, closely related to cultured members of the genera Rhodanobacter, Psychrobacter, Dokdonella, and Lysobacter, dominated the soils previously colonized by penguins. Results of this study indicate that despite relatively high nutrient levels and microbial biomass, bacterial communities of ornithogenic soils were not more diverse than those of mineral soils of the Ross Sea region of Antarctica.

AB We used morphometric data from 1276 Crocodylus moreletii captured in northern Belize (1992-2001) to develop predictive models for determining body size (total length [TL], snout-vent length [SVL]) from measurements of single attributes (dorsal cranial length [DCL], cranial width [CW], snout length [SL] and width [SW], body mass [BM], rear-foot length [RFL]), quantify sexual size dimorphism, examine ontogenetic changes in cranial morphology, re-evaluate maximum body size attained by this species, and estimate standing crop biomass of crocodiles at our principal study site. Strong positive allometric relationships were found between measures of body length and other morphometric attributes, and provide a reliable means to estimate body length from tracks, skulls, and body parts. The maximum DCL:CW ratio is attained at a relatively small body size and preceded a dietary shift from insects and arachnids to vertebrates and ampullarid snails. The SL:SW ratio of C. moreletii is highly variable and because of overlap with C. acutus, deemed of little value for distinguishing these two sympatric species. Both overall and adult sex ratio (female:male) was male biased and differed significantly from parity. The mean SVL of adult males (98.3 +/- 21.3 cm) was significantly greater than that of adult females (87.3 +/- 15.9 cm). A compressed sexual size dimorphism index (SDI) of 2.12 was calculated for C. moreletii in northern Belize. Based on skull measurements, the current size record for C. moreletii in Belize is 362 cm TL Standing crop biomass of C. moreletii at our principal study site (Gold Button Lagoon) was estimated to be 9.5 kg/ha.

AB Acacia saligna was regarded as the most troublesome invasive alien weed in the Cape Floristic region. The gall-forming rust fungus Uromycladium tepperianum was introduced into South Africa in 1987, and it established throughout the range of the weed. Five populations of the weed were monitored annually from 1991 to 2005. Tree density and stem diameter were recorded in each of four permanent transects at each site. Tree density declined by between 87% and 98% for the period 1991-2005 at these five sites. Average annual mortality rate (+/- SE) of infected trees dying was 18% (+/- 2%) during the same period. Canopy mass and age were determined by destructively sampling trees at 19 sites. Canopy mass at all sites was lower than data published before introduction of U. tepperianum, and the longer since the last major disturbance (fires or clearing operations), the greater the reduction. Average age of trees in these sites was between 2.2 and 6.1 years, despite the last major disturbance being at least 10-20 years previous at 11 of the sites. Pod and seed production were determined, and seed fall calculated, at each of four sites in 2004. These data were compared to the same variables gathered in 1989. Seed fall in 2004 was reduced compared to that recorded earlier. Results show that U. tepperianum remains a highly effective biological control agent against A. saligna in South Africa.

AB Dispersal kernels provide a useful way to quantify the average spatial distribution of propagules originating from a given point in space. Consequently, dispersal kernels have been used in analytical and numerical studies of short- and long-distance dispersal of marine invertebrates and fish with pelagic larval stages. In most cases, the shape of dispersal kernels is pre-determined and parameterised with knowledge of larval duration or mean current velocities homogeneously across space. Here, the characteristics of planktonic larval dispersal for near-shore species in a realistic coastal ocean flow are investigated through the use of a numerical ocean model of a section of the central Chilean coast. The 3-dimensional primitive equation model was forced by 4 yr of observed winds from Las Cruces. Planktonic larval dispersal was simulated by advecting passive drifters using the evolving model velocity field. No a priori assumptions were made about diffusion-advection statistics. Drifters were released daily from regularly spaced locations along the coast and were considered to have settled if found within 1 km of the coast 30 d after release. Observed dispersal kernels were then calculated for each release location, and their variability in space and time was examined. This variability was found to be substantial over spatial scales less than a typical larval- advection scale, and, as a result, a spatially and temporally averaged dispersal kernel was inadequate as a global model of settlement. Large along-shore variation in the shape of dispersal kernels led to significant variation in the spatial pattern of connectivity among local sites, with some acting as net sources and some as net sinks within scales of 10s of kilometres. These results are linked to the alongshore and seasonal variability in ocean circulation, in particular close to shore. Both local and global dispersal kernels were found to be non-Gaussian, with their distribution related to that of the ocean velocity field. It is concluded that, in realistic flows with complicated coastal geometry, considerable departure from the expected Gaussian dispersal kernels based on homogeneous flow conditions can lead to complex spatial patterns of connectivity and successful settlement along a relatively simple but real coastline.

AB Question: How consistent are relationships of forest lichen community composition with environmental variables across geographic scales within region and across regions?
   Location: Northwestern continental USA and east central continental USA.
   Method: Four macrolichen data sets were compiled using identical plot sample protocol: species abundance estimated in 0.4-ha permanent plots on a systematic grid, as part of government (USDA-FS) forest inventory programs. One data set in each region represented a large area; the other represented part of the large area. We used global NMS ordination of plots based on species abundance to extract major axes of variation in community composition. Correlations of species, guilds, and environmental variables with ordination axes were compared between geographic scales for the two regions.
   Results: Primary axes of community variation at larger scales were correlated with climate variables and related geographic variables such as latitude and elevation, and with pollution. Forest vegetation variables such as stand age and tree species composition became more important at small scales. Community variation unexplained by macro-environment variables also became more important at small scales. Of several hundred species tested, ten lichen species showed consistent behaviour between scales within region (one also across regions) and are thus potential general indicators of ecological conditions in forests. Of six lichen guilds tested, several show strong patterns not consistently related to environmental conditions
   Conclusions: Interpretation of lichen species and community composition as indicating particular environmental conditions is context-dependent in most cases. Observed relationships should not be generalized beyond the geographic and ecological scale of observation.

AB Although there is no consense among phytosociologists about how to define an association, little attention has been given to this question in the recent literature. BRAUN-BLANQUET'S concept was based on character species with restricted geographical validity. However, all efforts to clarify the geographical limits of character species in a methodologically sound way have failed so far. The re-examination of the original definition of the association established by the International Botanical Congress at Brussels in 1910 reveals a possible solution: (1) The first and most important criterion for an association is its "definite floristic composition". It is shown that this criterion is only fulfilled if the syntaxon has a sufficient number of good diagnostic species. It is recommended to use the "total cover value ratio" to measure the diagnostic value of a species and to consider those species as good diagnostic species which have a total cover value at least ten times higher than in the compared syntaxon. (2) Associations belonging to the same formation should clearly differ from each other either in their site conditions or in their distribution. Floristical difference contains no useful information as long as it can't be interpreted as reflection of a different habitat or a different vegetation history. Population processes, intraspecific variation, autocorrelation, microhabitat mosaics and stochastic events set an absolute limit to all classification efforts.

AB Spatial and temporal variation in patterns of distribution and abundance of algal assemblages is large and often occurs at extremely small spatial and temporal scales, Despite this, few studies investigate interactions between these scales, that is, how patterns of spatial variation change through time. This study investigated a number of scales of spatial variation (from tens of centimetres to kilometres) in assemblages of intertidal and subtidal turfing algae. Significant differences were found in the composition and abundances of species in assemblages of turf at all spatial scales tested. Much of the variation among assemblages could, however, be explained at the scale of quadrats (tens of centimetres apart) (27 +/- 1.4 (SE)% of dissimilarity) with an additional 7 +/- 1.2% explained at the scale of sites (tens of metres apart) and 10 +/- 1.5% at the scale of locations (kilometres apart). Although the greatest dissimilarity in assemblages occurred at the scale of habitats, this accounted for a relatively small proportion of the overall variation in assemblages. These patterns were consistent through time, that is, at each sampling time the spatial scale explaining the greatest proportion of variation in assemblages was replicate quadrats separated by tens of centimetres, These patterns appear to be due to small-scale variation in patterns of distribution and abundances of the individual species that comprise turfing algal assemblages. The results of this experiment suggest that large scale processes have less effect on patterns of variability of algal assemblages than those occurring on relatively smaller spatial scales and that small-scale spatial variation should not be considered as simply "noise".

AB Extensive field observations were made in the Mingan Islands, northern Gulf of St Lawrence, to evaluate spatial and temporal variations in the use of habitat and prey resources by two major subtidal predators, the seastars Leptasterias polaris and Asterias vulgaris. Although both seastars have similar size structures and generally overlapped in their spatial and temporal distribution, the degree of overlap varied in different sites and appeared to be related to prey abundance, substratum type and slope. Three general patterns were observed: (1) both species aggregating in shallow water and decreasing in numbers with depth; (2) the two species showing inverse depth distributions; and (3) both seastars occurring in low numbers across the subtidal zone. Temporal changes in availability of the preferred prey of the two seastars, the mussel Mytilus edulis, appeared to be a major factor affecting their abundance and distribution. The two seastars occurred together in dense aggregations on mussel beds in shallow water. They consume similar-sized mussels until the number of mussels becomes reduced when A. vulgaris, but not L. polaris, begins to select larger mussels. Once a mussel bed is decimated, the seastars appear to move away, possibly in search of other beds. Intensive seastar foraging limits the distribution of mussels to a few metres in depth. Below the mussel zone, the two seastars are spatially segregated at a small spatial scale (l m(2) quadrat) and select different alternative prey, L. polaris feeding mainly on the crevice-dwelling clam Hiatella arctica and A. vulgaris on the ophiuroid Ophiopholis aculeata. The size partitioning of the preferred prey in shallow water, and spatial segregation and selection of different alternative prey at greater depths may reflect mechanisms permitting the two seastars to coexist.

AB Zooplankton can consume a substantial portion of the phytoplankton, but grazing rates are notoriously variable seasonally and among sites. We developed models relating grazing rates to characteristics of zooplankton communities, food concentration, and water temperature. Grazing rates were measured in 30 zooplankton communities that differed in biomass, size distribution, and taxonomic composition. Crustaceans grazed per day 2-21 % of the chlorophyll in algae <35-mu-m, which is within the range of most grazing rates measured in other studies. Grazing rates were positively related to zooplankton biomass and negatively related to food concentration, although much variation among communities remains unexplained (R2 = 0. 1 9-0.35). Surprisingly, we could not detect a general relationship between zooplankton size distribution and grazing rate. Communities dominated by large zooplankton (mostly Daphnia and Diaphanosoma) did not tend to have higher grazing rates than communities dominated by small zooplankton. Zooplankton taxonomic composition was significantly related to grazing rates but explained little variation among communities. Grazing rates calculated from published allometric equations were biased, usually overestimating phytoplankton removal by zooplankton.

AB The interiors of plants are colonized by diverse microorganisms that are referred to as endophytes. Endophytes have received much attention over the past few decades, yet many questions remain unanswered regarding patterns in their biodiversity at local to global scales. To characterize research effort to date, we synthesized results from similar to 600 published studies. Our survey revealed a global research interest and highlighted several gaps in knowledge. For instance, of the 17 biomes encompassed by our survey, 7 were understudied and together composed only 7% of the studies that we considered. We found that fungal endophyte diversity has been characterized in at least one host from 30% of embryophyte families, while bacterial endophytes have been surveyed in hosts from only 10.5% of families. We complimented our survey with a vote counting procedure to determine endophyte richness patterns among plant tissue types. We found that variation in endophyte assemblages in above-ground tissues varied with host growth habit. Stems were the richest tissue in woody plants, whereas roots were the richest tissue in graminoids. For forbs, we found no consistent differences in relative tissue richness among studies. We propose future directions to fill the gaps in knowledge we uncovered and inspire further research.

AB Conservation of imperiled species often demands addressing a complex suite of threats that undermine species viability. Regulatory approaches, such as the US Endangered Species Act (1973), tend to focus on anthropogenic threats through adoption of policies and regulatory mechanisms. However, persistent ecosystem-based threats, such as invasive species and altered disturbance regimes, remain critical issues for most at-risk species considered to be conservation-reliant. We describe an approach for addressing persistent ecosystem threats to at-risk species based on ecological resilience and resistance concepts that is currently being used to conserve greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and sagebrush ecosystems. The approach links biophysical indicators of ecosystem resilience and resistance with species-specific population and habitat requisites in a risk-based framework to identify priority areas for management and guide allocation of resources to manage persistent ecosystem-based threats. US federal land management and natural resource agencies have adopted this framework as a foundation for prioritizing sage-grouse conservation resources and determining effective restoration and management strategies. Because threats and strategies to address them cross-cut program areas, an integrated approach that includes wildland fire operations, postfire rehabilitation, fuels management, and habitat restoration is being used. We believe this approach is applicable to species conservation in other largely intact ecosystems with persistent, ecosystem-based threats. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB AimTo quantify the relative importance of propagule pressure, climate-matching and host availability for the invasion of agricultural pest arthropods in Europe and to forecast newly emerging pest species and European areas with the highest risk of arthropod invasion under current climate and a future climate scenario (A1F1).
   LocationEurope.
   MethodsWe quantified propagule pressure, climate-matching and host availability by aggregating large global databases for trade, European arthropod interceptions, Koeppen-Geiger world climate classification (including the A1F1 climate change scenario until 2100) and host plant distributions for 118 quarantine arthropod species.
   ResultsAs expected, all the three factors, propagule pressure, climate suitability and host availability, significantly explained quarantine arthropod invasions in Europe, but the propagule pressure only had a positive effect on invasion success when considered together with climate suitability and host availability. Climate change according to the A1F1 scenario generally increased the climate suitability of north-eastern European countries and reduced the climate suitability of central European countries for pest arthropod invasions.
   Main conclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that propagule pressure interacts with other factors to drive invasions and is not alone sufficient to explain arthropod establishment patterns. European countries with more suitable climate and large agricultural areas of suitable host plants for pest arthropods should thus be more vigilant about introduction pathways. Moreover, efforts to reduce the propagule pressure, such as preventing pests from entering pathways and strengthening border controls, will become more important in north-eastern Europe in the future as the climate becomes more favourable to arthropod invasions.

AB Some alien woody species used in commercial forestry become invasive and, as invaders, cause major problems in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. However, the deliberate introduction of aliens can bring unintended negative changes also within areas of their cultivation. This paper presents the effects of the intentional introduction of the North-American Quercus rubra in European mixed Scots pine-Pedunculate oak forests (POFs): Querco roboris-Pinetum (W. Mat. 1981) J. Mat. 1988. Phytosociological data from field research combined with GIS data analysis of the current distribution of Northern Red oak in the studied habitat were used to determine the composition and structure of forest communities in plots with and without Q. rubra participation.
   The results show that Q. rubra significantly reduces native species richness and abundance, both in old-growth and in secondary (post-agricultural) forests. Not one resident vascular plant benefits from the introduction of Northern Red oak and only a few are able to tolerate its co-occurrence. The natural restocking of all native woody species is also strongly limited by this alien tree.
   The introduction of Northern Red oak significantly limits the environmental functions of the POF ecosystem and weakens its economic and social aspects. However, its further cultivation is justified from an economic point of view, as the essential function of the studied forests is commercial timber production, and the introduction of this fast growing alien tree supports the provisioning ecosystem services. A clear description of the level of trade-off between the accepted negative and positive effects of the introduction of Q. rubra on forest ecosystem services requires further interdisciplinary studies.

AB Introduction of exotic plants change soil microbial communities which may have detrimental ecological consequences for ecosystems. In this study, we examined the community structure and species richness of ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi associated with exotic pine plantations in relation to adjacent native ectomycorrhizal trees in Iran to elucidate the symbiont exchange between distantly related hosts, i.e. Fagales (Fagaceae and Betulaceae) and Pinaceae. The combination of morphological and molecular identification approaches revealed that 84.6 % of species with more than one occurrence (at least once on pines) were shared with native trees and only 5.9 % were found exclusively on pine root tips. The community diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the pine plantations adjacent to native EcM trees was comparable to their adjacent native trees, but the isolated plantations hosted relatively a species-poor community. Specific mycobionts of conifers were dominant in the isolated plantation while rarely found in the plantations adjacent to native EcM trees. These data demonstrate the importance of habitat isolation and dispersal limitation of EcM fungi in their potential of host range expansion. The great number of shared and possibly compatible symbiotic species between exotic Pinaceae and local Fagales (Fagaceae and Betulaceae) may reflect their evolutionary adaptations and/or ancestral compatibility with one another.

AB Three recent meta-analyses of protective plant-ant mutualisms report a surprisingly weak relationship between herbivore protection and measured demographic benefits to ant-plants, suggesting high tolerance for herbivory, substantial costs of ant-mediated defense, and/or benefits that are realized episodically rather than continuously. Experimental manipulations of protective ant-plant associations typically last for less than a year, yet virtually all specialized myrmecophytes are long-lived perennials for which the costs and benefits of maintaining ant symbionts could accrue at different rates over the host's lifetime. To complement long-term monitoring studies, we experimentally excluded each of four ant symbionts from their long-lived myrmecophyte host trees (Acacia drepanolobium) for 4.5 years. Ant species varied in their effectiveness against herbivores and in their effects on intermediate-term growth and reproduction, but the level of herbivore protection provided was a poor predictor of the net impact they had on host trees. Removal of the three Crematogaster species resulted in cumulative gains in host tree growth and/or reproduction over the course of the experiment, despite the fact that two of those species significantly reduce chronic herbivore damage. In contrast, although T. penzigi is a relatively poor defender, the low cost of maintaining this ant symbiont apparently eliminated negative impacts on overall tree growth and reproduction, resulting in enhanced allocation to new branch growth by the final census. Acacia drepanolobium is evidently highly tolerant of herbivory by insects and small browsers, and the costs of maintaining Crematogaster colonies exceeded the benefits received during the study. No experimental trees were killed by elephants, but elephant damage was uniquely associated with reduced tree growth, and at least one ant species (C. mimosae) strongly deterred elephant browsing. We hypothesize that rare but catastrophic damage by elephants may be more important than chronic herbivory in maintaining the costly myrmecophyte habit in this system.

AB Question
   Are the patterns of alien conifer (Pinaceae, Cupressaceae) invasions different between continents, and how is invasion success influenced by commercial forestry practices?
   Location
   Temperate and subtropical countries and regions (n = 60) from five continents spanning both hemispheres.
   Methods
   We used generalized linear mixed models to test how continent identity, region area and use in commercial forestry affect probabilities of Pinaceae and Cupressaceae species to escape following introduction and cumulative logit regression models to assess how these predictors affect the likelihood that a species becomes naturalized or invasive.
   Results
   Sixty Pinaceae of a global total of 232 and 26 Cupressaceae of a total of 142 species have escaped from cultivation across the study regions examined. Average numbers of both alien Pinaceae and Cupressaceae species per region were highest in Oceania, followed by Africa. Moreover, the probability of alien Cupressaceae and Pinaceae becoming naturalized or invasive was particularly high in these two continents. For both families, species used in commercial forestry have a significantly higher probability of escape than those which are only introduced for ornamental or other purposes. In the case of Pinaceae, forestry species also become naturalized or invasive more frequently than non-forestry species, while no such effect was detectable for Cupressaceae.
   Conclusions
   We found that non-native conifers are more likely to escape from cultivation, naturalize and turn into invasive weeds on the continents of the Southern Hemisphere. In addition to this biogeographic signal, introduction effort strongly determines the behaviour of introduced Pinaceae, and less so, Cupressaceae. A clear conflict exists between the economic benefits of conifer forestry and the risks to the environment from invasions. Future expansion of commercial forestry should address spatial planning to ecosystems vulnerable to invasion and adopt comprehensive risk assessment procedures.

AB Variation in the size of home range of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has broad implications for managing populations, agricultural damage, and disease spread and transmission. Size of home range of deer also varies seasonally because plant phenology dictates the vegetation types that are used as foraging or resting sites. Knowledge of the landscape configuration and connectivity that contributes to variation in size of home range of deer for the region is needed to fully understand differences and similarities of deer ecology throughout the Midwest. We developed a research team from four Midwestern states to investigate how size of home range of deer in agro-forested landscapes is influenced by variations in landscape characteristics that provide essential habitat components. We found that for resident female deer, annual size of home range in Illinois (mean = 0.99 km(2)), Michigan (mean = 1.34 km(2)), Nebraska (mean = 1.20 km(2)), and Wisconsin (mean = 1.47 km(2)) did not differ across the region (F (3,175) = 0.42, P = 0.737), but differences between agricultural growing and nongrowing periods were apparent. Variables influencing size of home range included: distance to forests, roads, and urban development from the centroid of deer home range, and percent of crop as well as four landscape pattern indices (contrast-weighted edge density, mean nearest neighbor, area-weighted mean shape index, and patch size coefficient of variation). We also identified differences in model selection for four landscapes created hierarchically to reflect levels of landscape connectivity determined from perceived ability of deer to traverse the landscape. Connectivity of selected forested regions within agro-forested ecosystems across the Midwest plays a greater role in understanding the size of home ranges than traditional definitions of deer habitat conditions and landscape configuration.

AB Dry forests of the Caribbean islands are among the most endangered tropical ecosystems. Above and beyond several centuries of anthropogenic disturbances, most of these forests are prone to natural, catastrophic disturbances such as hurricanes. This study was conducted in a set of 2400-m(2) permanent inventory plots established in an old-growth dry forest on the calcareous island of Grande-Terre, Guadeloupe (FWI). It aimed at assessing various aspects of forest recovery after the forest had been struck by Hurricane Hugo (1989). Floristic composition, litterfall, stem density, basal area and tree growth (girth increment) for trees with girth >= 10 cm at breast height, were monitored from 1987 to 1996-98. Species richness remained quite stable over the period of study (30-34 species), although some qualitative changes occurred. Nine years after the hurricane, neither stem density and basal area, nor girth increment, had returned to pre-hurricane values (respectively 3800 stems ha(-1), 21.5 m(2) ha(-1) and 7.1 mm year(-1)). Stem growth, however, had clearly been impeded by drought in the last 4 years of the study. Leaf litter production was restored both qualitatively and quantitatively as of the fourth year following Hurricane Hugo, whereas wood and reproductive components had not fully attained pre-hurricane values by the end of the study. Though hardly distinguishable from the superimposed effects of other recurrent anthropogenic (e.g. charcoal production) or natural stressors (e.g. wildfires and drought), hurricane disturbance in dry forests appears to affect the forest structure on a longer time-scale rather than the functioning of the forest ecosystem.

AB Selective pressure for choosing an adequate habitat should be strong in semisedentary animals because they have limited mobility once established. I examined microhabitat preferences and the adaptive value of these preferences in the antlion larva Myrmeloen crudelis, a semisedentary insect that digs pit traps in soils to capture small arthropods. I tested the habitat preferences of M. crudelis between two soil types in a tropical dry forest of Costa Rica. Specifically, I compared the soil particle composition size within and outside antlion aggregations and manipulated the availability of fine- and coarse-grained soil to assess how differences in soil grain size affect the design and performance of larval traps. Adjacent to antlion pits the soil was composed of a greater proportion of fine- grained particles (< 2 mm) than soil 1 m away from the pits. A set of experiments demonstrated that ( 1) in the presence of equal availability of fine- and coarse-grained soils, all larvae built their pits in fine- grained soil; ( 2) the larvae required less time to start and finish traps in fine- grained soil; ( 3) the larvae constructed larger and deeper pits in fine- grained soil; and ( 4) prey capture increased greatly in fine- grained traps compared with coarse-grained traps. Antlion larvae respond to variations in the proportion of fine particles in the soil, suggesting that antlion aggregations result from an active microhabitat selection. The preference for fine- grained soils is adaptive since pits constructed in such substrate are functional for longer periods and much more successful in trapping prey than pits in coarse-grained soil. Sit-and-wait predators that use sessile traps are spatially constrained to track prey abundance. Therefore, the ability to detect and select microhabitats with better conditions that enhance capture success may be under strong selection for this type of organism.

AB 1. Competitive interactions within and between size-classes of the limpet Patella depressa Pennant were investigated in central Portugal. Experimental enclosures of 25 x 25 cm containing marked limpets were set up at mid-tidal level on the shore. Twelve treatments with different combination of densities and size-classes were assigned to the plots, with three replicates of each. Mortality was recorded every 15 days and length was measured monthly during the approximately 6 months of the experiment.
   2. At the end of the experiment limpets were collected for determination of length, height, dry weight, sex and gonad development. The availability of food was assessed indirectly by determination of chlorophyll concentration with spectrophotometric analysis of rock chips. Reduced density treatments showed very low mortality and substantially increased growth. Both size-classes of limpets showed increased mortality and reduced growth in increased density treatments. This effect was, however, more marked for large than small limpets when caged separately.
   3. Although both size-classes could negatively affect each other, the effect of large limpets on small was greater than the reverse. Large limpets are superior competitors that may modulate the abundance of small limpets on the shore. It is unlikely, however, that they will totally exclude small limpets due to intensity of competition within the large size-class. Niche differentiation and high recruitment at low shore levels are other possible factors that can contribute to reduce competition between the size-classes.

AB Interspecific variation in water-induced fluctuations in stem girth demonstrates the mechanisms promoting coexistence in seasonally dry tropical forest. In addition, these fluctuations are a potential, but unevaluated, source of bias in measurements of annual tree growth rates. To examine diurnal and seasonal patterns of stem diameter change, tree girth was measured over 2 years (1997-1999), using dendrometer bands, for three species (Celtis mildbraedii, C. zenkeri and Strombosia glaucescens) in semi-deciduous forest in Ghana. Soil matric potential was measured concurrently at 15 cm depth. In addition, measurements of all trees >20 cm dbh on three, 1 ha plots were made at the beginning and middle of the 1998/1999 dry season. During the severe 1997/1998 dry season, soil matric potential declined below -1.5 MPa and two species showed significant stem shrinkage. For the evergreen species, C mildbraedii, there was a significant positive effect of tree diameter on stem shrinkage, and shrinkage was greater in the second, compared to the first, half of the dry season. For the deciduous species, C zenkeri, shrinkage was reduced during the second half of the dry season, following leaf fall. During 1998/1999, soil matric potential, did not decline below - 1.5 MPa, and rates of girth change remained positive for all species. There were no significant effects of size or phenology on the rate of girth change in the plot-based study. Deviations in annual increment calculated over successive monthly intervals indicate that a 10-fold difference in soil water availability between measurement occasions can lead to a 4% bias in estimates of annual growth. Measurements of forest plots should be made when inter-annual variation in soil water availability is low. In this forest, measurements should, therefore, be made during the wet season, contrary to published recommendations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We explore the relationships between environmental factors and vegetative and reproductive phenology in nine dominant perennial plant species in a semi-arid ecosystem in central Mexico. In spite of the highly seasonal environment at the study site, and a relatively long dry period. at least one species was always in some phase of growth or reproduction for the duration of the study (April 1996-June 1998). Two patterns in leafing were observed. Some shrub species maintained their leaves during the entire year, whereas others lost their leaves during the dry season. The cacti Neobuxbaumia tetetzo and Cephalocereus columna-trajani showed slow growth, however they produced areoles throughout the study. Echinocactus platyacanthus ceased areolar production during the driest period of the study. Throughout the both years, the dispersion of flowering and fruiting peaks among all the species studied were random. However, these species formed four distinct groups based on reproductive phenology and life form. (1) Shrubs with a general root system (0-1 m depth), Mimosa luisana and Caesalpinia melanadenia, and the succulent nanophanerophyte with shallow roots, E. platyacanthus, flowered and fruited during the rainy season; (2) Phreatophytic shrubs, Prosopis laevigata and Cercidium praecox, and succulent mesophanerophytes with shallow roots, N. tetetzo and C. columna-trajani, flowered and fruited before the rainy season; (3) Castela tortuosa, a shrub with general root system, was the only species to flower and fruit all year long, (4) The semisucculent shrub with general root system, Ipomoea arborescens, flowered and fruited after the rainy season. These phenological patterns were correlated principally with soil moisture, maximum temperature, and to a lesser degree, relative humidity and photoperiod. Our results support the hypothesis that the coexistence of these species in and zones is due to differences in resource utilization, (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB The management of riverine wetlands, recognized as a major component of biodiversity in fluvial hydrosystems, is problematic. Preservation or restoration of such ecosystems requires a method to assess the major ecological processes operating in the wetlands, the sustainability of the aquatic stage, and the restoration potential of each riverine wetland. We propose a method of diagnosis based on aquatic macrophytes and helophytes. Plant communities are used because they are easy to survey and provide information about (1) the origin of a water supply (i.e., groundwater, seepage, or surface river water) and its nutrient content, (2) effects of flood disturbances, and (3) terrestrialization processes. The novelty of the method is that, in contrast to available typologies, it is based on the interference of gradients resulting from several processes, which makes it possible to predict wetland sustainability and restoration potential. These predictions result from knowledge of the processes involved in terrestrialization, i.e., the influence of flood disturbances, occurrence of groundwater supplies, trophic degree, and water permanency of the habitat during a yearly cycle. The method is demonstrated on five different river systems.

AB Introduced plant species at the Hastings Reservation comprise 17% of the total flora, and are predominantly annual herbs and grasses.  No introduced species are present in chaparral, coastal sage or rock outcrops and very few (4% of the total species number) in the mixed evergreen woodland.  The highest percentage of introduced species is found in disturbed areas (40%), such as roadsides and around buildings.  Introduced species have successfully invaded native grasslands (22%), oak foothill woodland (15%) and riparian areas (15%).  In these vegetation types, introduced plants form an integral part, and in grasslands and the understory of oak foothill woodland, annual introduced grasses are the dominant species.  The only difference found between established and recorded, but not-established, is that the latter is more recorded in disturbed areas.  This reinforces anecdotal evidence that humans are the main cause of, intentional or accidental, dispersal into this reservation and that the most likely habitats of first establishment are the disturbed areas around houses and roads.  Not all introduced species are capable of establishing a foothold in these disturbed areas and an even smaller portion is capable of intruding into grassland and oak foothill woodland.  Both these vegetation types are characterized by high natural disturbance, mainly caused by pocket gophers.  Vegetation types with less frequent disturbance, such as chaparral, coastal sage and mixed evergreen oak woodlands are not, or much less, invasible.  Finally, most of the introduced species trace their origin to a similar Mediterranean climate in Europe.

AB Physiological rates of individual organisms are well related to their body size. These allometric relationships suggest that ecological rates should also be related to the size structure of organisms in populations, communities, and ecosystems. We describe size distributions of zooplankton communities and explore the implications of such distributions on community grazing rates. Ninety zooplankton communities, varying in biomass and in size distributions, were sampled in 28 lakes in northeastern North America and their grazing rates were predicted with an allometric equation. Zooplankton size distributions vary in shape but, on average, can be described as bimodal. Predicted community mass-specific grazing rate decreases with increasing mean body size (r2 = 0.92) and is only slightly affected by the shape of community size distributions. Community biomass on the other hand increases with mean body size (r2 = 0.39). Total zooplankton grazing mte is expected to be higher in communities dominated by large zooplankton, but this relationship is obscured (r2 = 0. 1 5) by temporal and spatial variability in zooplankton biomass. Although body size is a powerful predictor of individual physiological rates, its importance is expected to be largely masked at the level of communities.

AB The quest for understanding how species interactions modulate diversity has progressed by theoretical and empirical advances following niche and network theories. Yet, niche studies have been limited to describe coexistence within tropic levels despite incorporating information about multi-trophic interactions. Network approaches could address this limitation, but they have ignored the structure of species interactions within trophic levels. Here we call for the integration of niche and network theories to reach new frontiers of knowledge exploring how interactions within and across trophic levels promote species coexistence. This integration is possible due to the strong parallelisms in the historical development, ecological concepts, and associated mathematical tools of both theories. We provide a guideline to integrate this framework with observational and experimental studies.

AB 1. Woody encroachment is a pervasive challenge facing savanna and grassland managers world-wide. Proposed drivers of the phenomenon range from local changes in fire, herbivory and direct human impacts, to global changes in climate or atmospheric [CO2] that may be accelerating woody growth. The relative influences of local versus global drivers and their interactions are largely unknown, but will determine the extent to which management can limit woody encroachment locally.
   2. We examined recent woody encroachment in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in South Africa from 2007 to 2014. Vegetation transects were distributed across broad gradients in rainfall, herbivore use intensity and fire frequency, on a variety of soils.
   3. Density of medium trees (2-4 m tall) increased dramatically (by 46%) in seven years, while densities of small and large trees remained constant. Increases in medium tree density were largest on sandy soils, where fires were infrequent and where grazing pressure increased.
   4. Tree density increased even where recent fire frequency was similar to historical fire regimes. These potentially widespread increases, unexplained by changes in local disturbance history, suggest the possible influence of drivers outside the scope of local control.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Fire can provide a limited buffer against generalized woody encroachment in savannas, but may only prevent further encroachment where managers can increase fire frequency. Grazing, which can limit fire frequency and intensity, may come increasingly into conflict with efforts to control woody encroachment, presenting a stark choice for savanna managers between maintenance of short-term grazer population productivity and longer-term prevention of woody encroachment.

Here, we use an IBD approach to determine patterns of connectivity to infer dispersal distances for a phylogenetically diverse range of marine species.
   LocationTwo thousand and eight hundred kilometre of South African coastline.
   MethodsmtDNA data sets for 11 rocky shore and reef-dwelling marine species with diverse life history strategies (broadcast spawning, brooding and live-bearing) were used to quantify intraspecific genetic connectivity by means of global and pairwise (st). Mantel tests were used to assess the significance of genetic structure with geographic distance. Significant, positive slopes were used to estimate dispersal distances. For all species, we also plotted genetic diversity along the coast and compared this to patterns of species richness.
   ResultsFor seven of the 11 species tested, we report positive IBD relationships, with patterns of IBD of similar magnitude in broadcast spawners and live-bearers. Dispersal estimates were low, with effective distances of <10km per generation. We find discordance between pelagic larval development and population structure and that genetic structure and the physio-geographic features of the coastline considered to be important biogeographic barriers do not overlap. Genetic diversity and species richness show congruent patterns, with both variables lowest on the west coast, and increasing towards the east.
   Main conclusionsOur study highlights the complexity of marine systems and the clear need for regional assessments of connectivity, rather than more general management plans which may not otherwise effectively encompass area-specific conservation needs. Importantly, we show that the current marine protected area (MPA) network in South Africa is not effective in protecting evolutionary processes and strongly recommend a network of more closely spaced MPAs in the region that reflects the low average connectivity between distant marine populations.

AB AimTo study the combined effects of climate change on connectivity between marine protected areas (MPAs) and larval supply to the continental shelf.
   LocationThe Mediterranean Sea, where sea surface temperatures are expected to strongly increase by the end of the 21st century, represents an archetypal situation with a dense MPA network but resource overexploitation outside.
   MethodsUsing an individual-based mechanistic model of larval transport, forced with an emission-driven regional climate change scenario for the Mediterranean Sea, we explored the combined effects of changes in hydrodynamics, adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on the connectivity among MPAs and their ability to seed fished areas with larvae.
   ResultsWe show that, over the period 1970-2099, larval dispersal distances would decrease by 10%, the continental shelf area seeded with larvae would decrease by 3% and the larval retention fraction would increase by 5%, resulting in higher concentration of larvae in smaller areas of the continental shelf. However, connectance within the MPA network would increase by 5% as more northern MPAs would become suitable for reproduction with increasing temperatures. We also show that the effects of changes in adult reproductive timing and larval dispersal on connectivity patterns are additive.
   Main conclusionsClimate change will influence connectivity and the effectiveness of MPA networks, and should receive more attention in future conservation planning and large-scale population dynamics.

AB The process of coral larval dispersal is important for coral reef ecosystems, but remains poorly understood and hard to gauge. Better knowledge of inter-reef connectivity patterns would be useful in enabling better management of coral reef waters however. By employing a spatially explicit numerical modelling approach, we simulate larval dispersal through the central section of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), comprising over 1000 reefs, and identify spatial patterns in the inter-reef connectivity network using a community detection method from network science. This paper presents the modelling approach used and discusses the significance of the results.
   Inter-reef connectivity networks were estimated for 4 different coral species, and significant differences between them were found. We show how we can partition reefs into clusters, or "communities", that are sparsely connected with each other, and therefore identify important barriers to larval dispersal. By fine-tuning a resolution parameter in the community detection method, we can find dispersal barriers of varying strength. Finally, we show that the average connectivity length scale varies significantly across the different reef communities, and suggest that this may have repercussions for the optimal placement of marine protected areas (MPAs) to maximise connectivity with surrounding reefs.

AB We take the first step in the development of a new field of research with the aim of merging spatial morphology and resilience science. This involves a revisiting and reunderstanding of the meaning of sustainable urban form. We briefly describe the fields of resilience science and spatial morphology. Drawing on a selected set of propositions in both fields, we put urban form in the context of the adaptive renewal cycle, a dynamic framework model used in resilience science to capture the dynamics of complex adaptive systems, of which urban systems are prime examples. We discuss the insights generated in this endeavor, dealing with some key morphological aspects in relation to four key attributes of resilience, i.e., "change," "diversity," "self-organization," and "learning." We discuss and relate these to urban form and other social variables, with special attention paid to the " backloop phase" of the adaptive renewal cycle. We conclude by postulating ways in which resilience thinking could contribute to the development of a new research frontier for addressing designs for resilient urban social-ecological systems, and end by proposing three strategic areas of research in such a field.

AB Tropical forests are becoming increasingly alien-dominated through the establishment of timber plantations and secondary forests. Despite widespread recognition that afforestation results in increased evapotranspiration and lower catchment yields, little is known of the impacts of timber plantations on water balance relative to native forest. Native forest trees have been claimed to use water conservatively and enhance groundwater recharge relative to faster-growing alien species, and this argument should motivate native forest preservation and restoration. However, data have been available primarily for leaf-level gas exchange rather than for whole-plant and stand levels. We measured sap flow of dominant tree and tree fern species over eight weeks in native Metrosideros polymorpha forest and adjacent alien timber plantations on the island of Hawai'i and estimated total stand transpiration. Metrosideros polymorpha had the lowest values of sap flux density and whole-tree water use (200 kg.m(-2) sapwood.d(-1), or 8 kg/d for trees of 35 cm mean diameter at breast height, D), substantially less than timber species Eucalyptus saligna or Fraxinus uhdei (33 and 34 kg/d for trees of 73 and 30 cm mean D, respectively). At the stand level, E. saligna and F. uhdei trees had three-and ninefold higher water use, respectively, than native M. polymorpha trees. Understory Cibotium tree ferns were most abundant in M. polymorpha-dominated forest where they accounted for 70% of water use. Overall, F. uhdei plantation had the highest water use at 1.8 mm/d, more than twice that of either E. saligna plantation or M. polymorpha forest. Forest water use was influenced by species composition, stem density, tree size, sapwood allocation, and understory contributions. Transpiration varied strongly among forest types even within the same wet tropical climate, and in this case, native forest had strikingly conservative water use. Comparisons of vegetation cover in water use should provide additional resolution to ecosystem valuation and land management decisions.

AB The hypothesis that the history of management compliance (strong versus variable), closure size (0.3 to 28 km(2)), closure age (2 to 39 yr), and habitat/geographic variables influenced total fish biomass, the number of species, and the ratio of herbivores to carnivores in no-take areas was tested. Twenty existing closures across 6 countries in the western Indian Ocean were sampled during the same time period (2004 to 2007). Geographic location and closure attributes were weak to moderate predictors of these coral reef fish community variables for analyses of all closures. Strong interactions between fish community variables and levels of compliance indicated that high compliance sites largely drove the closure-fish community relationships. Variable or weak compliance and closures <1 km(2) exhibited limited recovery of fish communities. The closure area-fish biomass data for strong-compliance closures indicates that biomass is stable above 5 km(2). A mix of community-based, private, and national program closures were sampled, and, although low sample sizes within each of these management systems precludes conclusive analysis, none of these management systems was universally successful in terms of compliance or maximizing fish community variables.

AB The midgut glands (hepatopancreas) of terrestrial isopods contain bacterial symbionts. We analysed the phylogenetic diversity of hepatopancreatic bacteria in isopod species from various suborders colonizing marine, semiterrestrial, terrestrial and freshwater habitats. Hepatopancreatic bacteria were absent in the marine isopod Idotea balthica (Valvifera). The symbiotic bacteria present in the midgut glands of the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus (Asellota) were closely related to members of the proteobacterial genera Rhodobacter, Burkholderia, Aeromonas or Rickettsiella, but differed markedly between populations. By contrast, species of the suborder Oniscidea were consistently colonized by the same phylotypes of hepatopancreatic bacteria. While symbionts in the semiterrestrial isopod Ligia oceanica (Oniscidea) were close relatives of Pseudomonas sp. (Gammaproteobacteria), individuals of the terrestrial isopod Oniscus asellus (Oniscidea) harboured either 'Candidatus Hepatoplasma crinochetorum' (Mollicutes) or 'Candidatus Hepatincola porcellionum' (Rickettsiales), previously described as symbionts of another terrestrial isopod, Porcellio scaber. These two uncultivated bacterial taxa were consistently present in each population of six and three different species of terrestrial isopods, respectively, collected in different geographical locations. However, infection rates of individuals within a population ranged between 10% and 100%, rendering vertical transmission unlikely. Rather, feeding experiments suggest that 'Candidatus Hepatoplasma crinochetorum' is environmentally transmitted to the progeny.

AB We studied the food habits and size-related dietary patterns of Morel et's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) in freshwater wetlands of northern Belize (1992-2000). Crocodiles (n=420) were classified as hatchlings, small juveniles, large juveniles, subadults or adults based on total length. Stomach contents were obtained primarily by stomach flushing. Prey items included aquatic and terrestrial insects, arachnids, aquatic gastropods, crustaceans, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Based on the percent occurrence of recovered prey items, we concluded that the smallest size classes feed largely on insects and arachnids. Large juveniles broadened their diet to include aquatic gastropods, crustaceans, fish and non-fish vertebrates. Insect and arachnid consumption declined sharply among subadults, and increasing amounts of aquatic gastropods and fish were recovered from this size class. The adult diet consisted mainly of aquatic gastropods, fish and crustaceans. Dietary diversity was greatest among large juveniles and subadults. Conversely, hatchlings and small juveniles had the most specialized (least diverse) diet owing to a reliance on insects and arachnids. Dietary overlap was greatest between adjacent size classes, and lowest between the smallest and largest size classes. We also provide field observations of prey-specific foraging behaviours.

AB in order to preserve diversity it is essential to understand how assemblages change across space. Despite this fact, we still know very little about how marine diversity is spatially distributed, especially among lesser-studied invertebrate taxa. In the present study beta-diversity patterns of sea urchins, sponges, mushroom corals and larger foraminifera were assessed in the Spermonde Archipelago (Indonesia). Using ordinations we showed that the inshore zone (< 5 km offshore), midshore zone (5 < x < 30 km offshore) and distance offshore zone (> 30 km offshore) all contained distinct assemblages of sponges and corals, while only foraminifera. assemblages from the inshore (< 5 km offshore) zone were distinct. There was a significant spatial pattern of community similarity for all taxa. surveyed, but this pattern proved to be wholly related to environmental variables for sponges and foraminifera, and primarily for mushroom corals and sea urchins. The lack of a pure spatial component suggests that these taxa may not be dispersal limited within the spatial scales of this study (c. 1600 km(2)). The analyses of the corals and foraminifera were additionally tested at two spatial scales of sampling. Both taxa. were primarily associated with local-scale environmental variables at the local scale and larger-scale variables at the larger scale. Mean inter-plot similarity was also higher and variation lower at the larger scale. The results suggest that substantial variation in similarity can be predicted using simple locally assessed environmental variables combined with remotely sensed parameters.

AB Based on 8 years of observations of a group of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) and a unit-group of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) living sympatrically in the montane forest at Kahuzi-Biega National Park, we compared their diet and analyzed dietary overlap between them in relation to fruit phenology. Data on fruit consumption were collected mainly from fecal samples, and phenology of preferred ape fruits was estimated by monitoring. Totals of 231 plant foods (116 species) and 137 plant foods (104 species) were recorded for gorillas and chimpanzees, respectively. Among these, 38% of gorilla foods and 64% of chimpanzee foods were eaten by both apes. Fruits accounted for the largest overlap between them (77% for gorillas and 59% for chimpanzees). Gorillas consumed more species of vegetative foods (especially bark) exclusively whereas chimpanzees consumed more species of fruits and animal foods exclusively. Although the number of fruit species available in the montane forest of Kahuzi is much lower than that in lowland forest, the number of fruit species per chimpanzee fecal sample (average 2.7 species) was similar to that for chimpanzees in the lowland habitats. By contrast, the number of fruit species per gorilla fecal sample (average 0.8 species) was much lower than that for gorillas in the lowland habitats. Fruit Consumption by both apes tended to increase during the dry season when ripe fruits were more abundant in their habitat. However, the number of fruit species consumed by chimpanzees did not change according to ripe fruit abundance. The species differences in fruit consumption may be attributed to the wide ranging of gorillas and repeated usage of a small range by chimpanzees and/or to avoidance of inter-specific contact by chimpanzees. The different staple foods (leaves and bark for gorillas and fig fruits for chimpanzees) characterize the dietary divergence between them in the montane forest of Kahuzi, where fruit is usually scarce. Gorillas rarely fed on insects, but chimpanzees occasionally fed on bees with honey, which possibly compensate for fruit scarcity. A comparison of dietary overlap between gorillas and chimpanzees across I habitats suggests that sympatry may not influence dietary overlap in fruit consumed but may stimulate behavioral divergence to reduce feeding competition between them.

AB The seasonal trend in root mass, root distribution with depth and root/shoot ratios along a degradation gradient were quantified over a 2 year period (2000/01 and 2001/02 growing seasons) for a semi-arid rangeland. Water-use efficiency (WUE) for each rangeland condition is defined as the quantity of above-ground phytomass produced per unit of water evaptranspired. Sampling was from rangeland artificially maintained in 3 different rangeland conditions viz. good, moderate and poor. Roots were extracted to a depth of 900 with 50 mm intervals, using a corer and then separated front the soil by wet sieving. Sampling of both above- and belowground phytomass production including litter. were at approximately bimonthly intervals to account for major seasonal changes. Most of the grassroots were found in the first 150 mm soil layer, but root distribution tended to be more superficial with rangeland degradation. Root mass in semi-arid rangelands are strongly seasonal with the most active Growth taking place during March and April. when the aboveeround is dormant. Both the above- and belowground phytomass productions decreased by rangeland degradation (p less than or equal to 0.01). The growing seasonal (October-March) average root mass to a depth or 900 mm was 3185, 2336 and 1162 kg ha(-1) respectively, for rangeland in good. moderate and poor condition, compared to the average above-ground phytomass production over the same period of 2341, 1648 and 695 kg ha(-1). It seems that root mass is greater than above-ground biomass for this semi-arid rangeland, with root production also more sensitive to rangeland degradation than above-ground production. The root/shoot ratios for rangeland in good, moderate and poor conditions ranged between 1.57-3.20, 1.65-3.46 and 2.06-7.14, respectively. Water-use efficiency declined (p less than or equal to 0.01) with rangeland degradation. Rangeland in good condition averaged a WUE of 2.97 kg above-ground phytomass produced ha(-1) mm(-1) evapotranspiration. The average litter productions were 99.55, 61.51 and 24.00 kg ha(-1), respectively, for rangeland in good, moderate and poor condition. As a proportion of annual phytomass production, litterfall of 5.35% for rangeland in good condition was obtained. This study is one of few root studies available where different rangeland conditions were evaluated and can serve as guidelines for sustainable utilization of the rangeland ecosystem in semi-arid climate.

AB Grow-out density is a key factor to consider in abalone mariculture. The growth of 30-50-mm Haliotis rubra was reduced at high density. About 1800 juveniles were individually tagged and reared for 5 months in 12 gravity-fed raceway tanks at high and low density. Their growth and distribution in the tanks was monitored monthly. Density was found to affect growth directly through competition for preferred shelter space and indirectly through the degradation of water quality. Initial size was negatively correlated to growth in the first month of the experiment. Ammonia in the water was directly correlated to the number of abalone present upstream. Ammonia was negatively correlated with growth after the effects of density and initial size were removed. Growth appeared to be significantly reduced by this level of chronic ammonia exposure, which is lower than the effective level reported previously (EC5 = 0.004 mg FAN/l).

AB Acacia mellifera is one of the most important encroaching woody plants in southern African savannas. Previous studies found that this species encroaches far more readily on rocky areas than on sandy substrates, although it grows larger on sandy substrates. Rocky substrates are known to retain more water than sandy substrates, which may be of vital importance during recruitment in semi-arid and arid environments. A number of studies have also indicated that competition with grasses may reduce the recruitment and biomass of tree seedlings. We created an experiment in a semi-arid environment (mean annual rainfall = 388 mm) that tested for the effects of rockiness on A. mellifera recruitment. We also tested the hypothesis that grasses effectively compete with A. mellifera in this environment by simulating the effect of grazing by clipping grasses from half the plots in both the rocky and sandy treatments. Significantly more A. mellifera seedlings established in plots where grasses were clipped than in control plots. A. mellifera seedlings had greater biomass on sandy substrates than on rocky substrates. No significant interaction effects were found between substrate and grass clipping treatment for either seedling number or biomass. We conclude that A. mellifera seedlings are more likely to encroach in habitats with low grass density, although they may achieve greater biomass on sandy soils. Thus, it may be the lower grass density rather than rockiness, which increases the encroachment observed in naturally rocky habitats. These results are also consistent with our observations that adult A. mellifera trees are larger on sandy soils than on rocky soils.

AB This study investigated the effects of cormorant colonies on plant-arthropod island food webs, the consequences of nutrient-rich runoff on marine communities, and feedback loops from marine to terrestrial ecosystems. Terrestrial plant responses were as expected, with the highest plant biomass on islands with low nest density and the highest nitrogen (N) content on islands with high nest density. In contrast to our hypothesis, we found no uniform density response across guilds. Among herbivores, the variable responses may depend on the relative importance of plant quality or quantity. As expected, nutrient-rich runoff entered water bodies surrounding cormorant nesting islands, but only at high nest density, and increased the density of emerging insects. This created a potential feed-back loop to spiders (major terrestrial predators), where stable isotope analyses suggested great use of chironomids. Contrary to our expectation, this potential feed-back did not result in the highest spider density on islands with a high cormorant nest density. Web spiders showed no changes in density on active cormorant islands, and lycosids were actually less abundant on active cormorant islands compared to reference islands. The variable response of spiders despite increased dipteran densities, and also in other consumer groups, may be due to direct negative effects of cormorants on soil chemistry, vegetation cover, and other density regulating forces (for example, top-down forces) not studied here. This study highlights the importance of including processes in the surrounding marine ecosystem to understand the impacts of seabirds on the food web structures of their nesting islands.

AB The ghost ant, Tapinoma melanocephalum (FABRICIUS, 1793), is a ubiquitous indoor and outdoor pest throughout much of the tropics and subtropics, and an increasingly common indoor pest in temperate regions. Here, I examine the taxonomy of T melanocephalum and map records from > 1500 sites to evaluate its worldwide spread and probable geographic origin.
   I document the earliest known T. melanocephalum records for 154 geographic areas (countries, major islands, island groups, US states, and Canadian provinces), including many areas for which I found no previously published records: Anguilla, Antigua & Barbuda, Barbados, Bonaire, Cambodia, Cape Verde, Cayman Islands, Comoro Islands, Curacao, Gabon, Gambia, Grenada, Italy, Kenya, Montserrat, Nevis. Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Martin, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Tapinoma melanocephalum has one of the widest distributions known for any ant species. It has spread across the Old World and New World in both the northern and southern hemispheres, though at latitudes greater than 30 degrees it is largely restricted to living inside buildings.
   In most parts of the world, T melanocephalum can be reliably distinguished from other ant species. In India, Southeast Asia, and the western Pacific region, however, T melanocephalum may be confused with closely related taxa, including Tapinoma minutum MAYR, 1862, Tapinoma indicum FOREL, 1895. and several seemingly intermediate forms. suggesting that T. melanocephalum originated in the Indo-Pacific region. Future research on the phylogeny of Tapinoma and on the genetic diversity of T. melanocephalum populations in different parts of the world should help elucidate further the native and exotic ranges of T. melanocephalum.

AB The foundation of many plant-ant mutualisms is ant protection of plants from herbivores in exchange for food and/or shelter. While the role of symbiotic ants in protecting plants from stem- and leaf-feeding herbivores has been intensively studied, the relationship between ant defense and measures of plant fitness has seldom been quantified. We studied ant aggression, damage by herbivores and seed predators, and fruit production among Acacia drepanolobium trees occupied by four different acacia-ant species in an East African savanna. Levels of ant aggression in response to experimental disturbance differed strongly among the four species. All four ant species recruited more strongly to new leaf growth on host plants following disturbance, while recruitment to developing fruits was on average an order of magnitude lower. Host plants occupied by more aggressive ant species suffered significantly less vegetative damage from leaf-feeding insects, stem- boring beetles, and vertebrate browsers than host plants occupied by less aggressive ant species. However, there were no differences among fruiting host plants occupied by different ant species in levels of seed predation by bruchid seed predators. Fruit production on host trees was significantly correlated with tree stem diameter but not with the identity of resident ants. Our results demonstrate that defense of host plants may differ substantially among ant species and between vegetative and reproductive structures and that fruit production is not necessarily correlated with high levels of aggression by resident ants.

AB Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems are nutrient-poor and depend for their functioning in part on external nutrients. However, little is known about the relative importance of various sources. We measured external mineral nutrient sources (wind blown material, precipitation and guano) at three locations, the cold temperate oceanic Falkland Islands (51 degrees 76'S), and the Maritime Antarctic Signy (60 degrees 71'S) and Anchorage Islands (67 degrees 61'S). These islands differ in the level of vegetation development through different environmental constraints and historical factors. Total mineral nitrogen input differed considerably between the islands. During the 3 month summer period it amounted to 18 mg N m(-2) on the Falkland Islands and 6 and 102 mg N m(-2) at Signy and Anchorage Islands, respectively. The high value for Anchorage was a result of guano deposition. By measuring stable isotopic composition (delta N-15) of the different nitrogen sources and the dominant plant species, we investigated the relative utilisation of each source by the vegetation at each island. We conclude that external mineral nitrogen inputs to Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems show great spatial variability, with the local presence of bird (or other vertebrate) colonies being particularly significant.

AB Erosion is one of the main problems in roadfill restoration. Revegetation is widely used as a method to reduce erosion rates, and it is often carried out through hydroseeding. In semiarid Mediterranean conditions, this approach to revegetation often produces poor results due to climatic limitations. We evaluated whether (1) spreading topsoil and (2) hydroseeding with local rather than commercial species mixtures could improve the vegetative cover of roadfills. The study was carried out in 24 plots over a 20-month period. At the end of the study, vegetation cover was higher in topsoiled plots (38.8%) than in nontopsoiled plots (21.5%). Locally selected species produced higher vegetative cover (61.1%) than did standard commercial species (52.2%). After 20 months, the erosion index was not different among any treatment probably due to the low sensitivity of this variable. These results suggest that amendment of soils through the addition of topsoil is an important technique in roadfill revegetation in Mediterranean environments. Additionally, hydroseeding with local species will produce better vegetative cover on roadfills than does hydroseeding with available commercial species.

AB Within an extensive programme on the Seine river, including the large reservoirs in the upstream basin, zooplankton populations were investigated at the reservoir-river interface to find out their fate when released into the river. Zooplankton structure, abundance and biomass were analysed in the river upstream and downstream from the reservoir, in the release canal and in the reservoir. Whereas the river zooplankton are dominated by rotifers, microcrustaceans represent a large part of the population in the reservoir, because of the longer residence time (6 months). We have shown that the reservoir is a source of zooplankton; we calculated a biomass export of 30-60 tons C year(-1), which is, however, rapidly lost in the river. One of the main loss factors was found to be selective fish predation on larger zooplankton species developed in the reservoir.

AB 1 The demographies of two long-lived arid zone shrubs, Eremophila maitlandii. and Eremophila forrestii, were characterized using data from a grazing trial (1983-93) in arid Western Australia. Two sites were used, one dominated by annual pasture, the other by shrubs. Recruitment, mortality and size change were described from 11 annual samplings, encompassing conditions of prolonged drought and 1 year of unusually high rainfall.
   2 The dynamics of these two species can be described by a combination of event-driven and continuous processes, Both recruitment and mortality were observed in all years for both species. Highest rates of recruitment were observed during the wet year and in the two subsequent years. Highest rates of mortality were observed in the 2 years following the year of lowest rainfall.
   3 Stocking rate had no effect on the mortality rate of the unpalatable E. forrestii but the mortality rate of the palatable E. maitlandii was greater under high stocking. The effect of high stocking and low rainfall was additive, rather than excessive stocking being especially damaging in drought years,
   4 Higher mortality rates were observed in the shorter and younger stages of both species. Tall individuals had very low mortality rates, Shrubs decreased in height in the year(s) before death.
   5 Individuals of both species increased in height during the wet period and decreased during the drought. Net change in height over the trial period was small. High stocking led to higher rates of size decline during the drought. There was large height variation within all cohorts and many plants present at the start of the trial remained short, Taken together, these results suggest that caution must be exercised if size frequency distributions are used to infer population dynamics.

AB Inputs of inorganic nutrients in 1992 from seabirds (white-capped noddy and wedgetail shearwater, maximum of ca 80 000 breeding pairs) are compared to inputs from humans (97 700 person days) on Heron Island at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We estimated that noddies deposited ca 107 t, and shearwaters ca 22 t, of fresh guano. The composition of fresh noddy guano was 7.3% nitrogen, 1.5% phosphorus, 60% moisture and 31.2% other substances. Assuming a similar composition for shearwaters, the total annual deposition of guano contained 9.4 t nitrogen and 1.9 t phosphorus. Experiments examining effects of ageing of guano indicated a large decrease in total nitrogen in guano under humid conditions over 4 d as a result of volatilisation of NH3. Under natural conditions most of the deposited nitrogen is likely to be lost as NH3 and a relatively small fraction of the soluble component leached into the cay, but the precise dynamics will depend on rainfall and wind patterns. Phosphorus was not volatilised from guano under any experimental conditions. Although inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus from human sewage into the cay system (ca 0.3 t of each) were much less than that from birds, all nutrients from humans are released in liquid form and percolate directly into the cay. Significant seasonal and tidal variations in standing concentrations of NH3, oxidised forms of nitrogen (NO2+NO3), and PO4 were detected in the water column around the island. Trends of higher mean concentrations of all nutrients in summer than in winter, and higher concentrations at low tide than at high tide except at sites close to the island where nutrient levels were high independent of tide, suggest that nutrients may be transported from guano on Heron Island into the water immediately surrounding the island. The exact fate and mechanisms of transport of all nutrients require further attention.

AB Negative interactions have been suggested as a major barrier for species arriving in a new habitat. More recently, positive interactions drew attention from community assembly theory and invasion science. The invasional meltdown hypothesis (IMH) introduced the idea that positive interactions among non-native species could facilitate one another's invasion, even increasing their impact upon the native community. Many studies have addressed IMH, but with contrasting results, reflecting various types of evidence on a multitude of scales. Here we use the hierarchy-of-hypotheses (HoH) approach to differentiate key aspects of IMH, organizing and linking empirical studies to sub-hypotheses of IMH. We also assess the level of empirical support for each sub-hypothesis based on the evidence reported in the studies. We identified 150 studies addressing IMH. The majority of studies support IMH, but the evidence comes from studies with different aims and questions. Supporting studies at the community or ecosystem level are currently rare. Evidence is scarce for marine habitats and vertebrates. Few sub-hypotheses are questioned by more than 50% of the evaluated studies, indicating that non-native species do not affect each other's survival, growth, reproduction, abundance, density or biomass in reciprocal A <-> B interactions. With the HoH for IMH presented here, we can monitor progress in empirical tests and evidences of IMH. For instance, more tests at the community and ecosystem level are needed, as these are necessary to address the core of this hypothesis.

AB Background and Aims Unrelated organisms that share similar niches often exhibit patterns of convergent evolution in functional traits. Based on bimodal distributions of hawkmoth tongue lengths and tubular white flowers in Africa, this study hypothesized that long-tongued hawkmoths comprise a pollination niche (ecological opportunity) that is distinct from that of shorter-tongued hawkmoths.
   Methods Field observations, light trapping, camera surveillance and pollen load analysis were used to identify pollinators of plant species with very long-tubed (>8 cm) flowers. The nectar properties and spectral reflectance of these flowers were also measured. The frequency distributions of proboscis length for all captured hawkmoths and floral tube length for a representative sample of night-blooming plant species were determined. The geographical distributions of both native and introduced plant species with very long floral tubes were mapped.
   Key Results The convolvulus hawkmoth Agrius convolvuli is identified as the most important pollinator of African plants with very long-tubed flowers. Plants pollinated by this hawkmoth species tend to have a very long (approx. 10 cm) and narrow flower tube or spur, white flowers and large volumes of dilute nectar. It is estimated that >70 grassland and savanna plant species in Africa belong to the Agrius pollination guild. In South Africa, at least 23 native species have very long floral tubes, and pollination by A. convolvuli or, rarely, by the closely related hawkmoth Coelonia fulvinotata, has been confirmed for 11 of these species. The guild is strikingly absent from the species-rich Cape floral region and now includes at least four non-native invasive species with long-tubed flowers that are pre-adapted for pollination by A. convolvuli.
   Conclusions This study highlights the value of a niche perspective on pollination, which provides a framework for making predictions about the ecological importance of keystone pollinators, and for understanding patterns of convergent evolution and the role of floral traits in plant colonization.

AB Fire is an important ecological disturbance in vegetated ecosystems across the globe, and also has considerable impacts on human infrastructure. Vegetation flammability is a key bottom-up control on fire regimes and on the nature of individual fires. Although New Zealand (NZ) historically had low fire frequencies, anthropogenic fires have considerably impacted indigenous vegetation as humans used fire extensively to clear forests. Few studies of vegetation flammability have been undertaken in NZ and only one has compared the flammability of indigenous plants; this was a qualitative assessment derived from expert opinion. We addressed this knowledge gap by measuring the flammability of terminal shoots from a range of trees and shrubs found in NZ. We quantified shoot flammability of 60 indigenous and exotic species, and compared our experimentally derived ranking with expert opinion. The most flammable species was the invasive exotic shrub Gorse (Ulex europaeus), followed by Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), K (u) over bar marahou (Pomaderris kumeraho), Rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) and Silver Beech (Lophozonia menziesii). Our experimentally derived ranking was strongly correlated with expert opinion, lending support to both methods. Our results are useful to ecologists seeking to understand how fires have and will influence NZ's ecosystems, and for fire managers identifying high-risk landscapes, and low flammability species for green firebreaks'.

AB A 60-day indoor growth trial was conducted to study the effect of dietary supplementation of periphyton on growth performance and digestive enzyme activities in Penaeus monodon juvenile. Periphyton developed over bamboo substrate in outdoor cistern tanks (15 m(2)) was used as a dietary supplement in P. monodon (2.02 +/- 0.04 g) reared in 1000 l fiberglass reinforced plastic tank. Graded level of dried periphyton was included in shrimp basal diets; 0% (control), 3% (T1), 6% (T2), 9% (T3) and a control diet with natural bamboo substrate for periphyton growth (T4) served as a positive control. Significantly lower (p<0.01) level of NO3-N, and PO4-P were noticed in T4 compared to other experimental groups, while no significant difference in other water quality parameters were noticed among the treatments. At the end of the feeding trial, significantly higher (p<0.01) body weight was noticed in T2 (5.50 +/- 0.21 g) and T4 (5.33 +/- 0.13 g) compared with control (4.44 +/- 0.17 g). Similarly, significantly better (p<0.01) feed conversion ratio (FCR), 2.01 +/- 0.08 and protein efficiency ratio (PER), 2.70 +/- 0.12 was noticed in T2 compared to control (FCR 2.81 +/- 0.19 and PER 1.94 +/- 0.14) and T3 (FCR 3.58 +/- 0.14 and PER 1.51 +/- 0.06), while no significant difference was noticed between T4 and T1. At the end of the feeding trial, there was 75.45, 128.3, 178.5 and 76.6% significant increase (p<0.05) in gut digestive enzymes amylase, cellulase, protease and trypsin respectively in T2 compared with control. Similarly, most of the digestive enzyme activities in T1 and T4 were superior compared to control and T3. However, treatment with 9% level of periphyton inclusion (T3) did not differ significantly (p>0.05) for most of the digestive enzyme activities, growth, FCR and PER compared with control indicating inherent upper limit of periphyton inclusion. The present study elucidates the suitability of periphyton as a novel dietary supplement and its supplementation up to 6% in shrimp for enhancing growth and digestive enzyme activities in tiger shrimp juvenile.

AB Despite a widespread recognition of the role of seabird colonies in the fertilization of nutrient-poor polar terrestrial ecosystems, qualitative and quantitative data documenting any consequential influence on soil invertebrate communities are still lacking. Therefore, we studied community structure and abundance of springtails (Collembola) in ornithogenic tundra near two large seabird colonies in Hornsund, south-west Spitsbergen. We found considerably (5-20x) higher densities and biomass of Collembola in the vicinities of both colonies (the effect extending up to ca. 50 m from the colony edge) than in comparable control areas of tundra not influenced by allochtonous nutrient input. The most common springtails observed in the seabird-influenced areas were Folsomia quadrioculata, Hypogastrura viatica and Megaphorura arctica. The latter species appeared the most resistant to ornithogenic nutrient input and was found commonly closest to the bird colonies. Collembolan abundance decreased with increasing distance from the seabird colonies. However, relationships between collembolan density and specific physicochemical soil parameters and vegetation characteristics were weak. The most important factors were the cover of the nitrophilous green alga Prasiola crispa, total plant biomass and soil solution conductivity, all of which were correlated with distance from the colony and estimated amount by guano deposition. Community composition and abundance of springtails showed no evidence of being influenced of seabird diet, with no differences apparent between communities found in ornithogenic tundra developing in the vicinity of planktivorous and piscivorous seabird colonies. The study provides confirmation of the influence of marine nutrient input by seabirds on soil microfaunal communities.

   DILEMMA; CLIMATE
AB "Votingwith feet" describes the prominent social phenomenon that people tend to move away from deteriorating neighborhoods and search for and join prosperous groups. To quantify the role this kind of expectation-driven migration plays in the evolution of cooperation, here we study a simple yet effective model of cooperation based on spatial public goods games. The population structure is characterized by a square lattice with some nodes being left empty. Individuals have expectations toward their current habitats. Dissatisfied players, whose expectation is not met after interacting with all directly connected neighbors, tend to abstain from the groups of low quality by moving away and explore the physical niches of avail. How fast interaction happens relatively to selection is regulated by the time-scale ratio of game interaction to natural selection. Under strong selection, simulation results show that cooperation is greatly improved for either low, moderate, or high expectations compared to whenever the expectation-driven migration is absent. Further explorations reveal that neither too high nor too low but rather a combination of moderate expectations and rapid interaction establishes cooperation for a moderate public goods enhancement factor. There exists an optimal interval of expectation level most favoring the evolution of cooperation as the required time-scale ratio is minimized.

AB There are at least two immediate reasons why it is important to determine the role of biotic interactions, such as pollination, in limiting species distribution ranges. Firstly, if range limits are imposed by biotic factors, current and future distribution ranges might not be constrained by climate. Secondly, if biotic interactions limit the distribution ranges of species, anthropogenic impacts on these interactions are likely to have a major effect on biodiversity. Here we test the role of pollination in limiting plant distributions by studying plant community assembly in a guild of 15 oil-secreting orchids (Coryciinae) along a pollination gradient. In all members of the guild, seed production depends on pollination by the oil-collecting bee Rediviva peringueyi (Melittidae). While the mode of aboveground reproduction is uniform across the guild, the orchid species differ widely in their capacity for belowground clonal reproduction through the formation of bulbils, and hence span a range of predicted dependence on pollination (and subsequent seed set) for population persistence. Pollination rate by R. peringueyi varied across the landscape from 0 to 98% of flowers pollinated. With decreasing pollination, species richness of the orchid guild declined, and species were lost by the successive deletion of the least clonal species. Thus, pollination is shown to act as a biotic filter, excluding non-clonal species from pollinator-poor communities. The findings are consistent with the idea that pollination mutualisms matter ecologically by limiting the distribution of non-clonal plants. Conversely, the results suggest that clonality allows some plant species to escape from the range of their pollinators.

AB Urban ecosystems pose different environmental constraints on plant and animal communities than natural ecosystems, and this in turn might affect ecological interactions. We investigated plant pollinator interactions in urban vegetation communities in the context of local community structure and two landscape metrics describing the surrounding urban matrix. We recorded plant species diversity, floral density, pollinator species and floral visits at 89 flowering patches within the urban matrix, and used Trifolium pratense as a focal plant species.
   We correlated visits by all species, by bees, by bees when excluding the main visitor Bombus pascuorum, and by the main visitor alone T. pratense with the landscape metrics "green area", representing the total extent of vegetated areas, and "edge density of green areas", representing the degree of habitat fragmentation, at scales from 20 to 200 m. Extent of green area was positively correlated with visits by all species, by bees, and by Bombus pascuorum, but negatively with bees excluding the main visitor. The correlation increased with scale for all four variables, and the strongest correlations were found for B. pascuorum. The direction of correlation between edge density and the visitation variables was similar as for green area, but showed considerable variation at scales below 100 m radius.
   Visits by all bees and all visitors to T. pratense were negatively affected by flowering plant species diversity. There was a positive interaction between extent of green area and plant diversity on bee visitation, and a negative interaction between the extent of green area and heterospecific flowers for bees (excluding B. pascuorum). Increasing floral abundance and plant diversity reduced pollinator visitation to T. pro tense, suggesting competitive effects through both quantity and diversity of resources. Competition for flower visitors was mainly from Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens, both of which frequently co-occurred with T. pratense.
   We conclude that T. pratense competes for pollinators with other co-occurring plants, but that the nature of the surrounding urban matrix mediates interactions among plant species for pollinator services at different scales, particularly with respect to the proportion of green areas.

AB Perennial grasses are a dominant component of many vegetation formations and provide important ecosystem services including supporting herbivores and preventing soil erosion. Despite their importance, our understanding of the processes that influence their mortality rates is surprisingly limited. This study explores the effects of local and landscape-scale processes on mortality of a perennial grass (Stipagrostis uniplumis) in semi-arid savanna. We focussed on three local-scale factors: self-shading by the standing dead biomass of a tuft, plant size, and neighbour abundance as a measure of intra-specific competition. Three indices of neighbour abundance were calculated: number of neighbours, sum of the neighbours' basal area, and sum of the neighbours' living basal area. At the landscape scale, we explored the influence of fire on tuft mortality. The amount of standing dead biomass increased the mortality rates of tufts. Neighbour abundance, indexed as the sum of the living basal area of neighbours, was also associated with higher mortality rates, whereas the other indices of neighbour abundance had no influence on mortality rates. On a landscape level, fire significantly increased tuft mortality rates, from up to 31% for unburned tufts, to 73% for burned tufts. Fire, on the other hand, indirectly reduces the risk of future mortality by reducing self-shading and competitive pressure. Our results imply that the timing and frequency of fires is crucial for their positive indirect effects on plant fitness. As the onset of local effects on plant mortality is highly dependent on grazing pressure and stochastic rainfall, fire management should flexibly take into account the accumulation of dead plant material on a site.

AB Background: Among Coffea species, C. canephora has the widest natural distribution area in tropical African forests. It represents a good model for analyzing the geographical distribution of diversity in relation to locations proposed as part of the "refuge theory". In this study, we used both microsatellite (simple sequence repeat, SSR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers to investigate the genetic variation pattern of C. canephora in the Guineo-Congolean distribution zone.
   Results: Both markers were first compared in terms of their informativeness and efficiency in a study of genetic diversity and relationships among wild C. canephora genotypes. As expected, SSR markers were found to have a higher genetic distance detection capacity than RFLP. Nevertheless, similarity matrices showed significant correlations when Mantel's test was carried out (r = 0.66, p < 0.0001). Finally, both markers were equally effective for group discrimination and phylogenetic studies, but SSR markers tended to outperform RFLP markers in discriminating the source of an individual among diversity groups and in putative hybrid detection. Five well defined genetic groups, one in the Upper Guinean forests, the four others in the Lower Guinean forests, were identified, corresponding to geographical patterning in the individuals.
   Conclusion: Our data suggested that the Dahomey Gap, a biogeographical barrier, played a role in wild C. canephora differentiation. Climatic variations during the Pleistocene and/or Holocene probably caused the subgroup differentiation in the Congolese zone through the presence of a mosaic of putative refugia. Recent hybridization between C. canephora diversity groups, both for spontaneous individuals and cultivars, was further characterised according to their geographic dissemination or breeding history as a consequence of human activities.

AB 1. Introduced plant species modify the environment and alter ecological interactions in communities, often to the detriment of native fauna, but the causes driving negative effects on fauna are rarely examined. We used native Australian scincid lizards Carlia munda and Carlia pectoralis and the introduced weed rubber vine Cryptostegia grandiflora as a model system to determine the possible underlying mechanisms driving habitat selection by native fauna in an environment invaded by weeds.
   2. Lizards were allowed to select between rubber vine and native eucalypt leaf litter in semi-natural enclosures. To determine the mechanisms of habitat preference, we examined differences in temperature, prey (arthropod) availability and composition, and leaf shape of naturally occurring rubber vine and native vegetation.
   3. Lizards discriminated between leaf litter types: 85% of Carlia pectoralis and 80% of Carlia munda chose native leaf litter over rubber vine, clearly indicating a preference for native habitat.
   4. In the field, rubber vine leaf litter was cooler at the surface than native leaf litter, and during peak lizard activity was below the temperature range of Carlia. Rubber vine also contained significantly fewer arthropod taxa and a significantly different composition of arthropod taxa, with fewer preferred prey items of Carlia than native vegetation.
   5. Finally, rubber vine leaves were significantly shorter than native leaves and the lizards themselves. The shape of rubber vine leaves was different from that of the lizards, potentially making the lizards more obvious on rubber vine litter. This may increase the susceptibility of the lizards to detection by predators.
   6. Synthesis and applications. In comparison with native habitat, rubber vine provided a suboptimal environment for litter-dwelling lizards because of the lower ambient temperatures, reduced availability of prey and a reduction in camouflage from predators (dissimilar leaf and lizard shapes). Our study has identified three possible mechanisms by which an introduced plant species can alter the availability of resources in an environment, making it less attractive to native fauna. Our results highlight the importance of understanding how alien plants alter the environment and further emphasize the critical need for management of plants that replace native habitat with a suboptimal environment.

AB South American high-mountain ecosystems are greatly influenced by human disturbance. In the mountains of Cordoba, Argentina, Polylepis australis (Rosaceae) woodlands are currently highly fragmented and subject to extensive burning and livestock grazing, resulting in severe changes of habitat characteristics, which hamper natural regeneration. In order to find out how to achieve successful reforestation, we compared P. australis seedling survival and growth and the development of a shrubby habit for two seed provenances and different planting microsites. Survival of planted seedlings after 5 years was 70%, with most deaths (19%) in the first year and declining mortality with ongoing establishment. Survival did not show any relationship with seed provenance or microsite characteristics. Height growth averaged 34.6 +/- 1.2 cm in 5 years. Seedlings produced from seeds collected in a well-preserved woodland grew taller and showed a higher tendency for development of shrubby habit than those produced from seeds collected in a degraded woodland. Seedlings planted in more degraded microsites with exposed soil or rock due to past grazing pressure grew less and developed a more shrubby habit than those planted in better preserved microsites. Our results show that restoration of degraded areas with P. australis is possible and that there is potential to improve restoration success with a careful selection of seed provenance and planting microsites.

AB In fire-prone communities such as fynbos, many species rely on regeneration from seed banks in the soil. Persistent seed banks are particularly important for species with life spans shorter than the average fire cycle, in order to counter local extinction. Persistent seed banks also give potential for restoring ecosystems following disturbances such as alien plant invasion. This study investigated the seed persistence patterns of 25 perennial species, representing several growth forms and life histories, during a three-year burial. Long-term persistence (i.e., seed bank half-life exceeding two years) was found in the hard-seeded Fabaceae and Pelargonium, and the nut-fruited Proteaceae. In this group, germinability was low and dormancy increased further following burial, resulting in a highly viable, dormant seed bank after three-year's burial. A second group with potentially long-term persistent seeds includes four taxa (Pseudopentameris, Passerina, Elegia and Restio) that either have low germinability or develop secondary dormancy following burial. Dormancy in the latter group was partially countered by exposure to smoke-seed primer. Of the small-seeded species, only two Erica species with high initial dormancy had long-term persistent seed banks. The other species mostly displayed high initial germinability and short-term persistent seed banks (i.e., seed bank half-life less than two years). This group included taxa with short to medium life-spans (Syncarpha, Roella) that were expected to have long-term persistent seeds in order to buffer against local extinction following average to long fire-return intervals. We hypothesize that light may play a role in overcoming secondary dormancy in those species, and could have resulted in an underestimate for seed persistence in this study. Alternatively, those short to medium life-span species persist via inter-fire recruitment in gaps or long-distance dispersal ( of the smallest seed). No correlations were found between seed persistence and seed mass or variance in seed dimensions. Nor was a correlation found between seed persistence and phenol concentration. In fynbos, seed burial of larger seeds by ants and rodents are major processes that operate in conjunction with passive burial of small seeds. Selection for persistence can be expected to operate across all seed sizes and shapes in fire-prone communities.

AB Interspecific and interannual variation in reproductive phenology was quantified for 50 common species of trees and shrubs from a mesic savanna near Darwin, northern Australia. The presence of buds, Bowers, and fruit was noted over a 30-month period, from September 1992 to February 1995. Surveys were undertaken at: monthly intervals for the less common species, and at bimonthly intervals for ten of the common trees and tall shrubs. The majority of species flowered each year at about the same time. There was no evidence of sub-annual or continuous regimes of reproductive phenology. There was no supra-annual carryover of seed-bearing fruit in the canopy of any species. The peak flowering periods were the mid to late dry season (July-August) and the transition between the dry season and the wet season (October-November). The two dominant trees--Eucalyptus miniata and E. tetrodonta--flowered during the dry season, thereby providing resources for some elements of the vertebrate Fauna. Flowering and fruiting were uncommon at the end of the wet season (February/March), although two species that flower and fruit ar this time (E. porrecta and Terminalia ferdinandiana) may provide resources to consumers at a time when floral or fruit resources are otherwise scarce. Because the peak of reproductive activity takes place during the late dry season, fruit maturity and seed dispersal have occurred prior to the onset of the rainy season for most species, and germination and seedling establishment potentially may take effect in response to the first rains. Late dry season fires, which tend to be extensive and incense, are a potential threat to the floral and fruit reserves within these savannas.

AB Quantification and characterization of bacterial flora in the hepatopancreas (hp) of pond-reared Penaeus monodon juveniles affected with luminous bacteria were conducted in 1994 and 1995. Shrimp samples were taken from 23 grow-out ponds, 14 of which had disease outbreaks. Luminous bacterial (LB) load of the shrimps' hp with (mean = 2.4 x 10(1) colony forming units (CFU)/hp) and without (mean = 0.3 x 10(1) CFU/hp) disease outbreaks were comparable during the first 15 days of culture (DOC). During disease outbreaks at 18 to 32 DOC, however, LB load of affected shrimps (mean = 9.0 x 10(4) CFU/hp) were higher than healthy shrimps (mean = 7.0 x 10(1) CFU/hp). At 50 to 60 DOC, levels of LB were comparable in older shrimps with or without disease. Total viable and presumptive Vibrio counts were also comparable in both shrimp samples from 1 to 60 DOC. Characterization of the 172 bacterial isolates collected showed that most (90.12%) were Vibrio species dominated by V. harveyi (27.91%), V. splendidus II (13.37%) and V. parahaemolyticus (10.46%).

AB Eucalyptus and Acacia are two tree genera that are commonly used in industrial plantations and as components of agroforestry systems in southeast Asia. These fast-growing trees are mostly grown in monocultures. However, questions are now being raised about the long-term sustainability of their growth as well as their effects on site quality. Losses of N and P from the site through biomass harvest and during site preparation constitute a major nutrient drain. As an alternative to monocultures, mixed-species cultures which include at least one N(2)-fixing tree species can improve plant productivity and soil N dynamics. Among the various aspects of N dynamics in such stands, export of N during biomass harvest and inputs by the N(2)-fixing component are the most important.
   Reported estimates of the amount of N fixed by acacia and other N(2)-fixing trees are highly variable, depending on inherited plant characteristics, tree age, site factors (e.g., drought), soil fertility (e.g., available P, metal toxicities) and unreliable methods of measuring N(2)-fixation. Of the available techniques for assessing N(2)-fixation by trees, the total N difference method (TND) is the simplest. The contribution of roots to assessments of N(2)-fixation is recognized but rarely measured.
   For short-rotation mixed-species plantations, the amount and time of N transfer from N(2)-fixing trees to non-N(2)-fixing trees are important issues to consider when attempting to develop productive nutrient management strategies. Based on limited information from trials in southeast Asia, it appears that acacia fixes substantial amounts of N during the first few years of establishment and a significant amount of that N is transferred to adjacent eucalypts, thereby improving the growth and nutrition of the eucalypts. The presumed transfer of N from acacias to eucalypts during the early stages of plantation development probably results from below-ground turnover of roots and nodules because aboveground litter decomposition is slight at this stage, and contributes little to the overall N dynamics.
   The available information on P cycling in mixed-species stands, during the early stages of stand growth, provides inconclusive evidence as to whether the availability of soil P increases, despite indications of higher levels of phosphatase activity in the fine roots of nitrogen-fixing trees. This would imply that additional inputs of P as fertilizer are required to remove any P deficiency in mixed-species stands. Long-term observations are required for better understanding of the nutritional and growth benefits of including N(2)-fixing trees in mixed-species stands.

AB Visual ship transect surveys provide crucial information about the density, and spatial distribution of floating anthropogenic litter in a basin. However, such observations provide a 'snapshot' of local conditions at a given time and cannot be used to deduce the provenance of the litter or to predict its fate, crucial information for management and mitigation policies. Particle tracking techniques have seen extensive use in these roles, however, most previous studies have used simplistic initial conditions based on bulk average inputs of debris to the system. Here, observations of floating anthropogenic macro debris in the Adriatic Sea are used to define initial conditions (number of particles, location, and time) in a Lagrangian particle tracking model. Particles are advected backward and forward in time for 60 days (120 days total) using surface velocities from an operational regional ocean model. Sources and sinks for debris observed in the central and southern Adriatic in May 2013 and March 2015 included the Italian coastline from Pescara to Brindisi, the Croatian island of Mljet, and the coastline from Dubrovnik through Montenegro to Albania. Debris observed in the northern Adriatic originated from the Istrian peninsula to the Italian city of Termoli, as well as the Croatian island of Cres and the Kornati archipelago. Particles spent a total of roughly 47 days afloat. Coastal currents, notably the eastern and western Adriatic currents, resulted in large alongshore displacements. Our results indicate that anthropogenic macro debris originates largely from coastal sources near population centers and is advected by the cyclonic surface circulation until it strands on the southwest (Italian) coast, exits the Adriatic, or recirculates in the southern gyre.

AB Biomes are globally distributed, structurally and functionally similar vegetation units defined without reference to plant species composition. The boundaries between biomes are presumed to correspond with species turnover and changes in biogeochemical cycling. Determining the controls of biome distributions is thus critical for anticipating global change impacts. Historically, climate and soils have been understood to adequately explain the global distribution of biomes. Convergent evolution and environmental filtering are assumed to be pervasive, ultimately resulting in deterministic patterns of vegetation structure and function in relation to prevailing environmental conditions. Recent studies have highlighted significant problems with this view of biomes. Firstly, systematic structural and functional divergence within biomes has been identified when comparing environmentally similar, yet floristically distinct regions. Secondly, climatic determinism is being further undermined by evidence suggesting multiple stable biome states are possible for some combinations of climatic drivers. We argue that biomes remain useful and necessary constructs for organizing our knowledge of how ecosystems function and for predicting how they might respond to change. However, biome concepts should acknowledge the limits to predictability from environmental conditions alone and the influence of historical processes on modern vegetation patterns. We discuss how direct mapping of plant structure and function, the incorporation of insights into biome evolution and a new generation of vegetation models will lead to improvements in the concept of what biomes are, where they occur, and efforts to predict their distribution.

AB Animal structures occasionally attain extreme proportions, eclipsing in size the surrounding body parts. We review insect examples of exaggerated traits, such as the mandibles of stag beetles (Lucanidae), the claspers of praying mantids (Mantidae), the elongated hindlimbs of grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Caelifera), and the giant heads of soldier ants (Formicidae) and termites (Isoptera). Developmentally, disproportionate growth can arise through trait-specific modifications to the activity of at least four pathways: the sex determination pathway, the appendage patterning pathway, the insulin/IGF signaling pathway, and the juvenile hormone/ecdysteroid pathway. Although most exaggerated traits have not been studied mechanistically, it is already apparent that distinct developmental mechanisms underlie the evolution of the different types of exaggerated traits. We suggest this reflects the nature of selection in each instance, revealing an exciting link between mechanism, form, and function. We use this information to make explicit predictions for the types of regulatory pathways likely to underlie each type of exaggerated trait.

AB In many countries, plantation forestry depends mostly on a small number of fast-growing exotic species (mainly eucalypts and pines). These species are highly productive but may also become invasive in the communities surrounding plantations. The spread of alien species depends on characteristics of the species itself (species invasiveness) and of the host community (community invasibility), so that some habitats are more vulnerable than others to the invasion of a given species. Our aim in this study is to assess the ability of Eucalyptus globulus to spread in the absence of fire from plantations into the three most common types of surrounding habitats in the study area (NW Spain; native forests, pine plantations and shrublands) and to make recommendations to minimize the risk of spread. We independently assessed propagule pressure and community invasibility by measuring (1) the amount of seeds of E. globulus reaching different distances from the edge of plantations, and (2) seedling emergence and survival in the three types of habitats mentioned. We then estimated the density of seedling and sapling recruitment at different distances from plantation edges by means of a stochastic model parameterized with field data. Seed dispersal distances up to 80 m were recorded, with the frequency distribution of dispersal distances being strongly leptokurtic. Most E. globulus seeds were recorded in the first 5 m from plantation edges (84.3%), and 98.6% in the first 15 m. Native forests were the most resistant to E. globulus spread, showing lower seedling emergence (0.9% vs. 3.3% and 2.2% in shrublands and pine plantations) and survival (3.7% vs. 17.5% and 19.9% up to 6 months). Despite relatively low establishment success ratio, high seed production leads to considerable seedling densities in surrounding habitats, especially in pine plantations and shrublands. In order to control E. globulus spread, we recommend eliminating all new recruits in a safety belt around plantations (e.g. a 15-m wide belt could reduce recruitment in c. 95%) while they can be easily uprooted (1-2 years) and have not reached sexual maturity. Given the resistance of native forests to eucalypt establishment, fostering this type of vegetation in those belts would facilitate their maintenance and increase their effectiveness.

AB The hickory genus (Carya) contains ca. 17 species distributed in subtropical and tropical regions of eastern Asia and subtropical to temperate regions of eastern North America. Previously, the phylogenetic relationships between eastern Asian and eastern North American species of Carya were not fully confirmed even with an extensive sampling, biogeographic and diversification patterns had thus never been investigated in a phylogenetic context. We sampled 17 species of Carya and 15 species representing all other genera of the Juglandaceae as outgroups, with eight nuclear and plastid loci to reconstruct the phylogeny of Carya. The phylogenetic positions of seven extinct genera of the Juglandaceae were inferred using morphological characters and the molecular phylogeny as a backbone constraint. Divergence times within Carya were estimated with relaxed Bayesian dating. Biogeographic analyses were performed in DIVA and LAGRANGE. Diversification rates were inferred by LASER and APE packages. Our results support two major clades within Carya, corresponding to the lineages of eastern Asia and eastern North America. The split between the two disjunct clades is estimated to be 21.58 (95% HPD 11.07-35.51) Ma. Genus-level DIVA and LAGRANGE analyses incorporating both extant and extinct genera of the Juglandaceae suggested that Carya originated in North America, and migrated to Eurasia during the early Tertiary via the North Atlantic land bridge. Fragmentation of the distribution caused by global cooling in the late Tertiary resulted in the current disjunction. The diversification rate of hickories in eastern North America appeared to be higher than that in eastern Asia, which is ascribed to greater ecological opportunities, key morphological innovations, and polyploidy.

AB Most of the world's rangelands are subject to large spatial and temporal variation in forage quantity and quality, which can have severe consequences for the stability and profitability of livestock production. Adaptive foraging movements between functional seasonal resources can help to ameliorate the destabilizing effects on herbivore body stores of spatial and temporal variability of forage quantity and quality. Functional dry-season habitats (key resources) provide sufficient nutrients and energy to minimize reliance on body stores and are critical for maintaining population stability by buffering the effects of drought. Functional wet-season habitats dominated by short, nutritious grasses facilitate optimal intake of nutrients and energy for lactating females, for optimal calf growth rates and for building body stores. Adaptive foraging responses to high-quality focal patches induced by rainfall and disturbance further facilitate intake of nutrients and energy. In addition, focused grazing impact in high-quality patches helps to prevent grassland maturing and losing quality. In this regard, the design of many rotational grazing systems is conceptually flawed because of their inflexible movement of livestock that does not allow adaptation to spatial and temporal variability in forage quantity and quality or sufficient duration of stay in paddocks for livestock to benefit from self facilitation of grazing. Similarly the fixed intraseasonal resting periods of most rotational grazing systems might not coincide with the key pulses of nitrogen mineralization and rainfall in the growing season, which can reduce their efficiency in providing a functional recovery period for grazed grasses. This might explain why complex rotational grazing systems on average have not outperformed continuous grazing systems. It follows, therefore, that ranchers need to adopt flexible grazing management practices that allow adaptation to spatial and temporal variability in forage quantity and quality, allow facilitation of grazing (season-long grazing), and allow more effective recovery periods (season-long resting).

AB Plant invasions can have large effects on ecosystem services. Some plant invaders were introduced specifically to restore key services to ecosystems, and other invaders are having unintended, detrimental effects on services, such as the quantity and quality of water delivered, flood control, erosion control, and food production. Many ecosystem services are difficult to measure directly, and although there are extensive studies on plant invaders and ecosystem processes, a number of challenges prevent us from confidently extrapolating those processes as proxies for services. To extrapolate local, short-term measures of processes to ecosystem services, we must: (1) determine which processes are the key contributors to a service, (2) assess how multiple processes interact to provide a given service, (3) determine how vegetation types and species affect those processes, and (4) explicitly assess how ecosystem services and their controls vary over space and time, including reliance of ecosystem services on "hot spots" and "hot moments" and a minimum size of a vegetation type in the landscape. A given invader can have positive effects on some services and negative effects on others. It is important to consider that, in some systems, shifting environmental conditions may no longer support native species and that invasive species may be critical contributors to the resilience of ecosystem services.

AB Aim Explaining why some invasions fail while others succeed is a prevailing question in invasion biology. Different factors have been proposed to explain the success or failure of exotics. Evidence suggests that climate similarities may be crucial. We tested this using 12 species of the genus Pinus that have been widely planted and shown to be highly invasive. Pinus is among the best-studied group of exotic species and one that has been widely introduced world-wide, so we were able to obtain data on invasive and non-invasive introductions (i.e. unsuccessful invasions; areas where after many decades of self-sowing seeds there is no invasion).
   Location World-wide.
   Methods We developed species distribution models for native ranges using a maximum entropy algorithm and projected them across the globe. We tested whether climate-based models were able to predict both invasive and non-invasive introductions.
   Results Appropriate climatic conditions seem to be required for these long-lived species to invade because climates accurately predicted invasions. However, climate matching is necessary, but not sufficient to predict the fate of an introduction because most non-invasive introductions were predicted to have triggered an invasion.
   Main conclusions Other factors, possibly including biotic components, may be the key to explaining why some introductions do not become invasions, because many areas where Pinus is not invading were predicted to be suitable for invasion based solely on climate.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the gut bacterial communities of Nephrops norvegicus individuals, using a suite of molecular tools consisting of automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, 16S rRNA gene-internal transcribed spacer clone libraries and FISH. The animals were collected from Pagasitikos Gulf, Greece, during different months of the year. The diversity of the gut bacterial communities was found to mostly vary with sampling time, which could be related to temporal variations in food supply. The 16S rRNA gene diversity analysis showed dominance of specific phylotypes for each month studied. February, May, July, August and October samples were rich in sequences related to the gammaproteobacterial genera Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobacter and Photobacterium. September and December samples were dominated by phylotypes affiliated with uncultured representatives of Mollicutes, which are generally associated with the intestinal tracts of various animals. The presence of Gammaproteobacteria and uncultured Mollicutes in August and September samples, respectively, was further confirmed by FISH. None of the morphometric parameters considered was related to the temporal pattern of dominant bacterial communities.

AB The honeycomb worm Sabellaria alveolata forms biogenic reefs which constitute diversity hotspots on tidal flats. The largest known reefs in Europe, located in the Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel (English Channel), are suffering increasing anthropogenic disturbances which raise the question of their sustainability. As the ability to recover depends partly on the recolonization of damaged reefs by larval supply, evaluating larval dispersal and the connectivity between distant reefs is a major challenge for their conservation. In the present study, we used a 3D biophysical model to simulate larval dispersal under realistic hydroclimatic conditions and estimate larval retention and exchanges among the two reefs of different sizes within the bay. The model takes into account fine-scale hydrodynamic circulation (800 x 800 m(2)), advection-diffusion larval transport, and gregarious settlement behaviour. According to the field data, larval dispersal was simulated for a minimal planktonic larval duration ranging from 4 to 8 weeks and the larval mortality was set to 0.09 d(-1). The results highlighted the role played by a coastal eddy on larval retention within the bay, as suggested by previous in situ observations. Very different dispersal patterns were revealed depending on the spawning reef location, although the two reefs were located only 15 km apart. The settlement success of the larvae released from the smallest reef was mainly related to tidal conditions at spawning, with the highest settlement success for releases at neap tide. The settlement success of the larvae from the biggest reef was more dependent on meteorological conditions: favourable Wand SW winds may promote a ten-fold increase in settlement success. Strong year-to-year variability was observed in settlers' numbers, with favourable environmental windows not always coinciding with the main reproductive periods of Sabellaria. Settlement kinetics indicated that the ability to delay metamorphosis could significantly improve the settlement success. Although bidirectional exchanges occurred between the two reefs, the highest settlers' numbers originated from the biggest reef because of its stronger reproductive output. Because of the recent decline of this reef due to increasing anthropogenic disturbances larval supply in the bay may not be sufficient enough to ensure the sustainability of the remarkable habitat formed by Sabellaria alveolata reefs.

AB Various survey methods are used to monitor and manage ungulate popualations. The choice of optimal method depends on estimation accuracy, management objective and financial constraints. Here we compare estimates produced by four different methods for estimating population size, i.e. aerial counts, hunter observations, pellet group counts and cohort analysis. A Swedish moose Alces alces population was studied during 1973-2005 in the Grimso Wildlife Research Area (135 km(2)). The highest correlation was found between cohort analysis and aerial counts (r = 0.69. P < 0.05). and the hunter observations and the aerial counts (r = 0.76. P < 0.10). The different methods produced relatively consistent trends in population estimates over years. Pellet group counts prior to 1997 were not significantly correlated with the other methods. probably due to unrepresentative spatial sampling. A comparison of the aerial and pellet group counts in 2002 and 2006, showed that the average defecation rate was estimated at approximately 14 pellet groups per day per moose. Our results show the importance of having representative spatial sampling in pellet group surveys and indicate that hunter observations can be a useful tool for estimating long-term population trends even in moderately sized areas.

AB Kelps and other fleshy macroalgae-dominant reef-inhabiting organisms in cool seas-may have radiated extensively following late Cenozoic polar cooling, thus triggering a chain of evolutionary change in the trophic ecology of nearshore temperate ecosystems. We explore this hypothesis through an analysis of body size in the abalones (Gastropoda; Haliotidae), a widely distributed group in modern oceans that displays a broad range of body sizes and contains fossil representatives from the late Cretaceous (60-75 Ma). Geographic analysis of maximum shell length in living abalones showed that small-bodied species, while most common in the Tropics, have a cosmopolitan distribution, whereas large-bodied species occur exclusively in cold-water ecosystems dominated by kelps and other macroalgae. The phylogeography of body size evolution in extant abalones was assessed by constructing a molecular phylogeny in a mix of large and small species obtained from different regions of the world. This analysis demonstrates that small body size is the plesiomorphic state and largeness has likely arisen at least twice. Finally, we compiled data on shell length from the fossil record to determine how (slowly or suddenly) and when large body size arose in the abalones. These data indicate that large body size appears suddenly at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. Our findings support the view that fleshy-algal dominated ecosystems radiated rapidly in the coastal oceans with the onset of the most recent glacial age. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications of this change.

AB The dynamics of mutualistic interactions involving more than a single pair of species depend on the relative costs and benefits of interaction among alternative partners. The neotropical myrmecophytes Cordia nodosa and Duroia hirsuta associate with several species of obligately symbiotic ants. I compared the ant partners of Cordia and Duroia with respect to two benefits known to be important in ant-myrmecophyte interactions: protection against herbivores provided by ants, and protection against encroaching vegetation provided by ants. Azteca spp., Myrmelachista schumanni, and Allomerus octoarticulatus demerarae ants all provide the leaves of Cordia and Duroia some protection against herbivores. However, Azteca and Allomerus provide more protection than does Myrmelachista to the leaves of their host plants. Although Allomerus protects the leaves of its hosts, plants occupied by Allomerus suffer more attacks by herbivores to their stems than do plants occupied by other ants. Relative to Azteca or Allomerus, Myrmelachista ants provide better protection against encroaching vegetation, increasing canopy openness over their host plants. These differences in benefits among the ant partners of Cordia and Duroia are reflected in the effect of each ant species on host plant size, growth rate, and reproduction. The results of this study show how mutualistic ant partners can differ with respect to both the magnitude and type of benefits they provide to the same species of myrmecophytic host.

AB The consequences of burning on grazer distributions in the landscape were investigated in a savanna system in South Africa. Distribution and extent of fires can be highly variable within and between years, but how this influences patterns of grazing is not well understood. Three years of fire and grazer distribution data from Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, KwaZulu Natal were used to describe how animals respond to different burn situations. Animals were attracted to the burnt areas after fires and this resulted in a decrease in grazer densities in unburnt areas. This effect was more pronounced when a larger area of the park had burnt, and increased over time as area burnt increased. Thus, grazing pressure in an area will depend on the size, timing and distribution of fires in a larger spatial context. Fires also seem to promote a more uniform grazing environment: although grazer density overall is higher in areas that have burnt, the grazers are more dispersed in these areas, and grazing at any one point may be less intense than in the unburnt areas (which are grazed patchily). Therefore at the beginning of the wet season-a key time of year for grass growth-fires are acting to decrease grazing pressure at any one point in both burnt and unburnt areas. The presence of fire in grazing systems could affect grass community composition because fire alters the intensity and frequency of utilisation of the grass sward.

AB For many, tropical forests a tendency for fruit production to fluctuate seasonally has been established, with pronounced peaks of abundance and periods of fruit scarcity during which a few important resources maintain frugivore communities. However, there is a lack of studies in subtropical forests on community phenology and on the identification of important resources. In this study, community-wide fruit availability and its use by the local frugivore community was investigated in the subtropical coastal dry forest of Oribi Gorge Nature Reserve, South Africa over 13 mo from July 1997 to July 1998. Along 19.5 km of phenology traits, 940 individuals of 96 plant species bearing fleshy fruits were monitored twice per month and fruit-eating animals observed. Although some fruit was available all year round richness of both fruiting species and fruit abundance showed a seasonal pattern with peaks at the end of August to beginning of October (i.e. before the rainy season) and March to May (i.e. after the rainy season). Periods of fruit scarcity were found in July and August (i.e. during the long dry season) and in November and December (i.e. during the rainy season). Fruits of 23 plant species were observed being eaten by 18 species of bird and two of monkey. Highest animal numbers were attracted by Ficus thonningii, a species that fruited asynchronously during most of the year and during periods of fruit scarcity, and provided high overall fruit biomass. The importance of this species as a potential keystone resource for the frugivore community is discussed.

AB 1. Animal abundance data are essential for endangered species conservation, tracking invasive species spread, biosecurity, agricultural applications and wildlife monitoring; however, obtaining abundance data are a perennial challenge. Recent improvements in the resolution of remotely sensed imagery, and image-processing tools and software have facilitated improvement of methods for the detection of individual, generally large-bodied animals. The potential to monitor and survey populations from remotely sensed imagery is an exciting new development in animal ecology.
   2. We review the methods used to analyse remotely sensed imagery for their potential to estimate the abundance of wild and domestic animal populations by directly detecting, identifying and counting individuals.
   3.Despite many illustrative studies using a variety of methods for detecting animals from remotely sensed imagery, it remains problematic in many situations. Studies that demonstrated reasonably high accuracy using automated and semi-automated techniques have been undertaken on small spatial scales relative to the geographical range of the species of interest and/or in homogenous environments such as sea ice. The major limitations are the relatively low accuracy of automated detection techniques across large spatial extents, false detections and the cost of high-resolution data.
   4. Future developments in the analysis of remotely sensed data for population surveys will improve detection capabilities, including the advancement of algorithms, the crossover of software and technology from other disciplines, and improved availability, accessibility, cost and resolution of data.

AB Community-based conservation (CBC) institutions are widely regarded as transformative bodies that benefit social and ecological processes in coupled social-ecological systems. Yet, limited empirical evidence for this claim exists, especially on the African continent where community-based conservancies (CBCs) are being rapidly adopted in diverse institutional forms across multiple countries. We provide the first large-scale systematic review of CBC outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. We review the literature on CBCs and develop a conceptual model that illustrates the nested scales of interaction in which CBCs are embedded, the institutional processes ("conditions") reported as important for success, and the outcomes of CBCs on social and ecological systems. The mixed-method approach consists of inductive/deductive textual analysis of cases, geospatial visualization, descriptive statistics, and correlational analysis. Results indicate that more often than not, establishment of CBCs in Africa has led to negative or a mixture of positive and negative social outcomes, whereas ecological outcomes have been largely positive. The research conducted on CBC institutions has overwhelmingly focused on social outcomes, using qualitative methods. Monetary and nonmonetary incentives seem to be important but not sufficient on their own for positive outcomes. Devolution of rights to the local community is significantly associated with CBC outcomes but was not present in many cases, despite this feature being a hallmark of CBCs. A number of conditions were not reported in the cases reviewed, including leadership, social learning, consideration of cultural worldviews, and diverse partnerships. We provide indepth examples of the types and diversity of outcomes and contexts underpinning the presence or absence of societal processes, highlight important gaps in the existing research, and offer guidelines for research and evaluation moving forward.

AB 1. Predator diversity alterations have been observed in most ecosystems as a result of the loss and/or addition of species. This has implications for predator-prey dynamics as non-trophic interactions among predators, so-called multiple predator effects (MPE), are known to influence predation success. In addition, there is often a density-dependent relationship between prey availability and prey consumption (functional response). While MPE investigations are common in the literature, functional responses have rarely been incorporated into this field of predation ecology.
   2. Here, we outline an experimental procedure that incorporates functional responses into multiple predator effect studies. Using three fish species with different functional traits as model predators (bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, southern mouthbrooder Pseudocrenilabrus philander and banded tilapia Tilapia sparrmanii), we assess intra-and interspecific predator interaction outcomes on predator-prey dynamics. This was done by contrasting observed functional responses of heterospecific and conspecific combinations of predators with expected responses based on those of individual predators.
   3. Multipredator combinations produced variable results. Bluegill were the only species in which observed conspecific multipredator functional responses matched those of expected based on individual performance (prey risk neutral effects). In contrast, prey risk reduction was observed for both mouthbrooder and tilapia conspecific multipredator trials. Heterospecific combinations revealed strong prey risk reduction effects for mouthbrooder-tilapia and bluegill-tilapia trials, while mouthbrooder-bluegill multipredator functional responses combined additively. These results are discussed within the context of behavioural traits of the species and the development of a trait-based predictive framework.
   4. Using a functional response approach allowed for the assessment of multiple predator effects across a range of prey densities. We propose that the incorporation of within-guild predator combinations into classic functional response investigations will enhance predictive capacity development in competition and predation ecology.

AB Bats are the second-most species-rich mammal group numbering more than 1270 species globally. Our knowledge of their geographic distributions and diversity patterns however is very limited possibly the poorest among mammals mainly due to their nocturnal and volant life history, and challenging fieldwork conditions in the tropics where most bat species occur. This knowledge gap obscures the geographic extent of ecosystem services provided by bats (i.e. pollination, seed dispersal and insect control), translates into inefficient conservation policies, and restricts macroecological analyses to coarse spatial resolutions. In contrast to the currently prevailing method of estimating species distributions using expert-drawn range maps, correlative species distribution models (SDMs) can provide estimates at very fine spatial grains and largely account for widespread sample bias as well as the prevalent Wallacean shortfall in species occurrence data. Very few such studies have hitherto been published that cover a large and complete taxonomic group with fine resolution at continental extent. Using an unparalleled amount of occurrence data, the MaxEnt algorithm and tailored solutions to specific modelling challenges, we created SDMs for nearly all 250 African bat species to explore emerging diversity patterns at a resolution of 1 km(2). Predicted species richness generally increases towards the equator conforming to expectations. Within the tropical area of elevated richness, several pronounced richness peaks and lows stand out, hinting at a complex interplay of determining factors. Richness gradients are often steep, decreasing strongly away from streams, and especially so in savanna biomes. Species richness also seems positively associated with rugged terrain, in particular at lower elevations. Centres of endemism are found primarily at low latitudes near major elevational ranges. Overlap with hotspots of species richness is rather low, and confined to five or six topodiverse, relatively low lying areas between western Guinea and the East African coast. Several poorly sampled regions are identified that may represent rewarding future survey targets. Our results demonstrate the value of stacking SDMs to infer plausible continent-wide diversity gradients at a spatial resolution fine enough to directly inform conservation policies and to open up new avenues in macroecological research.

   consistent protocol for aquatic vegetation

AB AimsMost vegetation classification systems developed for large areas include various inconsistencies. Therefore, we (1) propose a new consistent Cocktail-based approach to redefine the traditional phytosociological classification of species-poor vegetation; (2) apply it to create a classification protocol for aquatic vegetation; (3) implement this protocol in a computer expert system; and (4) test it with a data set previously classified using an older version of the Cocktail method.
   MethodsThe new approach uses formal logic to provide formal definitions of vegetation units. In the classification protocol for aquatic vegetation we defined consistent criteria for delimitation of associations according to the concepts that are predominantly used in phytosociology, based on species cover, dominance patterns and functional species groups. We applied these criteria in a computer expert system running in the JUICE 7.0 program, and applied them to a test data set of 12171 vegetation plots from the Czech Republic containing at least one aquatic species. The new classification was compared with (1) the previous national Cocktail classification based on species cover values and in few cases on sociological species groups, and (2) a non-formalized expert-based classification.
   ResultsThirteen functional species groups were created to build logical formulas of 64 aquatic associations and 5297 (44% of the total data set) vegetation plots were assigned to these associations, i.e. by 4% and 12% more than in the previous Cocktail and expert-based classifications, respectively. There was 94% and 83% classification agreement with the previous Cocktail and expert-based classification.
   ConclusionsThe new approach produces a formal, consistent and unequivocal classification of species-poor vegetation with several advantages over similar approaches. It provides not only a set of formal definitions of vegetation units, but also a set of rules for building such definitions. All associations with common characteristics are defined by structurally identical formulas, ensuring consistency of the classification. While similar approaches for species-rich vegetation use sociological species groups, which are not applicable to species-poor vegetation, the new approach introduces the use of functional species groups, which reflect vegetation physiognomy and spatial structure and, in combination with species dominance, enable the classification of species-poor vegetation in a similar manner as in traditional phytosociology.

AB Coral reef communities are likely to change in the future as reef organisms respond differently to various stressors. In order to predict future reef compositions, we apply estimates of coral and fish vulnerability to two key stressors; climate change (bleaching) and fishing. Most corals were vulnerable to one or both stressors, and future coral communities are likely to comprise stress-tolerant and weedy life histories. Fish assemblages displayed a negative relationship to the two stressors; climate impacts and fishing independently influenced a different suite of species. Most functionally important groups of fishes were more vulnerable to fishing than climate change. While climate change will negatively affect many taxa (particularly reef corals), reducing local fishing impacts should benefit reef futures by enhancing key ecosystem processes.

AB Distribution data are central to many invasion science applications. The shortage of good information on the distribution of alien species and their spatial dynamics is largely attributable to the cost, effort and expertise required to monitor these species over large areas. Virtual globes, particularly Google Earth, are free and user-friendly software which provide high-resolution aerial imagery for the entire globe. We suggest this has enormous potential for invasion science. We provide suggestions and tools for gathering data on the distribution and abundance of invasive alien trees using visual interpretation of Google Earth imagery, and propose how these data may be used for a number of purposes, including calculating useful metrics of invasions, prioritising species or areas for management and predicting potential distributions of species. We also suggest various practical uses of Google Earth, such as providing a tool for early detection of emerging invasions, monitoring invasions over time, and to help researchers and managers identify suitable field study sites. Virtual globes such as Google Earth are not without limitations and we provide guidance on how some of these can be overcome, or when imagery from Google Earth may not be fit for invasion science purposes. Because of Google Earth's huge popularity and ease of use, we also highlight possibilities for awareness-raising and information sharing that it provides. Finally, we provide the foundations and guidelines for a virtual global network of sentinel sites for early detection, monitoring and data gathering of invasive alien trees, which we propose should be developed as part of a "citizen science" effort. There has been limited use of virtual globes by invasion scientists and managers; it is our hope that this paper will stimulate their greater use, both within the field of invasion science and within ecology generally.

AB Invasion ecology has much advanced since its early beginnings. Nevertheless, explanation, prediction, and management of biological invasions remain difficult. We argue that progress in invasion research can be accelerated by, first, pointing out difficulties this field is currently facing and, second, looking for measures to overcome them. We see basic and applied research in invasion ecology confronted with difficulties arising from (A) societal issues, e.g., disparate perceptions of invasive species; (B) the peculiarity of the invasion process, e.g., its complexity and context dependency; and (C) the scientific methodology, e.g., imprecise hypotheses. To overcome these difficulties, we propose three key measures: (1) a checklist for definitions to encourage explicit definitions; (2) implementation of a hierarchy of hypotheses (HoH), where general hypotheses branch into specific and precisely testable hypotheses; and (3) platforms for improved communication. These measures may significantly increase conceptual clarity and enhance communication, thus advancing invasion ecology.

AB Effects of alien plant invaders on native ecosystems are widely acknowledged, although the evidence is sometimes speculative, especially in riparian zones. We examined the changes in floristic diversity, stand structure and composition of resident species associated with invasions of Eucalyptus camaldulensis in riparian zones of the Western Cape, South Africa. Using a gradient comparative approach, we compared the richness, diversity (H') and evenness (J) of resident vegetation in a riparian forest under varying levels of E. camaldulensis percentage canopy cover. We found that species richness, diversity and structural attributes (e.g. height, relative cover and mean basal area) of native species decreased consistently along the invasion gradient. However, evenness did not change significantly with increasing Eucalyptus invasion. Invasion by E. camaldulensis was associated with changes in native plant species composition; although some native species occurred in alien invaded sites, they were more abundant in uninvaded sites. This research offers a baseline from which further experimental work can be conducted to determine the mechanisms responsible for changes attributed to Eucalyptus invasion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB This is the first continent-wide overview of insect diversity and status sufficiently fine-scaled to be used in conservation planning. We analyze patterns of richness and the conservation status of African dragonflies and dam-selflies (Insecta: Odonata), commonly referred to as dragonflies, to determine threats to species and freshwater habitats, location of diversity hotspots, necessary conservation actions, and research gaps. Major centers of dragonfly diversity in Africa are tropical forest areas that include highlands. Most threatened species - as classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature global Red List - are concentrated in highlands from Kenya to South Africa (together with the Cape Floristic Region), western Africa (including mountains on the Cameroon-Nigeria border), and Ethiopia. Currently available knowledge can be applied throughout Africa's freshwater systems to help minimize or mitigate the impact of future development actions, allowing dragonflies to act as "guardians of the watershed". The private sector can be advised to safeguard sensitive habitats and species when selecting sites for development. Key sites and species for monitoring can be identified by checking the distribution of threatened species at www.iucnredlist.org.

AB Climate and grazing are the main drivers of plant community composition and species richness in arid environments. This study aimed to examine the vegetation response to a spatial precipitation gradient, interannual rainfall variability, and grazing pressure in Mongolia. To examine the effect of a spatial precipitation gradient, we compared species richness among six sites. To investigate the effects of interannual rainfall variability and grazing pressure, we compared species richness for 2 years at two sites, in desert-steppe and steppe areas. The regional gradient in annual precipitation showed positive and negative relationships with grass richness and shrub richness, respectively, although total species richness did not vary significantly. The proportions of the different functional groups were affected by grazing pressure and rainfall variability in both zones. In the desert-steppe zone, species richness was lower in the drier year but did not vary with grazing pressure. In the steppe zone, species richness varied significantly with grazing pressure but did not vary between years. Precipitation would be more important than grazing pressure on vegetation changes in drier areas with high rainfall variability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Restoring roadside slopes in semiarid regions of the Mediterranean Basin is often constrained by the difficulties arising when developing restoration projects (absence of nearby natural ecosystems serving as reference sites and slow natural colonization) and by the contradictions found between short-term (reduce soil erosion) and long-term (increase plant diversity) restoration goals Restoration techniques developed in temperate climates are commonly applied in these regions without taking into account their specific characteristics, as a consequence, they often fail. We evaluated the effectiveness of three treatments widely used by practitioners (hydroseeding, fertilization and irrigation) to foster community composition changes that control soil erosion and increase species diversity (restoration goals) during the restoration of motorway embankments The study was carried out during an 18-month period in five embankments from semiarid central Spain The most outstanding result was that responses of the plant community to the treatments evaluated were site-specific Several fast-growing dominant species, some hydroseeded and some already present in the study sites, were responsible for this idiosyncratic variation between sites. On embankments, where plant cover can easily leach values high enough to prevent erosion, the use of non-native herbs that can potentially dominate the community should be avoided These fast-growing species, although effective as starters the first years following motorway building, can constrain vegetation dynamics in the long term Our results indicate that these species should be controled in the field, and their presence avoided in the commercial seed mixtures when the target is to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem stability and resilience (C) 2010 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.

AB The Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is a useful, robust model marine organism for tissue metabolism studies. Its relatively few organs are easily delineated and there is sufficient understanding of their functions based on classical assays to support interpretation of advanced spectroscopic approaches. Here we apply high-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR)-based metabolomic analysis to C. virginica to investigate the differences in the metabolic profile of different organ groups, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to non-invasively identify the well separated organs. Metabolites were identified in perchloric acid extracts of three portions of the oyster containing: (1) adductor muscle, (2) stomach and digestive gland, and (3) mantle and gills. Osmolytes dominated the metabolome in all three organ blocks with decreasing concentration as follows: betaine > taurine > proline > glycine > beta-alanine > hypotaurine. Mitochondrial metabolism appeared most pronounced in the adductor muscle with elevated levels of carnitine facilitating beta-oxidation, and ATP, and phosphoarginine synthesis, while glycogen was elevated in the mantle/gills and stomach/digestive gland. A biochemical schematic is presented that relates metabolites to biochemical pathways correlated with physiological organ functions. This study identifies metabolites and corresponding H-1 NMR peak assignments for future NMR-based metabolomic studies in oysters.

AB Marine protected areas (MPAs) are growing in popularity as a conservation tool, and there are increasing calls for additional MPAs. Meta-analyses indicate that most MPAs successfully meet the minimal goal of increasing biomass inside the MPA, while some do not, leaving open the important question of what makes MPAs successful. An often-overlooked aspect of this problem is that the success of fishery management outside MPA boundaries (i.e., whether a population is overfished) affects how well MPAs meet both conservation goals (e. g., increased biomass) and economic goals (e. g., minimal negative effects on fishery yield). Using a simple example of a system with homogeneous habitat and periodically spaced MPAs, we show that, as area in MPAs increases, (1) conservation value (biomass) may initially be zero, implying no benefit, then at some point increases monotonically; and (2) fishery yield may be zero, then increases monotonically to a maximum beyond which further increase in MPA area causes yield to decline. Importantly, the points at which these changes in slope occur vary among species and depend on management outside MPAs. Decision makers considering the effects of a potential system of MPAs on multiple species are confronted by a number of such cost-benefit curves, and it is usually impossible to maximize benefits and minimize costs for all species. Moreover, the precise shape of each curve is unknown due to uncertainty regarding the fishery status of each species. Here we describe a decision-analytic approach that incorporates existing information on fishery stock status to present decision makers with the range of likely outcomes of MPA implementation. To summarize results from many species whose overfishing status is uncertain, our decision-analysis approach involves weighted averages over both overfishing uncertainty and species. In an example from an MPA decision process in California, USA, an optimistic projection of future fishery management success led to recommendation of fewer and smaller MPAs than that derived from a more pessimistic projection of future management success. This example illustrates how information on fishery status can be used to project potential outcomes of MPA implementation within a decision analysis framework and highlights the need for better population information.

AB Trophic cascades triggered by fishing have profound implications for marine ecosystems and the socioeconomic systems that depend on them. With the number of reported cases quickly growing, key features and commonalities have emerged. Fishery-induced trophic cascades often display differential response times and nonlinear trajectories among trophic levels and can be accompanied by shifts in alternative states. Furthermore, their magnitude appears to be context dependent, varying as a function of species diversity, regional oceanography, local physical disturbance, habitat complexity, and the nature of the fishery itself. To conserve and manage exploited marine ecosystems, there is a pressing need for an improved understanding of the conditions that promote or inhibit the cascading consequences of fishing. Future research should investigate how the trophic effects of fishing interact with other human disturbances, identify strongly interacting species and ecosystem features that confer resilience to exploitation, determine ranges of predator depletion that elicit trophic cascades, pinpoint antecedents that signal ecosystem state shifts, and quantify variation in trophic rates across oceanographic conditions. This information will advance predictive models designed to forecast the trophic effects of fishing and will allow managers to better anticipate and avoid fishery-induced trophic cascades.

AB A biogeographical regionalization is a hierarchical system to categorize geographic areas in terms of their biotas. This hierarchy involves the levels of realm, region, dominion, province and district, with province being the basic level. Many regionalizations have been proposed to categorize biogeographic areas. Some of them are based oil the total similarity of their biota; however, the identification of patterns of geographic homology (through the search for successively nested areas of endemism) is a basic requirement for proposing schemes of natural regionalizations. In this paper, I describe the main concepts and methods to identify biogeographical patterns used to build natural biogeographical regionalizations.

AB In this study, we examine the hypotheses that the size of the seagrass meadow and marine protection influence the abundance of seagrass herbivores and their associated grazing pressure. The effect of meadow size was tested in 9 shallow unprotected meadows of Posidonia oceanica encompassing a wide range of areas. The effect of fishing protection was examined by comparing 9 unprotected meadows (controls) with 3 marine protected areas (MPAs) with at least 20 yr of protection that also varied in meadow size (large > 3 ha, medium 1 ha < x < 2 ha and small < 1 ha). At each site, we quantified the abundance, size distribution and grazing pressure of the 2 most important herbivores, the fish Sarpa salpa and the sea urchin Paracentrotus hvidus. A strong negative relationship between meadow size and both the abundance and grazing rates of S. salpa was evident in the unprotected meadows, but no effects were detected on either the abundance or grazing rates of P. lividus. Results also showed that populations of S. salpa (mainly large individuals) benefit from fishing protection and tended to concentrate in MPAs (with the exception of Port-Cros), resulting in enhanced grazing pressure. In P. lividus abundances or size distributions did not present any significant difference between protected and unprotected areas, although most MPAs presented low sea urchin densities. While MPAs are important to preserve seagrass ecosystems, results from this study indicate that it is crucial to account for the size of these habitats, particularly when functional aspects of seagrass habitats are so strongly altered by size,

AB Frequent fire is a feature of the mesic Australian savannas, yet little is known about its effect on tree growth rates. Growth data are critical for the development of demographic models to understand the consequences of different land management regimes. We used generalized linear mixed effects models and information-theoretic multi-model inference to analyse annual diameter growth of adult trees (>= 5 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) and saplings (>= 1.5 m height and < 5 cm DBH) and height growth of juveniles (< 1.5 m height) in response to fire, tree size, stand basal area, annual rainfall, and for adult trees, the presence of the introduced Asian swamp buffalo (a potentially growth-limiting herbivore). The analysis was based on two medium-term datasets from natural eucalypt savanna in Kakadu National Park in the Australian monsoonal tropics. One dataset was based on a 7-year experiment examining the effect of buffalo removal during which three fires occurred, and the second was derived from a 4-year study in which three experimental fire treatments (annual early dry season fire, annual late dry season fire and no fire) were imposed. An unplanned, extremely severe fire burnt some of the previously unburnt trees in the final year of this latter experiment, so we considered it as an additional fire treatment. Despite high variance, there was strong evidence for differential effects of the fire treatments on tree growth, and these effects differed among the three size groups. Late and extreme fires resulted in a high proportion of individuals with negative DBH increments (due to burning or shedding of bark, and also to stems being killed and replaced by small stems), and decreased average DBH growth of saplings (-0.17 and -1.38 cm year(-1), respectively-cf. 0.22 cm year(-1) for no fire) and adult trees (0.01 and 0.03 cm year(-1), respectively-cf. 0.18 cm year(-1) for no fire). Early fires decreased DBH growth of saplings (0.11-cf. 0.22 cm year(-1) for no fire) but increased growth of adult trees (0.29-cf. 0.18 cm year(-1)). Height growth of juvenile trees was reduced by early fires (0.01-cf. 0.06 m year(-1) for no fire) but was increased by late fires (0.10 m year(-1)), probably because juveniles are physiologically active early in the dry season, but are effectively dormant in the late dry season. When stand basal area was high there was evidence of growth suppression in adults, saplings and juveniles. Growth of adult trees was lower in years with high rainfall and where buffalo were removed, possibly because of increased competition from ground layer vegetation. Our study casts doubt on the sustainability of the frequent, early dry season fires that have become a management goal in much of northern Australia. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Observations from several places around the world suggest that periods of relaxation of winds tha drive upwelling favor the onshore transport of larvae entrained in shoreward movement of warm surface waters. However, the generality of this process has not yet been appropriately evaluated. We examined the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, and inter-annual variability of sea surface temperature fluctuations associated with the relaxation of equator-ward winds and their influence on invertebrate settlement in central Chile (33 degrees 30'S, 71 degrees 40'W). Our results showed that there were marked differences in the intensity and structure of temperature increases following the relaxation of upwelling favorable winds. While most temperature increases were small (0.5 to 1 degrees C) and preserved the stratification of the water column, large 'warming events' (> 3 degrees C) led to a breakdown of stratification for periods of 3 to 9 d at least twice during each spring-summer season. These large warming events occurred in association with downwelling-favorable (northerly) winds, and their formation might have required certain conditions in terms of mesoscale eddy features and local topography. Settlement of invertebrates occurred during these events as well at other times, and was not quantitatively correlated with relaxation or downwelling conditions. However, during specific large warming events, we observed significant synchrony in the settlement of several marine invertebrate taxa (e.g. decapods, gastropods, polychaetes, mussels, and sea urchins). Thus, at this site in central Chile and during our period of study, relaxation events did not dominate settlement, and it appeared that the upwelling-relaxation model did not adequately represent the larval transport mechanism for any taxa examined. However, large warming events (which produced synchrony in the settlement of several different taxa) could be important in that they may result in uniform settlement along the shore and deliver larvae from distant origins, increasing long-distance demographic and genetic connectivity. Thus, these infrequent events are likely to be a critical factor in settlement distribution along the shore.

AB Advances in technology for in vitro propagation and genetic transformation have accelerated the development of genetically engineered trees during the past 15 years. At least 33 species of transformed forest trees have been successfully regenerated to date. Targeted traits include herbicide tolerance, pest resistance, abiotic stress tolerance, modified fiber quality and quantity, and altered growth and reproductive development. Commercial potential has been demonstrated in the field for a few traits, in particular herbicide tolerance, insect resistance, and altered lignin content. Now that commercial implementation is feasible, at least for the few genotypes that can be efficiently transformed and propagated, environmental concerns have become the main obstacle to public acceptance and regulatory approval. Ecological risks associated with commercial release range from transgene escape and introgression into wild gene pools to the impact of transgene products on other organisms and ecosystem processes. Evaluation of those risks is confounded by the long life span of trees, and by limitations of extrapolating results from small-scale studies to larger-scale plantations. Issues that are central to safe deployment can only be addressed by permitting medium- to large-scale release of transgenic trees over a full rotation. Current regulations restricting field releases of all transgenes in both time and space need to be replaced with regulations that recognize different levels of risk (as determined by the origin of the transgene, its impact on reproductive fitness, and nontarget impacts) and assign a commensurate level of confinement. The next step in determining acceptability of transgene technology for forest tree improvement is the unconfined release of constructs that pose little risk in terms of gene escape and nontarget impacts, such as lignin-altered poplar or pine, to permit evaluation of ecological risks and environmental or agronomic benefits at relevant scales.

AB Extensive rangelands and other vegetation types that we know today formed while atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration was low (50 to 75% of today's concentration). Fossil fuel burning and deforestation and other land me changes during the last 200 years have increased CO2 concentration by about 30%, to the present 360 parts per million (ppm). Atmospheric CO2 will continue to rise during the next century, possibly to concentrations that are unprecedented for the last several million years. Much of the potential importance of CO2 concentration to vegetation derives from its influence on plant carbon balance and water relations. Plants grow by assimilating CO2 that diffuses into leaves through stomatal pores. Inevitably associated with CO2 uptake is transpirational loss of water vapor through stomata. Transpiration rates usually decline as CO2 increases, while, in many plants, photosynthesis and growth increase. These ''primary'' responses to CO2 can lead to a multitude of changes at the plant and ecosystem levels, ranging from alteration of the chemical composition of plant tissues to changes in ecosystem function and the species composition of plant communities.
   The direct physiological responses of plants to CO2 and expression of these responses at higher scales differ among species and growing conditions. Growth response to CO2 is usually highest in rapidly-growing plants that quickly export the carbohydrates formed in leaves and use them for storage or new growth and allocate a high proportion of fixed carbon to produce leaves. Growth is also more responsive to CO2 in plants with the C-3 (most woody plants and 'cool-season' grasses) than C-4 photosynthetic pathway (most 'warm-season' grasses), These and other differences among species could lead to changes in the composition of rangeland vegetation, but generalizations are difficult. On many rangelands, species abundances are determined more by morphological and phenological attributes that influence plant access to essential resources like nitrogen and light and reaction to fire, grazing, and other disturbances than by physiological traits that are sensitive to CO2 concentration. Species composition probably will be most responsive to CO2 on moderately water-limited and disturbed rangelands where multiple positive effects of CO2 on plant water relations can be expressed and competition for light is minimized. Greatest initial changes in species composition likely will occur on C-3/C-4 grasslands and at the transition between grasslands and woodlands. Plant production should also increase on water-limited rangelands, but CO2 may have little influence on production when nutrient elements like nitrogen are severely Limiting.

AB Biodiversity is threatened by climate change and other human activities [1], but to assess impacts, we also need to identify the current distribution of species on Earth. Predicting abundance and richness patterns is difficult in many regions and especially so on the remote Antarctic continent, due to periods of snow cover, which limit remote sensing, and the small size of the biota present. As the Earth's coldest continent, temperature and water availability have received particular attention in understanding patterns of Antarctic biodiversity [2], whereas nitrogen availability has received less attention [3]. Nitrogen input by birds is a major nutrient source in many regions on Earth [4-7], and input from penguins and seals is associated with increased plant growth [8-10] and soil respiration [11-13] at some Antarctic locations. However, the consequences of increased nitrogen concentrations in Antarctic mosses and lichens for their associated food web has hardly been addressed [14, 15], despite the fact that nutrient status of primary producers affects the abundance and diversity of higher trophic levels [16, 17]. We show that nitrogen input and delta N-15 signatures from marine vertebrates are associated with terrestrial biodiversity hotspots well beyond (>1,000 m) their immediate colony borders along the Antarctic Peninsula. Invertebrate abundance and richness was two to eight times higher under penguin and elephant seal influence. The nitrogen footprint area was correlated with the vertebrate population size. These findings improve our ability to predict biogeographical patterns of Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity through knowledge of the location and size of penguin and elephant seal concentrations.

AB Shade cast by trees, which suppresses grass growth, and fire fuelled by grass biomass, which prevents tree sapling establishment, are mutually exclusive and self-reinforcing drivers of biome distribution in savanna-forest mosaics.
   We investigated how shade depth, represented by canopy leaf area index (LAI), is generated by adult trees across savanna-forest boundaries and how a shade gradient filters tree functioning, and grass composition and biomass.
   Forest trees exerted greater shading through increased stem density and greater light interception per unit biomass. A critical transition at LAI c. 1.5 was linked to tree shifts from savanna to forest species, functional shifts from fire-tolerant to light-competitive species, and grass composition shifts from C-4 to C-3 pathways. A second transition to grass fuel loads too low to support fires, occurred at a lower canopy density (LAI > 0.5), accompanied by shifts in C-4 subtype dominance.
   This pattern suggests that shade suppression of grass biomass is an essential first step for the maintenance of alternative stable states.

AB Several species of Vibrio are the causative agent of gastroenteritis in humans. In aquaculture, Vibrio harveyi (Vh) and V. parahaemolyticus (Vp) have long been considered as shrimp pathogens in freshwater, brackish and marine environments. Here we show by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) that Penaeus monodon orally inoculated with each of these two pathogens via an Artemia diet had numerous bacteria attached randomly across the stomach surface, in single and in large biofilm-like clusters 6 h post-infection. A subsequent marked proliferation in the number of V. harveyi within the biofilm-like formations resulted in the development of infections in the stomach, the upper and middle midgut, but neither in the posterior midgut nor the hindgut. SEM also revealed the induced production of peritrichous pili-like structures by the Vp attaching to the stomach lining, whilst only a single polar fibre was seen forming an apparent physical bridge between Vh and the host's epithelium. In contrast to these observations, no such adherences or linkages were seen when trials were conducted with non-pathogenic Vibrio spp. or with Micrococcus luteus, with no obvious resultant changes to the host's gut surface. In naive shrimp, the hindgut was found to be a favorable site for bacteria notably curved, short-rod shaped bacteria which probably belong to Vibrio spp. Data from the current study suggests that pathogens of P. monodon must be able to colonize the digestive tract, particularly the stomach, where chitin is present, and then they use an array of virulent factors and enzymes to infect their host resulting in disease. Oral infection is a better way of mimicking natural routes of infection; investigating the host-bacteria interactions occurring in the digestive tract may lead to new strategies for the prevention or control of bacterial infections in penaeids.

AB Acacia dealbata Link, a leguminous tree native of Australia, has become a major problem due to its invasiveness throughout the world. However, little is known about its impact over time. In this study, we have explored the impact of A. dealbata on soil nutrients and on soil microbial community function and structure in 4 mixed invaded forest sites in NW Spain, in a chronosequence of invasion: (1) a minimum of 25 years; (2) an average of 15 years; (3) an average of 7 years and (4) less than 3 years. pH significantly diminished over time as organic matter increased. Soil nutrients were progressively altered under A. dealbata; total C, N and P invariably increased as different periods of invasion time also increased, whilst Ca2+, K+ and Mg2+ contents showed irregular trends during the different periods of invasion. In addition, soil enzymatic activities of acid phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, urease and N-acetyl glucosaminidase increased significantly, and soil basal respiration enhanced over the sequence of the invasion. DGGE analyses suggested variations in the structure of microbial and fungal communities over the whole assessed period due to A. dealbata presence. This is the first time that chronological sequences have been included to investigate the impact of A. dealbata invasion. Our results show that the initial dominance of A. dealbata and its negative impact on soil and microbial parameters cannot be recovered even long periods after the invasion. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Woody plant encroachment is frequent in dry savannas. Grazing is often considered to be a major cause of encroachment in dry savannas because grasses are removed by livestock, leaving bare areas for trees to colonise in wetter years. Earlier experiments conducted in the Kimberley area of the Northern Cape showed that neither fire nor grazing was important for woody plant encroachment. We used aerial and fixed-point repeat ground photographs, including historical photographs taken at the time of the Second Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902, to assess the scale and timing of woody plant encroachment in the dry savannas near Kimberley in South Africa (mean annual rainfall = 300-400 mm). There were large increases in woody plant encroachment in most areas. Even at the battlefield of Magersfontein, where grazing has been virtually absent since its protection in 1960, we found that encroachment by trees and shrubs has occurred. Using aerial photographs, we found that the rate of encroachment has increased substantially since 1993. However, repeated photographs at certain sites indicate that encroachment produced cohorts of trees. We show that global drivers are perhaps of greater importance than local drivers such as heavy grazing and absence of fire.

AB We propose a framework for spatially estimating a proxy for coral reef resilience using remote sensing. Data spanning large areas of coral reef habitat were obtained using the commercial QuickBird satellite, and freely available imagery (NASA, Google Earth). Principles of coral reef ecology, field observation, and remote observations, were combined to devise mapped indices. These capture important and accessible components of coral reef resilience. Indices are divided between factors known to stress corals, and factors incorporating properties of the reef landscape that resist stress or promote coral growth. The first-basis for a remote sensed resilience index (RSRI), an estimate of expected reef resilience, is proposed. Developed for the Red Sea, the framework of our analysis is flexible and with minimal adaptation, could be extended to other reef regions. We aim to stimulate discussion as to use of remote sensing to do more than simply deliver habitat maps of coral reefs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Stable isotope analysis is being utilized with increasing regularity to examine a wide range of issues (diet, habitat use, migration) in ecology, geology, archaeology, and related disciplines. A crucial component to these studies is a thorough understanding of the range and causes of baseline isotopic variation, which is relatively poorly understood for nitrogen (delta N-15). Animal excrement is known to impact plant delta N-15 values, but the effects of seabird guano have not been systematically studied from an agricultural or horticultural standpoint.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: This paper presents isotopic (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and vital data for maize (Zea mays) fertilized with Peruvian seabird guano under controlled conditions. The level of N-15 enrichment in fertilized plants is very large, with delta N-15 values ranging between 25.5 and 44.7 parts per thousand depending on the tissue and amount of fertilizer applied; comparatively, control plant delta N-15 values ranged between -0.3 and 5.7 parts per thousand. Intraplant and temporal variability in delta N-15 values were large, particularly for the guano-fertilized plants, which can be attributed to changes in the availability of guano-derived N over time, and the reliance of stored vs. absorbed N. Plant delta C-13 values were not significantly impacted by guano fertilization. High concentrations of seabird guano inhibited maize germination and maize growth. Moreover, high levels of seabird guano greatly impacted the N metabolism of the plants, resulting in significantly higher tissue N content, particularly in the stalk.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results presented in this study demonstrate the very large impact of seabird guano on maize delta N-15 values. The use of seabird guano as a fertilizer can thus be traced using stable isotope analysis in food chemistry applications (certification of organic inputs). Furthermore, the fertilization of maize with seabird guano creates an isotopic signature very similar to a high-trophic level marine resource, which must be considered when interpreting isotopic data from archaeological material.

AB The Table Mountain National Park is a 265 km(2) protected area embedded within a city of 3.5 million people. The park contains an extremely diverse flora with many endemic species, and has been granted World Heritage Site status in recognition of this unique biodiversity. Invasive alien plants are arguably the most significant threat to the conservation of this biodiversity, and the past decade has seen the implementation of aggressive programs aimed at the removal of invasions by these plants. These invasive alien plants include several species of trees, notably pines (Pinus species) and eucalypts (Eucalyptus species), which historically have been grown in plantations, and which are utilized for recreation by the city's residents. In addition, many citizens regard the trees as attractive and ecologically beneficial, and for these reasons the alien plant control programs have been controversial. I briefly outline the legal obligations to deal with invasive alien plants, the history of control operations and the scientific rationale for their implementation, and the concerns that have been raised about the operations. Evidence in support of control includes the aggressive invasive nature of many species, and the fact that they displace native biodiversity (often irreversibly) and have negative impacts on hydrology, fire intensity, and soil stability. Those against control cite aesthetic concerns, the value of pine plantations for recreation, the (perceived) unattractive nature of the treeless natural vegetation, and the (incorrect) belief that trees bring additional rainfall. The debate has been conducted through the press, and examples of perceptions and official responses are given. Despite opposition, the policy promoting alien plant removal has remained in place, and considerable progress has been made towards clearing pine plantations and invasive populations. This conservation success story owes much to political support, arising largely from job creation, and a strong body of scientific evidence that could be cited in support of the program.

AB To help determine the major factors associated with alien plant in a newly invaded mountain range; we analyzed the distribution patterns of woody alien species along the altitudinal gradient of the Crdoba mountains, in relation to biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors. We selected 303 plots using a Geographic Information System (GIS) covering all the variability of these factors. In the field we registered woody alien occurrence in these 303 and in 303 additional neighbor plots. We used 12 biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic variables from the GIS to predict the probability of presence of alien species through a logistic model. Then, we analyzed if neighbor alien occurrences could explain some additional variance. We created a probability map with 4 categories of alien occurrence which was then validated by new field sampling. Occurrence of woody aliens was highest in the eastern slope (with longer history of species introduction), at low altitudes, near sources of propagule pressure (human settlements, roads and neighbor sites with established alien plants), and associated to sheltered topographies. In the upper belt of the Crdoba Mountains woody invasion is incipient and thus in a transient stage. Accordingly, propagule pressure seems to be the major factor at play, while the relevance of disturbance and biotic interactions is less clear.

AB We compiled and identified a list of Chinese endemic seed plant species based on a large number of published references and expert reviews. The characters of these seed plant species and their distribution patterns were described at length. China is rich in endemic seed plants, with a total of 14 939 species (accounting for 52.1% of its total seed plant species) belonging to 1584 genera and 191 families. Temperate families and genera have a significantly higher proportion of endemism than cosmopolitan and tropical ones. The most primitive and derived groups have significantly higher endemism than the other groups. The endemism of tree, shrub, and liana or vine is higher than that of total species; in contrast, the endemism of herb is lower than that of total species. Geographically, these Chinese endemic plants are mainly distributed in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces, southwest China. Species richness and proportion of these endemic plants decrease with increased latitude and have a unimodal response to altitude. The peak value of proportion of endemism is at higher altitudes than that of total species and endemic species richness. The proportions of endemic shrub, liana or vine, and herb increase with altitude and have a clear unimodal curve. In contrast, the proportion of tree increases with altitude, with a sudden increase at similar to 4000 m and has a completely different model. To date, our study provides the most comprehensive list of Chinese endemic seed plant species and their basic composition and distribution features.

AB Spatial heterogeneity is considered a ubiquitous feature in natural ecosystems. Fertile islands represent a typical example for such heterogeneity in desert ecosystems. The soil pH and salinity also show significant heterogeneity in fertile islands. To investigate the distribution of soil salinity and nutrients around individual shrubs and the major factors influencing their distribution, an experiment was conducted at the scale of the rhizosphere, root system, and individual for Haloxylon ammodendron (C. A. Mey.) Bunge (Chenopodiaceae) shrub in the Gurbantunggut Desert. Specifically, the heterogeneity of the following soil chemical parameters was evaluated: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and available phosphorus (AP). The chemical properties of the shrub stemflow were also evaluated to determine its contribution to the formation of fertile islands and the distribution of soil salinity. The results revealed great variance in the soil pH and EC at the rhizosphere and root system scales, indicating that a single root or root system exerts a great effect on soil pH and salinity. At the individual scale, the content of SOC, TN, and AP was significantly enriched in the layers adhering to the taproot, and this enrichment extended 20-40 cm from the taproot. Conversely, the soil pH and EC were significantly lower from the taproot to 10-25 cm away from the root, indicating that the fertile island is also an island of low alkalinity/salinity. Comparison of the chemical properties of stemflow and bulk precipitation revealed a higher content of chemical elements (except pH and CO(3) (2-)) in the stemflow, indicating that the fertile island and lower pH and EC in this island were likely formed by the effects of stemflow. Specifically, stemflow brings in water and nutrients, while reducing the salt levels. Overall, the high nutrients and low alkalinity/salinity island created around the taproot favor the growth of the plants.

AB P>1. Indices of abundance offer cost effective and rapid methods for estimating abundance of endangered species across large landscapes, yet their wide usage is controversial due to their potential of being biased. Here, we assess the utility of indices for the daunting task of estimating the abundance of the endangered tiger at landscape scales.
   2. We use double sampling to estimate two indices of tiger abundance (encounters of pugmarks and scats per km searched) and calibrate those indices against contemporaneous estimates of tiger densities obtained using camera-trap mark-recapture (CTMR) at 21 sites (5185 km2) in Central and North India. We use simple and multiple weighted regressions to evaluate relationships between tiger density and indices. A model for estimating tiger density from indices was validated by Jackknife analysis and precision was assessed by correlating predicted tiger density with CTMR density. We conduct power analysis to estimate the ability of CTMR and of indices to detect changes in tiger density.
   3. Tiger densities ranged between 0 center dot 25 and 19 tigers 100 km-2 were estimated with an average coefficient of variation of 13 center dot 2(SE 2 center dot 5)%. Tiger pugmark encounter rates explained 84% of the observed variability in tiger densities. After removal of an outlier (Corbett), square root transformed scat encounter rates explained 82% of the variation in tiger densities.
   4. A model including pugmark and scat encounters explained 95% of the variation in tiger densities with good predictive ability (PRESS R2 = 0 center dot 99). Overall, CTMR could detect tiger density changes of > 12% with 80% power at alpha = 0 center dot 3, while the index based model had 50% to 85% power to detect > 30% declines. The power of indices to detect declines increased at high tiger densities.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Indices of tiger abundance obtained from across varied habitats and a range of tiger densities could reliably estimate tiger abundance. Financial and temporal costs of estimating indices were 7% and 34% respectively, of those for CTMR. The models and methods presented herein have application in evaluation of the abundance of cryptic carnivores at landscape scales and form part of the protocol used by the Indian Government for evaluating the status of tigers.

AB Changing environmental and socio-economic conditions make land degradation, a major concern in Central and East Asia. Globally satellite imagery, particularly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, has proved an effective tool for monitoring land cover change. This study examines 33 grassland water points using vegetation field studies and remote sensing techniques to track desertification on the Mongolian plateau. Findings established a significant correlation between same-year field observation (line transects) and NDVI data, enabling an historical land cover perspective to be developed from 1998 to 2006. Results show variable land cover patterns in Mongolia with a 16% decrease in plant density over the time period. Decline in cover identified by NDVI suggests degradation; however, continued annual fluctuation indicates desertification - irreversible land cover change - has not occurred. Further, in situ data documenting greater cover near water points implies livestock overgrazing is not causing degradation at water sources. In combination of the two research methods - remote sensing and field surveys - strengthen findings and provide an effective way to track desertification in dryland regions.

AB The distribution and abundance of native ungulates were measured on commercially managed, semi-arid rangeland in central Kenya over a 3-year period that encompassed severe drought and above-average rainfall. Native ungulate biomass density averaged 5282 kg km-2 over the study and was dominated by elephant (Loxodonta africana), impala (Aepyceros melampus) and dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii). Biomass density of domestic cattle (Bos taurus) averaged 2280 kg km-2 during the study. Responses of native ungulates to severe drought were variable. Impala densities were similar to or greater than densities for similar habitat in protected areas, and varied from 12 to 16 km-2 during and following the drought to 24-29 km-2 following above-average rainfall. Dik-dik densities were also greater than densities reported for protected areas and were surprisingly stable throughout the study despite the wide annual fluctuations in rainfall. Elephant migrated out of the region during drought but were present at high densities (2.9-5.2 km-2) during wet seasons, consistent with telemetry studies emphasizing the importance of Acacia bushland habitat on commercial rangelands for the migratory portion of the Laikipia-Samburu elephant population. Results show that substantial densities of native browsing and mixed-feeding ungulates can occur on rangeland managed for commercial beef production and suggest that the capacity for ungulates to move over large spatial scales (> 100 km2) and to shift distributions in response to locally variable thunderstorms may be important for sustaining these populations.Resume
   Pendant trois ans, on a mesure la distribution et l'abondance d'ongules indigenes dans une propriete semi-aride, geree de facon commerciale, situee au centre du Kenya. Cette periode a inclus de graves secheresses et aussi des chutes de pluies au-dessus de la moyenne. La biomasse des ongules natifs fut en moyenne de 5282 kg km-2 pendant cette periode; elle etait dominee par les elephants Loxodonta africana, les impalas Aepyceros melampus et les dik-diks Madoqua kirkii. La biomasse du betail domestique Bos taurusetait en moyenne de 2280 kg m-2 pendant cette etude. Les reponses des ongules indigenes face a la secheresse prononcee furent variables. La densite des impalas fut la meme, voire superieure a celle des habitats similaires dans des aires protegees et elle a varie de 12-16 per km superset of pendant et juste apres la secheresse a 24-29 km-superset of suite a des pluies exceptionnellement abondantes. La densite des dik-diks fut aussi superieure a celle qui fut rapportee pour les aires protegees, et elle est restee etonnamment stable durant toute la duree de l'etude malgre les amples fluctuations des pluies annuelles. Les elephants ont migre hors de la region pendant la secheresse mais ils etaient la en forte densite (2.9-5.3 per km superset of) pendant les saisons des pluies, ce qui conforte les etudes telemetriques qui insistent sur l'importance de la brousse a acacias dans les exploitations commerciales pour la partie de la population d'elephants de Laikipia-Samburu qui fait des migrations. Les resultats montrent que l'on peut observer des densites importantes d'ongules indigenes herbivores et mixtes sur des proprietes gerees en vue de la production commerciale de boeuf, et ils suggerent que le fait que des ongules puissent migrer sur de longues distances (> 100 km) et que leur distribution puisse ainsi evoluer en reponse a des tempetes locales de force variable pourrait etre tres important pour le maintien de ces populations.

AB Road building triggers vegetation and soil degradation which affects road safety. We present conclusive results in terms of roadslope protection against erosion from several studies performed on semiarid roadslopes since 2000 (in Eastern Spain). We aim to (1) improve our understanding about slope and vegetation factors which control soil erosion and plant colonisation on semiarid roadslopes; (2) assess the effectiveness of topsoiling, hydroseeding and species selection in the protection of soil against erosion and (3) set scientifically based priorities on ecosystem components that have to be taken into account in future roadslope restoration plans.
   Erosion and vegetation cover estimations, vegetation surveys, drilling and hydroseeding experiments with commercial and native species were performed on roadslopes, in addition to seed germination and root penetration experiments.
   Our results indicate that slope type and angle are the main factors controlling soil erosion and plant colonisation on semiarid roadslopes. Microsite availability is more limiting to plant establishment than seed availability. Restoration strategies based on the improvement of soil properties and the appropriate selection of native species, able to overcome harsh hydrological and structural soil conditions, are proposed and tested according to slope characteristics. Drilling proved to be a promising technique for roadcut restoration, whereas topsoiling followed by hydroseeding with a seed mixture of selected native species was the most efficient treatment, in terms of cost and benefit, to control erosion on roadfills.
   This study clearly shows that ecological knowledge is needed to guide restoration efforts in Mediterranean ecosystems. Moreover, an efficient transfer of scientific knowledge from researchers to the institutions concerned (restorers, policymakers and practitioners) is also needed in the perspective of a more appropriate management of these ecosystems.

AB In African savannas, vertebrate herbivores are often identified as key determinants of plant growth, survivorship, and reproduction. However, plant reproduction is likely to be the product of responses to a suite of abiotic and biotic factors, including nutrient availability and interactions with antagonists and mutualists. In it relatively simple system, we examined the role of termites (which act as ecosystem engineers-modifying physical habitat and creating islands of high soil fertility), vertebrate herbivores, and symbiotic ants, on the fruiting success of a dominant plant, Acacia drepanolobium, in East African savannas.
   Using observational data, large-scale experimental manipulations, and analysis of foliar N, we found that Acacia drepanolobium trees growing at the edge of termite mounds were more likely to reproduce than those growing farther away, in off-mound soils. Although vertebrate herbivores preferentially used termite mounds as demonstrated by dung deposits, long-term exclusion of mammalian grazers did not significantly reduce A. drepanolobium fruit production. Leaf N was significantly greater in trees growing next to mounds than in those growing farther away, and this pattern Was unaffected by exclusion of vertebrates. Thus, soil enrichment by termites, rather than through dung and urine deposition by large herbivores, is of primary importance to fruit production near mounds. Across all mound-herbivore treatment combinations, trees that harbored Crematogaster, sjostedti were more likely to fruit than those that harbored one of the other three ant species. Although C. sjostedti is less aggressive than the other ants, it tends to inhabit large, old trees near termite mounds which are more likely to fruit than smaller ones.
   Termites play a key role in generating patches of nutrient-rich habitat important to the reproductive success of A. drepanolobium in East African savannas. Enhanced nutrient acquisition from termite mounds appears to allow plants to tolerate herbivory and the reduced defense by it relatively ineffective ant partner. Our results underscore the importance of simultaneously examining top-down and bottom-up effects to understand those factors most important to plant reproductive success.

AB The current growing body of evidence for diversity-disturbance relationships suggests that the peaked pattern predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis ( IDH) may not be the rule. Even if ecologists could quantify the diversity-disturbance relationship consistent with the IDH, the applicability of the IDH to land management has rarely been addressed. We examined two hypotheses related to the generality and management applicability of the IDH to Mongolian rangeland ecosystems: that the diversity-disturbance relationship varies as a function of landscape condition and that some intermediate scales of grazing can play an important role in terms of sustainable rangeland management through a grazing gradient approach. We quantified the landscape condition of each ecological site using an ordination technique and determined two types of landscape conditions: relatively benign and harsh environmental conditions. At the ecological sites characterized by relatively benign environmental conditions, diversity-disturbance relationships were generally consistent with the IDH, and maximum diversity was observed at some intermediate distance from the source of the grazing gradient. In contrast, the IDH was not supported at most (but not all) sites characterized by relatively harsh environmental conditions. The intermediate levels of grazing were generally located below the ecological threshold representing the points or zones at which disturbance should be limited to prevent drastic changes in ecological conditions, suggesting that there is little "conundrum" with regard to intermediate disturbance in the studied systems in terms of land management. We suggest that the landscape condition is one of the primary factors that cause inconsistencies in diversity-disturbance relationships. The ecological threshold can extend its utility in rangeland management because it also has the compatibility with the maintenance of species diversity. This study thus suggests that some intermediate scales of grazing and ecological thresholds are mutually supportive tools for sustainable management of Mongolian rangelands.

AB Despite wide agreement that strictly protected areas (World Conservation Union categories I-III) are the best strategy for conserving biodiversity, they are limited in extent and exclude many species of key conservation importance. In contrast, multiple-use management areas (categories IV-VI), comprising > 60% of the world's protected-area network, are often considered of little value to biodiversity conservation, particularly in Africa, where they typically contain few charismatic large mammals. We sampled small mammals, amphibians, birds, butterflies, and trees at 41 sites along a four-step gradient of increasing human activity and decreasing conservation protection, from a well-protected Tanzanian national park to nonintensive agricultural land. Although preliminary, our results indicate that species richness of these five taxa did not decline along this gradient, but different management areas, occupying areas of largely similar habitat, hosted distinct communities of each taxon. Differences in species composition in the absence of manifest differences in species richness highlight the importance of developing landscape-scale conservation strategies and the danger of using either a limited suite of indicator taxa or umbrella species as surrogates for biodiversity. Although strictly protected areas perform a unique and vital conservation service in East Africa by protecting large mammals, areas that allow varied resource extraction activities still possess vital and complementary conservation value.

AB Although much concern has been directed at nitrogen (N) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems with bird colonies, little has been clarified on the processes of phosphorus (P) cycling itself, and few comparisons between P and N cycling in bird colonies have been made. On the Isaki Headland and Chikubu Island, which are located on or near the shore of Lake Biwa, Central Japan, a dramatic increase in the population of cormorants has occurred since the 1980s. There has been a concomitant increase in the transport of nutrients from the lake to the waterside ecosystems. We compared the pools and dynamics of N and P in the cormorant-colony forests in order to clarify the effects of differences in soil N and P dynamics on the N-P balance of these colony forests. The total N concentration in the forest floor at excrement-influenced sites was not significantly different from that at sites without such influence, in spite of the heavy load of cormorant- derived N. In contrast to N, forest floor P concentration at the sites with excrement influence was significantly higher compared to sites without such influence, resulting in the lower forest floor N/P ratio at the excrement-influenced sites even after colony abandonment. The site pattern of total N and P concentrations and N/P ratio for mineral soil was similar to that for the forest floor. It seems that the leaky character for N and the accumulative character for P are due to the high mobility of nitrate in soils and the tight absorption of inorganic P to clay minerals, respectively. The site pattern of N/P ratios observed for Chamaecyparis obtusa Sieb. et Zucc. leaves is consistent with that for the forest floor and/ or mineral soil, suggesting that the soil geochemical property was reflected in the foliar N/P ratio. The chemistry of throughfall and soil solution was also changed due to deposition of cormorant excrement, and the changes continued for a few years after abandonment of the colony. The quantitative analyses for N and P suggested that the major part of N and P transported by cormorants was not retained in plant matter and the surface soil beneath the colony but instead leached into deeper soil layers. The influence of cormorant excrement on nutrient balance of the whole colony ecosystem is also discussed.

AB The endemic seed plant flora of the north-eastern Transvaal Escarpment (part of the Afromontane Region) is assessed in terms of the region's lithology (mainly rocks of the Transvaal Sequence). A total of 81 species and infraspecific taxa are endemic or near-endemic to the quartzitic and related rock types of the Black Reef Quartzite Formation, Wolkberg Group and Timeball Hill Formation (c. 3880 kM2) and a total of 32 species were recorded as endemic or near-endemic to the dolomitic Chuniespoort Formation (c. 2100 kM2). As a major centre of biodiversity, we propose to name this escarpment region of Transvaal Sequence, the Wolkberg Centre. Two subunits of endemism are recognized: the Blyde Subcentre in the south, and the Serala Subcentre in the north. Although the number of endemics on dolomite is less than half the number on quartzite-derived substrates, the degree of endemism is higher on the former. The majority of dolomite endemics are confined to the drier areas and are not of such strong Afromontane affinity as the quartzite ones. Nearly all the endemics are herbaceous, conforming to the observation that regional endemism levels in the Afromontane Region are high in grassland, but low among the tree flora of the patches of undifferentiated evergreen forest. The vegetation of the Wolkberg Centre, especially the grasslands, is under considerable pressure, particularly from the timber industry and invasive alien plants. Existing and proposed conservation areas in the centre are listed.

AB Context A background assumption of landscape approaches is that some landscape patterns are more sustainable than others, and thus searching for these patterns should be a unifying theme for all landscape-related studies. We know much about biodiversity, ecosystems, and human wellbeing in our landscapes, but much less about how their interactions influence, and are influenced by, landscape patterns. To help fill this knowledge gap, landscape sustainability science (LSS) has emerged. However, the core research questions and key approaches of this new field still need to be systematically articulated. Objectives The main objectives of this paper were: (1) to propose a set of core research questions for LSS, and (2) to identify key cross-disciplinary approaches that can help address these questions. Methods I took a qualitative and subjective approach to review and synthesize the literature relevant to landscape sustainability, based on which I developed core questions and identified key cross-disciplinary approaches. Results Eight core questions were proposed to focus on understanding the relationships among landscape pattern, biodiversity, ecosystem function, ecosystem services, and human wellbeing, assessing the impacts of environmental and socio-institutional changes on these relationships, and fusing knowledge and action through landscape design/planning and governance processes. Ten inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches were identified, and their key characteristics were discussed in relation to landscape sustainability. Conclusions LSS has emerged as an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research field that aims to understand and improve sustainability by focusing on landscape scales, while considering local and global scales in the same time. To advance LSS, future research not only needs to emphasize the relationships among landscape pattern, ecosystem services, and human wellbeing, but also to proactively integrate complementary approaches across natural and social sciences. Landscape sustainability is inevitably connected to the broader regional and global context; but if global sustainability is to be achieved, our landscapes must be sustained first. It is not the other way around.

AB Determining where species diversify (cradles) and persist (museums) over evolutionary time is fundamental to understanding the distribution of biodiversity and for conservation prioritization. Here, we identify cradles and museums of angiosperm generic diversity across tropical Africa, one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth. Regions containing nonrandom concentrations of young (neo-) and old (paleo-) endemic taxa were identified using distribution data of 1719 genera combined with a newly generated time-calibrated mega-phylogenetic tree. We then compared the identified regions with the current network of African protected areas (PAs). At the generic level, phylogenetic diversity and endemism are mainly concentrated in the biogeographically complex region of Eastern Africa. We show that mountainous areas are centres of both neo- and paleo-endemism. By contrast, the Guineo-Congolian lowland rain forest region is characterized by widespread and old lineages. We found that the overlap between centres of phylogenetic endemism and PAs is high (> 85%). We show the vital role played by mountains acting simultaneously as cradles and museums of tropical African plant biodiversity. By contrast, lowland rainforests act mainly as museums for generic diversity. Our study shows that incorporating large-scale taxonomically verified distribution datasets and mega-phylogenies lead to an improved understanding of tropical plant biodiversity evolution.

AB Urban green space (UGS) is an indispensable component of urban environmental systems and is important to urban residents. Both physical features (e.g., shrubs, trees) and social functions (e.g., public parks, green buffers) are important in UGS mapping. Most UGS studies rely solely on remote sensing data to conduct UGS mapping of physical features, and few studies have focused on UGS mapping from a social function perspective. Due to the limitations of remote sensing in identifying social features; social sensing, which can reflect socioeconomic characteristics, is needed. As a result, a novel methodological framework for integrating these two different data sources to conduct the social functional mapping of UGS has been required. Consequently, we first extracted vegetation patches from an area in Beijing, via the Hyperplanes for Plant Extraction Methodology (HPEM) and considered the parcels segmented by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks as the basic analytical units. Then, near-convex-hull analysis (NCHA) and text-concave-hull analysis (TCHA) were performed to integrate the multi-source data. The results show that the Level I and Level II (refer to Table 3) social function types of UGS had overall accuracies of 92.48% and 88.76%, respectively. Our study provides an improved understanding of UGS and can assist government departments in urban planning. It can also help researchers broaden their research scope by acting as a freely available data source for their work.

AB Although there is a diversity of concerns about recent persistent declines in the abundances of many species, the implications for the associated delivery of ecosystem services to people are surprisingly poorly understood. In principle, there are a broad range of potential functional relationships between the abundance of a species or group of species and the magnitude of ecosystem-service provision. Here, we identify the forms these relationships are most likely to take. Focusing on the case of birds, we review the empirical evidence for these functional relationships, with examples of supporting, regulating, and cultural services. Positive relationships between abundance and ecosystem-service provision are the norm (although seldom linear), we found no evidence for hump-shaped relationships, and negative ones were limited to cultural services that value rarity. Given the magnitude of abundance declines among many previously common species, it is likely that there have been substantial losses of ecosystem services, providing important implications for the identification of potential tipping points in relation to defaunation resilience, biodiversity conservation, and human well-being.

AB The concept of spatial resilience has brought a new focus on the influence of multi-scale processes on the dynamics of ecosystems. Initial ideas about spatial resilience focused on coral reefs and emphasized escalating anthropogenic disturbances across the broader seascape. This perspective resonated with a new awareness of global drivers of change, such as growth in international trade and shifts in climate, and the need to respond by scaling up governance and management. We review recent trends and emerging ideas in spatial resilience, using coral reefs and dependent communities as exemplars of multi-scale social-ecological systems. Despite recent advances, management and governance of ecosystems remain spatially fragmented and constrained to small scales. Temporally, many interventions still miss or ignore warning signals and struggle to cope with history, politics, long-term cumulative pressures, feedbacks, and sudden surprises. Significant recent progress has been made in understanding the relevance of spatial and temporal scale, heterogeneity, networks, the importance of place, and multi-scale governance. Emerging themes include better integration of ecology and conservation with social and economic science, and incorporating temporal dynamics in spatial analyses. A better understanding of the multi-scale spatial and temporal processes that drive the resilience of linked social-ecosystems will help address the widespread mismatch between the scales of ongoing ecological change and effective long-term governance of land- and seascapes.

AB Positive indirect effects of consumers on their resources can stabilize food webs by preventing overexploitation, but the coupling of trophic and non-trophic interactions remains poorly integrated into our understanding of community dynamics. Elephants engineer African savanna ecosystems by toppling trees and breaking branches, and although their negative effects on trees are well documented, their effects on small-statured plants remain poorly understood. Using data on 117 understory plant taxa collected over 7 yr within 36 1-ha experimental plots in a semi-arid Kenyan savanna, we measured the strength and direction of elephant impacts on understory vegetation. We found that elephants had neutral effects on most (83-89%) species, with a similar frequency of positive and negative responses among the remainder. Overall, estimated understory biomass was 5-14% greater in the presence of elephants across a range of rainfall levels. Whereas direct consumption likely accounts for the negative effects, positive effects are presumably indirect. We hypothesized that elephants create associational refuges for understory plants by damaging tree canopies in ways that physically inhibit feeding by other large herbivores. As predicted, understory biomass and species richness beneath elephant-damaged trees were 55% and 21% greater, respectively, than under undamaged trees. Experimentally simulated elephant damage increased understory biomass by 37% and species richness by 49% after 1yr. Conversely, experimentally removing elephant damaged branches decreased understory biomass by 39% and richness by 30% relative to sham-manipulated trees. Camera-trap surveys revealed that elephant damage reduced the frequency of herbivory by 71%, whereas we detected no significant effect of damage on temperature, light, or soil moisture. We conclude that elephants locally facilitate understory plants by creating refuges from herbivory, which countervails the direct negative effects of consumption and enhances larger-scale biomass and diversity by promoting the persistence of rare and palatable species. Our results offer a counterpoint to concerns about the deleterious impacts of elephant overpopulation that should be considered in debates over wildlife management in African protected areas: understory species comprise the bulk of savanna plant biodiversity, and their responses to elephants are buffered by the interplay of opposing consumptive and non-consumptive interactions.

AB The microbial communities and overall health of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, have long been topics of interest due to the fundamental economic and ecological roles this species maintains. A broad scale characterization of the oyster microbiome over spatial and seasonal scales, however, has never been carried out. The primary goal of this study was to examine the factors mediating microbial communities of the gut and pallial fluid of C. virginica at three sites within the Long Island Sound estuary, with a focus on both genetic structure (T-RFLP) and physiological profiling (EcoPlates) of the microbiome. Results indicated that the genetic structure of microbial communities of oysters was minimally separated across sites, but was influenced by season. Although the microbial community structure was similar, the number of carbon sources utilized by these communities (richness) varied across site, season, and anatomical location within the host. Parameters including oyster condition index, Dermo disease, and ambient water temperature were measured to assess their influence on the oyster microbiome. Only water temperature was found to have a significant relationship with microbial community structure and richness. Results suggest that a core microbiome may exist within the eastern oyster, specifically for those populations that are not genetically distinct.

AB In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the field of virus environmental ecology. In marine ecosystems, for example, viruses are now thought to play pivotal roles in the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and to be mediators of microbial evolution through horizontal gene transfer. The diversity and ecology of viruses in soils are poorly understood, but evidence supports the view that the diversity and ecology of viruses in soils differ substantially from those in aquatic systems. Desert biomes cover similar to 33% of global land masses, and yet the diversity and roles of viruses in these dominant ecosystems remain poorly understood. There is evidence that hot hyperarid desert soils are characterized by high levels of bacterial lysogens and low extracellular virus counts. In contrast, cold desert soils contain high extracellular virus titers. We suggest that the prevalence of microbial biofilms in hyperarid soils, combined with extreme thermal regimens, exerts strong selection pressures on both temperate and virulent viruses. Many desert soil virus sequences show low values of identity to virus genomes in public databases, suggesting the existence of distinct and as-yet-uncharacterized soil phylogenetic lineages (e.g., cyanophages). We strongly advocate for amplification-free metavirome analyses while encouraging the classical isolation of phages from dominant and culturable microbial isolates in order to populate sequence databases. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the study of viruses in hyperarid soils and of the factors that contribute to viral abundance and diversity in hot and cold deserts and offers technical recommendations for future studies.

AB Land use effects are considered among the main stressors on freshwater biodiversity, with up to 80% of land in Europe under intensive use. Here, we address the impact of arable and urban landscapes on taxon richness, Shannon Wiener diversity, taxon rareness and taxonomic distinctness of eleven organism groups encompassing vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, occurring in five freshwater ecosystem types across Europe: rivers, floodplains, lakes, ponds and groundwater. In addition, nine geo-climatic descriptors (e.g. latitude, longitude, precipitation) were used to disentangle land use effects from those of natural drivers of biodiversity. Using a variance partitioning scheme based on boosted regression trees and generalised linear regression modelling, we sought: (i) to partition the unique, shared and unexplained variation in the metrics explained by both groups of descriptor variables, (ii) to quantify the contribution of each descriptor variable to biodiversity variation in the most parsimonious regression model and (iii) to identify interactions of land use and natural descriptors. The variation in biodiversity uniquely described by land use was consistently low across both ecosystem types and organism groups. In contrast, geo-climatic descriptors uniquely, and jointly with land use, explained significantly more variance in all 39 biodiversity metrics tested. Regression models revealed significant interactions between geo-climatic descriptors and land use for a third of the models, with interactions accounting for up to 17% of the model's deviance. However, no consistent patterns were observed related to the type of biodiversity metric and organism group considered. Subdividing data according to the strongest geo-climatic gradient in each dataset aimed to reduce the strength of natural descriptors relative to land use. Although data sub-setting can highlight land use effects on freshwater biodiversity, sub-setting our data often failed to produce stronger land use effects. There was no increase in spatial congruence in the subsets, suggesting that the observed land use effects were not dependent on the spatial extent of the subsets. Our results confirm significant joint effects of, and interactions between, land use and natural environmental descriptors on freshwater biodiversity, across ecosystem types and organism groups. This has implications for biodiversity monitoring. First, the combined analysis of anthropogenic and natural descriptors is a prerequisite for the analysis of human threats to biodiversity. Second, geo-climatically, but not necessarily geographically more homogeneous datasets can help unmask the role of anthropogenic descriptors. And third, whole community-based biodiversity metrics (including taxon richness) are not ideal indicators of anthropogenic effects on biodiversity at broad scales. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Exotic tree species are increasingly common in many regions of the world and at least some species are becoming naturalized in the regions where they were introduced. Disturbances like fire may be at the origin or accelerate the naturalization of these species. Portugal holds one of the largest areas of exotic Eucalyptus globulus plantations in the world and is one of the countries most affected by forest fires. These two facts have triggered the present research. This study aimed at characterising medium-term natural establishment of E. globulus plants originated from seeds under natural conditions in burnt planted forests (pure E. globulus stands, pure Pinus pinaster stands, and mixed stands of both species), and at analysing factors associated with this establishment. Occurrence, abundance and height of naturally established E. globulus plants were characterized in 284 sites distributed in burnt areas, across Central and Northern Portugal, 57 years after wildfire. Generalized linear models were used to assess the influence of stand type, regional productivity potential, and post-fire management practices on occurrence probability, density, and median height of sampled E. globulus individuals. The influence of these explanatory variables on the structure (in terms of size class distribution) of naturally established E. globulus cohort was examined using analysis of similarity and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Naturally established E. globulus plants were present in 93.1%, 19.0% and 98.6% of samples in pure E. globulus, pure P. pinaster and mixed stands, respectively. Cohort median density was 0.20 plants m(-2) and maximum density was 4.55 plants m(-2). Median height of plants was 2.0 m and 95.3% of them had h >1.30 m and <= 5 cm. Establishment probability, density and median height were highest in the most productive regions. Three post-fire management operations had a significant influence on the response variables: (i) salvage logging was associated with a higher density; (ii) tillage was associated with a lower density and a smaller median height; (iii) understorey removal was associated with a lower occurrence probability. Tillage was the only studied factor influencing the size structure of spontaneously established cohort, eliminating larger plants. This study showed that stand type, productivity region and post-fire management operations might have significantly influenced the natural establishment of E. globulus in burnt areas, and consequently the species naturalization process in Portugal. The implications of these findings for management are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dispersion of planktonic propagules connects shoreline populations of many marine species, and considerable effort has been directed at understanding this process. However, gaps in knowledge persist. In particular, relatively little information is available regarding transport over the innermost portions of the continental shelf. We quantified velocity in nearshore waters at 5 sites along the California coast and investigated flow patterns relevant for dispersing larvae and algal spores. Mean depth-averaged alongshore velocities increased with distance from shore at all sites. This repeated and consistent 'coastal boundary layer' (CBL) pattern exhibits a logarithmic profile that resembles that associated with the 'law of the wall' of smaller-scale turbulent boundary layers, despite differences in spatial dimension and governing physics. A tentative scaling of dominant terms in an alongshore momentum balance suggests nontrivial levels of lateral stress, but small cross-shore gradients in this quantity. Such a trend of near-constant lateral stress, when combined with simple representations of horizontal mixing (i.e. eddy viscosity parameterizations) that increase approximately linearly with distance from shore, provides a possible explanation for the observed logarithmic velocity pattern. Incorporating these cross-shore gradients in alongshore velocity and cross-shore mixing in a 2-dimensional particle-tracking simulation leads to a decrease in mean alongshore transport of larvae and an increase in the variance in dispersal distance. Most notably, the CBL is predicted to dramatically increase self-replenishment.

AB Tick-borne disease systems are very sensitive to climate through the impact of temperature and moisture stress on rates of the demographic processes of ticks. There is no a priori reason, however, to expect tick abundance or seasonal activity patterns to respond to climate change in ways that inevitably increase the risk of infection by the transmitted pathogens. Changing host availability may be more important than climate in determining tick abundance. The credibility of any (inherently untestable) predictions of future system-specific changes will be strengthened if based on satisfactory explanations of the past. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Europe is presented as a case study: observed patterns of climate change are too similar within and between countries to provide the sole explanation for the extreme spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the marked upsurges in TBE incidence over the past two decades. Instead, a nexus of interacting factors affecting both the risk of infection and exposure of humans to that risk, and each differing in force in space and time, is a more powerful model. Many of these factors are driven by socio-economic changes, and include climate, land cover, wildlife, agricultural practices, industrial activities, (un)employment and income. The same principle may apply to the periodic epidemics of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.

AB C:N stoichiometry was investigated in relation to diet (delta(15)N), N-deprivation, and worker body size for a diverse assemblage of tropical Amazonian ants. Relative nitrogen (N) deprivation was assayed for 54 species as an exchange ratio (ER),. defined as SUCmin/AAmin,, or the minimum sucrose concentration, divided by the minimum amino acid concentration, accepted as food by greater than or equal to50% of tested workers. On average, N-deprivation (ER) was almost fivefold greater for N-omnivorous and N-herbivorous (N-OH) taxa than for N-carnivores. In two-way ANOVAs at three taxonomic levels (species and species groups, genera, and tribes), higher ER was associated with small body size and (marginally) with less carnivorous diets. ERs did not differ systematically between trophobiont-tending and "leaf-foraging" functional groups, but specialized wound-feeders and coccid-tenders were prominent among high ER taxa. Paradoxically, some high ER taxa were among the most predatory members of their genera or subfamilies. Biomass % N was lower in N-OH taxa than in carnivores and varied inversely with N-deprivation (log ER) in the former taxa only. In an expanded data set, N-content increased allometrically in N-OHs, N-carnivores, and all ants combined. and with carnivory in large-bodied ants only. Exceptional taxa included small-bodied and predaceous Wasmannia, with high % N despite high ER, and Linepithema, with the lowest % N despite high delta(15)N. Patterns in C:N stoichiometry are explained largely at the genus level and above by elemental composition of alarm/defensive/offensive chemical weaponry and, perhaps in some cases, by reduced N investment in cuticle in taxa with high surface:volume ratios. Several consequences of C:N stoichiometry identify Azteca. and possibly Crematogaster. as taxa preadapted for their roles as prominent associates of myrmecophytes. C:N stoichiometry of ants should be incorporated into models of strategic colony design and examined in a phylogenetic context as opportunities permit.

AB Aim This paper reports the diversity and endemism patterns of African ferns, and explores the potential role of diversity refuges and environmental and historical factors in the shaping of these patterns.
   Material and locations The extant fern taxa occupying Africa south of the Sahara, Madagascar and some islands of the South Atlantic.
   Methods The number of taxa in each area or operational geographical unit (OGU) was scored, and the correlation between this number and physical and climatic variables analysed by standard pairwise and stepwise multiple regression analysis (SPR and SMR). The effects of biological factors such as dispersal capacity, reproductive biology, genetic features and certain physiological adaptations were evaluated by comparing the number of species in each OGU. Floral affinities among OGUs were analysed using non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMS) and parsimonic analysis of dispersion (PAD), and compared with beta-turnover and inter-OGU distances.
   Results OGU area, elevation and the distance between refuges determined the composition of local floras, but only greater OGU area and the existence of higher maximum elevations increased species richness. The distance between refuges also affected the number of endemic species, especially on islands. The biological features studied only slightly influenced fern distribution. The main climatic predictor of species number was humidity. SPR and SMR revealed three main groups of ferns with different ecological trends. NMS and PAD analyses separated the four areas of highest diversity in Africa, three of which are inhabited by ferns with distinct ecological requirements. The fourth area was Madagascar, which shows an accumulation of endemic and relict diversity that is not easy to explain.
   Main conclusions The distribution of ferns in Africa has been influenced by refuges. These probably allowed many species to recolonize the neighbouring areas after the extinctions of the Pleistocene. Three major components were detected in the African flora: Guinea-Congolian thermophilous, cold-tolerant Afro-montane, and Southern drought-tolerant elements. These are related to the three main refuge areas, i.e. the Gulf of Guinea area, the eastern tropical region, and the Cape region. Endemicity in ferns was found to be lower than that of seed plants due to the higher dispersability of fern spores. The distance between OGUs seems to be the main predictor of the number of endemic fern species these areas contain.

AB Shrub encroachment of grassland is a global phenomenon that can cause substantial and rapid changes in soil nutrient levels and distribution. If the woody plants in question also have the capacity to fix nitrogen (N), the effects on soil nutrients may potentially be large. Cytisus scoparius L. Link (Scotch broom) is an introduced leguminous shrub from the Mediterranean region that colonizes open grasslands. We measured several properties of the surface soil (0-10 cm depth) across advancing fronts of Cytisus to assess changes in soil fertility associated with invasion in western Washington state (USA). Both total soil C and N increased (1.8% and 6.5%, respectively), resulting in a decrease in C to N ratio of 22.5 in uninvaded soils to 21.5 inside Cytisus patches. delta(15)N signature of surface soil did not clearly demonstrate a signal of N-2-fixation across the Cytisus gradient. On the other hand, seven-day laboratory aerobic incubations demonstrated 3 and 2.4 times greater mineralization and nitrification rate, respectively, in Cytisus soils compared to uninvaded soils. Despite this increase in N availability, bioassay plants (Achillea millefolium) grown in uninvaded soils in the greenhouse were similar to 30% larger than those grown in Cytisus-invaded soils, suggesting that Cytisus may have inhibitory effects on some plants growing in invaded soils. These results suggest that the impact of Cytisus invasion on grassland plant communities may be influenced or tempered by chemical or microbial effects on the soil other than simply increased labile N.

AB We investigated the pathways by which water clarity increases following fish removal by evaluating the effects of a benthivorous fish reduction in a large, shallow, eutrophic, wetland in a predominately agricultural watershed in Iowa, U. S. A. Phytoplankton was phosphorus limited prior to manipulation. After a substantial fish removal was obtained, water clarity increased as a result of decreased suspended sediment and phytoplankton biomass. Trophic cascading, mitigated by release from fish predation and decreased physical interference from suspended sediments, appears to determine water clarity. Inorganic suspended solids declined immediately after fish were removed but the biomass of Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia did not increase until a few weeks after fish removal. High grazing by zooplankton likely reduced phytoplankton biomass during the height of the clear-water phase. Phytoplankton appeared to be limited by zooplankton grazing for approximately two months before reverting to bottom-up control. An increase in suspended sediment and/or increased predation pressure on zooplankton, due to the return of juvenile carp, appears to account for the decline of larger-bodied zooplankters and the switch back to bottom-up control. Macrophyte diversity and density increased substantially after the initiation of the clear-water phase.

TI Marine protected areas in the eastern African region: How successful are
   they?

LA English
DT Article

AB This article reviews the governance and management of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and the coral reefs they contain, in the eastern African Region. This includes the Comoros, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Tanzania, and the Seychelles. Three generations or categories of MPAs are distinguished: i) small areas for protection of a single species or unique marine habitat; ii) large multiple use MPAs designed for coastal development as well as biodiversity protection; and iii) MPAs managed by a nongovernmental organization (NGO) or the private sector. Each of these MPA types is examined according to the policies, legislation, and management systems they entail as well as the economic and community situation they operate within. The paper also provides a review of some eastern African MPAs in terms of their size and location, the type of MPA, zonation schemes, and financial status. The successes of the different types of MPAs are discussed based on specific indicators, such as changes in biodiversity, infrastructure, compliance to regulations and the level of involvement of primary stakeholders in the management. From the review it is clear that a fourth generation of MPAs may be forthcoming; community-based MPAs. Although lack of data makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these different categories of MPAs, it is clear that no MPA can succeed without support of the local communities. Generally, the results of the analysis are promising for MPAs, however a lack of data is hampering a deeper analysis. The major issues facing MPAs in the region are highlighted, as well as some regional initiatives striving to address these issues. A number of recommendations are made, aiming to strengthen the establishment and management of MPAs in the eastern African region.

AB In southern Mediterranean Pinus sylvestris forests there are grassy meadows that resist invasion of trees despite the proximity to seed sources. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms blocking colonization by Pinus sylvestris of the meadows. Two experiments were conducted in which seeds were sown either at I cm depth or on the surface to simulate dispersal, and three treatments of vegetation removal were applied: Disturbed (where the herbaceous layer was eliminated, exposing the mineral soil), Clipped (vegetation cut at ground level) and Control (no disturbance of the herbaceous layer). In addition, the effect of seed predators was controlled by using wire cages in the case of the surface sown experiment.
   When seeds were sown at I cm depth, seedling emergence was not reduced by the herbaceous layer. In contrast, when seeds were surface sown and predators were excluded, the rate of emergence was low in the Control treatment, intermediate in Clipped and high in Disturbed. Seedling emergence was, however, minimal when predators were not excluded, irrespective of the disturbance level. Seedling survival and growth after three years of study were similar among treatments. The results show that the seed predation and the physical barrier created by the herbaceous layer are the two mechanisms blocking the encroachment of Pinus sylvestris onto these Mediterranean mountain meadows, limiting the regeneration and potential expansion of the forest.

AB Litter fall and litter decomposition were studied in four mature stands of Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) in the eastern Pyrenees. The stands were located in environments differing in bedrock type and exposition and were studied for two years. Mass-loss during the first year of decomposition was compared with other European P. sylvestris forests and regressed with environmental variables (temperature and rainfall) and latitude. The results suggested that the mean amount of needle fall (1760 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1)) was within the range reported for northern European stands. There were more differences in the amount of litter fall between the four stands than between the two years studied. However, the needle fall pattern over the year showed significant differences between years in three of the four stands. Litter decomposition was similar in all the stands and only the one in drier conditions showed a lower decomposition rate. On the European scale the decomposition rate was positively related to mean annual temperature and annual rainfall. However, regression analysis suggests that there are other factors, not taken into account in this study, that are important for predicting the decomposition rate.

AB With 2285 species of higher plants crammed into 471 km(2), the flora of South Africa's Cape Peninsula is exceptionally rich. Similar sized areas in other Mediterranean-climate region biodiversity hot-spots support between 4.7 and 2.7 times fewer species. The high plant species richness of the Cape Peninsula is due to the exceptionally high turnover between moderately species-rich sites in different habitats (beta diversity) and between sites in similar habitats along geographical gradients (gamma diversity). Highest beta diversity, encompassing almost complete turnover, was recorded along soil fertility gradients. Although similar patterns for these independent components explain the richness of other regions in the Cape Floristic Region, it is the very long and steep habitat gradients of the Cape Peninsula that makes this region exceptionally rich. Furthermore, the flora is characterized by a high degree of rarity, a phenomenon that undoubtedly influences the turnover. Future research should focus on developing a biological and ecological understanding of the different forms of rarity and integrating this into management plans for the maintenance of biodiversity.

AB In temporary aquatic habitats, permanence and the severe disturbance associated with desiccation are strong selective agents expected to lead to differentiation in life history strategies in populations experiencing different disturbance regimes. Besides optimal timing of hatching of dormant life stages, maturation and reproduction, pool inhabitants also benefit from the acquisition of reliable cues for the quality of the ambient environment. We investigated whether hatching patterns, life history characteristics and egg bank size of Branchipodopsis fairy shrimp (Branchiopoda, Anostraca) inhabiting a cluster of temporary rock pools in South Africa reflect variation in habitat stability and hatching cues. Long-term hydrological variation was used to select pools along a gradient of habitat stability. Initial conductivity was a good indicator for the length of inundations. No hatching occurred under elevated conductivities, which may present a mechanism to avoid abortive hatching. Egg bank size was unaffected by habitat size or habitat stability but instead was related to cover by a protective sheet of dry aquatic vegetation, which presumably counteracts egg bank erosion by wind when pools are dry. Life history but not hatching phenology reflected some aspects of habitat stability. Fairy shrimp populations in ephemeral pools started reproduction earlier than populations in more stable habitats. Additional common garden or transplant experiments, however, will be required to assess the relative importance of environmental and genetic components in explaining the observed variation and acquire more insight into the trade-offs that lie at the base of the evolution of life history strategies along the pond permanence gradient.

AB Pit-building antlions, the larvae of a winged adult insect, capture food by digging funnel-shaped pits in sand and then lying in wait, buried at the vertex, for prey to fall inside. The sedentary nature of this sit-and-wait predatory behaviour and, especially, antlions' innate ability to detect prey arrival, do not fit the typical profile of insects that possess learning capabilities. However, we show, for the first time, that learning can play an important role in this unique form of predation. In three separate experiments, individual antlions received, once per training day, either a vibrational cue presented immediately before the arrival of food or that same cue presented independently of food arrival. Signalling of food not only produced a learned anticipatory behavioural response (Experiment 1), but also conferred a fitness advantage: Associative learning enabled antlions to dig better pits (Experiments 2 and 3), extract food more efficiently (Experiments 2 and 3). and, in turn, moult sooner (Experiment 3) than antlions not receiving the associative learning treatment.

AB Highly mobile aquatic predators are known to forage in the intertidal during periods of immersion. There is limited quantitative information, however, on the extent to which these predators influence the abundance of grazing molluscs which are known to have a key role in structuring intertidal assemblages. Our preliminary video observations revealed that crabs and small fish were abundant on shores in southwest England during high-tide. We then used manipulative experiments to quantify the effect of small mobile aquatic predators on the abundance of limpets (Patella vulgata L). On the lower shore at two moderately sheltered rocky shores three treatments were established: complete cage, partial cage (cage control) and uncaged (natural condition). The complete cages excluded all predators. The partial cage treatment allowed full access to small predators and the uncaged treatment allowed access to all predators. After two months, limpet abundance in uncaged and partial cage treatments had declined by around 50% compared to the complete cage treatment. Population structure also changed with survival of larger individuals being greater than smaller individuals in the open and partial cage treatments compared to the complete cage treatment. The effects of excluding predators were consistent at small (meters) and large spatial scales (kilometres) and hence, it would appear that the outcomes of our research are generally applicable to similar shores in the region.
   To explore the mechanism behind the differential effects of predators according to prey size, we compared the detachment force required to remove limpets of differing sizes from the shore. This was around four times greater for larger individuals than for smaller ones indicating that smaller limpets were more vulnerable to predation. These effects were also consistent between locations. Subsequent laboratory observations showed that the crabs Carcinus maenas (L), Necora puber (L) and Cancer pagurus (L.) which are locally abundant predators of limpets, had differing handling behaviour but were all highly efficient at removing limpets from substratum. Hence, shell width and attachment force appeared to be critical factors influencing the vulnerability of limpets to predation by these crabs. Limpets are known to control the abundance of macroalgae on shores in the North-east Atlantic and so our conclusions about the role of mobile predators in regulating the abundance of these grazers are important to our broader understanding of the ecology of these shores.

AB In forest ecosystems where infrequent, severe fires have been an important process in shaping ecosystem structure, understanding the effects of introduced livestock on post-fire recovery of the vegetation is essential for effective forest resource management and preservation. In Nahuel Huapi National Park in northwestern Patagonia, we studied the effects of livestock on the post-fire recovery of a Nothofagus dombeyi-Austrocedrus chilensis forest that was burned in 1999. We experimentally excluded cattle by fencing plots and compared the vegetation characteristics of fenced and unfenced control plots over a 5-year period. Although cattle did not significantly reduce total plant cover or total species richness, they did reduce maximum heights of woody species including the dominant tree species. Chusquea culeou, a tall understory bamboo, can impede establishment and height growth of the dominant tree species. Although C. culeou accounts for the largest percentage of cattle diet, its mean cover and mean maximum height were not strongly affected by cattle. The reduction in the height growth of seedlings of N. dombeyi and Austrocedrus in the unfenced areas implies that presence of cattle in the recently burned areas may contribute to a post-fire transition from tall forest to bamboo-dominated shrubland that is already widespread in this landscape. Thus, these results provide support for the fencing of recently burned Nothofagus and Austrocedrus forests in the national parks for periods long enough to allow the dominant tree species to grow to heights at which they are no longer severely inhibited by cattle browsing.

AB Nearshore circulation processes and local geomorphological patterns are thought to be important correlates of spatial variation in larval recruitment of benthic organisms. However, few studies have attempted to quantitatively separate their relative influences upon recruitment dynamics. Here we use 12 study sites spanning 250 km of the northern Chile upwelling ecosystem and the intertidal barnacles Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus to examine the extent to which spatial variation in larval recruitment is related to environmental variability and how these relationships depend on spatial autocorrelation. We find that upwelling intensity and wind velocity are negatively related to larval recruitment while surface slicks showed a positive correlation. However, the pure effect of each environmental variable was lower than its combined effects. Taking spatial autocorrelation into account, we find that the spatially structured variation of upwelling dynamics, distance to upwelling fronts, wind velocity, and slick occurrence explained most of the variation in barnacle recruitment. Spatial variation in recruitment rates of barnacles showed a characteristic length scale of 60-70 km, similar to the scale estimated for the spatially structured variables (upwelling, wind velocity, and surface slicks). We find that conditions for the occurrence of surface slicks (as surrogates of internal waves activity) seem to operate across several sites, suggesting a meso-instead local-scale influence over spatial variation in barnacle recruitment. Our results suggest that spatial variation in barnacle recruitment is modulated by the combined influence of several spatially structured nearshore processes operating at scales of 60-70 km and that spatial autocorrelation must be taken into account in the study of the recruitment-environment relationship. However, the influence of local and small-scale factors on recruitment dynamics of benthic invertebrates should be interpreted cautiously.

AB Woody species have increased in abundance in many grassland ecosystems during the last century. To investigate the consequences of Baccharis pilularis encroachment into coastal California grasslands, we established a chronosequence of sites naturally invaded by Baccharis zero to 25 years ago. Increasing above- and below-ground biomass increase along the chronosequence drove increases in ecosystem N sequestration of similar to 700% and in C storage of over 125%. Colonization by oaks (Quercus agrifolia) and other woody species at sites colonized by Baccharis > 15 years ago indicate that the progressive ecosystem changes observed in chronosequence reinforce woody dominance and associated changes at shrub-invaded sites.

AB The reproductive trade-off hypothesis predicts that the investment made in current reproduction determines the breeders' future fitness as a consequence of intra-or inter-generational reproductive costs. Long-lived species are expected to favour their own reproductive value at the expense of their offspring, hence incurring in inter-generational costs, whereas short-lived species are expected to invest in the current breeding attempt even at the expense of their own survival, thus incurring in intra-generational costs. We tested whether intensity of current reproductive effort has intra-or inter-generational costs in a short-lived bird, the blue tit Parus caeruleus, with a brood size manipulation experiment. We expected more intra-generational (parental reproduction and/or survival) than inter-generational (offspring quality and survival) reproductive costs. We found that parental effort, measured as the hourly rate of parental visits to nests, increased gradually with experimental manipulation. Brood size manipulation resulted in a gradual increase in the number of fledglings per nest from reduced to increased treatments. We found an effect of the manipulation on the probability of making a second clutch, with adults rearing enlarged broods being less likely to undertake such a second reproduction during the season compared to those rearing control or decreased broods. We found no evidence of other reproductive costs; neither as adult weight after manipulation, apparent parental local survival, apparent offspring local survival or local recruitment. Although the results seem to support the a priori expectations, alternative explanations are discussed.

AB The design of marine reserves is complex and fraught with uncertainty. However, protection of critical habitat is of paramount importance for reserve design. We present a case study as an example of a reserve design based on fine-scale habitats, the affinities of exploited species to these habitats, adult mobility, and the physical forcing affecting the dynamics of the habitats. These factors and their interaction are integrated in an algorithm that determines the optimal size and location of a marine reserve for a set of 20 exploited species within five different habitats inside a large kelp forest in southern California. The result is a reserve that encompasses similar to 42% of the kelp forest. Our approach differs fundamentally from many other marine reserve siting methods in which goals of area, diversity, or biomass are targeted a priori. Rather, our method was developed to determine how large a reserve must be within a specific area to protect a self-sustaining assemblage of exploited species. The algorithm is applicable across different ecosystems, spatial scales, and for any number of species. The result is a reserve in which habitat value is optimized for a predetermined set of exploited species against the area left open to exploitation. The importance of fine-scale habitat definitions for the exploited species off La Jolla is exemplified by the spatial pattern of habitats and the stability of these habitats within the kelp forest, both of which appear to be determined by ocean microclimate.

AB Tropical dry forests are located predominantly in the northern portion of Venezuela, above 6 degrees N. Although their potential extent covers ca 400,000 km(2) (44% of the land), they currently occupy about 10 percent of this area. The diversity and complexity of Venezuelan dry forests increases from north to south along a gradient of decreasing severity of the dry season. A typical dry forest in Venezuela presents ca 110-170 species of plants front ca 40 to 50 families with in an area of approximately 10 ha. Species composition and forest structure, however, are dependent oil local landscape conditions (e.g., soil type, topography), and nearby forest types call be very different. Our analysis of five dry forest variants showed a maximum family similarity of 67 percent, although most values fell in the 50-60 percent interval. They are currently considered as one of venezuelas most threatened ecosystems, but only 5 percent of extant dry forests are included in protected areas; this represents 0.5 percent of their potential extent. It is fundamental to promote the creation of at least 3 or 4 more large protected areas (ca 5000 ha), with different climatic and orographic characteristics, in combination with the recovery of threatened species, the restoration of degraded systems, and the implementation of sustainable development projects. Their apparent high resilience suggests Chat with the proper management we call restore and maintain the integrity of Venezuelan dry forests.

AB The endemic Hawaiian grouper, Epinephelus quernus, is a commercially important species experiencing intense fishing pressure in part of its distributional range. We examined population genetic structure with 398 base pairs of the mitochondrial control region across a large portion of the range of E. quernus, spanning approximately 2000 km of the Hawaiian archipelago. Examination of genetic diversity shows that Gardner Island, situated midway along the island chain, harbours the most diverse haplotypes. F-statistics and Bayesian estimates of migration also reveal the mid-archipelago as genetically differentiated, where the first significant break among adjacent pairs of populations lies between the islands of Nihoa and Necker. Most island comparisons beyond Necker and Gardner to the northwest and among the lower five islands to the south-east show little to no genetic differences. Evidence of historical population expansion across the islands was also found by Maximum Likelihood analyses. The results suggest that management should be structured to reflect the genetic differentiation and diversity in the mid-archipelago, the patterns of which may be associated with oceanic current patterns.

AB Ecological niches are crucial for species coexistence and diversification, but the niche concept has been underutilized in studying the roles of pollinators in plant evolution and reproduction. Pollination niches can be objectively characterized using pollinator traits, abundance, and distributions, as well as network topology. We review evidence that floral traits represent adaptations to pollination niches, where tradeoffs in trait deployment reinforce niche specialization. In turn, specialized pollination niches potentially increase speciation rates, foster species coexistence, and constrain species range limits. By linking studies of adaptation with those on speciation and coexistence, the pollination niche provides an organizing principle for research on plant reproduction, and conceptually unites these studies with fields of biology where the niche perspective is already firmly established.

AB Understanding and predicting biological invasions is challenging because of the complexity of many interacting players. A holistic approach is needed with the potential to simultaneously consider all relevant effects and effectors. Using networks to describe the relevant anthropogenic and ecological factors, from community-level to global scales, promises advances in understanding aspects of invasion from propagule pressure, through establishment, spread, and ecological impact of invaders. These insights could lead to development of new tools for prevention and management of invasions that are based on species' network characteristics and use of networks to predict the ecological effects of invaders. Here, we review the findings from network ecology that show the most promise for invasion biology and identify pressing needs for future research.

AB Large-scale declines in bee abundance and species richness over the last decade have sounded an alarm, given the crucial pollination services that bees provide. Population dips have specifically been noted for both managed and feral bee species. The simultaneous increased cultivation of bee-dependent agricultural crops has given rise to additional concern. As a result, there has been a surge in scientific research investigating the potential stressors impacting bees. A group of environmental and anthropogenic stressors negatively impacting bees has been isolated. Habitat destruction has diminished the availability of bee floral resources and nest habitats, while massive monoculture plantings have limited bee access to a variety of pollens and nectars. The rapid spread and increased resistance buildup of various bee parasites, pathogens, and pests to current control methods are implicated in deteriorating bee health. Similarly, many pesticides that are widely applied on agricultural crops and within beehives are toxic to bees. The global distribution of honey bee colonies (including queens with attendant bees) and bumble bee colonies from crop to crop for pollination events has been linked with increased pathogen stress and increased competition with native bee species for limited resources. Climatic alterations have disrupted synchronous bee emergence with flower blooming and reduced the availability of diverse floral resources, leading to bee physiological adaptations. Interactions amongst multiple stressors have created colossal maladies hitting bees at one time, and in some cases delivering additive impacts. Initiatives including the development of wild flower plantings and assessment of pesticide toxicity to bees have been undertaken in efforts to ameliorate current bee declines. In this review, recent findings regarding the impact of these stressors on bees and strategies for mitigating them are discussed.

AB This review provides an overview and integration of the use of resilience concepts to guide natural resources management actions. We emphasize ecosystems and landscapes and provide examples of the use of these concepts from empirical research in applied ecology. We begin with a discussion of definitions and concepts of ecological resilience and related terms that are applicable to management. We suggest that a resilience-based framework for management facilitates regional planning by providing the ability to locate management actions where they will have the greatest benefits and determine effective management strategies. We review the six key components of a resilience-based framework, beginning with managing for adaptive capacity and selecting an appropriate spatial extent and grain. Critical elements include developing an understanding of the factors influencing the general and ecological resilience of ecosystems and landscapes, the landscape context and spatial resilience, pattern and process interactions and their variability, and relationships among ecological and spatial resilience and the capacity to support habitats and species. We suggest that a spatially explicit approach, which couples geospatial information on general and spatial resilience to disturbance with information on resources, habitats, or species, provides the foundation for resilience-based management. We provide a case study from the sagebrush biome that illustrates the use of geospatial information on ecological and spatial resilience for prioritizing management actions and determine effective strategies.

AB Cities tend to be built in areas of high biodiversity, and the accelerating pace of urbanization threatens the persistence of many species and ecological communities globally. However, urban environments also offer unique prospects for biological conservation, with multiple benefits for humans and other species. We present seven ecological principles to conserve and increase the biodiversity of cities, using metaphors to bridge the gap between the languages of built-environment and conservation professionals. We draw upon John Ruskin's famous essay on the seven lamps of architecture, but more generally on the thinking of built-environment pioneers such as Patrick Geddes (1854-1932) who proposed a synoptic view of the urban environment that included humans and non-humans alike. To explain each principle or 'lamp' of urban biodiversity, we use an understanding from the built-environment disciplines as a base and demonstrate through metaphor that planning for the more-than-human does not require a conceptual leap. We conclude our discussion with ten practical strategies for turning on these lamps in cities. Urban planners, architects, landscape architects, engineers and other built-environmental professionals have a key role to play in a paradigm shift to plan for the more-than-human, because of their direct influence on the evolving urban environment. This essay is intended to increase dialogue between ecologists and members of these professions, and thus increase the biodiversity of cities around the world.

AB The ability to directly monitor animal populations across time and space is a key element of wildlife conservation and management, but logistically difficult to achieve. Photographic capture rates from camera trap surveys can provide relative abundance indices (RAIs) for a wide variety of medium- to large-bodied wildlife species. RAIs are less complex than other estimation methods and are commonly used when true abundance is difficult or costly to measure. However, this method is controversial as it does not account for potential bias arising from imperfect detection. Here, we evaluate the reliability and precision of RAI estimates drawn from a large-scale camera trap survey for ten African herbivore species by comparing them against preexisting aerial survey data. RAIs correlated strongly with independent estimates, particularly when indices were derived from counts of all photographed animals. RAIs were most reliable for species that were nonmigratory, occurred in open habitats and had high rates of daily movement. Increasing survey coverage and duration both had strong but comparable effects on improving RAI precision. Our results suggest that RAIs from camera traps hold substantial promise as a tool for monitoring herbivore relative abundances, and we provide guidelines on the utility of this approach for ecological inference.

AB Context Climate change will have diverse and interacting effects on forests over the next century. One of the most pronounced effects may be a decline in resistance to chronic change and resilience to acute disturbances. The capacity for forests to persist and/or adapt to climate change remains largely unknown, in part because there is not broad agreement how to measure and apply resilience concepts.
   Objectives We assessed the interactions of climate change, resistance, resilience, diversity, and alternative management of northern Great Lake forests.
   Methods We simulated two landscapes (northern Minnesota and northern lower Michigan), three climate futures (current climate, a low emissions trajectory, and a high emissions trajectory), and four management regimes [business as usual, expanded forest reserves, modified silviculture, and climate suitable planting (CSP)]. We simulated each scenario with a forest landscape simulation model. We assessed resistance as the change in species composition over time. We assessed resilience and calculated an index of resilience that incorporated both recovery of pre-fire tree species composition and above-ground biomass within simulated burned areas.
   Results Results indicate a positive relationship between diversity and resistance within low diversity areas. Simulations of the high emission climate future resulted in a decline in both resistance and resilience.
   Conclusions Of the management regimes, the CSP regime resulted in some of the greatest resilience under climate change although our results suggest that differences in forest management are largely outweighed by the effects of climate change. Our results provide a framework for assessing resistance and resilience relevant and valuable to a broad array of ecological systems.

AB AimTo discover and evaluate potential dispersal barriers across the Indo-West Pacific Ocean and to develop spatially explicit hypotheses regarding the location of barriers and their capacity to filter taxa. Additionally, to compare model predictions with previously described barriers and build a more thorough understanding of the region's biogeographic patterns.
   LocationThe reefs of the Indo-West Pacific Ocean, from 100 to 170 degrees E and from 30 degrees N to 30 degrees S.
   MethodsA biophysical larval dispersal model was used to quantify over 800,000 dispersal kernels by simulating 99 model taxa. Spatial analysis was used to map emergent patterns of potential multispecies population connectivity and predict geographic locations and strength of concordant dispersal barriers across the seascape.
   ResultsAlthough individual taxa varied in their predicted fine-scale population connectivity, there was consistency in the location of dispersal barriers. Across all trait combinations, reproductive output (fecundity and density of reproductive adults), reproductive strategy (spawning phenology) and the length of the larval dispersal phase determined the strength of barriers across the seascape. More than 80% of the previously described marine boundaries in the region were predicted to restrict the dispersal of at least 10% of the simulated taxa. The location and strength of many additional multitaxa barriers were described at scales <200km.
   Main conclusionsThe geographic structure of many previously described multispecies barriers across the Indo-West Pacific were predicted with the biophysical dispersal model and spatial analysis. The permeability of individual dispersal barriers was primarily determined by reproductive output, spawning phenology and the length of the pelagic larval stage. Across all dispersal barriers analysed, Euclidean distance explained up to 49% of the variation in barrier strength.

AB Natural ecosystems have experienced widespread degradation due to human activities. Consequently, enhancing resilience has become a primary objective for conservation. Nature reserves are a favored management tool, but we need clearer empirical tests of whether they can impart resilience. Catastrophic flooding in early 2011 impacted coastal ecosystems across eastern Australia. We demonstrate that marine reserves enhanced the capacity of coral reefs to withstand flood impacts. Reserve reefs resisted the impact of perturbation, whilst fished reefs did not. Changes on fished reefs were correlated with the magnitude of flood impact, whereas variation on reserve reefs was related to ecological variables. Herbivory and coral recruitment are critical ecological processes that underpin reef resilience, and were greater in reserves and further enhanced on reserve reefs near mangroves. The capacity of reserves to mitigate external disturbances and promote ecological resilience will be critical to resisting an increased frequency of climate-related disturbance.

AB Although long-distance transport of marine organisms is constrained by numerous oceanic and biological factors, some species have evolved life-histories reliant on such movements. We examine the factors that promote long-distance transport in a transoceanic migrant, young loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), from the southeastern U.S. Empirical data from near-surface buoys and simulations in two ocean circulation models indicated that passive drifters are often retained for long periods shoreward of oceanic fronts that delineate coastal and offshore waters. Further simulations revealed that offshore swimming aided newly hatched turtles in moving past fronts and increased turtles' probability of survival, reaching distant foraging grounds, and encountering favorable temperatures. Swimming was most beneficial in regions that were more favorable under scenarios assuming passive drift. These results have broad implications for understanding the movement processes of many marine species, highlighting likely retention of more planktonic species and potential for dispersal in more nektonic species.

AB P>1. Movement pathways of individuals can be shaped by heterogeneity in the dispersal environment that separates origin and destination patches. However, effects of the dispersal environment on the phenotype (or future fitness) of dispersers is poorly known; individual experiences during dispersal may have latent effects on the performance or persistence of later life-stages.
   2. We evaluated such 'legacy effects' for dispersing reef fish larvae using (i) otolith (ear stone) microchemistry to characterize two distinct dispersal pathways and (ii) otolith microstructure to estimate 'larval quality' (a composite of five measured larval phenotypes). We conducted a reciprocal transplant field experiment to evaluate selective mortality after dispersal as a function of larval quality. We conducted longitudinal sampling of natural cohorts of reef fish through to adulthood to quantify shifts in the distribution of larval quality in local populations.
   3. We found the quality of dispersers to be variable and determined by their experience in the larval dispersal environment. Larval quality of successful dispersers predicted their subsequent survival after dispersal in reciprocal transplant experiments. Longitudinal sampling was consistent with short-term field experiments, and revealed that survivors to adulthood were disproportionately comprised of high quality larval dispersers.
   4. Overall, our results suggest that conditions in the dispersal environment shape future fitness of individuals after successful dispersal, and that this can indirectly mediate dispersal patterns and connectivity in a metapopulation.

AB Restoring native plant communities on sites formerly occupied by invasive nitrogen-fixing species poses unique problems due to elevated soil nitrogen availability. Mitigation practices that reduce available nitrogen may ameliorate this problem. We evaluated the effects of tree removal followed by soil preparation or mulching on native plant growth and soil nitrogen transformations in a pine-oak system formerly occupied by exotic nitrogen-fixing Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) trees. Greenhouse growth experiments with native grasses, Andropogon gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, showed elevated relative growth rates in soils from Black locust compared with pine-oak stands. Field soil nutrient concentrations and rates of net nitrification and total net N-mineralization were compared 2 and 4 years since Black locust removal and in control sites. Although soil nitrogen concentrations and total net N-mineralization rates in the restored sites were reduced to levels that were similar to paired pine-oak stands after only 2 years, net nitrification rates remained 3-34 times higher in the restored sites. Other nutrient ion concentrations (Ca, Mg) and organic matter content were reduced, whereas phosphorus levels remained elevated in restored sites. Thus, 2-4 years following Black locust tree removal and soil horizon mixing achieved through site preparation, the concentrations of many soil nutrients returned to preinvasion levels. However, net nitrification rates remained elevated; cover cropping or carbon addition during restoration of sites invaded by nitrogen fixers could increase nitrogen immobilization and/or reduce nitrate availability, making sites more amenable to native plant establishment.

   MECHANISM; NITROGEN; AMERICA; HAWAII; SHADE
AB Quantitative studies are necessary to determine whether invasive plant species displace natives and reduce local biodiversity, or if they increase local biodiversity. Here we describe the effects of invasion by Norway maple Acer platanoides on riparian plant communities and tree regeneration at two different scales (individual tree vs stand scales) in western Montana, USA, using both descriptive and experimental approaches. The three stands differed in community composition with the stand most dominated by A. platanoides invasion being more compositionally homogenous, and less species rich (-67%), species even (-40%), and diverse (-75%) than the two other stands. This sharp decrease in community richness and diversity of the highly invaded stand, relative to the other stands, corresponded with a 28-fold increase in A. platanoides seedlings and saplings. The dramatic difference between stand 1 vs 2 and 3 suggests that A. platanoides invasion is associated with a dramatic change in community composition and local loss of species diversity; however, other unaccounted for differences between stands may be the cause. These whole-stand correlations were corroborated by community patterns under individual A. platanoides trees in a stand with intermediate levels of patchy invasion. At the scale of individual A. platanoides canopies within a matrix of native trees, diversity and richness of species beneath solitary A. platanoides trees declined as the size of the trees increased. These decreases in native community properties corresponded with an increase in the density of A. platanoides seedlings. The effect of A. platanoides at the stand scale was more dramatic than at the individual canopy scale; however, at this smaller scale we only collected data from the stand with intermediate levels of invasion and not from the stand with high levels of invasion. Transplant experiments with tree seedlings demonstrated that A. platanoides seedlings performed better when grown beneath conspecific canopies than under natives, but Populus and Pinus seedlings performed better when grown beneath Populus canopies, the dominant native. Our results indicate that A. platanoides trees suppress most native species, including the regeneration of the natural canopy dominants, but facilitate conspecifics in their understories.

AB In Kajiado District, Kenya, ranches held communally by Maasai are being subdivided into individually owned parcels. Livestock owners know that herds on parcels that are too small cannot be viable, but the decline in the capacity of parcels to support livestock has not been quantified. We used ecosystem modeling to represent the effects of subdivision as Maasai group ranches were divided into 196, 10, 5, 3, and 1 km(2) parcels. Within the spatially explicit, process-based SAVANNA ecosystem model, we used maps that constrained the movements of livestock to be within parcels. We also modeled cooperative grazing associations, giving groups of herders access to parcels composed of dispersed or contiguous 1 km 2 parcels. Vegetatively productive areas had higher carrying capacities when isolated because resident animals did not compete with animals moving in seasonally from other areas. In a ranch of low but heterogeneous productivity, we saw a steady decline in capacity under subdivision, until 25% fewer livestock could be supported on the ranch of 1 km(2) parcels relative to the intact ranch. On a ranch with both low productivity and heterogeneity, 20% fewer livestock were supported when parcels were still 10 km(2). The most productive ranch studied saw small population changes with subdivision. Participation in grazing associations was helpful in the ranch intermediate in productivity and heterogeneity, but not other ranches. Subdivision of Kajiado lands might be inevitable, but our results show the relative benefits to stakeholders if land owners and policy makers act to maintain open or flexible access to individually held parcels.

AB In evolutionary time frames, grazing by domesticated livestock on the short grass plains of East Africa is a new occurrence resulting in increased animal densities year around and modification to annual timing of grazing. We addressed the following questions: (1) do plant species diversity and vegetation structural differences exist between an area that is grazed only during the wet season and an adjacent area that is grazed year around; and, (2) does plant species diversity and structure correlate temporally with density of grazers? A spatially explicit ecosystem model was used to determine grazer densities. The two areas were similar with respect to grazer density during the wet season but not in the dry season. Dry season grazer densities were solely due to the presence of domesticated livestock. No significant differences in plant species diversity (H'), evenness, or richness were found between the two areas. However, the relative abundance of forbs, shrubs, percent cover of shrubs and bare ground was positively correlated with grazer densities during the dry season. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB From January 2000 through December 2002, focal plant censuses were carried out to assess monthly leaf, flower, and ripe fruit presence for 423 individual plants (96 plant species, 39 families) within the littoral forest of Sainte Luce, Madagascar. Fruit-on-trail counts were conducted additionally in 2000 to allow comparison between both phenological methods. Despite low climatic seasonality and the absence of a dry season in the littoral forest, interannual phenological patterns were seasonal. Within year variability was present with clear periods of abundance and scarcity. All phenophases were highly intercorrelated and peaked from November through February. This was found in other humid Malagasy forests as well, while in dry Malagasy forests phenophases were separated in time perhaps due to the more seasonal climate. Temperature and day length seemed to influence all phenophases, the latter showing the strongest effect, while rainfall was only weekly associated with flushing and flowering. Differences in the presence of ripe fruits when comparing between sampling methods can be explained by the differential contribution of several life forms.

AB Isla Victoria (Nahuel Huapi National Park, Argentina), a large island dominated by native Nothofagus and Austrocedrus forest, has old plantations of many introduced tree species, some of which are famed invaders of native ecosystems elsewhere. There are also large populations of introduced deer and shrubs that may interact in a complex way with the introduced trees, as well as a recently arrived population of wild boar. Long-standing concern that the introduced trees will invade and transform native forest may be unwarranted, as there is little evidence of progressive invasion, even close to the plantations, despite over 50 years of opportunity. Introduced and native shrubs allow scattered introduced trees to achieve substantial size in abandoned pastures, but in almost all areas neither the trees nor the shrubs appear to be spreading beyond these sites. These shrub communities may be stable rather than successional, but the technology for restoring them to native forest is uncertain and probably currently impractical. Any attempt to remove the exotic tree seedlings and saplings from native forest would probably create the very conditions that would favor colonization by exotic plants rather than native trees, while simply clear-cutting the plantations would be unlikely to lead to regeneration of Nothofagus or Austrocedrus. The key to maintaining native forest is preventing catastrophic fire, as several introduced trees and shrubs would be favored over native dominant trees in recolonization. Deer undoubtedly interact with both native and introduced trees and shrubs, but their net effect on native forest is not yet clear, and specific management of deer beyond the current hunting by staff is unwarranted, at least if preventing tree invasion is the goal. The steep terrain and shallow soil make the recently arrived boar a grave threat to the native forest. Eradication is probably feasible and should be attempted quickly.

AB Grasslands worldwide have been invaded by woody species during the last 200 years. Atmospheric CO(2) enrichment may indirectly have facilitated invasion by reducing soil water depletion by grasses. We used a two-step correlative approach to test this hypothesis with the invasive and native shrub honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr. var. glandulosa). 1) Water content to 0.15 m depth was measured in grassland exposed to a CO(2) gradient from 200 to 550 mumol/mol to evaluate the prediction that CO(2) enrichment lessens soil water depletion by grasses. 2) Soil water content and emergence and survival of mesquite seedlings were measured in adjacent grassland plots from which grass roots were excluded to 0.15 m depth to reduce water depletion or that were irrigated to increase soil water levels. With these measurements, we tested the hypothesis that mesquite establishment is limited by water. Excluding grass roots doubled emergence of mesquite and almost tripled the fraction of emergent seedlings that survived for 12 weeks following the first of two plantings. Seedlings were taller, heavier, and had greater leaf area when grown without grass roots. Root exclusion did not measurably affect soil water during the 3-week period of seedling emergence, but soil water content over the 12 weeks that seedling survival was studied was higher in plots from which grass roots were excluded and following an April than May planting. Survivorship of mesquite seedlings correlated positively with soil water content. Percentage survival of seedlings increased from 1.5% to 15% and 28% at the soil water content measured in grassland exposed to CO(2) concentrations of 270 (preindustrial), 360 (current), and 550 mumol/mol (future), respectively. We infer that recent and projected increases in atmospheric CO(2) concentration may be large enough to increase establishment of invading mesquite seedlings in grasslands that are severely water-limited.

ID GASTROPODA; AMMONOIDS; ACMAEIDAE; PREDATION
AB New data contradict the mosasaur-bite hypothesis for the origin of holes seen in Placenticeras ammonites from the Late Cretaceous Pierre Shale and Bearpaw Formation of the western interior of North America. Observations of a limpet-infested Placenticeras ammonite and of several Placenticeras specimens with radular scratch marks reveal that the limpets dwelled on floating ammonites, and their homing activity produced circular depressions. When altered during diagenesis, the depressions mimic tooth punctures. Crushing experiments on fresh Nautilus shells using a mosasaur robot show that mosasaur bites could not have produced holes resembling those in the fossils. Furthermore, sectioning of "bitten" ammonites reveals that sepia are sometimes intact under the holes, an observation irreconcilable,vith penetration by a tooth. We present an alternative interpretation that the alleged "bite marks" in Placenticeras ammonites are really limpet home scars that were altered after burial. While predation of mosasaurs on ammonites remains a possibility, it would have to be demonstrated by other criteria. Our findings do not support mosasaur-ammonoid coevolution in the Late Cretaceous.

AB Development of mineral resources and the increasing mining waste emissions have created a series of environmental and health-related issues. Nowadays, the ecological restoration of mining tailings has become one of the urgent tasks for mine workers and environmental engineers all over the world. Aim of the present paper is to highlight the previous restoration techniques and the challenges encountered during the restoration of mine tailings. As it is a common practice that, before restoring of tailings, the site should be evaluated carefully. Studies showed that the mine tailings' adverse properties, including excessive heavy metal concentration, acidification, improper pH value, salinization and alkalization, poor physical structure and inadequate nutrition, etc., are the major challenges of their restoration. Generally, four restoration technologies, including physical, chemical, phytoremediation, and bioremediation, are used to restore the mining tailings. The working mechanism, advantages, and disadvantages of these techniques are described in detail. In addition, selection of the suitable restoration techniques can largely be carried out by considering both the economic factors and time required. Furthermore, the ecosystem restoration is perceived to be a more promising technology for mine tailings. Therefore, this extensive review can act as a valuable reference for the researchers involved in mine tailing restoration.

AB The application of remote sensing in biodiversity estimation has largely relied on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The NDVI exploits spectral information from red and near infrared bands of Landsat images and it does not consider canopy background conditions hence it is affected by soil brightness which lowers its sensitivity to vegetation. As such NDVI may be insufficient in explaining tree species diversity. Meanwhile, the Landsat program also collects essential spectral information in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region which is related to plant properties. The study was intended to: (i) explore the utility of spectral information across Landsat-8 spectrum using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and estimate alpha diversity (alpha-diversity) in the savannah woodland in southern Africa, and (ii) define the species diversity index (Shannon (H'), Simpson (D-2) and species richness (S) - defined as number of species in a community) that best relates to spectral variability on the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager dataset. We designed 90 m x 90 m field plots (n = 71) and identified all trees with a diameter at breast height (DbH) above 10 cm. H', D-2 and S were used to quantify tree species diversity within each plot and the corresponding spectral information on all Landsat-8 bands were extracted from each field plot. A stepwise linear regression was applied to determine the relationship between species diversity indices (H', D-2 and S) and Principal Components (PCs), vegetation indices and Gray Level Co occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture layers with calibration (n = 46) and test (n = 23) datasets. The results of regression analysis showed that the Simple Ratio Index derivative had a higher relationship with H', D-2 and S (r(2) = 0.36; r(2) = 0.41; r(2) = 0.24 respectively) compared to NDVI, EVI, SAVI or their derivatives. Moreover the Landsat-8 derived PCs also had a higher relationship with H' and D-2 (r(2) of 0.36 and 0.35 respectively) than the frequently used NDVI, and this was attributed to the utilization of the entire spectral content of Landsat-8 data. Our results indicate that: (i) the measurement scales of vegetation indices impact their sensitivity to vegetation characteristics and their ability to explain tree species diversity; (ii) principal components enhance the utility of Landsat-8 spectral data for estimating tree species diversity and (iii) species diversity indices that consider both species richness and abundance (H' and D-2) relates better with Landsat-8 spectral variables.

AB Savanna vegetation is characterized by tree-grass co-existence that can experience intense water limitation, yet the water relations of these savanna plants are poorly understood. We examined the water sources for trees and grasses in different seasons and investigated the importance of hydraulic redistribution in three tree species inhabiting a semi-arid savanna in South Africa. We used natural variation in H and O stable isotope composition of source waters to identify the principal water sources for these plants. We conducted an experiment by labelling deep-soil (2.5-m depth) with a deuterium tracer. Seasonal differences in the stable isotope composition of water in trees and grasses indicated that there was water-source use partitioning as well as overlap. Trees and grasses used water from the topsoil after rainfall indicating overlap of water-source use. All tree species shifted to groundwater or subsoil water use when there was no water in the topsoil indicating partitioning of water use. Grasses always used water from the topsoil. The seasonal changes in water-source use by trees and grasses indicated possible shifts in tree-grass interactions during different periods of the year. The tracer experiment confirmed hydraulic redistribution in all the three tree species and water transfer to grasses via the topsoil. However, this occurred only in the dry season. Our observations and experimental results indicate the potential for facilitation effects by trees to their understory grasses and show that dry season hydraulic redistribution from trees to grasses could be an important facilitative mechanism maintaining tree-grass co-existence in savannas.

AB This paper reviews the socio-economic, ecological, and conservation experiences during the establishment of Marine Reserves (no-take Marine Protected Areas (MPA)) in New Zealand in an international context. Once operational, reserves became popular with the public and provided economic benefits. In one reserve, 'spill-over' of lobsters counter-balanced lost fishing. The reserves provided the control sites that showed the effects of fishing on ecosystems through depleted populations and habitat change due to trophic cascades. Studies in other countries indicated that these trophic cascades were common globally. Research showed reserves protect benthic and pelagic species, including those that move outside the reserves. These findings benefited from reserves having a map of seabed habitats and data on the relative abundance of species of ecological importance. Information on other species (e.g. macro-invertebrates), and previous and nearby fishing effort over time, may have provided additional insights.
   Marine Reserves can provide benefits to (1) conservation of species and habitats, (2) science as controls for fishing effects, and (3) fisheries as reference sites that conserve natural genetic and population structure, host brood-stock, and provide spill-over to nearby fisheries. They should be distributed geographically in networks that include replicated examples of habitats and species. To do so, they need to be suitably located, large enough, and enforced to fulfil these opportunities. However, these benefits remain limited by the relatively small area occupied by Marine Reserves within and between countries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Resilient socio-ecological systems (SESs) can handle negative environmental changes well without regime shifts. In this study, we introduce the concept of spatial resilience and apply it to the assessment, planning, and ecosystem-based management of the urban wetland interface in the Taihu Lake watershed in China. From the assumption that spatial indicators in patterns and processes affect SES resilience, spatial resilience in this case focuses on the importance of ecological sensitivity, water quality, and vegetation cover. We consider two criteria in this study, protection and recovery, which are further categorized into general and specific types, to examine four resilience scenarios, namely, key protection, general protection, general recovery, and key recovery. Spatial resilience is assessed with an indicator-based system, multi-criteria evaluation method, and spatial visualization based on a geographic information system (GIS) to create zones. Spatial zonings are evaluated in the context of different degrees of spatial resilience. Results are integrated with indicators of ecological sensitivity, water quality and vegetation cover, are assessed to determine the practical application of spatial resilience. Zoning maps that show water quality, vegetation cover, and corresponding plans are generated on the basis of spatial resilience assessment, social indicators, and the existing administrative region. These maps can be used by authorities in protection or restoration activities for ecological services in wetlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Top predators significantly impact ecosystem dynamics and act as important indicator species for ecosystem health. However, reliable density estimates for top predators, considered necessary for the development of management plans and ecosystem monitoring, are challenging to obtain. This study aims to establish baseline density estimates for two top predators, spotted hyena and lion, in the Okavango Delta in northern Botswana. Using calling stations, we surveyed free-ranging populations of the two species and investigated methodological variables that might influence results about distributions and densities, including habitat type, seasonality, and different types of playback sounds. Calling stations were distributed over a survey area of approximately 1,800 km(2) characterized by three major habitat types: mopane woodland, floodplain and mixed acacia sandveld. Results indicate spotted hyenas were evenly distributed independent of habitat type and season throughout the survey area with an overall density estimate of 14.4 adults/100 km(2). In contrast, lion distribution and density varied significantly with habitat and season. Lion density in the prey-poor mopane woodland was near zero, while in the comparatively prey-rich floodplains it was estimated at 23.1 individuals/100 km(2) resulting in a weighted average density of 5.8 individuals/100 km(2) across the entire study area. In testing the effect of varying playback sounds we found that both species were significantly more likely to respond to calls of conspecifics. Our results show how several methodological variables may influence density estimates and emphasize the importance of standardized calling-station survey methods to allow consistent replication of surveys and comparison of results that can be used for landscape-scale monitoring of large predator species.

AB Conservation of the unique biodiversity of mountain ecosystems needs trans-disciplinary approaches to succeed in a crowded colloquial world. Geographers, conservationists, ecologists and social scientists have, in the past, had the same conservation goals but have tended to work independently. In this review, the need to integrate different conservation criteria and methodologies is discussed. New criteria are offered for prioritizing species and habitats for conservation in montane ecosystems that combine both ecological and social data.
   Ecological attributes of plant species, analysed through robust community statistical packages, provide unbiased classifications of species assemblages and environmental biodiversity gradients and yield importance value indices (IVIs). Surveys of local communities utilization of the vegetation provides use values (UVs). This review suggests a new means of assessing anthropogenic pressure on plant biodiversity at both species and community levels by integrating IVI and UV data sets in a combined analysis.
   Mountain ecosystems are hot spots for plant conservation efforts because they hold a high overall plant diversity as communities replace each other along altitudinal and climatic gradients, including a high proportion of endemic species. This review contributes an enhanced understanding of (1) plant diversity in mountain ecosystems with special reference to the western Himalayas; (2) ethnobotanical and ecosystem service values of mountain vegetation within the context of anthropogenic impacts; and (3) local and regional plant conservation strategies and priorities.

AB Several factors lead to expectations that the scale of larval dispersal and population connectivity of marine animals differs with latitude. We examine this expectation for demersal shorefishes, including relevant mechanisms, assumptions and evidence. We explore latitudinal differences in (i) biological (e. g. species composition, spawning mode, pelagic larval duration, PLD), (ii) physical (e. g. water movement, habitat fragmentation), and (iii) biophysical factors (primarily temperature, which could strongly affect development, swimming ability or feeding). Latitudinal differences exist in taxonomic composition, habitat fragmentation, temperature and larval swimming, and each difference could influence larval dispersal. Nevertheless, clear evidence for latitudinal differences in larval dispersal at the level of broad faunas is lacking. For example, PLD is strongly influenced by taxon, habitat and geographical region, but no independent latitudinal trend is present in published PLD values. Any trends in larval dispersal may be obscured by a lack of appropriate information, or use of 'off the shelf' information that is biased with regard to the species assemblages in areas of concern. Biases may also be introduced from latitudinal differences in taxa or spawning modes as well as limited latitudinal sampling. We suggest research to make progress on the question of latitudinal trends in larval dispersal.

AB Questions How can existing vegetation classifications be updated when new plot data are obtained? Can we use the properties of plots classed as outliers to identify gaps in our understanding of vegetation patterns and so direct future enquiry?
   Location New Zealand.
   Methods We updated a pre-existing classification of New Zealand's forests and shrublands based on a nationally representative data set (1177 plots) by using 12 374 additional plot records from New Zealand's National Vegetation Survey Databank (NVS). We resampled the NVS plot records to remove uneven representation along floristic and geographic gradients. To update the classification at the alliance level, we first cast the original classification into the fuzzy classification framework of Noise Clustering and then discarded original types with low plot numbers and high compositional variation. We then used the plot records that could not be assigned to any original alliance to define new alliances, while retaining the original alliances as fixed elements. We also defined vegetation associations to create a classification at a lower level of abstraction and related it to the classification at the alliance level. Finally, we determined whether known rare types were represented among the new vegetation types and characterized plot records classed as outliers.
   Results After casting the 24 original alliances in the NC framework, we discarded seven. We extended the 17 remaining alliances with 12 new ones and defined 79 associations. All 12 new alliances had extents <120 986 ha, which is smaller than the original alliances, and included rare types that were known to exist but could not be defined using the objectively sampled data set underpinning the original classification. Plot records classed as outliers tended to occur at lower altitudes or in successional shrublands. Further sampling is required to adequately define vegetation types in such situations, although composition may be inherently erratic in successional shrublands.
   Conclusions Our analysis illustrates the application of a fuzzy classification framework at a national scale and provides a model for others wishing to extend and update vegetation classifications. Our approach allows rare community types to be defined and identifies portions of compositional and geographic gradients that are poorly documented.

AB Questions What are the geographic patterns of ?-diversity of aquatic plants and what are the main driving factors? Are richness trends for aquatic plants similar to total plant richness? Is the Mediterranean area a hot spot for aquatic plants? Location Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Material We listed vascular aquatic plant presence or absence for 44 countries. We also compiled total plant species richness and geographic and environmental variables for each country. Methods We first analysed country ordination based on their aquatic flora constrained by environmental variables (dbRDA), and selected the environmental variables best explaining species patterns (BEST analysis). Total species richness patterns were studied using maps and latitudinal gradients. We used generalized additive models (GAM) to detect the main environmental factors driving species richness, both for aquatic plants and total plants. Results The BEST analysis identified a single variable that best explains aquatic plant species distribution: evapotranspiration. However, richness of aquatic plants vs latitude varies and no clear trend was observed. No relation was found between total plant and aquatic plant richness. Aquatic and total plant richness peak between 40 degrees and 50 degrees N, and values were intermediate at low latitudes. GAM related aquatic plant richness with water resources and rainfall, while total plant richness is mainly driven by evapotranspiration and temperature. Hydrophytes were relatively more abundant at higher latitudes than helophytes and the ratio correlated with evapotranspiration. Conclusion Southern and western Europe hold the highest aquatic plant diversity, although no clear latitudinal species richness patterns were found. Aquatic plant richness is mainly driven by water-related variables. Total plant richness exhibits a latitudinal pattern influenced by the Sahara desert, which depresses richness at low latitudes. Best predictors of total plant richness patterns are waterenergy variables.

AB 1. In migratory populations, the degree of fidelity and dispersal among seasonal ranges is an important population process with consequences for demography, management, sensitivity to habitat change and adaptation to local environmental conditions.
   2. Characterizing patterns of range fidelity in ungulates, however, has remained challenging because of the difficulties of following large numbers of marked individuals across multiple migratory cycles and of identifying the appropriate scale of analysis.
   3. We examined fidelity to wet season (i.e. breeding) ranges in a recently declining population of wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus Burchell in northern Tanzania across 3 years. We used computer-assisted photographic identification and capture-recapture to characterize return patterns to three wet season ranges that were ecologically discrete and topographically isolated from one another.
   4. Among 2557 uniquely identified adult wildebeest, we observed 150 recaptures across consecutive wet seasons. Between the two migratory subpopulations, the probability of remaining faithful to wet season areas ranged between 0 82 and 1 00. Animals from a non-migratory segment of the population (near Lake Manyara National Park) were rarely observed in other wet season ranges, despite proximity to one of the migratory pathways.
   5. We found no effect of sex on an individuals' probability of switching wet season ranges. However, the breeding status of females in year i had a strong influence on patterns of range selection in year i + 1, with surviving breeders over three times as likely to switch ranges as non-breeders.
   6. Social-group associations between pairs of recaptured animals were random with respect to an individual's wet season range during the previous or forthcoming wet seasons, suggesting that an individual's herd identity during the dry season does not predict wet season range selection.
   7. Examining fidelity and dispersal in terrestrial migrations improves our understanding of the constraints that migrants experience when they face rapid habitat changes or fluctuations in environmental conditions.

AB Questions: Which plant traits consistently respond to grazing in different years and across habitat-related environmental heterogeneity? Does the proposed partial RLQ approach allow partitioning of grazing-related environmental parameters from other environmental and temporal variations? Location: Semi-arid savannas of central Namibia. Methods: We recorded nine quantitative and 12 categorical traits from 87 plant species along grazing gradients in semi-arid Namibian rangelands. We sampled from gradients in different habitat settings in 2 yr with differing total rainfall amounts. We first examined trait-environment relations with RLQ analysis. To remove confounding effects of temporal and habitat-related environmental variation on trait performance, we introduced a novel partial RLQ analysis approach. Furthermore, we used the fourth-corner statistic to quantify and test relations between traits, environmental factors and RLQ axes. Results: Habitats and years had strong influences on trait patterns. After removing environmental variation caused by habitats and years, grazing became the most influential factor on trait responses. Traits negatively correlated with increasing grazing pressure were common to perennial grasses, such as long and entire leaves, anemochorous dispersal and rhizomatous growth. Positively correlated traits were those common to herbaceous, annual plants with a prostrate- creeping habit, compound leaves, high specific leaf area ( SLA) and exo-or endozoochorous dispersal. Some previously acknowledged grazing response traits, like growth form and plant height, were strongly influenced by variations in habitats and years and showed no significant correlation with grazing pressure. Conclusion: We emphasize that some traits that respond to grazing may also vary under different habitat conditions and among years, especially in highly variable environments like semi-arid savannas. When analysing trait-environment relations we recommend using approaches that partition environmental variation, particularly when applying broad sampling schemes at larger geographical scales.

AB The worldwide homogenization of genetic resources used in plantation forestry (primarily Pinus, Eucalypus, Populus and Acacia spp.) together with accelerating rates of human-aided dispersal of exotic pests, is resulting in plantation pests becoming broadly distributed extremely quickly, sometimes reaching a global distribution within a decade. This unprecedented rate of establishment and spread means that the risk associated with new and emerging pests is shared globally. Biological control represents a major component of the strategy to mitigate such risk, but the current efforts and scope for developing such controls are woefully inadequate for dealing with the increasing rates of pest spread. Given the global nature of the problem, biological control would benefit enormously from an international, collaborative focus. Though inherent difficulties and potential pitfalls exist, opportunities for cost-sharing, growth and maintenance of resources and capacity, and more comprehensive research programmes are critical to the long-term success of biological control. Governments and industries will need to increase their strategic investment in structures specifically designed to promote such focus if they are to successfully protect their forest resources.

AB We investigated the type and extent of degradation at three sites on the Agulhas Plain, South Africa: an old field dominated by the alien grass Pennisetum clandestinum Pers. (kikuyu), an abandoned Eucalyptus plantation, and a natural fynbos community invaded by nitrogen fixing-Australian Acacia species. These forms of degradation are representative of many areas in the region. By identifying the nature and degree of ecosystem degradation we aimed to determine appropriate strategies for restoration in this biodiversity hotspot. Vegetation surveys were conducted at degraded sites and carefully selected reference sites. Soil-stored propagule seed banks and macro- and micro-soil nutrients were determined. Species richness, diversity and native cover under Eucalyptus were extremely low compared to the reference site and alterations of the soil nutrients were the most severe. The cover of indigenous species under Acacia did not differ significantly from that in reference sites, but species richness was lower under Acacia and soils were considerably enriched. Native species richness was much lower in the kikuyu site, but soil nutrient status was similar to the reference site. Removal of the alien species alone may be sufficient to re-initiate ecosystem recovery at the kikuyu site, whereas active restoration is required to restore functioning ecosystems dominated by native species in the Acacia thicket and the Eucalyptus plantation. To restore native plant communities we suggest burning, mulching with sawdust and sowing of native species.

AB P>Aggregates and zooplankton may provide refuge for aquatic bacteria against external hazards. The ability of attached bacteria to survive and recover from stressors commonly used for water treatment was tested in the laboratory. Without zooplankton or aggregates, both UV and ozone significantly reduced abundance of free-living bacteria in both freshwater and marine medium. The presence of zooplankton carcasses and aggregates, however, allowed some of the attached bacteria to survive and recover quickly within 3 days. Heat exposure was the least effective as both free-living and attached bacteria were able to recover quickly. Selective survival of bacterial phylotypes led to large changes in bacterial community composition after stress exposures, and some of the bacteria that recovered belonged to groups with known pathogens. This study demonstrates that zooplankton and aggregates protected various aquatic bacteria from external stressors, and organic remains generated from zooplankton and aggregates after stress exposure even enabled the surviving bacteria to quickly regrow and subsequently be released into the surrounding water. Hence, water disinfection treatments that overlooked the potential persistence of bacteria associated with organisms and aggregates may not be effective in preventing the spread of undesirable bacteria.
