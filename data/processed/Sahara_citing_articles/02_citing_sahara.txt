AB 1. Temperate semi-natural grasslands are characterized by high levels of species diversity and have a high conservation value. Plant species diversity in grazed semi-natural grasslands is known to be influenced by management intensity and habitat connectivity. Both grazing pressure and between-patch connectivity are expected to depend on the movement patterns of livestock in the landscape.
   2. The present study examines associations between fine-scale (within 0.25 m(2) plots) plant species diversity in semi-natural grasslands and present grazing intensity, present and historical habitat connectivity, and the (present and historical) distance from the nearest village. The study area was a local (4.5 x 4.5 km) agricultural landscape on the island of Oland, Sweden.
   3. Fine-scale (Shannon) diversity and species richness were unimodally associated with the distance from the nearest historical (ad 1800) village, with maximum values c. 1-1.5 km from villages. These associations suggest that the distance from historical villages behaves as an integrated descriptor of variation in long-termmanagement intensity (livestock movements) and reflects aspects of the functional connectivity between plant communities in semi-natural grasslands.
   4. Groups of variables characterizing village distances, grazing pressure and habitat connectivity had overlapping effects on species diversity. Grazing intensity had the largest individual impact on diversity, followed by the distance from the nearest historical village and present-day habitat connectivity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The study indicates the importance of viewing grassland diversity in the context of local landscape history. Unimodal associations between fine-scale plant species diversity and the distance from the nearest village in ad 1800 suggest that information on the proximity to villages in the historical landscape has a potential use in conservation planning - as an indicator of variation in long-term grassland management intensity. Conservation programmes for grazed temperate grasslands should (1) give priority to old grasslands with an uninterrupted history of grazing management, (2) ensure a moderate grazing intensity, (3) avoid overgrazing and/or long breaks in the continuity of grazing management.

AB This paper is devoted to the investigation of the positivity, stability and control of the solutions of a generalized Beverton-Holt equation arising in population dynamics which is potentially subject to bounded discontinuities at sampling instants due to the harvesting (i.e. fishing/hunting) quota and eventual independent consumption. Other generalizations are that the intrinsic growth rate and the environment carrying capacity gains are allowed to be time-varying sequences. The interpretation of the appearance of discontinuities in the solution is the presence of impulsive terms in the corresponding continuous-time differential equation. The parallel interpretation in ecology is that there are two different recruitment levels at each current sampling time due, firstly, to the evolution of the population driven by its intrinsic growth rate and the environment carrying capacity and, subsequently, a second level arises due to harvesting and independent consumption from the existing spawning stock of the population. The "left" recruitment level occurs immediately before each current sampling time while the "right" one occurs just after related to the sampling period size. By this reason, the mathematical formulation presented distinguishes between "left" and "right" sides of the sampling times. The control actions on the population stock and recruitment might be performed in a direct fashion either through the environment carrying capacity in close habitats gains or the harvesting quota in open air environments. Both actions may be combined in some open air habitats subject to some artificial control. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Almost all metapopulation modelling assumes that connectivity between patches is only a function of distance, and is therefore symmetric. However, connectivity will not depend only on the distance between the patches, as some paths are easy to traverse, while others are difficult. When colonising organisms interact with the heterogeneous landscape between patches, connectivity patterns will invariably be asymmetric. There have been few attempts to theoretically assess the effects of asymmetric connectivity patterns on the dynamics of metapopulations. In this paper we use the framework of complex networks to investigate whether metapopulation. dynamics can be determined by directly analysing the asymmetric connectivity patterns that link the patches. our analyses focus on "patch occupancy" metapopulation models, which only consider whether a patch is occupied or not. We propose three easily calculated network metrics: the "asymmetry" and "average path strength" of the connectivity pattern, and the "centrality" of each patch. Together, these metrics can be used to predict the length of time a metapopulation is expected to persist, and the relative contribution of each patch to a metapopulation's viability. Our results clearly demonstrate the negative effect that asymmetry has on metapopulation persistence. Complex network analyses represent a useful new tool for understanding the dynamics of species existing in fragmented landscapes, particularly those existing in large metapopulations.

AB Although F-ST values are widely used to elucidate population relationships, in some cases, when employing highly polymorphic loci, they should be regarded with caution, particularly when subspecies are under consideration. Tripterygion delaisi presents two subspecies that were investigated here, using 10 microsatellite loci. A Bayesian approach allowed us to clearly identify both subspecies as two different evolutionary significant units. However, low F-ST values were found between subspecies as a consequence of the large number of alleles per locus, while homoplasy could be disregarded as indicated by the standardized genetic distance G'(ST). Heterozygosity saturation was observed in highly polymorphic loci containing more than 15 alleles, and this threshold was used to define two loci pools. The less variable loci pool revealed higher genetic variance between subspecies, while the more variable pool showed higher genetic variance between populations. Furthermore, higher differentiation was also observed between populations using G'(ST) with the more variable loci. Nonetheless, a more reliable population structure within subspecies was obtained when all loci were included in the analyses. In T.d. xanthosoma, isolation by distance was detected between the eight analysed populations, and six genetically homogeneous clusters were inferred by Bayesian analyses that are in accordance with F-ST values. The neighbourhood-size method also indicated rather small dispersal capabilities. In conclusion, in fish with limited adult and larval dispersal capabilities, continuous rocky habitat seems to allow contact between populations and prevent genetic differentiation, while large discontinuities of sand or deep-water channels seems to reduce gene flow.

AB The low rate of new Acacia erioloba seedling establishment in wildlife areas in northern Botswana may be influenced by seed predation, insufficient rainfall for seed germination and seedling establishment or browsing. Mammal and insect predation on A. erioloba pods, seeds, and seedlings were monitored in three wildlife areas to determine the effects on seed germination and seedling survival during 2 drought years followed by 2 years with average rainfall. Although bruchid beetles infested half of the seeds, removal of unripe pods by chacma baboons Papio cynocephalus and vervet monkeys Cercopithecus aethiops was the primary source of seed predation in areas near perennial water sources. The same number of seeds from pods collected under mature A. erioloba trees germinated as seeds from elephant dung when kept in saturated sand; however, seeds from dung began germinating in three days but those from pods did not start germinating until the tenth day. During the drought years, few seedlings emerged and none survived. New seedlings, identified by their cotyledons, emerged in December 1995 after > 100 mm rain over several days, but by mid January, more than half of the seedlings died from dessication. Only 15% of the seedlings remained in June and none survived through the dry season in 1996. Dispersal of more rapidly germinating seeds in elephant dung would be beneficial in sandy semi-arid savannas where sufficient rainfall for seed germination and seedling establishment appears to be rare. These results suggest that while seed predation reduces the number of seeds in the seed bank, inadequate rainfall limits A. erioloba seedling establishment, even during years with average annual rainfall.

AB Diversity relations in Mediterranean heathlands and the understorey of oak woodlands on sandstone-derived substrates were studied at both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar. Trends in species composition and cover were analysed by Detrended Correspondence Analysis; the first axis, assumed to reflect a main environmental gradient, was used to analyse the patterns of three aspects of community diversity. Species richness, i.e. number of species along a 100-m transect, shows a humpbacked trend along the gradient, with the highest values in the understorey of evergreen Quercus suber woodlands, associated with soils of intermediate fertility and moisture status. The number of endemic species is highest in open heathlands, associated with more extreme conditions of acid, infertile soils on exposed ridges. The taxonomic singularity, as measured by the inverse of the average number of species per genus at each site, is highest at the most fertile and moist sites occupied by semideciduous Q. canariensis woodlands.
   A comparison between northern (Spanish) and southern (Moroccan) sides of the Strait of Gibraltar shows a general concordance of the trends of woody plant communities along the main environmental gradient. However, significant differences of the southern samples are: (1) lack of some differential, habitat-specific species and greater abundance of wide spread generalists; and (2) a general reduction in species diversity, number of endemics and taxonomic singularity. We interpret these differences as affected partly by the smaller extent and fragmentation of sandstone areas in the south, and partly by the higher impact of slashing and grazing there.

AB In long-term exposures for 35 d, soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) were maintained in a flow-through suspension of intertidal sediment (100-200 mg.L-1) and in a control treatment of ambient sand-filtered seawater, each with microalgae as a food source.  Weekly measurements demonstrated a significant decrease in oxygen consumption and increase in ammonia excretion through time in the turbidity treatment compared with controls.  Atomic O:N ratios fell to 14 for exposed clams and remained at 27 for controls, suggesting that exposed clams were utilizing body reserves to meet nutritional needs.  Dry tissue weight showed no difference between initial and final values in the presence of suspended sediments, but control animals grew by 43%.  In short-term exposures to 0-2000 mg suspended sediments.L-1, oxygen consumption declined sharply with sediment concentration, suggesting that inhibition of respiration occurred at low values of turbidity.  In further short-term observations, the threshold for the production of pseudofeces was 100-119 mg.L-1.  These results suggest that Mya arenaria copes with increased turbidity by reducing its ventilation rate, a response which provides tolerance to intermittent turbidity, but causes starvation during long-term exposure.

AB The incidence of infections by pathogenic microorganisms, coupled with the experimental manifestation of infections, refers to a regular phenomenon in aquaculture species. A number of environmental changes generally give rise to traumatic scenarios, and activating the transient provocative reactions in the gut normally constitutes a factor to the anatomical and efficient intestinal diseases. These infections have frequently given birth to the momentous economic chaos in aquaculture sector. Putting efforts into resolving this issue, the inclusion of antibiotics in the diets of aquaculture species has been introduced either as growth promoters or the stimulation of the immune system against diseases. Nevertheless, both the fears and discussions of consumers and scientists over the antibiotic-resistant microbes and drug remains in meat have resulted into contentious views concerning the uses of antibiotics. This has resulted into forbidding the use of human antibiotics as growth promotants in the diet of animal since the year 2006 by the European Union; also, subsequent to that, in the year 2013, the United States also initiated a plan for the removal of human antibiotics in the diet as growth promotants. Making use of the prebiotics, synbiotics and probiotics as an alternative has proven as improving not just the growth but also the immunity and maintenance of intestine health of cultured species. They are administered in the feeds of culture species for the purpose of stimulating the good health, safeguarding the intestine against pathogenic microorganisms and reducing the inflammation. In the current investigation, we throw discussion on the present uses, together with the limitations and future directions, the immunomodulatory exploit of probiotics, synbiotics and prebiotics, which triggering directly or enhancing the non-specific immune structure of aquaculture species.

AB Landscape scientists have increasingly studied sustainability during the past three decades, with a plurality of perspectives and methods. However, a comprehensive review of the relevant literature is still lacking. Two concepts capture the core of these studies: sustainable landscapes (SL) and landscape sustainability (LS). Here we present a bibliometric analysis of 333 English papers published in SCI journals (i.e., indexed by Web of Science) during 1990-2017, whose titles, abstracts or keywords contain SL, LS, or both. Using multiple methods, including change-point detection, text and topic mining, and citation analysis, we found: (1) Sustainability studies of landscapes have entered a rapid growth phase since 2004-2006, as determined statistically by the annual publications and citations; (2) There have been many more studies focusing on the ecological and practical dimensions than sociocultural and theoretical dimensions; and (3) Influenced by advances in sustainability research in a broader science context, studies of SL and LS have become increasingly holistic, transdisciplinary, and normative. Our findings suggest that, to further advance landscape sustainability science, scholars need to be more explicit about the underlying sustainability perspective and associated scales of key terms (e.g., SL, LS, and ecosystem services) in specific studies, and need to put more emphasis on place-based case studies of various landscape unsustainability syndromes by integrating the sustainability science-based social-ecological systems and transdisciplinary perspectives.

TI Patterns of among- and within-species variation in heterospecific pollen

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Coflowering plants are at risk for receiving pollen from heterospecifics as well as conspecifics, yet evidence shows wide variation in the degree that heterospecific pollen transfer occurs. Evaluation of patterns and correlates of among-and within-species variation in heterospecific pollen (HP) receipt is key to understanding its importance for floral evolution and species coexistence; however, the rarity of deeply sampled multispecies comparisons has precluded such an evaluation.
   METHODS: We evaluated patterns of among-and within-species variation in HP load size and diversity in 19 species across three distinct plant communities. We assessed the importance of phenotypic specialization (floral phenotype), ecological specialization (contemporary visitor assemblage), and conspecific flower density as determinants of among-species variation. We present hypotheses for different accrual patterns of HP within species based on the evenness and quality of floral visitors and evaluated these by characterizing the relationship between conspecific pollen (CP) and HP receipt.
   KEY RESULTS: We found that within-species variation in HP receipt was greater than among-species and among-communities variation. Among species, ecological generalization emerged as the strongest driver of variation in HP receipt irrespective of phenotypic specialization. Within-species variation in HP load size and diversity was predicted most often from two CP-HP relationships (linear or exponentially decreasing), suggesting that two distinct types of plant-pollinator interactions prevail.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results give important insights into the potential drivers of among-and within-species variation in HP receipt. They also highlight the value of explorations of patterns at the intraspecific level, which can ultimately shed light on plant-pollinator-mediated selection in diverse plant communities.

AB In arid and semi-arid areas such as southern Africa, rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) middens represent an exceptionally valuable source of late Quaternary palaeoenvironmental information. Pollen and stable isotope data derived from two rock hyrax middens extracted from De Rif in the Cederberg Mountains of the southwestern Cape, casts new light on climatic changes that occurred across the Last Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT) and the Holocene (19.5-0.7 cal kBP) and how the region's vegetation responded to these changes. Significant changes in vegetation community composition would be expected in response to environmental changes characteristic of the contrast between 'glacial' and 'interglacial' climates. However, the pollen assemblages in general indicate that mountain fynbos remained dominant throughout the record and that most of the pollen taxa exhibited only muted frequency variations. This finding could be considered to be inconsistent with indications of marked climatic variations recorded in the stable isotope records for the same midden. An analysis of the geological setting and the bioclimatic affinities of the taxa suggest that the explanation for this inconsistency may lie in the dominating influence of sandstone substrates and the relative resilience of mountain fynbos vegetation to climate change.

AB Plant populations are regulated by a diverse array of herbivores that impose demographic filters throughout their life cycle. Few studies, however, simultaneously quantify the impacts of multiple herbivore guilds on the lifetime performance or population growth rate of plants. In African savannas, large ungulates (such as elephants) are widely regarded as important drivers of woody plant population dynamics, while the potential impacts of smaller, more cryptic herbivores (such as rodents) have largely been ignored. We combined a large-scale ungulate exclusion experiment with a five-year manipulation of rodent densities to quantify the impacts of three herbivore guilds (wild ungulates, domestic cattle, and rodents) on all life stages of a widespread savanna tree. We utilized demographic modeling to reveal the overall role of each guild in regulating tree population dynamics, and to elucidate the importance of different demographic hurdles in driving population growth under contrasting consumer communities. We found that wild ungulates dramatically reduced population growth, shifting the population trajectory from increase to decline, but that the mechanisms driving these effects were strongly mediated by rodents. The impact of wild ungulates on population growth was predominantly driven by their negative effect on tree reproduction when rodents were excluded, and on adult tree survival when rodents were present. By limiting seedling survival, rodents also reduced population growth; however, this effect was strongly dampened where wild ungulates were present. We suggest that these complex interactions between disparate consumer guilds can have important consequences for the population demography of long-lived species, and that the effects of a single consumer group are often likely to vary dramatically depending on the larger community in which interactions are embedded.

AB The role of competitive exclusion is problematic in highly diverse ant communities where exceptional species richness occurs in the face of exceptionally high levels of behavioural dominance. A possible non-niche-based explanation is that the abundance of behaviourally dominant ants is highly patchy at fine spatial scales, and subordinate species act as insinuators by preferentially occupying these gaps-we refer to this as the interstitial hypothesis. To test this hypothesis, we examined fine-scale patterns of ant abundance and richness according to a three-tiered competition hierarchy (dominants, subdominants and subordinates) in an Australian tropical savanna using pitfall traps spaced at 2 m intervals. Despite the presence of gaps in the fine-scale abundance of individual species, the combined abundance of dominant ants (species of Iridomyrmex, Papyirus and Oecophylla) was relatively uniform. There was therefore little or no opportunity for subordinate species to preferentially occupy gaps in the foraging ranges of dominant species, and we found no relationship between the abundance of dominant ants and nondominant species richness at fine spatial scales. However, we found a negative relationship between subdominant and subordinate ants, a negative relationship between dominant and subdominant ants, and a positive relationship between dominant and subordinate ants. These results suggest that dominant species actually promote species richness by neutralizing the effects of subdominant species on subordinate species. Such indirect interactions have very close parallels with three-tiered trophic cascades in food webs, and we propose a "competition cascade" where the interactions are through a competition rather than trophic hierarchy.

AB Gill bacterial communities of Chama pacifica, an Indo-Pacific invasive oyster to the eastern Mediterranean Sea, were compared with those of Chama savignyi, its northern Red Sea congeneric species. Summer and winter bacterial populations were characterized and compared using 16S rDNA clone libraries, and seasonal population dynamics were monitored by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). Clone libraries revealed a specific clade of bacteria, closely related to marine endosymbionts from the Indo-Pacific, found in both ecosystems, of which one taxon was conserved in oysters from both sites. This taxon was dominant in summer libraries and was weakly present in winter ones, where other members of this group were dominant. ARISA results revealed significant seasonal variation in bacterial populations of Mediterranean Sea oysters, as opposed to Red Sea ones that were stable throughout the year. We suggest that this conserved association between bacteria and oyster reflects either a symbiosis between the oyster host and some of its bacteria, a co-invasion of both parties, or both.

AB Recent ecological studies have shown a strong relation between temperature, echinoids and their grazing effects on macro-algal communities. In this study, we speculate that climate warming may result in an increasingly favourable environment for the reproduction and development of the sea urchin Arbacia lixula. The relationship between increased A. lixula density and the extent of barren grounds in the Mediterranean Sea is also discussed.

AB Non-random (aggregated) species distributions arise from habitat heterogeneity and nonlinear biotic processes. A comprehensive understanding of the concept of aggregation, as well as its measurement, is pivotal to our understanding of species distributions and macroecological patterns. Here, using an individual-based model, we analyzed opinions on the concept of aggregation from the public and experts (trained ecologists), in addition to those calculated from a variety of aggregation indices. Three forms of scaling patterns (logarithmic, power-law and lognormal) and four groups of scaling trajectories emerged. The experts showed no significant difference from the public, although with a much lower deviation. The public opinion was partially influenced by the abundance of individuals in the spatial map, which was not found in the experts. With the increase of resolution (decrease of grain), aggregation indices showed a general trend from significantly different to significantly similar to the expert opinion. The over-dispersion index (i.e. the clumping parameter k in the negative binomial distribution) performed, at certain scales, as the closest index to the expert opinion. Examining performance of aggregation measures from different groups of scaling patterns was proposed as a practical way of analyzing spatial structures. The categorization of the scaling patterns of aggregation measures, as well as their over- and in-sensitivity towards spatial structures, thus not only provides a potential solution to the modifiable areal unit problem, but also unveils the interrelationship among the concept, measures and perceptions of aggregated species distributions.

AB Identifying the mechanisms that underpin species richness is one of the central issues of community ecology. On rocky shores in north-western Europe, two key limpet species coexist on the mid- and low shore but are segregated at small scales with respect to habitat. Short-term and long-term experiments were done to test whether habitat suitability or habitat-specific competition drives the small-scale segregation of these species and therefore underpins their coexistence at larger spatial scales. In a controlled short-term experiment, Patella vulgata was transplanted onto open rock and into pools that either contained Patella ulyssiponensis and/or their mucus or from which P. ulyssiponensis and/or their mucus had been removed. After 2 days, P. vulgata remained in all experimental plots in similar numbers irrespective of treatment indicating that there was no negative response to P. ulyssiponensis, mucus or the pool habitat. In a long-term experiment, cage enclosures containing both species were set up in pools and on open rock over a 6-month period. P. vulgata grew equally well on both open rock and in pools but suffered higher mortality in pools. P. ulyssiponensis showed lower growth rate and higher mortality on open rock than in pools. P. ulyssiponensis exhibited increased growth in higher intraspecific densities on open rock and reduced growth in higher intraspecific densities in pools, indicating some degree of intraspecific facilitation on open rock and intraspecific competition in pools. There was no evidence of interspecific competition either in the short term or in the long term. Results revealed that habitat suitability was the mechanism causing segregation of these species at smaller spatial scales enabling them to coexist at larger spatial scales. Conflicting results in the short-term and long-term experiments highlight the importance of considering the correct temporal extent for experimental tests of hypotheses.

AB Quercus pyrenaica dehesas have been traditionally used as communal extensive grazing systems in the Leon province (NW Spain). In this region, recent abandonment of rural areas and the subsequent gradual decrease in livestock load have led to the invasion of shrubs in the understory, increasing the risk of fires. Indeed, even if there is no need of creating new pasturelands for livestock breeding, the remaining landowners keep on burning to clear these montane patches. Alternatively, the regional administration encourages shrub cutting as a better way of managing these areas and preserving the pasturelands. Our aim was to determine the effects of the dehesa abandonment and shrub cutting on plant species richness (annual herbs, perennial herbs and woody plants) and species composition, as well as on topsoil properties. For that, we compared three types of dehesas with different management regimes: (1) grazed dehesas (used at the present), (2) abandoned dehesas (more than 20 years without grazing) and (3) dehesas where shrub cutting was applied after abandonment (i.e. cleared dehesas). We selected three replicates or stands per dehesa type. The highest organic matter content (O.M.), total nitrogen (N) and available phosphorus (P) were found in cleared dehesas, while the lowest values corresponded to the grazed ones. Abandoned dehesas were characterized by the highest values for available calcium (Ca2+). No significant differences were detected regarding the vegetation richness values (S alpha, gamma or beta), although higher mean values of S alpha and gamma were found in grazed dehesas and lower, values in the cleared ones. Concerning the vegetation life forms, grazed dehesas held significantly greater species richness and cover of annual herbs, while abandoned dehesas had significantly higher woody species cover. Both grazed and abandoned dehesas harboured plant species (38 and 13 species, respectively), which were exclusively found in one dehesa type. Contrary to that, cleared dehesas scarcely had exclusive species. To conclude, our results indicated that shrub cutting alone (not followed by livestock grazing) may cause loss of plant species richness, suggesting that it is not the most appropriate management method to restore vegetation, except for reducing the risk of fire.

AB Marine ecosystems are traditionally considered to be highly connected, caused by long-distance movements of propagules in an open fluid medium. But this principle is not universal, and populations of many marine organisms have restricted gene-flow, including ones with drifting propagules. Direct tracking of marine free-floating propagules over large distances is virtually impossible, but long-distance dispersal (LDD) can be deduced from their drifting time and transport rates. Alternatively, LDD can be estimated as genetic exchange with the use of allelic frequency data obtained with genetic markers. The present study compares both approaches of LDD estimation for the tropical seagrass Thalassia testudinum. Fruit dispersal potential was measured in Puerto Morelos reef lagoon, Mexico. Between 10 and 15% of the fruits floated to the surface (floating potential <1 to 10 d), with a derived potential dispersal of <1 to 360 km. The remainder of the fruits dehisced in situ followed by limited seed dispersal (<1 to 10 m). Genetic diversity was characterized using 6 microsatellite loci for 16 populations distributed along a 1350 km long stretch of the Mexican coast, revealing a total of 58 alleles. AMOVA showed that only 9.75% of the total variation was accounted for by genetic differences between the populations. Isolation by distance was significant, and revealed a panmictic area of 350 km. The results of both approaches of LDD estimation coincided well and the maximum displacement of the fruits of this marine angiosperm exceeded, by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, the reported seed dispersal by terrestrial seed plants.

AB Pinus species, which have formed the foundation of commercial forestry industry in many countries, are known to be invasive in natural ecosystems, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. Pinus contorta is considered one of the most aggressively invasive plantation species. In this paper we aim to: (a) determine patterns of P. contorta invasion in relation to its size and age structure and spatial distribution and (b) determine the effect of vegetation cover on its regeneration. For this purpose, we have chosen the Malalcahuello National Reserve in south-central Chile, which is dominated by Araucaria araucana forests. In the three A contorta trial plots, attributes were measured in order to describe its current structure. We selected one of the three P. contorta trial plots and set eight 50 m wide and 125 m centrifugal transects starting at the North Azimuth (0 degrees) orientation and then one each 45 degrees. In each transect 25 circular plots of 2.5 m radius were established every 25 m. In each plot, we measured collar diameter (CD) for each P. contorta individual and adjusted a diameter-age function. We recorded the presence of cones for each individual P. contorta within the plots and the total number of P. contorta individuals. In each plot, we measured percent vegetation cover (grass, understory and canopy). The selected parent stand showed a decrease in density from the original plantation spacing, from 2500 to 150 plants ha(-1). Of all sampled individuals, only a 38% had cones. We found reproductive structures in trees as young as 5-year-old. Regeneration was found in all transects. Mean density for the area was 1600 plants ha-1, and the greater plant number was found in the West transect, reaching an average of 6600 plants ha(-1). Through the interpolation performed with the kriging method, a map of the area with the spatial gradient of plant density was obtained. Naturally regenerated individuals of A contorta occupied an area of 78 ha where the most distant individual is located in the southeast direction at an average distance of 1200 m from the three study plots. We determined that a positive association exists between P. contorta and the species A. araucana and Nothofagus antarctica. The capacity for early and consistent reproduction and the establishment of individuals dispersed at great distances from the original plots allow us to conclude that P. contorta has great potential as an invasive species in forests of this area of the Andes of southern South America. Invasion of P. contorta has many important implications for the conservation of native forests in our region including diminished regeneration of A. araucana. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Understanding the dispersal processes that influence genetic structure in marine species requires estimating gene flow in a dynamic, fluid environment that is often poorly characterized at scales relevant to multiple dispersive stages (e.g. spores, gametes, zygotes, larvae, adults). We examine genetic structure in the marine alga Fucus vesiculosus L., which inhabits moderately exposed shores in the northern Atlantic but releases gametes only under sunny, calm conditions. We predicted genetic structure would correlate with coastal topography because weather frequently varies across coastal promontories on the Maine shore when F. vesiculosus is reproductive, which causes one side to experience high levels of water motion (= no gamete release) while one side is calm (= gamete release). Furthermore, we expected that the effect of low dispersal capacities of gametes and zygotes would result in spatial genetic structure over short distances. Using surface drifters, we characterized near-shore circulation patterns around the study sites to investigate whether directionality of gene flow was correlated with directionality of currents. We found significant genetic differentiation among sites sampled at two different peninsulas, but patterns of differentiation were unrelated to coastal topography and there was no within-site spatial structuring. Our genetic and near-shore circulation data, combined with an examination of gamete longevity, support the dependency of gene flow on storm-detached, rafting, reproductive adults. This study highlights the significance of rafting as a mechanism for structuring established populations of macroalgae and associated biota and demonstrates the importance of coupling population genetics' research with relevant hydrodynamic studies.

AB Fire plays a critical role in breaking hard-seeded dormancy and establishing seedlings of several Acacia species in and and semi-arid regions. Numerous studies have reported an increase in seedling densities of some Acacias after fire without identifying the exact cause. However, it is generally believed and speculated that the effect is largely physical and heat related. Recent studies have revealed that smoke generated from wildfires has the ability to stimulate seed germination and also to improve seedling vigour. This stimulatory characteristic of smoke has now been confirmed by the isolation of a butenolide (3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one) from plant smoke that actively promotes germination of many plant species.
   The species of Acacia investigated were A. hebeclada (deciduous shrub), A. mearnsii (invasive tree, native to Australia) and A. robusta (deciduous tree). Seeds of A. hebeclada germinated under different light conditions with smoke-derived butenolide solution (10(-7) M), exhibited a significantly (p < 0.05) greater germination percentage than untreated seeds. Whereas A. mearnsii seeds exposed to constant dark conditions showed a significantly (p < 0.05) better germination percentage than the control. However, there was a non-significant improvement for A. robusta seeds. All three species responded positively to the butenolide treatment (10(-7) M) after incubating for 10 days under constant dark conditions at 25 +/- 0.5 degrees C, achieving a higher vigour index and seedling mass in comparison to the controls. Smoke-water (1:500) had an intermediate effect on these species. This study shows that the butenolide, isolated from smoke, may have a significant effect on the post-fire seedling ecology of Acacias.

AB An introduced plantation tree species, Acacia mangium Willd., is becoming invasive in the Brunei region of Borneo. To examine its invasive potential, a greenhouse, additive series experiment (target-neighbour) involving seedlings of A. mangium and those of a common native heath-forest (kerangas), Melastoma beccarianum Cogn. was carried out under low and high light regimes in intra- and interspecific combinations over a 6-month period. Significant variations in growth parameters (other than biomass allocation patterns) existed amongst seedlings from different treatments. A major part of this variation in growth could be attributed to the main factors of target species., neighbour species, and competition (seedling density). For the growth variables examined, the target-species response was not consistent across light regimes. Under high light conditions, Acacia was the better competitor; the Lotka-Volterra competition coefficient effect of Melastoma on Acacia was lower (alpha = 0.30) than the effect of Acacia on Melastoma (beta = 0.54). However, the reverse occurred under low light conditions with Melastoma gaining the upper hand (alpha = 1.45 and beta = 0.44). These results show that light (and hence disturbance) can strongly influence the pattern and intensity of both intra- and interspecific competition between invasive and local flora species. Relatively intact forest is unlikely to be invaded by Acacia trees (as they are poor competitors under this scenario). On the other hand, the Acacia trees can easily invade disturbed forests, especially those prone to recurring drought and fire, and over time convert the habitats to nearly monospecific stands, as is presently being observed in Brunei.

AB Isocalotic formulated diets containing four different sources of triacylglycerols (olive, corn, linseed and cod liver oils) at three levels (1.5%, 3.0% and 5.0%, total added dietary lipid = 5.0%) and a crude protein content of 37.5% to 39.9% were fed to juvenile green abalone (Haliotis fulgens). Growth and fatty acid composition of the muscle tissue were compared to that of abalone fed a reference diet that contained no added lipids (0.25% total lipids). After 75 days of culture in a flow-through system, no significant differences in growth were found among abalone fed the different oil types. Responses to different dietary levels of lipid were significantly different but not to sources of oils. Maximum growth was achieved at a 1.5% inclusion of oil sources. It appears that abalone have a great capacity to synthesize lipid from carbohydrate sources. Results also suggest that abalone are capable of desaturation and elongation of 18 C polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of the n - 3 and n - 6 family to 20:5n - 3 and 20:4n - 6. Synthesis of 22:6n - 3 from 20:5n - 3 is not reflected in the results. The lack of a growth response to the different levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) provided by the different oils included in the experimental diets may be due to an insufficient duration of the experiment to achieve an essential fatty acid deficiency. The relationship between fatty acid profiles of tissue and the diets fed to the abalone suggests that metabolic activity of the gut microflora is not a source of essential fatty acids.

AB The diversity of plant species in southern Africa is matched by an equally rich cultural diversity, but traditional uses of plants have not yet been systematically recorded. Available information is fragmentary and widely dispersed in many different journals and books. A survey by Liengme (1983a) has shown several gaps in the scientific literature and some progress has been made towards a more complete record of indigenous plant use in the region. Information on some ethnic groups, such as the Khoi, Ndebele and Swazi, as well as the interaction between plants and people, folk taxonomies, plant-related mythology, ethnoveterinary medicine and pre-colonial plant use are some of the aspects that still remain poorly recorded. In contrast, ethnopharmacology - particularly the testing of biological activity of crude extracts and isolated compounds - has received considerable attention in recent years. The aim of these studies is usually to validate traditional uses rather than to provide information for product development. A review of the literature on various categories of plant use, including recent publications and some hitherto unpublished research, is presented. Ethnobotany remains an underdeveloped discipline in southern Africa and there is an urgent need to systematically document indigenous knowledge on traditional plant use before it becomes irretrievably lost to future generations.

AB Mechanisms underlying competitive effects between two species of marine snails (Tegula aureotincta and Tegula eiseni) were examined; results indicated that the interaction involved exploitation of microalgae and not interference. A behavioral experiment demonstrated that an individual of either species was less likely to feed on a recently grazed patch when the prior forager was T. aureotincta. Both snails responded only to the amount of food available on a patch, and, except at very low food levels, the likelihood that a snail would remain to feed was identical for the two species across microalgal densities. Where food was scarce, T. eiseni was more likely than T. aureotincta to feed in that patch. Density-dependent effects on microalgal standing stock differed between the snails; at low grazer densities, T. aureotincta depressed food levels to a comparatively greater degree, whereas at high grazer densities, T. eiseni had a relatively greater effect. The relative growth performance of the snails differed as a function of available food: T. aureotincta had superior body growth at high resource densities, while T. eiseni grew comparatively better at low microalgal densities.
   Differences in effects on and growth responses to microalgae arose from dissimilar foraging characteristics of the snails. Compared with T. eiseni, T. aureotincta moved more rapidly while feeding, harvested twice as great an area per unit time, but was unable to crop microalgae as close to rock surfaces. While T. eiseni grazed a smaller area per unit time, it removed relatively more microalgae per area grazed. These differing suites of foraging attributes may represent a trade-off to harvest food at different densities: cropping closer to the substratum (area intensive grazing) yields more food when microalgae are scarce, but precludes grazing a larger area per unit time (area extensive grazing) through fast movement, which provides a greater food intake when microalgae are abundant. If an area extensive (moves faster)-intensive (digs deeper) trade-off is a common feature of benthic grazer systems, knowledge of this aspect could provide great predictive insight into the patterns and causes of density dependence arising from exploitation.

AB 1. A major challenge for the management of biological invasions is to ensure that data and information from basic inventories and ecological research are used alongside data from the monitoring and evaluation of interventions to trigger and improve policy and management responses. To address this issue, South Africa has committed to report on the status of biological invasions and their management every 3 years.
   2. We propose a framework of indicators for reporting on biological invasions at a country level; assess the feasibility of the indicators using South Africa as a case study; and outline steps needed for indicator development.
   3. We argue that a national status report on biological invasions should explicitly consider indicators for pathways, species, and sites, and should report on interventions in terms of inputs, outputs, and outcomes.
   4. We propose 20 indicators based on data currently available, as well as existing international policy initiatives. For each indicator, we have developed a factsheet that includes different hierarchical metrics (considering data availability) and provide suggestions on assigning confidence levels. We also combine these indicators into four high-level indicators to facilitate broader reporting and describe how forecasted indicators based on the concept of invasion debt could assist with scenario planning.
   5. We found that many of the data required for these indicators are already available in South Africa, but they have been poorly collated to date. However, data for the indicators of most direct value to policy and planning-those dealing with the impact of biological invasions and the outcome of interventions-are scarce.
   6. Policy implications. The framework of indicators developed here, for what we believe is the first ever national-level report on the status of biological invasions and their management, will facilitate the inclusion of biological invasions in environmental reporting at national and international levels. By identifying knowledge gaps, a status report will also focus efforts on determining the size of a country's invasion debt and what can be done to reduce it.

AB This study investigates the mechanism that motivates supply chain firms to reduce environmental externalities while balancing the economic feasibility of the supply chain system under environmentally constrained circumstances in a competitive market. Taking government policy incentives into account, a quantitative model of an integrated supply chain that incorporates sustainable constraints is formulated to optimize supply chain firms' operational strategies of producing environmental friendly products (EFPs). This study contributes to the literature with a better understanding the interplay and interrelation of multiple sustainable constraints and their impact on supply chain firms' collaborative decisions. Our findings suggest that the decisions of operating EFPs are subject to sustainable constraints and that the government policy incentives play a dominant role overseeing supply chain firms' environmental behaviors toward sustainability.

AB Aims To determine floristic units and centres of plant species endemism using quantitative methods and different taxonomic groups.
   Location The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in south-western China - the world's highest and geologically youngest plateau.
   Methods The plateau was divided into 260 grid cells, each 1 degrees x 1 degrees, and the numbers of different seed-plant taxa, including genera, total species, endemic species and alpine species, were recorded in each cell. Hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling ( NMDS) ordination were used to divide the flora quantitatively, and ANOSIM ( analysis of similarities) was used to evaluate differences between the derived groups in the composition of taxa. The stress value was used to assess the fitness of the NMDS ordination. Species endemism was measured using corrected weighted endemism, and centres of species endemism were delimited on the basis of floristic units.
   Results The plateau harbours a total of 12,058 seed-plant species and infraspecific taxa in 1619 genera; 38.2% of the species are endemic to the plateau and 27.7% are alpine plants. When two or four groups were considered, cluster analysis based on genera gave the best definition, whereas when 12 groups were considered, analysis of endemic species gave the best definition. The flora of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau represents two floristic subkingdoms, four floristic regions and 12 floristic subregions. Three centres of species endemism were identified, associated with five floristic subregions.
   Main conclusions Quantitative analysis can reveal associations within a flora, and partly confirm intuitive classifications. Genera provide clear divisions of higher floristic ranks, and endemic species give the clearest classifications of lower floristic ranks. Alpine species are important taxa for classifying the flora of mountainous regions. A centre of species endemism based on a floristic unit can be conveniently identified and delimited, and the spatial scale of this centre is determined by the taxonomic rank used.

AB Despite the southern Cape's great climatic and botanical significance (occupying the transition between the temperate and subtropical circulation systems and forming part of a global biodiversity hotspot), palaeoenvironmental data for this region of southern Africa is limited. This study presents pollen, charcoal and sedimentological data preserved in the Vankervelsvlei wetland, situated in the modern year-round rainfall zone at the ecotone between the Fynbos and Afrotemperate Forest biomes. Combining optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon dating techniques, it was possible to establish a chronology for a sediment sequence spanning the last 140,000 years, the longest record yet produced in the region. The data suggest that MIS 5d was relatively warmer (low fynbos pollen percentages and Pentzia-type pollen) than later MIS 5, MIS 4 and most of MIS 3 (similar to 96-37 ka), which were characterised by decreased temperatures (dominance of ericaceous fynbos). The pollen data indicate a complex response to the change from interglacial to glacial conditions, and suggest an important threshold is crossed in regional ecological dynamics. We postulate that during MIS 5d increased summer rainfall under warmer conditions may have offset increased potential evapotranspiration, allowing for the development of more extensive forests. During its early stages of development Vankervelsvlei was more open (increased aquatics and coarse sediment), trapping more longer-distance pollen (Podocarpus). As the mire became more closed, local elements dominated; a succession that is reflected in significant changes in the pollen assemblage, as Podocarpus remains only in trace percentages, but pollen of Canthium and Morella, which occupy nearly identical climatic niches as Podocarpus, increase in abundance. It is suggested that drought stress remains limited during the last glacial period as a result of reduced temperatures, compensating for what may have been a more seasonal winter-dominated rainfall regime, and that changes in the pollen record relate to vegetation succession and the development of the wetland rather than to major changes in moisture availability. Due to the virtual absence of palaeodata from the southern Cape covering MIS 5 to MIS 3, the establishment of this record provides an important contribution to the overall palaeoenvironmental history of the region.

AB Conservation of Neotropical game species must take into account the livelihood and food security needs of local human populations. Hunting management decisions should therefore rely on abundance and distribution data that are as representative as possible of true population sizes and dynamics. We simultaneously applied a commonly used encounter-based method and an infrequently used sign-based method to estimate hunted vertebrate abundance in a 48,000-km(2) indigenous landscape in southern Guyana. Diurnal direct encounter data collected during three years along 216, four-kilometer - long transects consistently under-detected many diurnal and nocturnal mammal species readily detected through sign. Of 32 species analyzed, 31 were detected by both methods; however, encounters did not detect one and under-detected another 12 of the most heavily hunted species relative to sign, while sign under-detected 12 never or rarely collected species relative to encounters. The six most important game animals in the region, all ungulates, were not encountered at 11-40% of village and control sites or on 29-72% of transects where they were detected by sign. Using the sign methodology, we find that tapirs, one of the terrestrial vertebrates considered most sensitive to overexploitation, are present at many sites where they were never visually detected during distance sampling. We find that this is true for many other species as well. These high rates of under-detection suggest that behavioral changes in hunted populations may affect apparent occurrence and abundance of these populations. Accumulation curves (detection of species on transects) were much steeper for sign for 12 of 16 hunted species than for encounters, but that pattern was reversed for 12 of 16 species unhunted in our area. We conclude that collection of sign data is an efficient and effective method of monitoring hunted vertebrate populations that complements encounter and camera-trapping methods in areas impacted by hunting. Sign surveys may be the most viable method for large-scale, management-oriented studies in remote areas, particularly those focused on community-based wildlife management.

AB Continuous hourly measurements of gas-phase ammonia (NH3(g)) were taken from 13 July to 7 August 2014 on a research cruise throughout Baffin Bay and the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Concentrations ranged from 30 to 650 ng m(-3) (40-870 pptv) with the highest values recorded in Lancaster Sound (74 degrees 13'N, 84 degrees 00'W). Simultaneous measurements of total ammonium ([NHx]), pH and temperature in the ocean and in melt ponds were used to compute the compensation point (chi), which is the ambient NH3(g) concentration at which surface-air fluxes change direction. Ambient (NH3(g)) was usually several orders of magnitude larger than both chi(ocean) and chi(MP) (< 0.4-10 ngm(3)) indicating these surface pools are net sinks of NH3. Flux calculations estimate average net downward fluxes of 1.4 and 1.1 ngm(-2) s(-1) for the open ocean and melt ponds, respectively. Sufficient (NH3(g)) was present to neutralize non-seasalt sulfate (nss-SO42-) in the boundary layer during most of the study. This finding was corroborated with a historical data set of PM2.5 composition from Alert, Nunavut (82 degrees 30'N, 62 degrees 20'W) wherein the median ratio of NH4+/nss-SO42- equivalents was greater than 0.75 in June, July and August. The GEOS-Chem chemical transport model was employed to examine the impact of (NH3(g)) emissions from seabird guano on boundary-layer composition and nss-SO42- neutralization. A GEOS-Chem simulation without seabird emissions underestimated boundary layer (NH3(g)) by several orders of magnitude and yielded highly acidic aerosol. A simulation that included seabird NH3 emissions was in better agreement with observations for both (NH3(g)) concentrations and nss-SO42- neutralization. This is strong evidence that seabird colonies are significant sources of NH3 in the summertime Arctic, and are ubiquitous enough to impact atmospheric composition across the entire Baffin Bay region. Large wildfires in the Northwest Territories were likely an important source of NH3, but their influence was probably limited to the Central Canadian Arctic. Implications of seabird-derived N-deposition to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are also discussed.

AB Climate models predict a range of changes in tropical forest regions, including increased average temperatures, decreased total precipitation, reduced soil moisture and alterations in seasonal climate variations. These changes are directly related to the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, primarily CO2. Assessing seasonal forest growth responses to climate is of utmost importance because woody tissues, produced by photosynthesis from atmospheric CO2, water and light, constitute the main component of carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystem. In this paper, we combine intra-annual tree growth measurements from published tree growth data and the corresponding monthly climate data for 25 pan-tropical forest sites. This meta-analysis is designed to find the shared climate drivers of tree growth and their relative importance across pan-tropical forests in order to improve carbon uptake models in a global change context. Tree growth reveals significant intra-annual seasonality at seasonally dry sites or in wet tropical forests. Of the overall variation in tree growth, 28.7% was explained by the site effect, i.e. the tree growth average per site. The best predictive model included four climate variables: precipitation, solar radiation (estimated with extrasolar radiation reaching the atmosphere), temperature amplitude and relative soil water content. This model explained more than 50% of the tree growth variations across tropical forests. Precipitation and solar radiation are the main seasonal drivers of tree growth, causing 19.8% and 16.3% of the tree growth variations. Both have a significant positive association with tree growth. These findings suggest that forest productivity due to tropical tree growth will be reduced in the future if climate extremes, such as droughts, become more frequent.

AB This paper proposes a control algorithm to govern the solution of the Beverton-Holt equation (BHE) under the potentially presence of additive disturbances. The BHE to be controlled is defined by certain intrinsic growth rate and environment carrying capacity sequences, the last one being susceptible of local modi. cations around nominal values. In fact, the control action provides the carrying capacity which makes that the solution of the current BHE tracks a reference sequence given by another BHE defined by appropriate intrinsic growth rate and environment carrying capacity sequences. In this context, the fact that the inverse of the BHE is a discrete time-varying linear system is taken into account where the inverse of the carrying capacity sequence plays the role of control sequence. The current and the reference BHEs have to be close enough to each other in order that local modi. cations of the carrying capacity be able to meet the tracking objective. A feedback control law is designed to achieve such an objective with a zero tracking-error in the ideal case of known intrinsic growth rate sequence and no presence of disturbances. An adaptive control law, with the associated parameter estimation algorithm, is considered when the intrinsic growth rate is fully or partially unknown and disturbances are present. Such a control strategy guarantees a bounded tracking-error with the error converging asymptotically to zero in case that additive disturbances also converge to zero. Some results obtained from a simulation example illustrate the effectiveness of this control strategy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Stable isotopes of carbon are useful for differentiating between freshwater food chains based on planktonic algae or benthic algae, but are reported to be of limited use for identifying food chains based on sedimentary detritus. Because data from marine systems suggest that stable isotopes of sulphur (delta S-34 values) have potential in this regard, we tested their utility in freshwater lakes.
   2. We found that sulphate in the water column of four boreal lakes was enriched in S-34 compared to the sulphur in bulk sediments from these lakes. Furthermore, within a given lake, insects known to feed on sediment (directly or via predation) had delta S-34 values similar to those of sediment, whereas planktonic and benthic invertebrates known to feed on suspended particles had delta S-34 values similar to those of sulphate in the water column.
   3. Using the stable S isotope values of invertebrates that obtain their S from either the sediment or the water column as end members in a two-source mixing model, we show that two fish species obtain their food from both planktonic and sedimentary sources. Furthermore, model results suggest that, as expected, the more benthic-feeding fish species obtains more of its S from the sediment compartment than does the species that feeds in the water-column.
   4. Our results suggest that measurements of stable sulphur isotopes provide a means of distinguishing between members of food chains that are based in the water column from those based on sedimentary detritus. As such, they would be a useful complement to stable C isotopes that are used to distinguish between food chains based on planktonic or benthic algae.

AB Understanding food-web dynamics requires knowing whether species assemblages are compartmentalized into distinct energy channels, and, if so, how these channels are structured in space. We used isotopic analyses to reconstruct the food web of a Kenyan wooded grassland. Insect prey were relatively specialized consumers of either C-3 (trees and shrubs) or C-4 (grasses) plants. Arboreal predators (arthropods and geckos) were also specialized, deriving c. 90% of their diet from C-3-feeding prey. In contrast, ground-dwelling predators preyed considerably upon both C-3- and C-4-feeding prey. This asymmetry suggests a gravity-driven subsidy of the terrestrial predator community, whereby tree-dwelling prey fall and are consumed by ground-dwelling predators. Thus, predators in general couple the C-3 and C-4 components of this food web, but ground-dwelling predators perform this ecosystem function more effectively than tree-dwelling ones. Although prey subsidies in vertically structured terrestrial habitats have received little attention, they are likely to be common and important to food-web organization.

AB Whereas the classification of plant communities has a long tradition that of animal assemblages remains poorly developed. Here we propose a classification scheme for orthopteran communities based on regional "character species", "differential species" and "attendant species" at different levels of habitat complexity, which is also applicable to other insect groups. In this context there are three main points of special importance: (i) the geographical reference area, (ii) the hierarchical spatial level (e. g. habitat complex, habitat and microhabitat) and (iii) precise constancy criteria for the definition of character species and differential species. We develop this new approach using a study on orthopteran communites of central German semi-dry calcareous grasslands. Within this habitat, we describe seven structural types that are characterized by specific orthopteran communities. For the arrangement of the structural types several environmental parameters (e. g. height and density of vegetation) were collected. Orthopteran densities were sampled at 80 sites using a biocoenometer (box quadrat). Regional character species of semi-dry grasslands include Myrmeleotettix maculatus, Metrioptera brachyptera, Stenobothrus lineatus and Tetrix tenuicornis. Within this habitat, Chorthippus parallelus, Metrioptera roeselii, Omocestus viridulus, Pholidoptera griseoaptera and Tettigonia viridissima were designated as differential species for particular structural types. Furthermore, Tettigonia cantans and Tettigonia viridissima act as altitudinal differential species. Chorthippus biguttulus is the only attendant species with high constancy values in all structural types. This classification is a powerful tool for arthropod conservation, since it allows one to determine community completeness of very important and threatened habitats, like semi-dry calcareous grasslands.

AB Ammonia emissions were measured from two entire seabird colonies with contrasting species assemblages, to ascertain the ammonia volatilisation potentials among seabird species in relation to their nesting behaviour. Emissions were calculated from downwind plume measurements of ammonia concentration using both inverse dispersion and tracer ratio methods. Measured colony emissions ranged 1 - 90 kg NH3 hour(-1), and equated to 16 and 36% volatilization of excreted nitrogen for colonies dominated by ground/burrow nesting and bare rock nesting birds, respectively. The results were applied in a bioenergetics model with a global seabird database. Seabird colonies are found to represent the largest point sources of ammonia globally ( up to similar to 6 Gg NH3 colony(-1) year(-1)). Moreover the largest emissions occur mainly in remote environments with otherwise low NH3 emissions. These ammonia "hot spots'' explain significant perturbations of the nitrogen cycle in these regions and add similar to 20% to oceanic ammonia emissions south of latitude 45 degrees S.

AB We studied the spatial structure of benthic and pelagic primary producer biomass over a large region on the west coast of North America, between Baja California del Sur, Mexico (27 degrees N), and Oregon, USA (42 degrees N). The distribution of benthic primary producer biomass was determined from repeated aerial surveys of shallow subtidal kelp stands, and pelagic primary producer biomass, from the long-term average of nearshore chlorophyll a concentrations from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Spatial analyses showed a striking match between the patch scales of kelp stands and chlorophyll a concentrations, with a characteristic length scale of similar to 180 km. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that kelp and phytoplankton biomass were negatively correlated from 0 to 150 km lag distances in the equatorward direction and 0 to 30 km in the poleward direction. Positive correlations at distances longer than the patch scale detected in the spatial analysis indicated that patches of benthic and pelagic biomass were offset in space. A spatial analysis of coastline features and long-term average coastal sea surface temperature anomalies from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) suggested that the spatial structure of benthic and pelagic primary producer biomass was associated with topographic forcing of coastal upwelling. Our results suggest that shoreline geomorphology has strong effects on coastal ecosystems, by altering the spatial distribution of primary producer biomass over characteristic spatial scales.

AB No-take marine reserves can be effective biodiversity conservation and fisheries management tools, but as yet there is little indication of whether rotational management, i.e. alternately closing and opening an area to fishing, might also confer such benefits on coral reef fish stocks. Using data taken from the state of Hawaii's long-term reef monitoring program, we have assessed the effects of more than 2 decades of rotational management on fish stocks at the Waikiki-Diamond Head Fishery Management Area (FMA) on Oahu, Hawaii. Fish biomass tended to increase during the 1 to 2 yr closure periods, but the scale of these increases was insufficient to compensate for declines during open periods. The net effect was that, between 1978 and 2002, total biomass declined by around two-thirds. Coincident with this decline was the virtual disappearance of large fishes (> 40 cm) of fishery-target groups: acanthurids, scarids and mullids. Such fishes, although initially common, were only rarely recorded in surveys after 1990. In 1988, a portion of the FMA was converted into the permanently closed Waikiki Marine Life Conservation District (MLCD). Assessment of the relative effectiveness of permanent and rotational Closure is complicated by declines in habitat quality, particularly within the MLCD, caused by overgrowth of much of the reef by the alien algae Gracilaria salicornia, which began in the early 1990s. However, the initial effect of full closure was a reversal of the previous downward trend in fish biomass, and, even in the post habitat-decline period, biomass of target species within the MLCD has been nearly twice as high as in the FMA. Additionally, there have been no declines or even downward trends in maximum size of target families in the MLCD. Overall, rotational management, as implemented at the Waikiki FMA, has not been an effective means of conserving fish stocks or revitalizing public fishing grounds.

AB Plant species and plant communities can alter element cycling promoting divergent pathways of soil development. We hypothesized that the exotic invasive crucifer, Lepidium latifolium, altered biogeochemical cycling relative to pre-existing vegetation such that sodium-affected sub-soils are ameliorated. We tested this hypothesis at the Fleming unit within the Honey Lake Wildlife Refuge in northeastern California by comparing the distribution and cycling of various elements in paired L. latifolium invaded and noninvaded sites occupied by Elytrigia elongata. Soils are fine, smectitic, calcareous, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls. In 1998, per unit area, live biomass of L. latifolium was more than 3 times greater than that of E. elongata. Content of C, Ca, Mg, K, and S in above-ground tissue of L. latifolium was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) greater than content in E. elongata. Biogeochernical fluxes of C, N, P, Ca, Mg, and S were from 3 to 11 times greater in L. latifolium-occupied areas than in E. elongata-occupied areas. L. latifolium invasion fostered elevated soil solution levels of Mg+2 and Ca+2, thereby reducing sodium adsorption ratios that could lead to sodic soil amelioration. Invasion by L. latifolium has the potential to alter soil properties and processes, thereby altering the trajectory of soil evolution.

AB We grew mussels (Mytilus edulis) under two different food regimes and eight population density levels to estimate the joint effects of density and biomass on their growth and survival and to determine the shape of the biomass-density (B-IV) relationship. Mussels were reared for 22 months, between December 1994 and October 1996, in 1-L experimental chambers supplied with natural seston. Growth in shell length, individual wet mass and ash free dry mass (m) decreased with decreasing food availability and increasing population density. Survival was negatively correlated with density but did not differ significantly between food regimes during the first year. Variations in concentration of available food did not alter the effects of crowding on mussels, as judged from the slopes of the body size-density curves. The general patterns exhibited by B-N curves were not consistent with expectations since we found 1) no classical competition-density (C-D) effect as reported in plants at intermediate competition levels, and 2) a slope of -0.648 for m-N curves in both food regimes, which was higher than expected from self-thinning (ST) theory. This value does not support present food-driven ST theory. This study introduces an unusual m-N region which combines properties of both ST and C-D effect.

AB Mobile or partially vegetated dunefields dominate the Eastern Cape coastline, with dune slacks being conspicuously well vegetated. Earlier studies on the dynamics of these habitats suggested that greater soil moisture, reduced sand movement and salt spray favoured the establishment of more mesic species. Since an understanding of these successional processes has important management implications, more detailed studies to firstly describe and then interpret the successional relationships between various plant communities were undertaken. From a survey of 152 releves at 62 sites, seven coastal communities were recognised by TWINSPAN. This separation appeared to be based on the location, habitat and successional stages of the communities, and ordination by DECORANA showed that in any one area these communities were linked to a succession gradient from pioneer to ''climax''. A more detailed investigation of the role played by dune slacks in this succession was undertaken at Kleinemonde. Six communities were separated by TWINSPAN. Pioneer communities of the foredunes had low cover and diversity, being dominated by herbs. Young dune slacks had low cover but moderately high diversity, with sedges and grasses dominating. Old dune slacks had a greater total mean cover, and shrubs were more abundant. Bushclumps were physiognomically more complex than dune slacks, with greater total mean cover, diversity and life form composition. Thicket margin communities were structurally similar to bushclumps, but floristically more complex. Dune thicket was the most physiognomically and floristically complex community sampled. Multivariate analysis revealed a distinct gradient of plant communities with increasing distance (age) from the sea, namely from Pioneer to Young Slack, Old Slack, Bushclump, Thicket Margin and Dune Thicket communities. With age, species richness, cover, diversity, number of life forms and structural complexity of the communities all increased. Importance value curves for 12 diagnostic species highlighted the distribution of these key species along the chronosequence. Pioneer species were restricted to the beginning, and dune slack species the central portion of the chronosequence. Hardy species had a wide distribution, but dune thicket species only appeared later. These trends appear to represent directional changes along a successional sequence as proposed in an earlier model, and the mode of transition between them relies heavily on autogenic changes. Dune slacks play an important role in this facilitation by acting as centres of diversity within the sparsely vegetated dunefield, and the foredunes by protecting dune slacks from salt spray and sand movement. Therefore, the role of foredunes and dune slacks must be considered in the management of the South African dune landscape, as they contribute significantly to the dynamic equilibrium of partly vegetated dunefields. Management should therefore be aimed at protecting these habitats.

AB Climate change is expected to lead to more frequent, intense and longer droughts in the future, with major implications for ecosystem processes and human livelihoods. The impacts of such droughts are already evident, with vegetation dieback reported from a range of ecosystems, including savannas, in recent years. Most of our insights into the mechanisms governing vegetation drought responses have come from forests and temperate grasslands, while responses of savannas have received less attention. Because the two life forms that dominate savannas-C-3 trees and C-4 grasses-respond differently to the same environmental controls, savanna responses to droughts can differ from those of forests and grasslands. Drought-driven mortality of savanna vegetation is not readily predicted by just plant drought-tolerance traits alone, but is the net outcome of multiple factors, including drought-avoidance strategies, landscape and neighborhood context, and impacts of past and current stressors including fire, herbivory and inter-life form competition. Many savannas currently appear to have the capacity to recover from moderate to severe short-term droughts, although recovery times can be substantial. Factors facilitating recovery include the resprouting ability of vegetation, enhanced flowering and seeding and post-drought amelioration of herbivory and fire. Future increases in drought severity, length and frequency can interrupt recovery trajectories and lead to compositional shifts, and thus pose substantial threats, particularly to arid and semi-arid savannas. Synthesis. Our understanding of, and ability to predict, savanna drought responses is currently limited by availability of relevant data, and there is an urgent need for campaigns quantifying drought-survival traits across diverse savannas. Importantly, these campaigns must move beyond reliance on a limited set of plant functional traits to identifying suites of physiological, morphological, anatomical and structural traits or "syndromes" that encapsulate both avoidance and tolerance strategies. There is also a critical need for a global network of long-term savanna monitoring sites as these can provide key insights into factors influencing both resistance and resilience of different savannas to droughts. Such efforts, coupled with site-specific rainfall manipulation experiments that characterize plant trait-drought response relationships, and modelling efforts, will enable a more comprehensive understanding of savanna drought responses.

AB Savanna vegetation is variable, and predicting how water, nutrients, and chronic disturbances interact to determine vegetation structure in savannas represents a challenge.
   Here, we examined in situ interactions among rainfall, soils, grasses, fire, and elephants that determine tree layer responses to resource gradients in Kruger National Park in South Africa, using 363 long-term monitoring sites throughout the park.
   Grass biomass increased with rainfall and on nutrient-rich clay soils. Fire frequency, too, increased with rainfall. Conversely, tree density was greater on sandier soils, where water infiltrates more readily, and in areas where the maximum interval between fires was longer, irrespective of average fire frequency. Elephant density responded positively to tree density, but did not contribute significantly to decreasing tree density.
   Savanna vegetation structure was reasonably predictable, via a combination of rainfall (favoring grasses), soil (sandy soils favoring trees), and fire (limiting trees until a longer interval between fires allows them to establish). Explicit consideration of bottom-up and top-down interactions may thus contribute to a predictive understanding of savanna vegetation heterogeneity.

AB Increased incidence of landscape fire and pollinator declines with co-extinctions of dependent plant species are both globally significant. Fire can alter species distributions, but its effects on plant-pollinator interactions are poorly understood so its present and future role in coupled plant-pollinator declines cannot be assessed. We develop a conceptual model of fire effects on plant-pollinator interactions. We review the empirical literature in the context of this model to identify important knowledge gaps regarding the processes underlying these effects and the phenotypic traits of flowering plants and pollinators mediating these effects. Fire generates, and plant-pollinator interactions respond to, heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales. There is evidence of local-scale fire effects on these interactions, but landscape-scale effects are poorly understood. Nest location and floral resource utilization primarily mediate pollinator survival during and after fire. Voltinism and mobility traits are potentially important, but poorly studied. Plant traits mediating flowering responses to fire include growth form, phenology and potentially bud location, seasonal changes in bud exposure and response to bud damage.Synthesis and applications. We suggest management actions and an agenda for future research to fill knowledge gaps currently inhibiting predictions of fire effects on plant-pollinator interactions. Fire regimes promoting floral diversity at local scales provide a surrogate means of managing pollinators and pollination while empirical research continues. Above-ground nesting, univoltine pollinators may be particularly vulnerable under expected fire regime changes. Improved knowledge of traits mediating the exploitation of landscape heterogeneity could be used to enhance the persistence of these species. Ultimately, our conceptual framework could be used as a basis for understanding fire effects on aggregate network properties to inform fire management strategies buffering plant-pollinator networks against secondary species extinctions.

TI Fluxes and fate of dissolved methane released at the seafloor at the

AB Widespread seepage of methane from seafloor sediments offshore Svalbard close to the landward limit of the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) may, in part, be driven by hydrate destabilization due to bottom water warming. To assess whether this methane reaches the atmosphere where it may contribute to further warming, we have undertaken comprehensive surveys of methane in seawater and air on the upper slope and shelf region. Near the GHSZ limit at approximate to 400 m water depth, methane concentrations are highest close to the seabed, reaching 825 nM. A simple box model of dissolved methane removal from bottom waters by horizontal and vertical mixing and microbially mediated oxidation indicates that approximate to 60% of methane released at the seafloor is oxidized at depth before it mixes with overlying surface waters. Deep waters are therefore not a significant source of methane to intermediate and surface waters; rather, relatively high methane concentrations in these waters (up to 50 nM) are attributed to isopycnal turbulent mixing with shelf waters. On the shelf, extensive seafloor seepage at <100 m water depth produces methane concentrations of up to 615 nM. The diffusive flux of methane from sea to air in the vicinity of the landward limit of the GHSZ is approximate to 4-20 mol m(-2) d(-1), which is small relative to other Arctic sources. In support of this, analyses of mole fractions and the carbon isotope signature of atmospheric methane above the seeps do not indicate a significant local contribution from the seafloor source.

AB The gut microbial community is one of the richest and most complex ecosystems on earth, and the intestinal microbes play an important role in host development and health. Next generation sequencing approaches, which rapidly produce millions of short reads that enable the investigation on a culture independent basis, are now popular for exploring microbial community. Currently, the gut microbiome in fresh water shrimp is unexplored. To explore gut microbiomes of the oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense) and investigate the effects of host genetics and habitats on the microbial composition, 454 pyrosequencing based on the 16S rRNA gene were performed. We collected six groups of samples, including M. nipponense shrimp from two populations, rivers and lakes, and one sister species (M. asperulum) as an out group. We found that Proteobacteria is the major phylum in oriental river prawn, followed by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Compositional analysis showed microbial divergence between the two shrimp species is higher than that between the two populations of one shrimp species collected from river and lake. Hierarchical clustering also showed that host genetics had a greater impact on the divergence of gut microbiome than host habitats. This finding was also congruent with the functional prediction from the metagenomic data implying that the two shrimp species still shared the same type of biological functions, reflecting a similar metabolic profile in their gut environments. In conclusion, this study provides the first investigation of the gut microbiome of fresh water shrimp, and supports the hypothesis of host species-specific signatures of bacterial community composition.

AB Problems associated with invasiveness of non-native tree species used in forestry are increasing rapidly worldwide and are most severe in areas with a long history of plantings. Lessons learnt in areas with long histories of plantings and invasions may be applicable to areas with shorter planting histories. Most research towards understanding such tree invasions has focused on Pinus species, though all groups of trees that have been widely used in forestry are invasive to some extent. This paper explores the experience of Australian Acacia species (wattles). Unlike some other groups of trees, no particular set of traits clearly separates highly invasive from less-or non-invasive wattles. All species that have been widely planted over a long period have become invasive; the extent of invasions is largely a function of human usage. These findings imply that propagule pressure in concert with residence times are the main drivers of invasiveness in wattles (many factors mediate these drivers, including fire, forest clearance and soil disturbance). The massive extent of recent plantings of Australian Acacia species in South-east Asia is therefore likely to result in large-scale invasions unless proactive management is implemented. The history of wattles in South Africa highlights the need for such proactive management. Wattles were of considerable net value to the South African economy immediately after introduction. However, the costs of wattle invasions increased over time to such an extent that (certainly over the last few decades) these costs exceed the benefits derived from the forestry industry. Wattles now dominate many natural ecosystems. We recommend several interventions to prevent a similar pattern in South-east Asia and to ensure the sustainability of plantation forestry based on wattles in the region. A spatially explicit assessment of invasion risk is required, and a monitoring system should be implemented. Cost-benefit analyses (that consider the full suite of perspectives relating to costs and benefits) need to be applied to determine the need for sustainable mitigation methods. Options for reducing potential invasiveness should be implemented; these include biological control targeting seed production (very good success has been achieved in South Africa) and the use of sterile cultivars.

AB The Cederberg Mountains (Western Cape Province, South Africa) are located within the Fynbos Biome, which exhibits some of the highest levels of species richness and endemism in the world. The region's post-glacial vegetation history, however, remains largely unknown. Presented here are high resolution pollen and microcharcoal records spanning the last 15,600 years obtained from the De Rif rock hyrax midden from the Driehoek Valley of the central Cederberg. In this region, previous pollen studies have shown muted variability in vegetation community composition during periods of globally marked climatic variability (e.g. the last glacial-interglacial transition). In our record, however, significant changes in vegetation composition are apparent. Most notably, they indicate a shift from ericaceous/restioid fynbos (present from 15,600 to 13,300 cal yr BP) to a brief, but prominent, development of proteoid fynbos at the beginning of the Holocene around 11,200 cal yr BP. This vegetation shift is associated with increased moisture at the site, and coincides with reduced fire frequency as indicated by the microcharcoal record. At 10,400 cal yr BP, there is a marked reduction in Protea-type pollen, which is replaced by thicket, characterised by Dodonaea, which became the dominant arboreal pollen type. This shift was likely the result of a long relatively fire-free period coupled with warmer and wetter climates spanning much of the early Holocene. A brief but marked decrease in water availability around 8500-8000 cal yr BP resulted in the strong decrease of Dodonaea pollen. The vegetation of the mid- to late Holocene is characterised by the increased occurrence of Asteraceae and succulent taxa, suggesting substantially drier conditions. These data give unprecedented insight into the vegetation dynamics across a period of substantial, rapid climate change, and while they confirm the presence of fynbos elements throughout the last 15,600 years, the results highlight significant fluctuations in the vegetation that were triggered by changes in both climate and fire regimes.

AB Savanna ecosystems are dominated by two distinct plant life forms, grasses and trees, but the interactions between them are poorly understood. Here, we quantified the effects of isolated savanna trees on grass biomass as a function of distance from the base of the tree and tree height, across a precipitation gradient in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results suggest that mean annual precipitation (MAP) mediates the nature of tree-grass interactions in these ecosystems, with the impact of trees on grass biomass shifting qualitatively between 550 and 737 mm MAP. Tree effects on grass biomass were facilitative in drier sites (MAP <= 550 mm), with higher grass biomass observed beneath tree canopies than outside. In contrast, at the wettest site (MAP = 737 mm), grass biomass did not differ significantly beneath and outside tree canopies. Within this overall precipitation-driven pattern, tree height had positive effect on sub-canopy grass biomass at some sites, but these effects were weak and not consistent across the rainfall gradient. For a more synthetic understanding of tree-grass interactions in savannas, future studies should focus on isolating the different mechanisms by which trees influence grass biomass, both positively and negatively, and elucidate how their relative strengths change over broad environmental gradients.

AB We provide the first comprehensive inventory of the non-native plants on Madagascar since Perrier de la BA cent thie's effort 80 years ago, and evaluate the characteristics and importance of this biota. Using botanical databases (especially the Tropicos Catalogue of the Vascular Plants of Madagascar), published plant lists, field observation, and relevant literature, we inventory 546 introduced species that have naturalized, as well as 611 other introduced species that only exist in cultivation. We also list 211 species with unclear status, eight native species that have had different genetic stock introduced, and three endemics that have naturalized outside their native range. Of the naturalized species, 101 display invasive behaviour. Highly represented families include Fabaceae (224 confirmed introduced species), Myrtaceae (143), Poaceae (71), Cactaceae (52), Asteraceae (50), and Solanaceae. (33). Humans have been bringing plants to Madagascar since they colonized the island, mainly for their utility. A number of plants with native varieties but which also have long histories of human use and transport are ripe for further historical biogeographical research (including Eragrostis, Panicum, Sorghum, Dioscorea, Ziziphus, and Adansonia). The introduced flora is similar in composition to other tropical regions; its numerical size appears to confirm that poorer countries experience relatively fewer plant introductions. Madagascar's introduced species deserve more attention, not just through the rubric of invasion biology, but as plants that build new ecologies and that sustain human communities.

AB There are many examples of ecological theory informing fishery management. Yet fisheries also provide tremendous opportunities to test ecological theory through large-scale, repeated, and well-documented perturbations of natural systems. Although treating fisheries as experiments presents several challenges, few comparable tests exist at the ecosystem scale. Experimental manipulations of fish populations in lakes have been widely used to develop and test ecological theory. Controlled manipulation of fish populations in open marine systems is rarely possible, but fisheries data provide a valuable substitute for such manipulations. To highlight the value of marine fisheries data, we review leading ecological theories that have been empirically tested using such data. For example, density dependence has been examined through meta-analysis of spawning stock and recruitment data to show that compensation (higher population growth) occurs commonly when populations are reduced to low levels, while depensation (the Allee effect) is rare. As populations decline, spatial changes typically involve populations contracting into high-density core habitats while abandoning less productive habitats. Fishing down predators may result in trophic cascades, possibly shifting entire ecosystems into alternate stable states, although alternate states can be maintained by both ecological processes and continued fishing pressure. Conversely, depleting low trophic level groups may affect central-place foragers, although these bottom-up effects rarely appear to impact fish-perhaps because many fish populations have been reduced to the point that they are no longer prey limited. Fisheries provide empirical tests for diversity-stability relations: catch data suggest that more diverse systems recover faster and provide more stable returns than less diverse systems. Fisheries have also provided examples of the tragedy of the commons, as well as counter-examples where common property resources have been managed successfully. We also address two barriers to use of fisheries data to answer ecological questions: differences in terminology for similar concepts and misuse of records of fishery landings (catch data) as a proxy for biomass trends.

AB Biodiversity matters in many aspects for human well-being by providing timber and non-timber products. The most important ecosystems providing these products in West Africa are savannas. In the context of land-use changes, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of land-use on savanna vegetation and biodiversity. This study assesses the impact of land-use on savannas by comparing protected and communal areas. Vegetation relev,s were performed in the W National Park and its surrounding communal area in Burkina Faso. Vegetation types were established using ordination and clustering methods. We analyzed to find which environmental factors determine the occurrence of the vegetation types and whether land-use has a specific effect on diversity of vegetation types occurring in both areas. Furthermore, we tested the effect of land-use on vegetation structure and the occurrence of life forms and highly valued tree species. Our results reveal five vegetation types occurring in both areas. Elevation and soil characteristics played the most important role for the occurrence of the vegetation types. Land-use had an effect on vegetation structure, diversity, and the occurrence of life form and highly valued species. Our findings suggest that traditional human land-use does not automatically lead to loss of species and degradation of savanna habitats and that combination of communal and protected areas may be of great importance for the conservation of broad spectrum of biodiversity. Our study demonstrates the complexity of land-use impact on biodiversity patterns and provides insights on what kind of management activities may be most appropriate in both areas.

AB Background: The tropical rain forests (TRF) of Africa are the second largest block of this biome after the Amazon and exhibit high levels of plant endemism and diversity. Two main hypotheses have been advanced to explain speciation processes that have led to this high level of biodiversity: allopatric speciation linked to geographic isolation and ecological speciation linked to ecological gradients. Both these hypotheses rely on ecology: in the former conservation of ecological niches through time is implied, while in the latter adaptation via selection to alternative ecological niches would be a prerequisite. Here, we investigate the role of ecology in explaining present day species diversity in African TRF using a species level phylogeny and ecological niche modeling of two predominantly restricted TRF tree genera, Isolona and Monodora (Annonaceae). Both these genera, with 20 and 14 species, respectively, are widely distributed in African TRFs, with a few species occurring in slightly less humid regions such as in East Africa.
   Results: A total of 11 sister species pairs were identified most of them occurring in allopatry or with little geographical overlap. Our results provide a mixed answer on the role of ecology in speciation. Although no sister species have identical niches, just under half of the tests suggest that sister species do have more similar niches than expected by chance. PCA analyses also support little ecological differences between sister species. Most speciation events within both genera predate the Pleistocene, occurring during the Late Miocene and Pliocene periods.
   Conclusions: Ecology is almost always involved in speciation, however, it would seem to have had a little role in species generation within Isolona and Monodora at the scale analyzed here. This is consistent with the geographical speciation model for TRF diversification. These results contrast to other studies for non-TRF plant species where ecological speciation was found to be an important factor of diversification. The Pliocene period appears to be a vital time in the generation of African TRF diversity, whereas Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have had a smaller role on speciation than previously thought.

ID WILDLIFE RESPONSES; CANIS-FAMILIARIS; POPULATIONS; DISTURBANCE; TRAILS
AB In developed countries dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are permitted to accompany human visitors to many protected areas (e. g., > 96% of protected lands in California, U.S.A.), and protected-area management often focuses on regulating dogs due to concerns about predation, competition, or transmission of disease and conflicts with human visitors. In 2004 and 2005, we investigated whether carnivore species richness and abundance were associated with management of domestic dogs and recreational visitation in protected areas in northern California. We surveyed for mammalian carnivores and human visitors in 21 recreation areas in which dogs were allowed offleash or onleash or were excluded, and we compared our observations in the recreation areas with observations in seven reference sites that were not open to the public. Carnivore abundance and species richness did not differ among the three types of recreation areas, but native carnivore species richness was 1.7 times greater (p < 0.01) and the relative abundances of native coyotes (Canis latrans) and bobcats (Lynx rufus) were over four times greater (p < 0.01) in the reference sites. Abundances of bobcats and all carnivores declined as the number of visitors increased. The policy on domestic dogs did not appear to affect species richness and abundance of mammalian carnivores. But the number of dogs we observed was strongly associated with human visitation (R-2 = 0.54), so the key factors associated with recreational effects on carnivores appear to be the presence and number of human visitors to protected areas.

AB It is argued that the inclusion of spatially heterogeneous environments in biodiversity reserves will be an effective means of encouraging ecosystem resilience and plant community conservation under climate change. However, the resilience and resistance of plant populations to global change, the specific life-history traits involved and the spatial scale at which environmentally driven demographic variation is expressed remains largely unknown for most plant groups. Here we address these questions by reporting an empirical investigation into the impacts of an unprecedented 3-year drought on the demography, population growth rates (lambda) and biogeographical distribution of core populations of the perennial grassland species Austrostipa aristiglumis in semiarid Australia. We use life-history analysis and periodic matrix population models to specifically test the hypothesis that patch- and habitat-scale variation in vital life-history parameters result in spatial differences in the resilience and resistance of A. aristiglumis populations to extreme drought. We show that the development of critical soil water deficits during drought resulted in collapse of adult A. aristiglumis populations (lambda < 1), rapid interhabitat phytosociological change and overall contraction towards mesic refugia where populations were both more resistant and resilient to perturbation. Population models, combined with climatic niche analysis, suggest that, even in core areas, a significant reduction in size and habitat range of A. aristiglumis populations is likely under climate change expected this century. Remarkably, however, we show that even minor topographic variation (0.2-3 m) can generate significant variation in demographic parameters that confer population-level resilience and resistance to drought. Our findings support the hypothesis that extreme climatic events have the capacity to induce rapid, landscape-level shifts in core plant populations, but that the protection of topographically heterogeneous environments, even at small spatial scales, may play a key role in conserving biodiversity under climate change in the coming century.

AB On artificial surfaces (seawalls) in Sydney Harbour (Australia), local biodiversity of grazers differs between sandstone and concrete constructions because limpets Siphonaria denticulata are more abundant on sandstone, while Patelloida latistrigata are more abundant on concrete walls. Competition between siphonarian and patellid limpets is unstudied on artificial structures, although the limpets are common and are known to compete in natural habitats. We tested hypotheses that the substratum (concrete or sandstone), intra-and/or interspecific competition, or a combination of factors, influence recruitment, survival, rates of grazing, or the quantity and types of algal food to explain the observed patterns. Such analyses enable better understanding of the processes influencing diversity. Both species recruited more to concrete than to sandstone plates. S. denticulata recruited more in the presence of conspecifics and slightly less in the presence of P. latistrigata. Results varied between locations and experiments, but each species survived better on concrete, which had more macro-and micro-algal food. Increased densities of P. latistrigata reduced survival of conspecifics and of S. denticulata. S. denticulata had no effect on survival of P. latistrigata, but reduced amounts of macro-algae. P. latistrigata did not affect macro-algae. Initially, there were more micro-algae on concrete and a minor effect of large densities of S. denticulata. After 95 d, differences between habitats decreased and P. latistrigata were more strongly associated with reduced amounts of micro-algae. Neither substratum, density, nor mix of limpets affected rates of grazing. Thus, interspecific interactions were similar to predictions from knowledge of natural habitats, despite the different characteristics of artificial habitats and the reduced intertidal area available for grazing. Recruitment and competition were important in explaining different densities of these limpets on sandstone and concrete walls. Increasing urbanization requires more experimental tests to identify how well current theories of intertidal ecology and of the processes maintaining local biodiversity can apply to artificial shorelines.

AB Ocean color images acquired from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) from 1998 to 2006 were used to examine the patterns of physical connectivity between land and reefs, and among reefs in the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS) in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Connectivity was inferred by tracking surface water features in weekly climatologies and a time series of weekly mean chlorophyll-a concentrations derived from satellite imagery. Frequency of spatial connections between 17 pre-defined, geomorphological domains that include the major reefs in the MBRS and river deltas in Honduras and Nicaragua were recorded and tabulated as percentage of connections. The 9-year time series of 466 weekly mean images portrays clearly the seasonal patterns of connectivity, including river plumes and transitions in the aftermath of perturbations such as hurricanes. River plumes extended offshore from the Honduras coast to the Bay Islands (Utila, Cayo Cochinos, Guanaja, and Roatan) in 70% of the weekly mean images. Belizean reefs, especially those in the southern section of the barrier reef and Glovers Atoll, were also affected by riverine discharges in every one of the 9 years. Glovers Atoll was exposed to river plumes originating in Honduras 104/466 times (22%) during this period. Plumes from eastern Honduras went as far as Banco Chinchorro and Cozumel in Mexico. Chinchorro appeared to be more frequently connected to Turneffe Atoll and Honduran rivers than with Glovers and Lighthouse Atolls, despite their geographic proximity. This new satellite data analysis provides long-term, quantitative assessments of the main pathways of connectivity in the region. The percentage of connections can be used to validate predictions made using other approaches such as numerical modeling, and provides valuable information to ecosystem-based management in coral reef provinces.

AB The Sneeuberg mountain complex (Eastern Cape) comprises one of the most prominent sections of the Great Escarpment in southern Africa but until now has remained one of the botanically least known regions. The Sneeuberg is a discrete orographical entity, being delimited in the east by the Great Fish River valley, in the west by the Nelspoort Interval, to the south by the Plains of Camdeboo, and to the north by the Great Karoo pediplain. The highest peaks range from 2278 to 2504 m above sea level, and the summit plateaux range from 1800 to 2100 m. Following extensive literature review and a detailed collecting programme, the Sneeuberg is reported here as having a total flora of 1195 species of which 107 (9%) are alien species, 33 (2.8%) are endemic, and 13 (1.1%) near-endemic. Five species previously reported as Drakensberg Alpine Centre (DAC) endemics are now known to occur in the Sneeuberg (representing range extensions of some 300-500 km). One-hundred-and-five species (8.8%) are DAC near-endemics, with the Sneeuberg being the western limit for most of these. Ten species (0.8%) represent disjunctions across the Karoo Interval from the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) to the Sneeuberg. In all, some 23 significant range extensions, eight new species, and several rediscoveries are recorded. We conclude by recognising the Sneeuberg as a new centre of endemism along the Great Escarpment, with floristic affinities with the Albany Centre and the DAC, and links to the CFR. (c) 2008 SAAB.

AB 1. Patch dynamics is a new, potentially unifying mechanism for the explanation of tree-grass coexistence in savannas. In this scale-explicit paradigm, savannas consist of patches in which a cyclical succession between woody and grassy dominance proceeds spatially asynchronously. The growing ecological and economic problem of shrub encroachment is a natural transient phase in this cycle.
   2. An important step towards understanding patterns at the landscape scale is achieved by investigating mechanisms at a smaller scale. We developed the spatially explicit individual-based simulation model SATCHMO to test the null hypothesis that cyclical succession cannot emerge from a realistic patch scale simulation model of the population dynamics of savanna woody species.
   3. We calculated the partial temporal autocorrelation coefficient for 100 simulated time series of shrub cover over 500 years for time lags of up to 200 years to establish the existence and duration of successional cycles. We found a significant positive autocorrelation indicating the existence of cycles with a typical duration of about 33 years.
   4. The shrub size frequency distributions over the course of a cycle showed shifts from dominance of small shrub sizes towards larger sizes during the increasing phase of a cycle and the reverse in the declining phase. This supports the three phase explanation as follows: (i) an initial phase when spatially and temporally overlapping favourable conditions lead to mass recruitment of shrubs; (ii) a build-up phase when the shrub cohort grows; and (iii) a break-down phase when increased competition due to crowding and unfavourable conditions lead to the break-down of the shrub cohort. The frequency distribution of shrub age at death over 10 simulations was also in agreement with this explanation.
   5. We investigated the relationship between shrub cover, annual precipitation and time-lagged shrub cover to identify the driver of the cyclical successions. More than 90% of the variation in shrub cover was explained by shrub cover of the previous year, precipitation, and their interaction.
   6. With the demonstration of precipitation-driven cyclical succession at the patch scale, we show that the mechanistic, temporal component of patch dynamics can be used to explain tree-grass coexistence in semi-arid savannas.

AB We censused all trees >= 1 cm dbh in 50 ha of forest in Korup National Park, southwest Cameroon, in the central African coastal forest known for high diversity and endemism. The plot included 329,519 individuals and 493 species, but 128 of those taxa remain partially identified. Abundance varied over four orders of magnitude, from 1 individual per 50 ha (34 species) to Phyllobotryon spathulatum, with 26,741 trees; basal area varied over six orders of magnitude. Abundance patterns, both the percentage of rare species and the dominance of abundant species were similar to those from 50-ha plots censused the same way in Asia and Latin America. Rare species in the Korup plot were much less likely to be identified than common species: 42% of taxa with < 10 individuals in the plot were identified to species, compared to 95% of the abundant taxa. Geographic ranges for all identified species were gleaned from the literature and online flora. Thirteen of the plot species are known only from Korup National Park (all discovered during the plot census), and 39 are restricted to the Nigeria-Cameroon coastal zone. Contrary to expectation, species with narrow geographic ranges were more abundant in the plot than average. The small number of narrow endemics (11% of the species), many locally abundant, mitigates short-term extinction risk, either from demographic stochasticity or habitat loss.

AB There have been no previous studies of the composition of nearshore larval fish assemblages along the coast of Portugal. We aimed to describe the composition and horizontal distribution patterns of larval fish assemblages and their temporal dynamics near a rocky reef at depths shallower than 13 m (inshore) and at two miles (3.70 km) from shore (offshore), as well as along transects perpendicular to the shoreline, from the reef to 10 miles offshore (18.52 km). Samples were taken using 5 min sub-surface trawls at the rocky shore of the Arrabida Marine Park (W Portugal). A total of 1021 larvae were collected, belonging to 61 taxa inshore and to 29 taxa offshore. Along transects, 626 larvae of 52 taxa were collected. Most larvae belonged to coastal species associated with rocky reefs. Total larval abundance and diversity were higher from May to July, which is consistent with the spawning activity of adults. Diversity and total larval abundance decreased significantly with increasing distance from shore, both in the inshore/offshore comparison and in the transects, where this decrease was evident at a very small spatial scale (within the first mile from the reef). Species assemblages differed in the pattern of distribution, with most species clearly associated to the extreme nearshore. The distribution patterns obtained were independent of the spawning mode of species. Results are discussed in the light of the possible physical mechanisms that can potentially act at the Arrabida Marine Park to facilitate larvae retention and the role of larval behaviour.

AB Tyrannosaurid theropods display several unusual adaptations of the skulls and teeth. Their nasals are fused and vaulted, suggesting that these elements braced the cranium against high feeding forces. Exceptionally high strengths of maxillary teeth in Tyrannosaurus rex indicate that it could exert relatively greater feeding forces than other tyrannosaurids. Areas and second moments of area of the nasals, calculated from CT cross-sections, show higher nasal strengths for large tyrannosaurids than for Allosaurus fragilis. Cross-sectional geometry of theropod crania reveals high second moments of area in tyrannosaurids, with resulting high strengths in bending and torsion, when compared with the crania of similarly sized theropods. In tyrannosaurids trends of strength increase are positively allomeric and have similar allometric exponents, indicating correlated progression towards unusually high strengths of the feeding apparatus. Fused, arched nasals and broad crania of tyrannosaurids are consistent with deep bites that impacted bone and powerful lateral movements of the head for dismembering prey.

AB Most research analyzing nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations on resprouter species in fire-controlled ecosystems has concentrated on how NSC concentrations recover immediately after fire. However, we know little of the effect of long periods without fire on NSC concentrations.
   In order to assess the effect of different periods of time-since-fire on resprouter species, we studied carbohydrate concentrations (total [NSC], soluble sugars [SS] and nonsoluble sugars [NSS]) in five resprouting species with contrasting trends of abundance across a chronosequence of time-since-fire (0.5-40 yr) in Florida.
   Carbohydrate concentrations were highest in species with specialized reserve organs. [SS] was mainly explained by factors related to plant size, whereas time-since-fire was the main factor explaining [NSS]. Changes in [NSS] and [NSC] were correlated with the time-since-fire abundance patterns.
   Variation in [NSS] carbohydrates can be related to the structural development of vegetation, with only those species capable of accessing full light able to accumulate carbohydrates, whereas subordinate plants show reductions in the [NSS] carbohydrate fractions. In areas with long intervals between fires, this carbohydrate reduction could affect subsequent postfire resprouting vigour, although this remains to be confirmed.

AB 1. On the south-east coast of Australia there are extensive infestations of the environmental weed bitou bush Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata. This exotic weed is highly invasive and persistent, yet little is known about its impacts and how it dominates coastal vegetation.
   2. A field study was carried out with sites selected for having an area heavily invaded by C. monilifera and an uninvaded native shrubland area. The mass and components of the litterfall and ground litter layer were monitored and compared over 12 months. Nutrient analysis was performed on the abscised leaves and mature green leaves. Soil properties and nitrogen content were also examined.
   3. There was a greater input of litter to the native areas (4800 +/- 450 kg ha(-1)), which was highly seasonal, compared with the C. monilifera areas (1690 +/- 150 kg ha(-1)). There was also a greater mass of litter on the ground in the native areas (9600 +/- 560 kg ha(-1)) than C. monilifera areas (3750 +/- 170 kg ha(-1)), probably as a result of the higher leaf fall rate and slow decomposition rate.
   4. A large proportion of nutrients was withdrawn from the native (48-80%) and C. monilifera leaves (38-60%) before abscission. The litterfall was estimated to contain more than twice the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous within the native areas, because of the high leaf fall rate rather than a high nutrient content.
   5. The total soil nitrogen was two to five times higher in the invaded areas (average 2570 +/- 620 kg ha(-1)) than within the native areas (730 +/- 90 kg ha(-1)). This was accompanied by an increase in ammonia content. The bulk density was lower in invaded areas, but there was no clear trend in the change in soil pH.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The higher soil nitrogen beneath the weed infestations could increase the competitive superiority of C. monilifera directly by increasing growth rate, or indirectly by impairing the establishment of native species that are adapted to growing in nutrient-poor soils. The control technique of spraying C. monilifera with herbicide, then burning and spraying seedlings again, could lead to greater regeneration success for natives species than spraying C. monilifera with herbicide only.

AB Exotic grasses and grass-fueled fires have altered plant species composition in the seasonal submontane woodlands of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. These changes have altered both structural and functional aspects of the plant community, which could, in turn, have consequences for litter decomposition and nitrogen (N) dynamics. In grass-invaded unburned woodland, grass removal plots within the woodland, and woodland converted to grassland by fire, we compared whole-system fluxes and the contributions of individual species to annual aboveground fine litterfall and litterfall N, and litter mass and net N loss. We assessed the direct contribution of grass biomass to decomposition and N dynamics, and we determined how grasses affected decomposition processes indirectly via effects on native species and alteration of the litter layer microenvironment. Grasses contributed 35% of the total annual aboveground fine litterfall in the invaded woodland. However, total litterfall mass and N were not different between the invaded woodland and the grass removal treatment because of compensation by the native tree Metrosideros polymorpha, which increased litter production by 37% +/- 5% when grasses were removed. The 0.3 g N m(-2)/y(-1) contained in this production increase was equal to the N contained in grass litter. Litter production and litterfall N was lowest in the grassland due to the loss of native litter inputs. Decomposition of litterfall on an area basis was highest in the grass-invaded woodland. We attributed this effect to increased inherent decomposability of native litter in the presence of grasses because (a) the microenvironment of the three vegetation treatments had little effect on decomposition of common litter types and (b) M. polymorpha litter produced in the invaded woodland decomposed faster than that produced in the grass removal plots due to higher lignin concentrations in the latter than in the former. Area-weighted decomposition was lowest in the grassland due to the absence of native litter inputs. Across all treatments, most litter types immobilized N throughout the incubation, and litter net N loss on an area basis was not different among treatments. Our results support the idea that the effects of a plant species or growth form on decomposition cannot be determined in isolation from the rest of the community or from the direct effects of litter quality and quantity alone. In this dry woodland, exotic grasses significantly altered decomposition processes through indirect effects on the quantity and quality of litter produced by native species.

AB The response of bird communities to a gradient of agricultural intensity was investigated in Burkina Faso, West Africa. Such knowledge may aid in predicting how avian diversity copes with increased human population density and land-use. A total of 34 transects were established on which bird censuses were made to test the effects of different fallow age, soil type and grazing intensity. Avian species richness was highest on actively disturbed land and gradually decreased with time since disturbance. Of 23 species restricted to one land-use type, 16 were found on cultivated land or recent fallows, 8 of them being categorized as uncommon in West Africa. Guild analyses suggest that availability of nest sites and food were the principal factors affecting bird distribution. For birds to persist in the agricultural landscape woody vegetation should include many different species and large trees should occur in the fields. Cultivated lands on the cuirasse had the highest average number of birds and many species were restricted to this land-use type. The potential for negative impact on the bird community was hence particularly high on the cuirasse. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A proposed prioritization system for the management of invasive alien
   plants in South Africa
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB EVERY COUNTRY HAS WEED SPECIES WHOSE presence conflicts in some way with human management objectives and needs. Resources for research and control are limited, so priority should be given to species that are the biggest problem. The prioritization system described in this article was designed to assess objectively research and control priorities of invasive alien plants at a national scale in South Africa. The evaluation consists of seventeen criteria, grouped into five modules, that assess invasiveness, spatial characteristics, potential impact, potential for control, and conflicts of interest for each plant species under consideration. Total prioritization scores, calculated from criterion and module scores, were used to assess a species' priority. Prioritization scores were calculated by combining independent assessments provided by several experts, thus increasing the reliability of the rankings. The total confidence score, a separate index, indicates the reliability and availability of data used to make an assessment. Candidate species for evaluation were identified and assessed by several experts using the prioritization system. The final ranking was made by combining two separate indices, the total prioritization score and the total confidence score. This approach integrates the plant's perceived priority with an index of data reliability. Of the 61 species assessed, those with the highest ranks (Lantana camara, Chromolaena odorata and Opuntia ficus-indica) had high prioritization and high confidence scores, and are thus of most concern. Those species with the lowest ranks, for example, Harrisia martinii, Opuntia spinulifera and Opuntia exaltata, had low prioritization scores and high confidence scores, and thus are of least concern. Our approach to ranking weeds offers several advantages over existing systems because it is designed for multiple assessors based on the Delphi decision-making technique, the criteria contribute equally to the total score, and the system can accommodate incomplete data on a species. Although the choice of criteria may be criticized and the system has certain limitations, it appears to have delivered credible results.

AB Fitness consequences of variation in body mass growth and body condition were studied in a Sandwich Tern Sterna sandvicensis colony on Griend, Dutch Wadden Sea, during 1990-2000. Body mass increment during the linear growth phase predicted nestling survival probabilities accurately. Chicks growing less than 8 g per day had low survival probabilities until fledging, but within a range of 8-11 g per day growth only small effects on chick survival were observed. Effects of slow growth on survival became obvious after about 10 days after hatching. Slow growing chicks reached a much lower fledging mass, whereas slow growth had only small effects on structural size at fledging. Body condition of the chicks was highly variable and had strong effects on survival until fledging. However, body condition during the nestling stage did not influence post-fledging survival. Body condition at fledging had no effects on post-fledging survival and did not affect final mass or body size. It is argued that low fledging mass can be overcome soon after fledging, as parents take their fledglings closer to the foraging areas, thereby avoiding high rates of kleptoparasitism by Black-headed Gulls Larus ridibundus .

AB Microbial colonization of marine invertebrate guts is widespread, but in general the roles that these bacteria play in the nutrition of their hosts are unknown. To examine the diversity and potential nutritional roles of hindgut microbiota in a deposit feeder, PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes were cloned from the bacterial community attached to the hindguts of the thalassinid shrimp Neotrypaea californiensis exposed to different feeding treatments. Partial 16S rDNA sequences were analyzed for 30 clones for three shrimp per treatment for a total of 270 clones. No effects of host starvation or high-protein diets were apparent on hindgut bacterial community composition. Diversity analyses indicated high variability between bacterial communities in individual shrimp hindguts, but partial 16S rDNA sequences revealed remarkable species-level similarity (>98%) within clusters of sequences from the different shrimp hindguts, and many sequences from different shrimp hindguts were identical. Sequences belonged to three main groups of bacteria: Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-Bacteroides (CFB), proteobacteria, and gram-positives. Of the 270 sequences, 40% belonged to the alpha-proteobacteria, greater than or equal to5% each to the gamma- and epsilon-proteobacteria, and greater than or equal to20% each to the gram-positive and CFB groups. All except one sequence are novel with less than or equal to95% sequence similarity to known genes. Despite weak similarity to known taxa, about 75% of the sequences were most closely related to known symbiotic and sedimentary bacteria. The bacteria in shrimp hindguts represent new species that have not yet been encountered in other environments, and gut environments may be a rich source of the difficult-to-culture and novel components of marine bacterial diversity.

AB Reproductive phenology of 171 plant species belonging to 57 families of angiosperms was studied according to life-forms in four habitat types in a savanna-forest mosaic on the Venezuelan Central Plain. Flowering, unripe fruit, and mature fruit patterns were affected significantly according to life-forms and habitats respectively. Production of flowers, unripe fruits, and mature fruits showed marked seasonality for all habitats except for the forest. Flowering peaked during the rainy season, and fruiting peaked toward the end of the rainy season. The savanna and the disturbed area had similar proportions of species that flowered over the year. The percentage of species with unripe fruits produced throughout the year was more seasonal for the disturbed area than for the other habitats. Mature fruit patterns showed an increase during the late rainy season for the ecotone and savanna. A large number of herbaceous (annual and perennial) and liana species flowered during the wet season, and a smaller fraction flowered during the dry season; and trees, shrubs, and epiphytes increased flowering activity during the dry season. Unripe fruit patterns were similar to those of flowering for all life-forms, however, tree species were less seasonal. Mature fruit production by shrubs peaked in the period of maximum rainfall, while the peak for perennial herbs was in the late rainy season and the peak for annual herbs was during the transition between the rainy season and the dry season. The largest proportion of tree and liana species with ripe fruits occurred during the dry season. Differences among phenological patterns in habitats were caused mainly by life-forms and promote a wider distribution of reproductive events in habitats and overall community in the Venezuelan Central Plain.

TI Plant diversity, herbivory and resistance of a plant community to
   invasion in Mediterranean annual communities

ID SPECIES RICHNESS; GRASSLAND; INVASIBILITY; BIODIVERSITY
AB Several components of the diversity of plant communities, such as species richness, species composition, number of functional groups and functional composition, have been shown to directly affect the performance of exotic species. Exotics can also be affected by herbivores of the native plant community. However, these two possible mechanisms limiting invasion have never been investigated together. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between plant diversity, herbivory and performance of two annual exotics, Conyza bonariensis and C. canadensis, in Mediterranean annual communities. We wanted to test whether herbivory of these exotics was influenced either by species richness, functional-group richness or functional-group composition. We also studied the relationship between herbivory on the exotic species and their performance. Herbivory increased with increasing species and functional-group richness for both Conyza species. These patterns are interpreted as reflecting a greater number of available herbivore niches in a richer, more complex, plant community. The identities of functional groups also affected Conyza herbivory, which decreased in the presence of Asteraceae or Fabaceae and increased in the presence of Poaceae. Increasing herbivory had consequences for vegetative and demographic parameters of both invasive species: survival, final biomass and net fecundity decreased with increasing herbivory, leading to a loss of reproductive capacity. We conclude that communities characterised by a high number of grass species instead of Asteraceae or Fabaceae may be more resistant to invasion by the two Conyza species, in part due to predation by native herbivores.

AB Urban political ecology (UPE) focuses on unsettling traditional understandings of 'cities' as ontological entities separate from 'nature' and on how the production of settlements is metabolically linked with flows of capital and more-than-human ecological processes. The contribution of this paper is to recalibrate UPE to new urban forms and processes of extended urbanization. This exploration goes against the reduction of what goes on outside of cities to processes that emanate unidirectionally from cities. Acknowledging UPE's rich intellectual history and aiming to enrich rather than split the field, this paper identifies four emerging discourses that go beyond UPE's original formulation.

AB During evolution of animals, their co-evolution with bacteria has generally been ignored. Recent studies have provided evidences that the symbiotic bacteria in the animal gut can either be essential or contributing to the plasticity of the host. The Crustacea includes crab, crayfish, lobster, and shrimp and represents the second largest subphylum on the planet. Although there are already studies investigating the intestinal bacterial communities in crustaceans, none of them has examined the microbiota in different parts of the digestive system during the gonad development of the host. Here, we utilized a new shrimp model Neocaridina denticulata and sequenced the 16S rRNA using the Ion Torrent platform to survey the bacterial populations colonizing the hepatopancreas, foregut, and intestine, including midgut and hindgut, of the early, mid, and late ovarian maturation stages of the shrimp. The predominant bacteria phylum was found to be Proteobacteria, with more than 80 % reads from the gut flora at the early gonad development belonged to a Coxiella-type bacterium. Distinct bacterial communities can be detected between the hepatopancreas and gut, although no significant difference could be revealed between the different regions of the gut investigated. Surprisingly, during the gonad development, bacterial diversity changed rapidly in the gut but not the hepatopancreas. This study provides the first evidence that microbiota modified differentially in specific regions of the digestive tract during gonadal development of crustaceans.

AB Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) measurements and surface drifters released from two oceanographic cruises conducted during March 2006 and January/February 2007 are used to investigate the circulation off the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). We show that the MBRS circulation can be divided into two distinct regimes, a northern region dominated by the strong, northward-flowing Yucatan Current, and a southern region with weaker southward coastal currents and the presence of the Honduras Gyre. The latitude of impingement of the Cayman Current onto the coastline varies with time, and creates a third region, which acts as a boundary between the northern and southern circulation regimes. This circulation pattern yields two zones in terms of dispersal, with planktonic propagules in the northern region being rapidly exported to the north, whereas plankton in the southern and impingement regions may be retained locally or regionally. The latitude of the impingement region shifts interannually and intra-annually up to 30 in latitude. Sub-mesoscale features are observed in association with topography, e.g., flow bifurcation around Cozumel Island, flow wake north of Chinchorro Bank and separation of flow from the coast just north of Bahia de la Ascencion. This third feature is evident as cyclonic recirculation in coastal waters, which we call the Ascencion-Cozumel Coastal Eddy. An understanding of the implications of these different circulation regimes on water mass distributions, population connectivity, and the fate of land-based pollutants in the MBRS is critically important to better inform science-based resource management and conservation plans for the MBRS coral reefs.

AB The management of exotic, invasive plants is among the most challenging undertakings of natural resource managers, particularly in large, remote landscapes. The availability of information on the distribution and abundance of invasive plants is vital for effective strategic planning yet is often unavailable because of high costs and long procurement times. This paper presents results of a large-scale invasive plant mapping effort in the Florida Everglades utilizing digital aerial sketch mapping (DASM) and evaluates its utility for guiding management decisions. The distribution and abundance (cover) of four priority invasive plant species Australian pine, Brazilian pepper, melaleuca, and Old World climbing fern were mapped over 728,000 ha in the Everglades during 2010 to 2012. Brazilian peppertree was the most widely distributed and abundant species, occupying 30,379 ha. Melaleuca was also widely distributed and occupied 17,802 ha. Old World climbing fern occupied only 7,033 ha but its distribution was generally concentrated in heavy infestations in the northern Everglades. Australian pine was the least abundant of the mapped species and tended to be limited to the southeastern Everglades region. DASM proved to be a cost-effective means of obtaining region-wide distribution and abundance information for these species at broad scales (>500 m), but detection rates and positional accuracy declined at finer scales. Both canopy type (forested vs. unforested) and distance from flight transect appear to be important factors for detection accuracy.

AB Capsule Heterogeneous detectability amongst species may impact multi-species bird surveys and if not accounted for, may bias community level conclusions. Estimates of detectability were produced for 195 UK bird species, and detectability was significantly affected by bird size, diet and habitat specialization.
   Aims To estimate detectability and understand which species traits may impact detectability.
   Methods We estimated the detectability of 195 species of birds in the UK using distance sampling methods and examined the average detectability of genetically related groups. We tested the significance of species traits in describing variation in detectability, whilst controlling for phylogenetic relationships.
   Results Passeriformes had the lowest median detectability of 0.37 and Charadriiformes the highest median detectability of 0.65, of the seven largest orders considered. Species most associated with closed habitats such as woodland and urban areas had the lowest detectability. Smaller species had lower detectability than larger species.
   Conclusion Heterogeneity in species detectability could lead to biased conclusions, particularly when calculating multi-species indices such as species richness or diversity. Accounting for detectability will be most important in studies that cover a wide range of habitat types or a diverse spread of taxa.

AB Landscape sustainability can be considered in terms of order and disorder, where order implies causality, well-defined boundaries and predictable outcomes, while disorder implies uncertain causality, shifting boundaries and often-unpredictable outcomes. We address the interplay of order and disorder in social-ecological landscapes (SELs) using spatiotemporal analysis of entropy-related indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time-series. These indices can provide insights for complex systems analysis for the evaluation of adaptive capacity in SELs. In particular, our overarching aim is to help interpret what an increase of order/disorder means with regards to SELs and the underlying drivers and causes of conditions in SELs. The approach can be used to increase spatially explicit anticipatory capability in environmental science and natural resource management based on how the system has responded to stress in the past. Such capability is crucial to address SEL adaptive capacity and for sustainable planning given that surprises may increase as a consequence of both climate change and multiple interacting anthropogenic stressors. These advancements should greatly contribute to the application of spatial resilience strategies in general, and to sustainable landscape planning in particular, and for the spatially explicit adaptive comanagement of ecosystem services.

AB In addition to fostering biodiversity goals, marine protected area (MPA) implementation has economic consequences for both commercial and recreational fisheries. During the implementation of the State of California (USA) Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA), which mandates the creation of an MPA network in California's state waters, the stakeholders and policymakers utilized a pair of economic analyses that addressed these considerations. One was a comparative, static assessment of short-term, "worst case" potential socioeconomic impacts to important fisheries based on surveys of local fishermen. This analysis made no assumptions about fishery management outside of MPAs, assumed no spillover of fish from MPAs into fished areas or reallocation of fishing effort, and estimated the maximum potential dollar-value economic impacts over a short time scale. The other was a dynamic, bioeconomic assessment of the changes in spatial distribution of biomass and catch, based on published biological parameter values, oceanographic models of larval connectivity, and a range of possible levels of fishing. This analysis explicitly accounted for fish population dynamics, spillover, fisher movement, and fishery management outside of the MPAs, but was limited to long-term, equilibrium-based results because of a lack of baseline abundance data. Both evaluation methods were novel in their spatial resolution and their use directly in an MPA design process, rather than after implementation. The two methods produced broadly similar (at a regional spatial scale) evaluations of the likely effects of proposed MPAs on fisheries, at least when the bioeconomic model assumed fishery management was conservative. Our experience with these analyses in the MLPA Initiative process led to several suggestions for future MPA design efforts: (i) since the change in fish biomass inside MPAs partly depends on fisheries management outside of them, it is useful to integrate or coordinate conventional fishery management and MPA planning efforts; (ii) integrate modeling assessments early into MPA design, as part of a post-implementation adaptive management approach; and (iii) integrate empirical fishery data into bioeconomic models in order to improve representations of human behavior and short-term forecasts of changes in fished populations.

AB Phenological variations in tropical forests are usually explained by climate. Nevertheless, considering that soil water availability and nutrient content also influence plant water status and metabolism, soil conditions may also be important in the regulation of plant reproductive and vegetative activities over time. We investigated whether phenological patterns and stem growth differ in trees growing in two types of soil that display contrasting water and nutrient availability, namely, Gleysol (moist and nutrient-poor) and Cambisol (drier and nutrient-rich).
   Phenological observations (flushing, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting) and stem diameter growth were recorded for 120 trees fitted with fixed dendrometer bands, at 15 days intervals, for 1 year. Two species of contrasting deciduousness were investigated: Senna multijuga (semi-deciduous) and Citharexylum myrianthum (deciduous).
   Both species were seasonal in all phenophases, regardless of soil type. However, frequency, mean date and intensity of phenophases varied according to soil type. Girth increment of C. myrianthum was four times greater in Cambisol than in Gleysol, whereas the type of soil had no significant effect on that of S. multijuga.
   These results show that soil characteristics also play an important role in determining phenological patterns and growth and must be considered when analysing phenological patterns in tropical forests.

AB 'Invasive plants may have variable effects within a given environment depending on their interactions with the dominant native species, yet little research has examined such species-species interactions within a site. Savanna trees with nonoverlapping canopies offer an ideal opportunity to assess associated changes in the ecosystem processes that result from interactions between an invasive species and different native tree species. We examined the influence of the exotic invasive shrub Lonicera maackii on decomposition dynamics under three native tree species: Fraxinus quadrangulata, Quercus muehlenbergii, and Carya ovata. Litter decomposition rates and litter C and N were evaluated over two years using single- and mixed-species litterbags (L. maackii and individual tree species litter); microarthropod abundance was measured at 6 weeks using Tulgreri funnels. Litter from the invasive L. maackii decomposed and lost N more rapidly than the litter of the three native tree species. The rate at which L. maackii decomposed depended on its location, with L. maackii litter decomposing and losing N more rapidly under C. ovata than under the other two native tree species. Mixing L. maackii with the native species' litter did not accelerate litter mass loss overall but did result in synergistic N losses at variable times throughout the experiment, further highlighting the variable interaction between native species and L. maackii. Nitrogen loss was significantly higher than expected in mixtures of C. ovata + L. maackii litter at 6 weeks, in F. quadrangulata + L. maackii litter at 12 weeks, and in Q. muehlenbergii + L. maackii litter at 24 weeks. If the effects of invasive species on certain ecosystem processes, such as litter decomposition, are strongly influenced by their association with native species, this could suggest the need for a more nuanced understanding of the vulnerability of ecosystem processes to invasions of L. maackii and potentially other invasive species.

AB The impacts of exotic plants on soil nutrient cycling are often hypothesized to reinforce their dominance, but this mechanism is rarely tested, especially in relation to other ecological factors. In this manuscript we evaluate the influence of biogeochemically mediated plant-soil feedbacks on native shrub recovery in an invaded island ecosystem. The introduction of exotic grasses and grazing to Santa Cruz Island, California, USA, converted native shrublands (dominated by Artemisia californica and Eriogonum arborescens) into exotic-dominated grasslands (dominated by Avena barbata) over a century ago, altering nutrient-cycling regimes. To test the hypothesis that exotic grass impacts on soils alter reestablishment of native plants, we implemented a field-based soil transplant experiment in three years that varied widely in rainfall. Our results showed that growth of Avena and Artemisia seedlings was greater on soils influenced by their heterospecific competitor. Theory suggests that the resulting plant-soil feedback should facilitate the recovery of Artemisia in grasslands, although four years of monitoring showed no such recovery, despite ample seed rain. By contrast, we found that species effects on soils lead to weak to negligible feedbacks for Eriogonum arborescens, yet this shrub readily colonized the grasslands. Thus, plant-soil feedbacks quantified under natural climate and competitive conditions did not match native-plant recovery patterns. We also found that feedbacks changed with climate and competition regimes, and that these latter factors generally had stronger effects on seedling growth than species effects on soils. We conclude that even when plant-soil feedbacks influence the balance between native and exotic species, their influence may be small relative to other ecological processes.

AB The advance of exotic tree and shrub species is one of the main threats to conservation of the last relicts of natural grassland in South America; however, control actions in the region are still scarce and there are almost no evaluations of the recovery of natural ecosystems after removing invasive plants. Monitoring of the vegetation during the years after removal of invasive trees is critical in order to decide whether an active restoration strategy is necessary. The recovery of montane grassland four years after the control of a dense invasion of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) is described in this study. Experimental clearing areas were followed during four years and compared to grassland controls. Variation was seen in the levels of recovery in function of the proximity of sectors of grassland that are free of invasive species and/or the density of invasive trees before control. Native species slowly replaced many exotic herbs that had appeared as pioneers, there was low recruitment of pine seedlings in spite of the quantity of seeds from trees that surrounded the clearings, and species richness and diversity were restored, including cover of the typical grasses in the controls. Recovery of grassland after felling was shown to be successful and does not seem to be seed limited if tree removal occurs early in the invasion process.

AB Our understanding of how communities are regulated diminishes with increasing spatial scale. Because oceanographic processes Supply food, transport propagules, and set abiotic conditions across broad areas, they may explain metacommunity and food web functioning on large scales. Here we test for bottom-up manifestations of an oceanographic process, upwelling, through production Of barnacle (Megabalanus spp.) prey to top-down control by whelks, fish, and urchins across a mesoscale (125 kin) gradient of 28-68% upwelling at 12 subtidal rock wall sites in the Galapagos from 2002 to 2005. Multivariate analysis of in situ flow measurements and the Occurrence of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) distinguished weak (WUP), intermediate (IUP), and strong upwelling (SUP) site groups. Barnacle cover and recruitment were significantly higher at SUP than at WUP sites and decreased with depth from 6 to 15 In. High barnacle recruitment was a persistent feature of SUP sites from 2002 to 2004. This recruitment was significantly related to larval concentrations, vertical flow speeds, and to I lesser extent, onshore offshore flow speeds, while growth rates of barnacles were highest at three SUP and one IUP site. Three-dimensional (3-D) flow explained 39% of the variation in growth. Therefore, bottom-up effects of upwelling occurred via prey production as recruitment and growth of barnacles. Vertical flow was the most important component of the upwelling regime predicting these dynamics. Evidence of population level predator-prey coupling was provided by significant linear relationships between densities of the whelk, Hexaplex princeps, and both the cover and recruitment of barnacle prey. In a mesoscale predation intensity experiment 33-100% of barnacles were eaten by Hexaplex and fish, linking bottom-up and top-down effects. Significantly more barnacles were consumed at SUP than at WUP sites. The broader spatial context for upwelling and predator-prey coupling documented here was provided by the topography of the sea floor offshore, its the maximum depth and bottom slope within 15 km of the sites predicted 40% of upwelling duration. Eighty percent of the SUP sites were close to steep slopes and deep (>1100 m) water where upwelling from internal waves and the EUC is likely.

AB Pit-building antlion larvae are small sit-and-wait arthropod predators that dig conical pits in sandy soils. We investigated the effect of exposure to constant light versus constant dark conditions on antlion behaviour. Antlions tended to relocate less often, construct pits more frequently and construct larger pits in constant light. We interpret this as an indication of dichotomous behaviour under light versus dark conditions such that antlion larvae hunt during the day and modify their positions at night. Antlion larvae immediately responded to the complete switch in this illumination treatment and adapted their behaviour to fit the new conditions. Prey capture success did not differ between the constant light and constant dark conditions. When provided with a choice between light and dark conditions, the vast majority of larvae preferred the former. Those that preferred constant dark, however, were on average larger than those that preferred constant light. We thus suggest that since larger antlion larvae possess larger fat reserves, they can afford reductions in foraging activity ( possibly to increase safety). An examination of the antlion trade-off between their preference for light and their preference for sand depth (which may affect their ability to evade predators) showed that their response to illumination was much more prominent, irrespective of the sand depth. Finally, combining light with other factors such as temperature and density may further elucidate microhabitat selection in pit-building antlion larvae. 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB The copper rockfish is a benthic, nonmigratory, temperate rocky reef marine species with pelagic larvae and juveniles. A previous range-wide study of the population-genetic structure of copper rockfish revealed a pattern consistent with isolation-by-distance. This could arise from an intrinsically limited dispersal capability in the species or from regularly-spaced extrinsic barriers that restrict gene flow (offshore jets that advect larvae offshore and/or habitat patchiness). Tissue samples were collected along the West Coast of the contiguous USA between Neah Bay, WA and San Diego, CA, with dense sampling along Oregon. At the whole-coast scale (similar to 2200 km), significant population subdivision (F(ST) = 0.0042), and a significant correlation between genetic and geographical distance were observed based on 11 microsatellite DNA loci. Population divergence was also significant among Oregon collections (similar to 450 km, F(ST) = 0.001). Hierarchical AMOVA identified a weak but significant 130-km habitat break as a possible barrier to gene flow within Oregon, across which we estimated that dispersal (N(e)m) is half that of the coast-wide average. However, individual-based Bayesian analyses failed to identify more than a single population along the Oregon coast. In addition, no correlation between pairwise population genetic and geographical distances was detected at this scale. The offshore jet at Cape Blanco was not a significant barrier to gene flow in this species. These findings are consistent with low larval dispersal distances calculated in previous studies on this species, support a mesoscale dispersal model, and highlight the importance of continuity of habitat and adult population size in maintaining gene flow.

AB Tropical dry forests occupy more area and are more endangered than rainforests, yet their regeneration ecology has received less study and is consequently poorly understood. We recorded the flowering and fruiting phenology of a tropical dry forest in Jamaica over a period of 26 mo within ten 15 x 15-m plots. Community-wide recruitment reached a maximum in the wet season, whereas no recruitment occurred during the dry season. We observed a unimodal peak in rainfall and fruit production, and the periodicity and intensity of seed production were significantly correlated with rainfall seasonality (the optimal time for germination). Flowering at the community and system levels lagged behind a significant increase and subsequent decrease in rainfall by 7 and 3 mo, respectively, indicating that the dominant factor controlling flowering periodicity is the passage of the major (4-mo long) rainy season and changes in soil moisture conditions. Fruiting lagged behind flowering by 2 mo and a significant increase in fruiting occurred 2 mo prior to a significant increase in rainfall. At the population level, a correspondence analysis identified a major dichotomy in the patterns of flowering and fruiting between species and indicated two broad species groups based oil their time of peak fruiting and the number of times they were in fruit. These were either individuals which were usually in peak fruit 1-2 mo prior to the start of the major rainy season or those that were in fruit more or less continuously throughout the year with no peak fruiting time. This study supports the view that seasonal variation in rainfall and hence soil water availability constitutes both the proximate and the ultimate cause of flowering periodicity in tropical dry forests.

AB Questions: Do invasions of P. halepensis (Aleppo pine) from plantations into adjacent natural communities occur in the Mediterranean region, where the species is native? What are the spatio-temporal processes involved in pine invasions in contrasting Mediterranean and semi-arid climatic regions?
   Location: Mediterranean and semi-arid regions of Israel.
   Methods: The density of invading Pinus was measured in relation to the distance from the plantation edge. Plants were categorized by age, height, basal stem girth and developmental stage, their spatial distribution was also recorded.
   Results: Analysis of plant age distribution indicates that the invasion process started when the plantations were 20-25 years old. Most invading plants were found within 20 m from the plantation edge, but a few individuals reached distances up to 100 m and became new invasion foci. Plant density declined sharply with distance from adult trees, data showing a better fit to a power model than to a negative exponential model. Invading Pinus began to produce cones earlier in the semi-arid than in the Mediterranean region (9 vs 12 years to 50% reproductive plants). In both regions, higher densities of invading plants were found on the west side of the plantation, the opposite direction to the hot winds that prevail during seed release.
   Conclusion: The frontal advance of P. halepensis from plantations is relatively slow, but the populations also expand by a saltation process, creating spreading 'islands' of pine trees in the natural vegetation. Spatial pattern of recruits with distance from the source population was remarkably similar to the pattern of seed dispersal in the same region (Nathan et al. 1999). This implies that the probability of a dispersed seed developing into a plant is independent of the distance from the forest edge.

AB Ant assemblages in South African fynbos invaded by Acacia saligna were compared with ant assemblages in undisturbed fynbos to determine whether ant assemblages change under exotic plants that produce ant-dispersed seeds. Overall, no differences in the species richness of ants were found between weed-infested and native sites but there were differences in both ant abundance and the composition of the ant assemblage. Ants were much less abundant in weed-infested sites. To investigate whether changes in ant assemblages in weed-infested areas could be due to a preference for native seeds over exotic seeds, seeds of a range of species were offered to ants and ants that handled seeds were identified. Thirteen species of ants handled A. saligna seeds and there was no evidence to suggest that the ant assemblage as a whole preferred native seeds to A. saligna seeds. Hypotheses that may account for this pattern are discussed.

AB Diapause allows aquatic organisms to survive periods of drydown in intermittent pools. However, often not all of the individuals hatch in response to a filling event. This prolonged diapause (diapause lasting through one or more favorable periods) is the likely consequence of several factors. We address the possibility that prolonged diapause in fairy shrimp in Southern California vernal pools is a bet-hedging adaptation to unpredictability in the duration of filling events. Under the simplest bet-hedging model of selection on prolonged diapause, the fraction of eggs hatching in any filling event should approximate the fraction of filling events lasting long enough for successful reproduction.
   We quantified filling durations in seven pools of coastal San Diego County, California for all winter and spring events between 1983 and 1996. The distributions of filling durations did not differ significantly among pools, so selection should be similar across pools. When the 189 filling durations were combined into a single estimated probability distribution, approximately 28% of the filling events lasted 17 days or longer, the developmental time to first reproduction (under field conditions) in the fairy shrimp Branchinecta sandiegonensis (Branchiopoda: Anostraca) inhabiting these pools. Previous laboratory hatching experiments determined a maximum hatching rate of 28% at 10 degreesC, with lower hatching percentages at higher and lower temperatures.

AB Egg densities were monitored in the dry sediment of four desert rock pool populations of the fairy shrimp Branchipodopsis wolfi over different years/seasons. Egg densities varied according to pool and season/year between about 1,000 and 220,000 eggs per m(2). This converts to population sizes of between about 200 and 500,000 viable diapausing eggs per pool. Egg densities are within the range of 10(3) to 10(5) eggs per m(2) usually measured for other zooplankton species with egg banks. Egg densities were associated but not significantly correlated with chances for successful recruitment in each of the pools as estimated from direct observations of pool hydrocycles and from pool morphometry. Egg bank densities were also not significantly linked with maturation rate and average brood size of the respective populations. Egg densities fluctuate in a partially asynchronosus way among the pools suggesting that factors other than chances for recruitment are also important in controlling egg bank dynamics. The large variance (CV greater than or equal to 80 %) in egg densities over the seasons in unvegetated pools with loose and sparse sediment in comparison with vegetated pools (CV <40 %) with compact sediment holding the eggs, is suggestive of the overriding importance of stochastic passive dispersal by wind or overflows. Earlier reproduction and larger average broods in the short-lived pools also weaken a positive correlation between habitat suitability and egg bank density. The relatively high egg densities of B. wolfi egg banks illustrate the effectiveness of the reproductive and hatching characteristics of this species to successfully persist in this extreme type of temporary habitat. This is the first study on egg bank dynamics in large branchiopods.

AB Analysis of aerial photographs indicates that woody plant biomass has rapidly increased in Hluhluwe Game Reserve over the last 40 years. Open Acacia nilotica savanna is being replaced by broadleaf species, especially Euclea spp. We were interested in whether this secondary successional shift was due to high numbers of seedlings establishing and growing to maturity under acacias (facilitation) or due to the release of already established, but suppressed individuals ('gullivers') of the resprouting broadleaf species. We examined the recruitment patterns and size-class distributions (height, basal diameter) of important species in this savanna.
   Densities of euclea seedlings (< 0.6 cm basal diameter) under Acacia nilotica were low (median of 0 and mean of 0.06 m(2)) below adult canopies and effectively zero in adjacent interspaces. No differences in numbers of other broadleaf species were found between open sites and under Acacia nilotica sites. Few large eucleas or other broadleaf species occurred under Acacia nilotica. Few Acacia nilotica recruits were found either under adults or in the open whereas Acacia karroo recruits were more common.
   The overall size class distribution for eucleas was dominated by individuals in the intermediate size class, suggesting that recruitment is not the dominant demographic process. We propose that the escape of intermediate sized eucleas from the fire trap has caused the increase in woody plants.
   Analysis of a time sequence of aerial photographs shows that invasion occurred rapidly between 1954 and 1975. A common feature for sites where woody plant invasion has taken place, was the presence of barriers to fire (especially roads). We suggest that the recent and rapid increase in woody vegetation is due to a decrease in the frequency of intense fires, rather than the recent absence of megaherbivores which allowed Acacia nilotica establishment. Few intense fires allow suppressed tree or shrub individuals, ('gullivers'), to escape the grass/fire layer and thereby become tall and fire-resistant. This release may explain the rapid rate of invasion by inherently slow growing broad-leaf species.

AB Given the crucial role of microbiota in host development, health, and environmental interactions, genomic analyses focusing on host-microbiota interactions should certainly be considered in the investigation of the adaptive mechanisms to environmental stress. Recently, several studies suggested that microbiota associated to digestive tract is a key, although still not fully understood, player that must be considered to assess the toxicity of environmental contaminants. Bacteria-dependent metabolism of xenobiotics may indeed modulate the host toxicity. Conversely, environmental variables (including pollution) may alter the microbial community and/or its metabolic activity leading to host physiological alterations that may contribute to their toxicity. Here, 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing has been applied to characterize the hepatopancreas microbiota composition of the Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinararn. The animals were collected in the Venice lagoon area, which is subject to different anthropogenic pressures, mainly represented by the industrial activities of Porto Marghera (PM). Seasonal and geographic differences in clam microbiotas were explored and linked to host response to chemical stress identified in a previous study at the transcriptome level, establishing potential interactions among hosts, microbes, and environmental parameters. The obtained results showed the recurrent presence of putatively detoxifying bacterial taxa in PM clams during winter and over-representation of several metabolic pathways involved in xenobiotic degradation, which suggested the potential for host-microbial synergistic detoxifying actions. Strong interaction between seasonal and chemically-induced responses was also observed, which partially obscured such potentially synergistic actions. Seasonal variables and exposure to toxicants were therefore shown to interact and substantially affect clam microbiota, which appeared to mirror host response to environmental variation. It is clear that understanding how animals respond to chemical stress cannot ignore a key component of such response, the microbiota.

AB Generalizations about the drivers of tree demography in tropical savannas continue to prove difficult because of the complex and dynamic interactions involved, and because multi-year data sets spanning meaningful gradients in potential drivers are lacking. Overstorey trees play disproportionate roles in the long-term dynamics and functioning of savanna ecosystems. Understanding demographic patterns in these trees is complicated by their resprouting ability after being top-killed and few studies have attempted to separate top-kill from true mortality events. We examined the interactive effects of fire frequency, mean annual precipitation and elephant herbivory on overstorey (>2m) tree mortality between 2009 and 2014 across 32 permanent vegetation plots in the Serengeti Ecosystem, Tanzania. Mean tree mortality over the study period was 0.280.02 (0.07year(-1)). Among trees that were top-killed (19.1% of all individuals), 31.2% resprouted. Mortality was driven largely by elephant herbivory, though mortality rates varied considerably across space and tree species. Fire frequency and mean annual rainfall were weak predictors of tree mortality. Over the 5year period, chronic elephant herbivory (i.e. repeated through time) was a stronger predictor of tree mortality than maximum elephant herbivory, suggesting that repeated, low-intensity damage from elephants was more important to mortality than acute, but infrequent, damage. Elephants disproportionately damaged certain tree species relative to their availability on the landscape, and the tolerance to damage differed by species as well. Acacia senegal was strongly selected and appeared to have low tolerance to damage when it occurred, resulting in a mortality rate of 0.736 +/- 0.052 (0.234year(-1)) over the study period. Top-killing and resprouting rates varied across species, with Acacias generally having low resprout rates.Synthesis. Our study highlights the considerable role that chronic herbivory plays in structuring savanna tree populations, irrespective of prevailing fire and rainfall conditions, and provides important vegetative context to the dramatic recent declines and (in the case of Serengeti) increases in savanna elephant densities in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB African wetlands include dambos or headwater valley grasslands in the upper regions of catchments, circular pan grasslands in drainage sumps, linear riverine grasslands in the mid regions of catchments and broad floodplains, swamps and deltas in the lower regions of catchments. Plant zonation on flood frequency and duration gradients occurs in predictable sequences across Africa and this variation combined with increasing retention of soil moisture for plant growth over the dry season with increasing flooding provides critical resource heterogeneity for herbivores. Consequently, wetlands are essential dry-season habitats for wild and domestic herbivore populations across Africa, often providing key resources that buffer herbivore population numbers in the face of severe dry seasons and droughts. Floodplain peripheries and shallow to intermediate-depth floodplains are generally preferred over the early dry season, with deep floodplains and swamps being used by the late dry season and during droughts. Wetland grasslands are generally able to withstand extremely heavy grazing over the dry season without becoming degraded because they are inaccessible to grazers during the period of flooding over the wet season, giving plants a full growing season's recovery period, as well as by wetland grasses storing a large proportion of their biomass in deep root systems and rhizomes. African wetlands are under siege by upstream damming and by agricultural projects and further/reinforced conservation measures are needed to protect them, such as ecologically designed water releases from dams to maintain flooding regimes and prevention of agriculture on key floodplains for grazers.

AB The spread of invasive alien plants has considerable environmental and economic consequences, and is one of the most challenging ecological problems. The spread of invasive alien plant species depends largely on long-distance dispersal, which is typically linked with human activity. The increasing domination of the internet will have impacts upon almost all components of our lives, including potential consequences for the spread of invasive species. To determine whether the rise of Internet commerce has any consequences for the spread of invasive alien plant species, we studied the sale of thirteen of some of the most harmful Europe invasive alien plant species sold as decorative plants from twenty-eight large, well known gardening shops in Poland that sold both via the Internet and through traditional customer sales. We also analyzed temporal changes in the number of invasive plants sold in the largest Polish internet auction portal. When sold through the Internet invasive alien plant species were transported considerably longer distances than for traditional sales. For internet sales, seeds of invasive alien plant species were transported further than were live plants saplings; this was not the case for traditional sales. Also, with e-commerce the shape of distance distribution were flattened with low skewness comparing with traditional sale where the distributions were peaked and right-skewed. Thus, e-commerce created novel modes of long-distance dispersal, while traditional sale resembled more natural dispersal modes. Moreover, analysis of sale in the biggest Polish internet auction portal showed that the number of alien specimens sold via the internet has increased markedly over recent years. Therefore internet commerce is likely to increase the rate at which ecological communities become homogenized and increase spread of invasive species by increasing the rate of long distance dispersal.

AB Socioecological theory, developed through the study of urban environments, has recently led to a proliferation of research focusing on comparative analyses of cities. This research emphasis has been concentrated in the more developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere (often referred to as the "Global North"), yet urbanization is now occurring mostly in the developing world, with the fastest rates of growth in sub-Saharan Africa. Countries like South Africa are experiencing a variety of land-cover changes that may challenge current assumptions about the differences between urban and rural environments and about the connectivity of these dynamic socioecological systems. Furthermore, questions concerning ecosystem services, landscape preferences, and conservation - when analyzed through rural livelihood frameworks - may provide insights into the social and ecological resilience of human settlements. Increasing research on urban development processes occurring in Africa, and on patterns of kinship and migration in the less developed countries of the "Global South", will advance a more comprehensive worldview of how future urbanization will influence the progress of sustainable societies.

AB Seabirds have substantial influence on geochemical circulation of elements, serving as a link for substance exchange between their foraging area and colonies. In this study, we investigated the elemental and carbon isotopic composition of five penguin-affected sediment profiles excavated from Ross Island and Beaufort Island in the Ross Sea region, Antarctica. Among the three main constituents of the sediments (including weathered bedrock, guano and algae), guano was the main source of organic matter and nutrients, causing selective enrichment of several elements in each of the sediment profiles. In the 22 measured elements, As, Cd, Cu, P, S, Se and Zn were identified as penguin bio-elements in the Ross Sea region through statistical analysis and comparison with local end-member environmental media such as weathered bedrock, fresh guano and fresh algae. Carbon isotopic composition in the ornithogenic sediments showed a mixing feature of guano and algae. Using a two-member isotope mixing equation, we were able to reconstruct the historical change of guano input and algal bio-mass. Compared with research in other parts of Antarctic, Arctic, and South China Sea, we found apparent overlap of avian bio-elements including As, Cd, Cu, P, Se, and Zn. Information on the composition and behavior of bio-elements in seabird guano on a global scale, and the role that bio-vectors play in the geochemical circulation between land and sea, will facilitate future research on avian ecology and paleoclimatic reconstruction.

AB Aim To evaluate the potential of habitat connectivity to promote the effectiveness of marine reserves. We used heterogeneous reef seascapes as a model system to examine the potential interaction of reserves and mangrove-reef connectivity and compared the magnitude of these effects across the western Pacific Ocean.
   Location The tropical and subtropical western Pacific, including the Solomon Islands, Great Barrier Reef and Moreton Bay, Australia.
   Methods We quantified fish densities on coral reefs (38 sites) and in mangrove forests (19 sites) across seven marine reserves and twelve unprotected control locations. Fish assemblages were in seascapes supporting either adjacent reefs and mangroves or isolated reefs. For each reserve-control comparison, we evaluated the potential interactive effects of habitat connectivity on species richness and densities of harvested species, functional groups, families and individual species. We then examined the influence of spatial variation in reserve attributes, seascape heterogeneity and latitude on the magnitude of reserve-connectivity effects.
   Results Snappers (Lutjanidae) and rabbitfish (Siganidae) were more abundant on reserve reefs close to mangroves in all regions. These interactive effects also enhanced the abundance of sweetlip (Haemulidae), bream (Sparidae), harvested fish, herbivores and piscivores and species richness in two of the three regions examined. Spatial variation in the magnitude of reserve-connectivity effects was explained by differences among reserves in seascape variables (i.e. area of mangroves and reef, duration of mangrove inundation and distance to rivers) but not by reserve attributes (i.e. age, size, poaching) or latitude.
   Main conclusions Habitat connectivity improved the effectiveness of reserves across the western Pacific Ocean. We recommend that heterogeneous landscapes with high-habitat connectivity should be viewed as high priorities for conservation. By improving our understanding of connectivity, and through its explicit incorporation into conservation, we may have greater success in restoring biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems.

AB Habitat fragmentation can significantly affect plant reproductive success and ultimately population viability, but little is known about the magnitude, direction or time scale of these impacts on plant-pollinator mutualisms. In this study, four species of terrestrial orchid with specialist and generalist pollination syndromes were used to investigate the effects of fragmentation on capsule set in urban bushland remnants. Supplementary pollination showed pollination limitation, but not resource limitation, occurs across all species. Habitat and landscape scale fragmentation predictor variables were used to build parsimonious models that explained capsule set data collected over 2 years. We found the sexually deceptive species, Caladenia arenicola, to be sensitive to interactions between landscape (perimeter to area ratio) and habitat scale (bare ground cover and population size) predictor variables. The effect of perimeter to area ratio was heavily tempered by the significant negative influence of bare ground cover, where values of over 40% bare ground cover resulted in reproductive failure. We found that generalist pollinated species had significant interactions at the habitat scale including significant positive interactions between capsule set and population size and litter cover. Our results suggest the effects of habitat fragmentation at the landscape and habitat scale are important drivers of population viability. Our results suggest population viability will depend on the sensitivity of the pollination syndrome and the pollinator involved. This study highlights the need for research into reproductive success across multiple spatial scales to improve and inform conservation efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Removing predatory fishes has effects that cascade through ecosystems via interactions between species and functional groups. In Kenyan reef lagoons, fishing-induced trophic cascades produce sea urchin-dominated grazing communities that greatly reduce the overall cover of crustose coralline algae (CCA). Certain species of CCA enhance coral recruitment by chemically inducing coral settlement. If sea urchin grazing reduces cover of settlement-inducing CCA, coral recruitment and hence juvenile coral abundance may also decline on fished reefs. To determine whether fishing-induced changes in CCA influence coral recruitment and abundance, we compared (1) CCA taxonomic compositions and (2) taxon-specific associations between CCA and juvenile corals under three fisheries management systems: closed, gear-restricted, and open-access. On fished reefs (gear-restricted and open-access), abundances of two species of settlement-inducing CCA, Hydrolithon reinboldii and H. onkodes, were half those on closed reefs. On both closed and fished reefs, juveniles of four common coral families (Poritidae, Pocilloporidae, Agariciidae, and Faviidae) were more abundant on Hydrolithon than on any other settlement substrate. Coral densities were positively correlated with Hydrolithon spp. cover and were significantly lower on fished than on closed reefs, suggesting that fishing indirectly reduces coral recruitment or juvenile success over large spatial scales via reduction in settlement-inducing CCA. Therefore, managing reefs for higher cover of settlement-inducing CCA may enhance coral recruitment or juvenile survival and help to maintain the ecological and structural stability of reefs.

AB Aim The study was aimed at testing whether West Africa can be regarded as a distinct biogeographic region based on amphibian assemblages. If so, we asked what were the relationships of these assemblages with those in Central Africa, and whether West African amphibian distributions showed biogeographic substructure. We further investigated what events or processes may explain the observed patterns.
   Location Sub-Saharan Africa.
   Methods Presence-absence data of amphibian assemblages derived from field surveys and the literature were statistically analysed using three different multivariate techniques (consensus clustering, Monmonier analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling) to emphasize consistent results.
   Results We showed that West Africa has unique amphibian assemblages, which could be clearly demarcated from Central African assemblages, particularly by the geographic barrier of the Cross River. Further biogeographic subdivisions were detected to the west of this barrier. Habitat, mainly forest, was the best factor explaining our observed pattern. Overall, intra-regional similarity (e.g. within West Africa) was higher than intra-habitat similarity (e.g. within forest) across regions.
   Main conclusions Our results are compared with previous works and interpreted in the light of the known evolutionary history of West and Central Africa. The observed pattern may be explained by postulated differences in river continuity through time, with West African rivers serving as more or less constant barriers in contrast to those in Central Africa. Our results demonstrate the uniqueness of West African amphibian assemblages, highlighting the need for their conservation as many are under acute anthropogenic pressure.

AB Distance to grazing hotspots like watering points or farms is regularly used as proxy for grazing intensity in extended rangelands. In many studies the resulting patterns between distance and grazing dependent variables are nonlinear with strong changes in the vicinity of the centre, a distinct transition zone, and hardly any changes on remote sites. Here we propose that this typical pattern just reflects the nonlinear relationship between grazing intensity and distance in circular grazing hotspots. Theoretical considerations as well as other proxies of grazing intensity like dung density or salinity suggest that reciprocal distance better represents grazing intensity. It is a more realistic description of the temporal distribution of livestock and often reveals linear relationships to grazing dependent variables preventing misinterpretations of thresholds that might be important for rangeland management.

AB We report abundance of C-13 and N-15 contents in terrestrial plants (mosses, lichens, liverworts, algae and grasses) from the area of Barton Peninsula (King George Island, maritime Antarctic). The investigated plants show a wide range of delta C-13 and delta N-15 values between -29.0 and -20.0aEuro degrees and between -15.3 and 22.8aEuro degrees, respectively. The King George Island terrestrial plants show species specificity of both carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions, probably due to differences in plant physiology and biochemistry, related to their sources and in part to water availability. Carbon isotope compositions of Antarctic terrestrial plants are typical of the C-3 photosynthetic pathway. Lichens are characterized by the widest carbon isotope range, from -29.0 to -20.0aEuro degrees. However, the average delta C-13 value of lichens is the highest (-23.6 +/- A 2.8aEuro degrees) among King George Island plants, followed by grasses (-25.6 +/- A 1.7aEuro degrees), mosses (-25.9 +/- A 1.6aEuro degrees), liverworts (-26.3 +/- A 0.5aEuro degrees) and algae (-26.3 +/- A 1.2aEuro degrees), partly related to habitats controlled by water availability. The delta N-15 values of moss samples range widest (-9.0 to 22.8aEuro degrees, with an average of 4.6 +/- A 6.6aEuro degrees). Lichens are on the average most depleted in N-15 (mean = -7.4 +/- A 6.4aEuro degrees), whereas algae are most enriched in N-15 (10.0 +/- A 3.3aEuro degrees). The broad range of nitrogen isotope compositions suggest that the N source for these Antarctic terrestrial plants is spatially much variable, with the local presence of seabird colonies being particularly significant.

AB 1. The Galapagos Marine Reserve provides refuge for numerous threatened marine species, including 16 mammals, birds, reptiles and fish currently recognized on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Plus an additional 25 endemic fish, mollusc, crustacean, echinoderm, coral and macroalgal species that comply with threatened species criteria because of declining extent of Occurrence or highly-localized ranges, and hence also qualify for inclusion on the Red List.
   2. threatened marine species With restricted ranges are not randomly distributed across the archipelago but tend to co-occur at a limited number of sites that are predominantly located in the west. Sites at which threatened species are known to persist, particularly those with a large proportion of the global population, are here identified as sites of global conservation significance-key biodiversity areas.
   3. The majority (27) of the 38 inshore key biodiversity areas identified are currently protected from fishing because they lie within the 17% of coastal waters that is zoned as 'no-take' tourism or conservation zones. All key biodiversity areas should be protected from extractive exploitation if threatened species are to be safeguarded. This can be achieved, at the minimum, through a relatively minor amendment to the existing marine zoning scheme, whereby an additional 2% of the coastline is dedicated to conservation.

AB Questions: How similar are solutions of eight commonly used vegetation classification methods? Which classification methods are most effective according to classification validity evaluators? How do evaluators with different optimality criteria differ in their assessments of classification efficacy? In particular, do evaluators which use geometric criteria ( e. g. cluster compactness) and non- geometric evaluators ( which rely on diagnostic species) offer similar classification evaluations?
   Methods: We analysed classifications of two vegetation data-sets produced by eight classification methods. Classification solutions were assessed with five geometric and four nongeometric internal evaluators. We formally introduce three new evaluators: PARTANA, an intuitive variation on evaluators which use the ratio of within/ between cluster dissimilarity as the optimality criterion, an adaptation of Morisita's index of niche overlap, and ISAMIC, an algorithm which measures the degree to which species are either always present or always absent within clusters.
   Results and Conclusions: 1. With the exception of single linkage hierarchical clustering, classifications resulting from the eight methods were often similar. 2. Although evaluators varied in their assessment of best overall classification method, they generally favored three hierarchical agglomerative clustering strategies: flexible beta ( beta = - 0.25), average linkage, and Ward's linkage. 3. Among introduced evaluators PARTANA appears to be an effective geometric strategy which provides assessments similar to C-index and Gamma evaluators. Nongeometric evaluators ISAMIC and Morisita's index demonstrate a strong bias for single linkage solutions. 4. Because non- geometric criteria are of interest to phytosociologists there is a strong need for their continued development for use with vegetation classifications.

AB Acclimation potential of needle photosynthetic capacity varies greatly among pine species, but the underlying chemical, anatomical and morphological controls are not entirely understood. We investigated the light-dependent variation in needle characteristics in individuals of Pinus patula Schlect. & Cham., which has 19-31-cm long pendulous needles. and individuals of P. radiata D. Don., which has shorter (8-17-cm-long) stiffer needles. Needle nitrogen and carbon contents, mesophyll and structural tissue volume fractions, needle dry mass per unit total area (MA) and its components, volume to total area ratio (V/A(T)) and needle density (D = M-A/(V/A(T))) and maximum carboxylase activity of Rubisco (V-cmax) and capacity of photosynthetic electron transport (J(max)) were investigated in relation to seasonal mean integrated irraC diance (Q(int)). Increases in Q(int), from canopy bottom to top resulted in proportional increases in both needle thickness and width such that needle total to projected surface area ratio, characterizing the efficiency of light interception, was independent of Q(int),,. Increased light availability also led to larger M-A and nitrogen content per unit area (N-A). Light-dependent modifications in MA resulted from increases in both V/AT and D, whereas A N-A changed because of increases in both MA and mass-based nitrogen content (N-M) (NA = NMMA). Overall, the volume fraction of mesophyll cells increased with increasing irradiance and V/AT as the fraction of hypodermis and epidermis decreased with increasing needle thickness. Increases in M-A and N-A resulted in enhanced J(max) and V-cmax per unit area in both species, but mass-based photosynthetic capacity increased only in P patula. In additions J(max), and V-cmax showed greater plasticity in response to light in P. panda. Species differences in mesophyll volume fraction explained most of the variation in mass-based needle photosynthetic capacity between species, demonstrating that differences in plastic adjustments in mass-based photosynthetic activities among these representative individuals were mainly associated with con-trasting investments in mesophyll cells. Greater area-based photosynthetic plasticity in P. patula relative to P radiata was associated with larger increases in MA and mesophyll volume fraction with increasing irradiance. These data collectively demonstrate that light-dependent increases in mass-based nitrogen contents and photosynthetic activities were associated with an increased mesophyll volume fraction in needles at higher irradiances. They also emphasize the importance of light- dependent anatomical modifications in determining needle photosynthetic capacity.

AB The African Plant Checklist and Database Project (APCD) provides botanists with the first angiosperm checklist and database for Sub-Saharan Africa. This was achieved by merging the existing datasets for Southern and Tropical Africa. The checklist is published as a one-off hardcopy publication. The database, with all attached additional information, is freely accessible via the internet and will be regularly updated. The APCD, for the first time, gives accurate statistics for the angiosperm flora of Sub-Saharan Africa. There are 50,136 current taxa (representing approximately 44,830 species) in the database, plus an additional 393 taxa where there are discrepancies in genus concept between the two original datasets. Taxa are classified into 274 families and 3,802 current genera. Several other important statistics can also be drawn from the database. Furthermore, by pointing out problems and discrepancies in taxonomic opinion, the APCD highlights taxa where further research is necessary. The APCD will be an invaluable too] to botanists working on the African flora. It also has an important role to play in greater projects such as the Global Plant Checklist Project and has already emerged as a nomenclatural standard for the African Plants Initiative.

AB We investigated the major patterns of plant rarity in sub-Saharan Africa, and looked for the most significant gaps in the reserve network of the region in terms of representing the distribution of threatened and geographically rare plants. Comparisons of the species ranges captured by the network of reserves were made against the proportion of species captured by randomly generated sets of areas and against a theoretical near minimum set of areas that represent all species once. At this scale of analysis, the network of large IUCN-coded reserves (the official 'protected areas') performs poorly against random and systematic selection procedures. Significant gaps in the IUCN-coded protected areas are in coastal Gabon/Cameroon, in the various tropical montane forest areas (Cameroon Highlands, Eastern Arc Mountains, Ethiopian Mountains), in lowland coastal eastern Africa, and in the South African Cape. Some of these gaps, for example in the Eastern Arc and eastern African coastal regions, are covered on the ground by a network of Forest Reserves under the management of national Forestry Authorities. The networks of Forest Reserves in Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Sierra Leone also fill reservation gaps for rare African plants in these countries. Upgrading the conservation status of some key Forest Reserves, which has been gradually happening for some decades, is proposed as an efficient way to enhance the protected area network of the Afrotropical region for the conservation of rare African plant species.

AB Butterfly, spider, and plant species richness and diversity were investigated in five different land-use types in Sardinia. In 16 one-hectare plots we measured a set of 15 environmental variables to detect the most important factors determining patterns of variation in species richness, particularly endemicity. The studied land-use types encompassed homogeneous and heterogeneous shrublands, shrublands with tree-overstorey, Quercus forest and agricultural land. A total of 30 butterfly species, among which 10 endemics, and 50 spider (morpho)species, were recorded. Butterfly and spider community composition differed according to land-use type. The main environmental factors determining diversity patterns in butterflies were the presence of flowers and trees. Spiders reacted mainly to habitat heterogeneity and land-use type. Traditional land-use did not have adverse effects on the diversity of butterflies, spiders, or plants. The number of endemic butterfly species per treatment increased with total species richness and altitude. Butterfly and spider richness did not co-vary across the five land-use types. Butterflies were, however, positively associated with plant species richness and elevation, whereas spiders were not. Conclusively, butterflies did not appear to be good indicators for spider diversity and species richness at the studied sites.

AB Coral cays form part of the Australian Great Barrier Reef. Coral cays with high densities of seabirds are areas of extreme nitrogen (N) enrichment with deposition rates of up to 1000 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). The ways in which N sources are utilised by coral cay plants, N is distributed within the cay, and whether or not seabird-derived N moves from cay to surrounding marine environments were investigated. We used N metabolite analysis, N-15 labelling and N-15 natural abundance (delta(15)N) techniques. Deposited guano-derived uric acid is hydrolysed to ammonium (NH4+) and gaseous ammonia (NH3). Ammonium undergoes nitrification, and nitrate (NO3-) and NH4+ were the main forms of soluble N in the soil. Plants from seabird rookeries have a high capacity to take up and assimilate NH4+, are able to metabolise uric acid, but have low rates of NO3- uptake and assimilation. We concluded that NH4+ is the principal source of N for plants growing at seabird rookeries, and that the presence of NH4+ in soil and gaseous NH3 in the atmosphere inhibits assimilation of NO3-, although NO3- is taken up and stored. Seabird guano, Pisonia forest soil and vegetation were similarly enriched in N-15 suggesting that the isotopic enrichment of guano (delta(15)N 9.9parts per thousand) carries through the forest ecosystem. Soil and plants from woodland and beach environments had lower delta(15)N (average 6.5parts per thousand) indicating a lower contribution of bird-derived N to the N nutrition of plants at these sites. The aquifer under the cay receives seabird-derived N leached from the cay and has high concentrations of N-15-enriched NO3- (delta(15)N 7.9parts per thousand). Macroalgae from reefs with and without seabirds had similar delta(15)N values of 2.0-3.9parts per thousand suggesting that reef macroalgae do not utilise N-15-enriched seabird-derived N as a main source of N. At a site beyond the Heron Reef Crest, macroalgae had elevated delta(15)N of 5.2parts per thousand, possibly indicating that there are locations where macroalgae access isotopically enriched aquifer-derived N. Nitrogen relations of Heron Island vegetation are compared with other reef islands and a conceptual model is presented.

AB In this paper we explore the integration of different factors to understand, predict and control ecological invasions, through a general cellular automaton model especially developed. The model includes life history traits of several species in a modular structure interacting multiple cellular automata. We performed simulations using field values corresponding to the exotic Gleditsia triacanthos and native co-dominant trees in a montane area. Presence of G. triacanthos juvenile bank was a determinant condition for invasion success. Main parameters influencing invasion velocity were mean seed dispersal distance and minimum reproductive age. Seed production had a small influence on the invasion velocity. Velocities predicted by the model agreed well with estimations from field data. Values of population density predicted matched field values closely: The modular structure of the model, the explicit interaction between the invader and the native species, and the simplicity of parameters and transition rules are novel features of the model.

AB Phenological studies were carried out in gallery and montane forests along the Lencois River in the Chapada Diamantina mountains, state of Bahia, Brazil, between January 1993 and March 1998. Leaf flush, leaf Fall, flowering, and fruiting were followed in 54 tree species (N = 243 trees tagged along trails following the river margin and the valley sides). Both gallery and montane forests exhibited a moderate peak in leaf fall during the dry season (August-October), as well as increased leaf flushing in the rainy season (December-April), Three basic model of leafing activity were noted, although most trees in the gallery forest and in the montane forest were evergreen (82.3 and 57.8% relative frequency, respectively). In both forest types, flowering and fruiting modes were annual, with peaks of activity during the rainy season. The predominantly evergreen mode of leaf fall and leaf flush found in this stud ' v was most similar to that seen in tropical wet forests, while the flowering and fruiting modes were more similar to that of dry forests.

AB Two classifications are presented that organize the major processes and theories addressing the high species diversity of tropical rain forests. The first typology organizes environmental and biological processes within a spatio-temporal hierarchy, whilst the second classifies 12 theories according to over-arching driving forces: genetic differentiation, environmental change, niche/habitat diversification and biotic interaction. The theories are reviewed and evaluated by delineating the development and current state of academic knowledge pertaining to each. General issues that arise from examining species diversity within the tropical realm are discussed and this indicates where the academic debate stands today. Some thoughts concerning future research avenues are included.

AB With nearly a quarter of global dryland systems considered to be degraded, the level and scale of degradation often exceed the thresholds for autogenic recovery, requiring human intervention to ensure that ecosystem biodiversity, structure, and function can be improved. A "Think Tank" workshop focusing on advancing the ecological approaches to large-scale restoration in degraded environments was held at Kings Park and Botanic Garden, Western Australia. Acknowledging that adaptive and broadly multidisciplinary strategies are paramount to achieving restoration in a repeatable and cost-effective manner, the workshop served as a forum to bring together plant scientists, ecologists, engineers, and environmental managers involved in dryland restoration from around the globe. This introductory paper to this special issue summarizes important contemporary challenges facing dryland restoration worldwide, offers a synthesis of the fundamental workshop themes, and provides a contextual overview for the series of invited papers in this issue, comprising reviews and case studies in seed and restoration technologies.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the relative contribution of natural productivity and compound food to the growth of the juvenile blue shrimp Litopenaeus stylirostris reared in a biofloc system. Two experiments were carried out based on the same protocol with three treatments: clear water with experimental diet (CW), biofloc with experimental diet (BF) and biofloc unfed (BU). Shrimp survival was significantly higher in biofloc rearing than in CW rearing. The contribution of the biofloc to shrimp diet was estimated through measurement of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios in shrimp and food sources. Different isotopic compositions between feeds were obtained by feeding natural productivity with a mixture rich in fish meal and the shrimps with a pellet containing a high level of soy protein concentrate. Using a two source one-isotope mixing model, we found that the natural productivity of the biofloc system contributed to shrimp growth at a level of 39.8% and 36.9%, for C and N, respectively. The natural food consumed by the shrimps reared in the biofloc system resulted in higher gene expression (mRNA transcript abundance) and activities of two digestive enzymes in their digestive gland: alpha-amylase and trypsin. The growth of shrimp biomass reared in biofloc was, on average, 4.4 times that of those grown in clear water. Our results confirmed the best survival and promoted growth of shrimps using biofloc technology and highlighted the key role of the biofloc in the nutrition of rearing shrimps.
   Statement of relevance
   In this study, we have applied an original protocol to determine the respective contribution of natural productivity and artificial feeds on the alimentation of the juvenile blue shrimp L. stylirostris reared in biofloc system by using C and N natural stable isotope analysis. Moreover, we have compared, in shrimp digestive gland, the alpha-amylase and trypsin enzyme activities at biochemical and molecular levels for two different shrimp rearing systems, biofloc and clear water. In our knowledge, the use of molecular tool to study the influence of biofloc consumption on digest process of shrimp was never carried out. We think that our research is new and important to increase knowledge on biofloc topic. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) has been increasingly used in forestry outside its native range, and is nowadays one of the most important pulpwood species in the world. E. globulus has great economic importance in many countries, and in Portugal it has recently become the most widespread tree species. However, there is also an increasing concern about the potential ability of eucalypts to naturally establish from seed (wildling establishment), because of negative ecological and economic impacts this could cause. The natural establishment of this fast-growing exotic species may have undesirable consequences, but little is known about its distribution, or which are the factors influencing its occurrence. In order to investigate these issues, we characterized wildling occurrence and abundance along 3111 roadside transects adjacent to eucalypt plantations distributed throughout continental Portugal. Eucalypt wildlings were found in 60 % of the sampled transects and across all natural regions, with densities ranging from 0 to 10,000 plants ha(-1) (mean = 277 plants ha(-1)). The potential influence of environmental variables on wildling establishment from plantations was assessed using boosted regression trees. The abundance of wildlings was found to be primarily affected by precipitation and distance from the sea (used as a surrogate of thermal amplitude), although topography, frost occurrence and soil type also played a significant role. Plant density peaked at around 1500 mm of annual precipitation and it decreased with both decreasing and increasing precipitation, reaching the lowest values below 800 mm and above 2400 mm. Eucalypt wildlings were also more abundant in areas with milder temperatures, namely closer to the sea (with lower thermal amplitude) and with lower number of frost days. Finally, plant density also seemed to be favoured in areas with intermediate elevation, higher slope and with certain soil types (namely Cambisols and Podzols). Knowing the regions with higher wildling density and understanding the factors influencing plant establishment may help managers to establish and prioritize eventual control plans in regions with higher probability of recruitment.

AB Predicting connectivity patterns in systems with fluid transport requires descriptions of the spatial distribution of propagules. In contrast to research on terrestrial seed dispersal, where much attention has focused on localized physical factors affecting dispersal, studies of oceanic propagule dispersal have often emphasized the role of large-scale factors. We link these two perspectives by exploring how propagule dispersal in the ocean is influenced by the coastal boundary layer (CBL), a region of reduced velocities near the shoreline that might substantially modify local-scale dispersal. We used a simple simulation model to demonstrate that accounting for the CBL markedly alters transport distances, the widths of dispersal distributions, and the fraction of larvae retained near their sites of origin (self-retention). Median dispersal distances were up to 59% shorter in simulations with a CBL than in those without. Self-retention of larvae increased by up to 3 orders of magnitude in the presence of CBLs, but only minor changes arose in the long-distance tails of the distributions, resulting in asymmetric, non-Gaussian kernels analogous to those quantified for terrestrial seed dispersal. Because successfully settling larvae are commonly those that remain close to shore and interact with the CBL, ignoring this pervasive oceanographic feature will substantially alter predictions of population self-persistence, estimates of connectivity, and outcomes of metapopulation analyses.

AB Sand-dwelling wormlion and antlion larvae are predators with a highly specialized hunting strategy, which either construct efficient pitfall traps or bury themselves in the sand ambushing prey on the surface. We studied the role substrate particle size plays in these specialized predators. Working with thirteen species of antlions and one species of wormlion, we quantified the substrate particle size in which the species were naturally found. Based on these particle sizes, four substrate types were established: fine substrates, fine to medium substrates, medium substrates, and coarse substrates. Larvae preferring the fine substrates were the wormlion Lampromyia and the antlion Myrmeleon hyalinus originating from desert habitats. Larvae preferring fine to medium and medium substrates belonged to antlion genera Cueta, Euroleon, Myrmeleon, Nophis and Synclisis and antlion larvae preferring coarse substrates were in the genera Distoleon and Neuroleon. In addition to analyzing naturally-occurring substrate, we hypothesized that these insect larvae will prefer the substrate type that they are found in. Specifically, we tested substrate preference in a choice experiment for four species of antlions. This was then compared to the substrate that the larvae were naturally found in. Larvae of the four antlion species were allowed to choose among eight substrates differing according to their particle size. Our findings show that the majority of M. hyalinus larvae built pits in the finest sand fraction, and the majority of N. microstenus larvae were found in a coarser fraction. The other two species, M. immaculatus and E. nostras, constructed majority of their pits in a medium sand fraction. These results support the hypothesis that neuropteran larvae prefer specific substrates for pitbuilding or ambushing prey, and that this - in combination with other abiotic and biotic factors - may drive selection of appropriate habitats.

AB How generalist plants diverge in response to pollinator selection without becoming specialized is still unknown. This study explores this question, focusing on the evolution of the pollination system in the pollination generalist Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae).
   Pollinator assemblages were surveyed from 2001 to 2010 in 48 geo-referenced populations covering the entire geographic distribution of E. mediohispanicum. Bipartite modularity, a complex network tool, was used to find the pollination niche of each population. Evolution of the pollination niches and the correlated evolution of floral traits and pollination niches were explored using within-species comparative analyses.
   Despite being generalists, the E. mediohispanicum populations studied can be classified into five pollination niches. The boundaries between niches were not sharp, the niches differing among them in the relative frequencies of the floral visitor functional groups. The absence of spatial autocorrelation and phylogenetic signal indicates that the niches were distributed in a phylogeographic mosaic. The ancestral E. mediohispanicum populations presumably belonged to the niche defined by a high number of beetle and ant visits. A correlated evolution was found between pollination niches and some floral traits, suggesting the existence of generalist pollination ecotypes.
   It is conjectured that the geographic variation in pollination niches has contributed to the observed floral divergence in E. mediohispanicum. The process mediating this floral divergence presumably has been adaptive wandering, but the adaptation to the local pollinator faunas has been not universal. The outcome is a landscape where a few populations locally adapted to their pollination environment (generalist pollination ecotypes) coexist with many populations where this local adaptation has failed and where the plant phenotype is not primarily shaped by pollinators.

TI The Trophy Hunting of African Lions: Scale, Current Management Practices
   and Factors Undermining Sustainability
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID PANTHERA-LEO; CONSERVATION; POPULATION; INDUSTRY; IMPACT
AB The trophy hunting of lions Panthera leo is contentious due to uncertainty concerning conservation impacts and because of highly polarised opinions about the practice. African lions are hunted across at least similar to 558,000 km(2), which comprises 27-32% of the lion range in countries where trophy hunting of the species is permitted. Consequently, trophy hunting has potential to impart significant positive or negative impacts on lions. Several studies have demonstrated that excessive trophy harvests have driven lion population declines. There have been several attempts by protectionist non-governmental organisations to reduce or preclude trophy hunting via restrictions on the import and export of lion trophies. We document the management of lion hunting in Africa and highlight challenges which need addressing to achieve sustainability. Problems include: unscientific bases for quota setting; excessive quotas and off-takes in some countries; fixed quotas which encourage over-harvest; and lack of restrictions on the age of lions that can be hunted. Key interventions needed to make lion hunting more sustainable, include implementation of: enforced age restrictions; improved trophy monitoring; adaptive management of quotas and a minimum length of lion hunts of at least 21 days. Some range states have made important steps towards implementing such improved management and off-takes have fallen steeply in recent years. For example age restrictions have been introduced in Tanzania and in Niassa in Mozambique, and are being considered for Benin and Zimbabwe, several states have reduced quotas, and Zimbabwe is implementing trophy monitoring. However, further reforms are needed to ensure sustainability and reduce conservation problems associated with the practice while allowing retention of associated financial incentives for conservation.

AB The transport of nutrients by migratory animals across ecosystem boundaries can significantly enrich recipient food webs, thereby shaping the ecosystems' structure and function. To illustrate the potential role of islands in enabling the transfer of matter across ecosystem boundaries to be gauged, we investigated the influence of seabirds on nitrogen input on islands. Basing our study on four widely differing islands in terms of their biogeography and ecological characteristics, sampled at different spatial and temporal intervals, we analyzed the nitrogen isotopic values of the main terrestrial ecosystem compartments (vascular plants, arthropods, lizards and rodents) and their relationship to seabird values. For each island, the isotopic values of the ecosystem were driven by those of seabirds, which ultimately corresponded to changes in their marine prey. First, terrestrial compartments sampled within seabird colonies were the most enriched in delta N-15 compared with those collected at various distances outside colonies. Second, isotopic values of the whole terrestrial ecosystems changed over time, reflecting the values of seabirds and their prey, showing a fast turnover throughout the ecosystems. Our results demonstrate that seabird-derived nutrients not only spread across the terrestrial ecosystems and trophic webs, but also modulate their isotopic values locally and temporally on these islands. The wealth of experimental possibilities in insular ecosystems justifies greater use of these model systems to further our understanding of the modalities of trans-boundary nutrient transfers.

AB The gut of abalone contains a diverse population of bacteria which contribute to food digestion and nutrient absorption. To investigate the development of gut microflora in the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor and the effect of various diets on the bacterial communities, we analyzed the composition of gut microbial flora and the bacterial digestive enzymes in connection with four important development stages, i.e., larva, early-juvenile, late-juvenile and grow-out. Among these cultivated bacteria, the Firmicutes group was isolated from both the larval and early-juvenile stages; the CFB (Cytophaga/Flexibacteria/Bacterioides) group was detected in early juveniles, late juveniles and grow-out; the gamma-proteobacteria existed throughout the four development stages. The isolated Bacillus sp. and Pseudoalteromonas sp. dominated in the larvae and were rarely detected in other stages. Subsequently, the genus Vibrio predominated in the latter three phases after the first feeding. Cluster analysis of the DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis) patterns was basically congruent with the result of culture-dependent method in which the gut bacterial community indicated the successional change in the development stages. And the artificial diets contribute to the change of gut bacterial composition to some extent. The enzyme assay showed that the gut bacteria isolated from the early juveniles produced the greatest diverse digestive enzymes compared with those isolated from other development stages. most cultivated bacteria in each development stage showed protease, lipase or alginate-degrading activities which could help the farmed abalone H. diversicolor to digest diets.

AB Species composition, number of emerging seedlings, species diversity and functional group of the soil seed banks, and the influence of grazing on the similarity between the soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation, were studied in 2008 and 2009 in a semi-arid savanna of Ethiopia. We tested whether the availability of persistent seeds in the soil could drive the transition from a degraded system under heavy grazing to healthy vegetation with ample perennial grasses. A total of 77 species emerged from the soil seed bank samples: 21 annual grasses, 12 perennial grasses, 4 herbaceous legumes, 39 forbs, and 1 woody species. Perennial grass species dominated the lightly grazed sites, whereas the heavily grazed sites were dominated by annual forbs. Heavy grazing reduced the number of seeds that can germinate in the seed bank. Species richness in the seed bank was, however, not affected by grazing. With increasing soil depth, the seed density and its species richness declined. There was a higher similarity in species composition between the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation at the lightly grazed sites compared with the heavily grazed sites. The mean similarity between the seed banks and aboveground vegetation was relatively low, indicating the effect of heavy grazing. Moreover, seeds of perennial grasses were less abundant in the soil seed banks under heavy grazing. We concluded that restoration of grass and woody species from the soil seed banks in the heavily grazed areas could not be successful in semi-arid savannas of Ethiopia.

AB Forest ecosystems are already being impacted by climate change as natural migration rates are outpaced by rapidly changing climate conditions. Human-assisted migration has been proposed as a potential management option to maintain optimal health and productivity of Canada's forests; however, a better understanding of the ecological implications is needed to inform decision-making on assisted migration (AM). This paper examines the ecological constraints and consequences of AM, and discusses options for their mitigation at three scales: translocation over long distances (assisted long-distance migration), translocation just beyond the range limit (assisted range expansion), and translocation of genotypes within the existing range (assisted population migration). From an ecological perspective, we find that AM is a feasible management option for tree species and that constraints and consequences can be minimized through careful application of available knowledge and tools.

AB Illegal hunting of wildlife is a major issue in today's society, particularly in tropical ecosystems. In this study, a total of 114 local residents from eight villages located in four wards adjacent to the northern Gonarezhou National Park, south-eastern Zimbabwe were interviewed in 2009, using semi-structured questionnaires. The study aimed to answer the following questions: (i) what is the prevalence of illegal hunting and what are commonly used hunting methods? (ii) Which wild animal species are commonly hunted illegally? (iii) What are the main reasons for illegal hunting? (iv) What strategies or mechanisms are currently in place to minimize illegal hunting? Overall, 59% of the respondents reported that they saw bushmeat, meat derived from wild animals, and/or wild animal products being sold at least once every six months, whereas 41% of the respondents reported that they had never seen bushmeat and/or wild animal products being sold in their villages and/or wards. About 18% of the respondents perceived that illegal hunting had increased between 2000 and 2008, whereas 62% of the respondents perceived that illegal hunting had declined, and 20% perceived that it remained the same. Snaring (79%) and hunting with dogs (53%) were reportedly the most common hunting methods. A total of 24 wild animal species were reportedly hunted, with African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) (18%), Burchell's zebra (Equus quagga) (21%), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) (25%) and impala (Aepyceros melampus) (27%) amongst the most targeted and preferred animal species. In addition, large carnivores, including spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) (11%), leopard (Panthera pardus) (10%) and African lion (Panthera leo) (8%), were reportedly hunted illegally. The need for bushmeat, for household consumption (68%), and raising money through selling of wild animal products (55%) were reported as being the main reasons for illegal hunting. Strengthening law enforcement, increasing awareness and environmental education, and developing mechanisms to reduce human-wildlife conflicts will assist in further minimizing illegal hunting activities in the Gonarezhou ecosystem.

AB Broad scale patterns of genetic structure in coastal communities are strongly affected by both ecological transitions and larval dispersal. Along the Chilean coast, we examined 2 species of co-distributed barnacles, Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus, which span an ecological transition associated with a sharp increase in larval recruitment. A distinct break in haplotype frequencies in the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) gene was detected in N. scabrosus, with only marginal genetic structure observed in J. cirratus, suggesting significant differences in either selective pressures or dispersal ability between the species. The nuclear gene elongation factor la was also analyzed in N. scabrosus, and similarly suggested limited gene flow. The sharp genetic transition is downstream of the described ecological transition, effectively mirroring a genetic cline described in a different barnacle species along the North American Pacific coast.

AB A modeling experiment was designed to investigate the impact of fire management, CO2 emission rate. and the growth response to CO2 on the response of ecosystems in the conterminous United States to climate scenarios produced by three different General Circulation Models (GCMs) as simulated by the MC1 Dynamic General Vegetation Model (DGVM). Distinct regional trends in response to projected climatic change were evident across all combinations of the experimental factors. In the eastern half of the U.S., the average response to relatively large increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation was an 11% loss of total ecosystem carbon. In the West, the response to increases in precipitation and relatively small increases in temperature was a 5% increase in total carbon stocks. Simulated fire suppression reduced average carbon losses in the East to about 6%, and preserved forests which were largely converted to woodland and savanna in the absence of fire suppression. Across the west, unsuppressed fire maintained near constant carbon stocks despite increases in vegetation productivity. With fire suppression, western carbon stocks increased by 10% and most shrublands were converted to woodland or even forest. With a relatively high level of growth in response to CO2, total ecosystem carbon pools at the end of the century were on average about 9-10% larger in both regions of the U.S. compared to a low CO2 response. The western U.S. gained enough carbon to counter losses from unsuppressed fire only with the high CO2 response, especially in conjunction with the higher CO2 emission rate. In the eastern U.S., fire suppression was sufficient to produce a simulated carbon sink only with both the high CO2 response and emission rate. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the impacts of global warming on the ecosystems of the conterminous U.S., some of which resides in the future trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, in the direct response of vegetation to increasing CO2, and in future tradeoffs among different fire management options, as illustrated in this study.

ID FISH; CIRCULATION; DISPERSAL
AB The northern Gulf of California, Mexico, is one of the most productive and diverse marine ecosystems in the world. It currently harbors three marine protected areas, including two biosphere reserves. Despite its significance as a conservation site and its importance for Mexico's fisheries, proper knowledge of population connectivity and larvae dispersal from spawning sites is largely lacking. Our study focuses on connectivity in the northern gulf resulting from advection by currents and turbulent diffusion during summer, the main spawning period of various key commercial species. We calculated connectivity matrices in the northern Gulf from currents produced by the output of a three-dimensional baroclinic numerical model and a random walk process to simulate turbulent motions. We released 2000 hypothetical passive particles in each of 21 areas along the coast (between 0-60 in deep) during the summer and followed their trajectories for periods of 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. For the case of full time transport, the effects of tidal currents are minimal in the overall dispersal of passive particles on the time scales studied. However, this can be substantially altered if the particles are allowed to avoid being transported for periods of time; this is illustrated by striking differences between the connectivity matrices obtained by modeling also night-only and day-only advection. This "order zero" connectivity study (i.e., not including realistic larvae behavior, which is species-specific) reveals that during the summer spawning season of key commercial species, regional hydrodynamics produce a cyclonic downstream connectivity along the coast, from the mainland to the Baja California coast. Our results provide the basis for a full connectivity study where larvae behavior and settlement habitat will be included. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Wind-induced sediment resuspension in shallow lakes affects many physical and biological processes, including food gathering by zooplankton. The effects of suspended sediment on clearance rate were determined for a dominant cladoceran, Daphnia carinata, and calanoid copepod, Boeckella hamata, in Lake Waihola, New Zealand.
   2. Animals were incubated at multiple densities for 4 days in lake water containing different amounts of suspended lake sediment. Rates of harvest of major food organisms were determined for each sediment level (turbidity) from changes in net growth rate with grazer density.
   3. Daphnia cleared all food organisms 7-40 mu m in length at similar rates, but was less efficient in its removal of free bacteria, phytoplankton < 7 mu m, and large cyanobacterial filaments. Elevation of sediment turbidity from 2 to 10 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) (63 mg DW L-1 added sediment) reduced Daphnia clearance of phytoplankton, heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates by 72-100%, and of amoebae and attached bacteria by 21-44%. Further inhibition occurred at higher turbidity.
   4. Boeckella hamata removed microzooplankton primarily, rather than phytoplankton. The rate at which it cleared rotifers was reduced by 56% when turbidity was increased from 2.5 to 100 NTU.
   5. In the absence of macrozooplankton, algal growth increased with sediment turbidity, suggesting that sediment also inhibits rotifer grazing.
   6. As mid-day turbidity in Lake Waihola is >= 10 NTU about 40% of the time, sediment resuspension may play a major role in moderating energy flow and structuring pelagic communities in this lake.

AB The larvae of the antlion Euroleon nostras are pit-builders, constructing pitfall traps in loose sand. The number of pits and the pit diameter are recorded when larvae are kept in substrates with different particle sizes. The most convenient pit-building sand fractions are two fractions with fine sand (<= 0.23 mm; 0.23-0.54 mm). The largest pits are constructed in sand with a particle size of 0.23-0.54 mm. In this sand fraction, larvae of all three instars most readily build pits. No pits are constructed in sand with a particle size greater than 1.54 mm. First- and second-instar larvae avoid building pits in substrates of particle size 1-1.54 mm, but third-instar larvae construct pits in this sand fraction. It is assumed that the antlion is capable of distinguishing between substrate types and this hypothesis is tested by giving larvae the choice of building a pit in one of four particle-size fractions. Larvae of all three instars prefer to build pits in the fraction with a particle size of 0.23-0.54 mm. Only third-instar larvae build pits in all four fractions, but only occasionally in the coarser fraction.

AB The present study examines the effect of shore exposure on the feeding performance (assessed by fatty acid analyses of the whole body) and gonad condition (stage of development and gonad somatic index, GSI) of Patella depressa populations.. Male, and female limpets were collected at exposed and sheltered sites, during winter and summer. The population at the exposed site was at a more advanced stage of gonad development, with a higher dispersion of gonad stages, both in winter and summer. Additionally, limpets from the exposed site, particularly the males, presented a higher GSI than the corresponding stage in the sheltered site. The quantitatively most important fatty acids were the saturated fatty acids (SFA) 16:0, 14:0, and 18:0, the monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) 18: 1 (n - 7), 18: 1 (n - 9), 16: 1 (n - 7) and 20: 1 (n - 9) and the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) 20:5(n - 3) and 20:4(n - 6). Females had a significantly higher fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) content (in summer and winter) and higher amounts of SFA and MUFA (in summer), which points to a higher degree of storage of neutral lipids in this sex. Male and female limpets at the exposed site had a significantly higher FAME, SFA, MUFA, PUFA and highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) content than the corresponding sex in the sheltered site in summer. In addition, an inversion in the eicosapentacnoic acid (EPA)/arachidonic acid (ARA) and (n - 3)/(n - 6) ratios was observed in the sheltered site, as a result of the significantly higher levels of ARA and (n - 6) fatty acids and lower amounts of EPA and (n - 3) fatty acids found in the sheltered limpets. A high variability among patches in the fatty acid composition in the exposed site was found in winter, possibly related to the aggregation of limpets at this time. The differences found between limpets from the exposed and sheltered sites suggest qualitative and quantitative differences in their diets. Additionally, the results show that the spatial aggregation strategy adopted by limpets in sites of great wave and wind exposure does not affect their feeding and reproductive success, at least in the site examined here. In fact, more developed gonads, a higher GSI and an elevated FAME content was found in the exposed population. Possible factors are suggested and discussed to explain these observations.

AB In a New Jersey Quercus-Fagus-Acer saccharum forest (Drew University Forest Preserve), the exotic tree Norway maple (A. platanoides) is a major and growing presence in all size classes. Norway maple, long one of North America's favorite shade trees, is invading nature preserves in New Jersey and elsewhere. Research in the Drew Forest Preserve shows that the forest is not a tight, resilient unit that repels invasions. Norway maple does not rely upon disturbance or edges. Norway maple seedlings are shade-tolerant and abundant, far outnumbering sugar maple and beech seedlings in the heart of the forest preserve. An analysis of population size and age structure shows that Norway maple trees date back to 1915 or earlier and are present in all subsequent age classes. Spatial studies show clumped distributions for Norway maples as for other plant species but show no restriction to edges. In the understory, species richness is significantly lower beneath Norway maple than under sugar maple or beech, and most stems under Norway maple are additional Norway maples. A restoration experiment (with tree removal plots and seedling removal plots) was begun in 1998 in a patch of 75-year-old sugar and Norway maples; this unusually simple two-species area will elucidate the competitive interaction over time. Other invasive species also penetrate relatively undisturbed forest; Lonicera japonica, Alliaria petiolata, Berberis thunbergii, and Wisteria floribunda are present alongside Norway maple in the Drew Forest Preserve. Nor is disturbance needed to admit exotic pathogens or insect pests that attack native trees. The threat to the eastern deciduous forest is grave. If the forest is not sufficiently resilient to weather the onslaught of intentional and accidental introductions, then intervention is urgently needed.

AB It is suggested that the evolution of marine mesoherbivores is influenced by the effect that these animals have on the host algae, the extent of food limitation and the ultimate factors controlling diet and habitat selection. Two contrasting models are proposed to explain the evolution of mesoherbivores: coevolution and sequential evolution. From the analysis of the available information on the biology and ecology of mesoherbivores it is obvious that: (i) no generalization can be made on the impact of mesoherbivores on the host algae, (ii) food limitation in mesoherbivores may be a common event, operating through diffuse competition, (iii) mesoherbivores have the potentiality to locate and colonize any host alga present in the habitat and, (iv) host selection, and possibly diet, is subordinate to habitat selection. Considering these results altogether, it follows that we cannot support or reject either of the two proposed models. Some suggestions are made for future research that might fill in the gaps in our knowledge of the biology and ecology of mesoherbivores.

AB Breeding snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) may be a major source of nutrients for the ecosystems on the inland nunataks (mountain outcrops) of continental Antarctica. To test this theory, the delta(15)N and delta(13)C values of soil and plants (moss, lichen and algae) from 11 nunataks with and without breeding snow petrels in northwestern Dronning Maud Land were compared. High delta(15)N values in all samples from nunataks with breeding birds provide a strong indication of the presence of breeding birds, as well as the use of bird-derived nitrogen by the plants of these ecosystems. The delta(13)C values showed little difference between the nunataks and are not a useful indicator of bird effects on ecosystem development.

AB 1. The persistence of populations of the economically important bunchgrass Themeda triandra in rangeland depends on seedling recruitment. A 2(5)-factorial field experiment in a single randomized block tested whether seedling recruitment of this grass in a semi-arid savanna would be enhanced by increased availability of seed. moisture. irradiance or gaps. or by decreased interference from vegetation: and evaluated which of seedling emergence. growth or first-year survival was critical for seedling establishment.
   2. Availability of seed had an overwhelming influence on recruitment of T. triandra in a community where it was conspicuous but not dominant. increasing recruitment 37-fold despite dramatic effects of other treatments on the abiotic environment and sward structure.
   3. Provided seed was available, shading increased seedling recruitment 7-fold by enhancing both emergence and seedling survival, because it conserved available moisture. Supplementation of moisture further improved recruitment of seedlings growling under shading by increasing their survival and growth during the first growing season. In turn. larger size conferred a survival advantage during the following dry season. Interference from established vegetation generally had a small effect on seedling recruitment. but decreased survival through the growing season of seedlings under shading. Both emergence and survival influenced seedling establishment.
   4. There was a strong hierarchy amongst factors influencing seedling recruitment of T. triandra because of the magnitude of individual effects and the dependence of some factors on others. The overriding effects of seed and moisture availability suggest that recruitment of T. triandra may be vulnerable to heavy grazing, which would curtail seed input, during critical years of sufficient rainfall for recruitment.

AB The foods of wild juvenile saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) are described, and rates of feeding, nutrient intake and growth are quantified. The size of prey eaten is strongly bimodal: large numbers of small prey (mainly crustaceans) and small numbers of large prey (mainly rats). The nutrient intake levels reflect size related changes in diet (more larger prey in larger crocodiles). The average juvenile diet is characterized by 70-71% water, low fat levels (3.0-4.5%), high protein content (12.7-14.7%), and calcium:phosphorus ratios which decline from 7:1 in animals 300-599 mm total length (TL), to 2:1 in animals 900-1200 mm TL. A mean food conversion rate (wet weight to wet weight) of 82.4% is derived, which is appreciably higher than results obtained from captive crocodilians (17-40%). To maintain similar growth rates, a wild juvenile C. porosus of 682 mm TL requires food equivalent to 4% of its body weight per week, whereas captive counterparts require four times that amount. The physiological mechanisms associated with digestion and assimilation may not function as efficiently when the stomach is repeatedly filled to capacity, as occurs in captivity.

LA English
DT Article
ID FOOD
AB We present a rule-based, event-driven model of foraging behavior, and use it to demonstrate the influence of structure and variability of habitats in determining the foraging efficiency of an individual herbivore. The structural and distributional properties of resources were assigned based on vegetation measurements in subalpine habitats in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska. The forager was characterized in terms of the physical, physiological, and cognitive attributes of a moose (Alces alces). We modelled movement as a sequence of steps in response to perceived resources. Simulation of foraging behavior in the model was event-driven. Artificial habitats were simulated to evaluate the influence of biomass per plant and mean bite size of plants on the foraging efficiency of the simulated animal. The mean rate of dry matter intake, and the 24-h activity budgets simulated by the model were similar to those reported for moose by Risenhoover. Foraging efficiency varied with changes in the size and variability of plants and individual bites available in the habitat. We discuss the results of our simulations in terms of modelling at the individual level.

AB Phyllopod populations were monitored in three temporary pools differing in the amount of submerged, peripheral vegetation present, surface area and duration. The effects of these factors on the life history strategies employed by phyllopods were investigated.  Triops granarius, various conchostracan species and the anostracan Branchipodopsis sp. inhabited the periphery of two pools where rooted, submerged vegetation was abundant while three Streptocephalus species dominated the central, unvegetated regions of the pools and the unvegetated pool. This distribution pattern appeared to be related to the animals' morphology and feeding habits. The peripheral regions of the pools were stressful habitats since they were colonized by large numbers of predators and competitors 30-40 days after inundation and they dried out sooner than the centre. The 'peripheral' species exhibited typical r-selected life history strategies; they grew rapidly, reproduced early and had short lifespans and in this way they overcame the threats presented by their habitat. The 'central' species took advantage of their predator-free, more stable habitat and exhibited life history patterns which tended towards the K-end of the r-K continuum. A degree of intraspecific variation in growth and reproduction was obvious and appeared to be related to differences in habitat duration of the three pools.

AB Rapid biodiversity loss has prompted global action to prevent further declines, yet coordinated conservation action among nations remains elusive. As a result, species with ranges that span international borders-which include 53.8% of terrestrial birds, mammals and amphibians-are in increasing peril through uncoordinated management and artificial barriers to human movement, such as border fences. Transboundary conservation initiatives represent a unique opportunity to better protect species through coordinated management across national borders. Using metrics of governance, collaboration and human pressure, we provide an index of transboundary conservation feasibility to assess global opportunities and challenges for different nations. While the transboundary conservation potential of securing multinational threatened species varied substantially, there are distinct opportunities in South-East Asia, Northern Europe, North America and South America. But to successfully avert the loss of transboundary species, the global community must be prepared to invest in some regions facing greater implementation challenges, including the nations of Central Africa, where efforts may necessitate establishing rapid conservation interventions postconflict that align with local socio-cultural opportunities and constraints. Sanctioned and coordinated approaches towards managing transboundary species are now essential to prevent further declines of many endangered species, and global policy efforts must do more to produce and enact legitimate mechanisms for collaborative action in conservation.
   Species with ranges that span international borders pose particular challenges for conservation management. Here, the authors develop an index of transboundary feasibility, and identify regions of the world with high conservation potential across national borders.

AB Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) or formerly known as early mortality syndrome (EMS) is an emerging disease that has caused significant economic losses to the aquaculture industry. The primary causative agent of AHPND is Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that has gained plasmids encoding the fatal binary toxins Pir A/Pir B that cause rapid death of the infected shrimp. In this review, the current research studies and information about AHPND in shrimps have been presented. Molecular diagnostic tools and potential treatments regarding AHPND were also included. This review also includes relevant findings which may serve as guidelines that can help for further investigation and studies on AHPND or other shrimp diseases.

AB Bays in coastal upwelling regions are physically driven and biochemically fueled by their interaction with open coastal waters. Wind-driven flow over the shelf imposes a circulation in the bay, which is also influenced by local wind stress and thermal bay ocean density differences. Three types of bays are recognized based on the degree of exposure to coastal currents and winds (wide-open bays, square bays, and elongated bays), and the characteristic circulation and stratification patterns of each type are described. Retention of upwelled waters in bays allows for dense phytoplankton blooms that support productive bay ecosystems. Retention is also important for the accumulation of larvae, which accounts for high recruitment in bays. In addition, bays are coupled to the shelf ecosystem through export of plankton-rich waters during relaxation events. Ocean acidification and deoxygenation are a concern in bays because local extrema can develop beneath strong stratification.

AB Animal population sizes are often estimated using aerial sample counts by human observers, both for wildlife and livestock. The associated methods of counting remained more or less the same since the 1970s, but suffer from low precision and low accuracy of population estimates. Aerial counts using cost-efficient Unmanned Aerial Vehicles or microlight aircrafts with cameras and an automated animal detection algorithm can potentially improve this precision and accuracy. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of the multi-class convolutional neural network RetinaNet in detecting elephants, giraffes and zebras in aerial images from two Kenyan animal counts. The algorithm detected 95% of the number of elephants, 91% of giraffes and 90% of zebras that were found by four layers of human annotation, of which it correctly detected an extra 2.8% of elephants, 3.8% giraffes and 4.0% zebras that were missed by all humans, while detecting only 1.6 to 5.0 false positives per true positive. Furthermore, the animal detections by the algorithm were less sensitive to the sighting distance than humans were. With such a high recall and precision, we posit it is feasible to replace manual aerial animal count methods (from images and/or directly) by only the manual identification of image bounding boxes selected by the algorithm and then use a correction factor equal to the inverse of the undercounting bias in the calculation of the population estimates. This correction factor causes the standard error of the population estimate to increase slightly compared to a manual method, but this increase can be compensated for when the sampling effort would increase by 23%. However, an increase in sampling effort of 160% to 1,050% can be attained with the same expenses for equipment and personnel using our proposed semi-automatic method compared to a manual method. Therefore, we conclude that our proposed aerial count method will improve the accuracy of population estimates and will decrease the standard error of population estimates by 31% to 67%. Most importantly, this animal detection algorithm has the potential to outperform humans in detecting animals from the air when supplied with images taken at a fixed rate.

AB Rapid improvements in the technology used to assess microbial communities have led to an expansion of the breadth and scope of microbial ecology research over the past 20 y. The rapid increase in microbiome research, spurred by next-generation amplicon sequencing, has allowed researchers to characterize the microbial communities of organisms and environments which were previously poorly understood. Research on marine invertebrates is still developing, with the mechanisms that determine interactions between the host and their associated microbes largely unknown. Bivalves are of particular interest because of their crucial ecological and economic roles. With the anticipation of shifting environmental conditions, defining the natural variation and role of bivalve-associated microbes is vital to more complex research questions. The current knowledge of the spatial and temporal distributions of bivalve-associated microbes, microbial functional and genetic diversity, host-specific and tissue-specific interactions, and core microbial community composition is summarized here, as well as the beginning stages of understanding the role of microbiome in bivalve physiology and disease susceptibility.

AB Aim: We studied the novel weapons hypothesis in the context of the broadly distributed tree species Eucalyptus globulus. We evaluated the hypothesis that this Australian species would produce stronger inhibitory effects on species from its non-native range than on species from its native range.
   Location: We worked in four countries where this species is exotic (U.S.A., Chile, India, Portugal) and one country where it is native (Australia).
   Time period: 2009-2012.
   Major taxa studied: Plants.
   Methods: We compared species composition, richness and height of plant communities in 20 paired plots underneath E. globulus individuals and open areas in two sites within its native range and each non-native region. We also compared effects of litter leachates of E. globulus on root growth of seedlings in species from Australia, Chile, the U.S.A. and India.
   Results: In all sites and countries, the plant community under E. globulus canopies had lower species richness than did the plant community in open areas. However, the reduction was much greater in the non-native ranges: species richness declined by an average of 51% in the eight non-native sites versus 8% in the two native Australian sites. The root growth of 15 out of 21 species from the non-native range were highly suppressed by E. globulus litter leachates, whereas the effect of litter leachate varied from facilitation to suppression for six species native to Australia. The mean reduction in root growth for Australian plants was significantly lower than for plants from the U.S.A., Chile and India.
   Main conclusions: Our results show biogeographical differences in the impact of an exotic species on understorey plant communities. Consistent with the novel weapons hypothesis, our findings suggest that different adaptations of species from the native and non-native ranges to biochemical compounds produced by an exotic species may play a role in these biogeographical differences.

AB Vegetation fires affect human infrastructures, ecosystems, global vegetation distribution, and atmospheric composition. However, the climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic factors that control global fire activity in vegetation are only poorly understood, and in various complexities and formulations are represented in global process-oriented vegetation-fire models. Data-driven model approaches such as machine learning algorithms have successfully been used to identify and better understand controlling factors for fire activity. However, such machine learning models cannot be easily adapted or even implemented within process-oriented global vegetation-fire models. To overcome this gap between machine learning-based approaches and process-oriented global fire models, we introduce a new flexible data-driven fire modelling approach here (Satellite Observations to predict FIre Activity, SOFIA approach version 1). SOFIA models can use several predictor variables and functional relationships to estimate burned area that can be easily adapted with more complex process-oriented vegetation-fire models. We created an ensemble of SOFIA models to test the importance of several predictor variables. SOFIA models result in the highest performance in predicting burned area if they account for a direct restriction of fire activity under wet conditions and if they include a land cover-dependent restriction or allowance of fire activity by vegetation density and biomass. The use of vegetation optical depth data from microwave satellite observations, a proxy for vegetation biomass and water content, reaches higher model performance than commonly used vegetation variables from optical sensors. We further analyse spatial patterns of the sensitivity between anthropogenic, climate, and vegetation predictor variables and burned area. We finally discuss how multiple observational datasets on climate, hydrological, vegetation, and socioeconomic variables together with data-driven modelling and model-data integration approaches can guide the future development of global process-oriented vegetation-fire models.

AB In plant-pollinator networks, the floral morphology of food plants is an important determinant of the interaction niche of pollinators. Studies on foraging preferences of pollinators combining experimental and observational approaches may help to understand the mechanisms behind patterns of interactions and niche partitioning within pollinator communities. In this study, we tested whether morphological floral traits were associated with foraging preferences of hummingbirds for artificial and natural flower types in Costa Rica. We performed field experiments with artificial feeders, differing in length and curvature of flower types, to quantify the hummingbirds' interaction niche under unlimited nectar resources. To quantify the interaction niche under real-world conditions of limited nectar resources, we measured foraging preferences of hummingbirds for a total of 34 plant species. Artificial feeders were visited by Eupherusa nigriventris and Phaethornis guy in the pre-montane forest, and Lampornis calolaemus in the lower montane forest. Under experimental conditions, all three hummingbird species overlapped their interaction niches and showed a preference for the short artificial flower type over the long-straight and the long-curved flower types. Under natural conditions, the two co-occurring hummingbird species preferred to feed on plant species with floral traits corresponding to their bill morphology. The short-billed hummingbird E.nigriventris preferred to feed on short and straight flowers, whereas the long- and curved-billed P.guy preferred long and curved natural flowers. The medium-size billed species L.calolaemus preferred to feed on flowers of medium length and did not show preferences for plant species with specific corolla curvature. Our results show that floral morphological traits constrain access by short-billed hummingbird species to nectar resources. Morphological constraints, therefore, represent one important mechanism structuring trophic networks. In addition, other factors, such as competition and differences in resource quantity or quality, define the interaction niches of consumer species in real-world communities, enforcing patterns of niche segregation between co-occurring consumer species. This suggests that experimental studies are needed to disentangle effects of morphological constraints from those of competition for resources in plant-pollinator interactions and other types of trophic interactions.

AB Knowledge of population dynamics is essential for managing and conserving wildlife. Traditional methods of counting wild animals such as aerial survey or ground counts not only disturb animals, but also can be labour intensive and costly. New, commercially available very high-resolution satellite images offer great potential for accurate estimates of animal abundance over large open areas. However, little research has been conducted in the area of satellite-aided wildlife census, although computer processing speeds and image analysis algorithms have vastly improved. This paper explores the possibility of detecting large animals in the open savannah of Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya from very high-resolution GeoEye-1 satellite images. A hybrid image classification method was employed for this specific purpose by incorporating the advantages of both pixel-based and object-based image classification approaches. This was performed in two steps: firstly, a pixel-based image classification method, i.e., artificial neural network was applied to classify potential targets with similar spectral reflectance at pixel level; and then an object-based image classification method was used to further differentiate animal targets from the surrounding landscapes through the applications of expert knowledge. As a result, the large animals in two pilot study areas were successfully detected with an average count error of 8.2%, omission error of 6.6% and commission error of 13.7%. The results of the study show for the first time that it is feasible to perform automated detection and counting of large wild animals in open savannahs from space, and therefore provide a complementary and alternative approach to the conventional wildlife survey techniques.

AB The effect of a pine invasion on the fuel characteristics was studied to predict fire behaviour and hypothesize potential changes on fire regime. Subalpine Andean forests, fire-prone environments, in the Malalcahuello Reserve in south-central Chile were invaded by the non-native Pinus contorta affecting the native endangered trees Araucaria araucana and Nothofagus antarctica communities. Several fuel components were evaluated by studying different variables, such as fuel load, vertical and horizontal continuity, and flammability of native and invasive tree species. The survey was conducted in five stand conditions: A. araucana and N. antarctica stands, each with and without invasion of P. contorta, and stands with only P. contorta (invasion source). The invasion of P. contorta increased the vertical fuel continuity in the Araucaria forest. The flammability analysis showed that P. contorta is a species highly flammable in comparison to the native trees. The invasion of P. contorta in the Malalcahuello Reserve is under progression and if the process of invasion continues the effects on fuel characteristics will increase. These results suggest that wildfires will be more intense and severe, and that the type of fires of the Malalcahuello Reserve will change from a mixed fire regime to a crown fire regime. These changes will affect plant regeneration, and a positive feedback that favours the P. contorta invasion could emerge. Long-term studies to understand the effect of invasive woody plants on the fire regime are essential for the control of these invasions, especially for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem processes in the Araucaria-Nothofagus ecosystems is the Chilean and Argentinean Patagonia.

AB Themeda triandra is a perennial tussock grass endemic to Africa, Australia and Asia. Within these regions it is found across a broad range of climates, geological substrates and ecosystems. Because it is widespread across these areas it has great economic and ecological value, as it is a relatively palatable species across most of its range. It is of critical importance in supporting local populations of both native and introduced herbivores, and is thus central to wildlife and livestock production, and consequently rural livelihoods. It is an important climax or subclimax species that is well adapted to fire, a common element of many areas where it is found. Inappropriate grazing management, however, can result in a decline of Themeda, as it is not well adapted to an uninterrupted, selective grazing regime. A decline in abundance of Themeda in a grassland is usually coupled to a decline in grazing value, species richness, cover and ecosystem function. In spite of its significant ecological and economic importance, there has been no attempt to review and synthesise the considerable body of research undertaken on this grass. Our aim is to summarise and synthesis work previously undertaken and identify areas where further research is required.

DT Article
DE comparative ecology; fire; plant architecture; plant functional trait
ID PLANT FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; FIRE SPREAD; ECOSYSTEMS; EVOLUTION
AB Fire ecology has been hindered by the lack of comparable, affordable protocols to quantify the flammability of whole plants over large numbers of species. We describe a low-tech device that can be carried to the field and that allows highly standardized measurement of the flammability of whole individuals or portions up to 70 cm long. We illustrate its potential with results for 34 species belonging to different growth forms from central Argentina. The device consists of an 85 60 cm half-cut metallic barrel placed horizontally and mounted on a removable metallic structure. It contains three parallel burners, a grill with an attached gauging thermometer and a blowtorch. Burners and blowtorch are connected to a propane-butane gas cylinder. Plant samples are placed on the grill and preheated with the burners for 2 min at 150 degrees C. They are then ignited for 10 s with the blowtorch while the burners are kept on. Four parameters are measured for each sample: maximum temperature reached, burning time, burnt length and burnt biomass percentage. These parameters are used to construct a compound index of flammability for each sample that ranges between 0 (no flammability) and around 3 (maximum flammability). We obtained a wide range of values for flammability and all its components. Most of this variability was accounted for by differences between growth forms and species, rather than by differences at the level of replicates. This suggests that the device and protocol are sensitive enough to detect flammability differences among plants with different functional traits, and at the same time robust enough to produce consistent results among samples with similar traits. A major advantage is that plant architecture is kept almost intact, providing a flammability measure much closer to that of whole individuals in the field than those obtained by other standard protocols in use. The device and protocol presented here should facilitate the acquisition of comparable flammability data over large numbers of species from different floras and ecosystems, potentially contributing to several fields of research, such as functional ecology, evolutionary ecology and vegetation-atmosphere modelling.

AB Physical and biological evidence supports the probable existence of an enclave of relatively warm climate located between the Southern Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean in the United States during the Last Glacial Maximum. The region supported a mosaic of forest and prairie habitats inhabited by a "Floridian" ice-age biota. Plant and vertebrate remains suggest an ecological gradient towards Cape Hatteras (35 degrees N) wherein forests tended to replace prairies, and browsing proboscideans tended to replace grazing proboscideans. Beyond 35 degrees N, warm waters of the Gulf Stream were deflected towards the central Atlantic, and a cold-facies biota replaced "Floridian" biota on the Atlantic coastal plain. Because of niche diversity and relatively benign climate, biodiversity may have been greater in the south-eastern thermal enclave than in other unglaciated areas of North America. However, the impact of terminal Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions may also have been shorter and more severe in the enclave than further north. A comparison with biotic changes that occurred in North America approximately 55 million years (ma) ago at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum suggests that similar processes of change took place under both ice-house and greenhouse climates.

AB The introduction of alien tree species may cause a threat to biodiversity. Introduction should not be allowed if there are doubts concerning invasiveness of the introduced species. The plantations of red oak (Quercus rubra L.) in Lithuanian forests are established in 79 stands on an area of about 116 ha. However, its invasiveness has not been studied yet. The aim of the work is to ascertain the interaction between the red oak and native flora as well as to assess the expediency of growing red oak in Lithuanian forests. Red oak spreads more abundantly than common oak on less fertile sites. It has an adverse effect on the structure of local floral communities such as the number of grass species and their ocurrence degree decreases. Consequently, 11 nemoral grass species are not detected any more. The soil in the stands of red oak contains 34% less micromycetes, 20% less mineralizing and 5% less ammonifying microorganisms, than the soil in the stands of common oak. It contains lower amounts of the most trace elements important for the nutrition of plants than the soil in the stands of common oak. The intensity of red oak invasiveness is higher than the mean (0.65), possible distribution level is medium (0.57), the level of adverse effect on society is lower than the mean (0.35). We ascertained that introduction of red oak in Lithuanian forests is not advantageous from ecological viewpoint.

AB Behaviourally and ecologically dominant ants are thought to structure ant communities through their monopolization of resources. Effects of a dominant ant, Iridomyrmex purpureus, on resource use by ant communities were tested using an exclusion experiment on sandstone outcrops near Sydney, in south-eastern Australia. The success of functionally different ants at honey and mealworm baits placed in rock and vegetation microhabitats was measured in a series of surveys before and after exclusion. I. purpureus was successfully excluded from the outcrops and patterns of resource use following I. purpureus exclusion were consistent with those of sites without I. purpureus and procedural control sites. At sites with I. purpureus, resources were discovered more rapidly, however, other ants were less successful, particularly on rock substrates. Iridomyrmex spp. were more successful on rock than in vegetation, however, in the presence of I. purpureus, the success of other Iridomyrmex on rock substrates and at honey baits was reduced. Camponotine and myrmicine ants had low success at baits and tended to be less successful in the presence of I. purpureus. In contrast, the opportunist Rhytidoponera metallica was not affected by the presence of I. purpureus and was more successful in the vegetation habitat. These findings indicate that the dominant ant affects the success of other ants at baits, particularly the ecologically similar Iridomyrmex. However, effects of I. purpureus on other taxa differ between habitats differing in complexity and resources differing in composition and defensibility.

AB Habitat degradation through over-grazing and wood collection is especially prevalent in developing countries such as South Africa. As human populations expand and the demand for land increases, the traditional idiom of setting aside protected areas for conservation is insufficient and assessment and protection of diversity outside these areas is needed. We assessed the impact of land use on lizard assemblages in communal rangelands in South Africa by comparing abundance, species richness and species diversity between degraded communal lands with a protected area. We first quantified vegetation differences between the study areas and found marked differences. Communal lands had significantly fewer large trees and less ground cover. Contrary to prediction, we found no evidence that any species of lizard was negatively affected by habitat disturbance. Some species were more common in communal lands, and species richness and diversity were also higher using certain sampling techniques. Terrestrial diversity was likely enhanced due to the preference of many terrestrial lizards for open, sparsely grassed areas. We discuss other reasons for increased diversity such as the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and/or reduced numbers of predators and competitors. We also conducted surveys of households and traditional healers to investigate the relationship between human uses of reptiles and abundance. The predominant users of reptiles were traditional healers. The most commonly used species were not encountered in our field surveys, and respondents indicated that they appeared to be declining. Our results emphasise the importance of integrating local knowledge into biodiversity assessment and conservation planning. Although we did not identify a negative impact of disturbance on lizard communities, community structure was different and this likely influenced ecosystem integrity and function in some way.

AB This study was an investigation of the diet and of prey selection by a population of African wild dogs Lycaon pictus in the Save Valley Conservancy (SVC) in the south-east lowveld of Zimbabwe. The diet of the dogs, based on the number of kills for each species located, consisted almost entirely of impala Aepyceras melampus (74%) and kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros (22%), the two most abundant medium-sized antelope in the area. The level of selection for different prey classes killed by the wild dogs was investigated and it was found that the wild dogs: (1) exhibited strong selection for a number of prey classes on a seasonal basis; (2) selected kudu throughout the year but showed little selection between the other prey species; (3) selected the young of both impala and kudu and selected males at times of the rut. Bone marrow analysis showed that prey killed by the wild dogs on SVC were in poorer condition than unselectively culled individuals suggesting the selection of the weaker individuals in the prey populations.

   SIZE; PREY; SNAKES; NICHE; PERFORMANCE; POPULATIONS
AB In snakes and other predators that swallow their food whole, gape size sets an upper limit to ingestible prey size. Individuals that vary in body size and swallowing capacity will therefore differ not only in energy requirements but also in rates of food intake. Here I show that size-frequency distribution of available prey may be an important determinant of life-history evolution in snakes and other gape-limited predators. A simple model is presented for the rate of net energy gain of gape-limited predators during food scarcity as a function of body size and swallowing capacity of the predator. Net energy gain is defined as the difference between rates of energy intake and expenditure while searching for prey, and thus represents the energetic scope available for growth, storage, reproduction, and survival. The model suggests that rate of energy intake will increase asymptotically with predator body size until it reaches an asymptote that differs depending on the size-frequency distribution of available prey. Rate of net energy gain will reach a maximum at intermediate or large predator size, but shift towards smaller predator body size if energy demands increase, maximum ingestible prey size increases more rapidly with predator size, or if mean body size of available prey decreases. Variation in swallowing capacity among equal-sized predators results in a difference in net energy gains that is at a maximum in intermediate-sized individuals. The model generates seven testable predictions. (1) Smaller body size does not confer an energetic advantage during periods of prey scarcity. (2) Mortality due to energy shortage sets lower and upper limits to body size. (3) Temporal shifts in size-frequency distribution of prey will result in oscillating survival selection on body size. (4) The proportion of resources allocated to energy storage and reproduction should increase with increasing body size at the expense of energy allocated to growth. (5) The reproductive advantage of large body size in females will increase with prey availability. (6) The intensity of selection on characters determining swallowing capacity will vary with body size and be lowest in larger individuals. (7) Discrimination against small prey is more likely among larger than among smaller individuals. Examples from natural populations relating to these predictions are provided.

AB Most studies of competition have classified interactions simply as interspecific or intraspecific. In doing this, individuals within a species are all assumed to be similar in their competitive ability. Consequently, the importance of variation in competitive ability among conspecific individuals is overlooked. At the Merret Rifle Range, in Williamstown (Victoria), the limpet Cellana tramoserica (Sowerby) occurs in high densities. We examined competitive interactions between limpets of different sizes from this population to test assumptions about competitive abilities among conspecific individuals. The effects of competition between and within size-classes were investigated by manipulating biomass in field experiments. Large limpets were affected by competition with both size-classes. Increased biomass (whether of small or large limpets) resulted in reduced growth rates of large limpets, but no mortality. Survivorship and growth of small limpets decreased markedly when caged with other small individuals, but were not affected by competition with large limpets, except at very high densities. The abundance of microalgae within enclosures was reduced more by small limpets than large limpets, regardless of biomass. The effect of small limpets on microalgal abundance increased with increasing biomass, whereas large limpets showed no such pattern. These results indicate strong asymmetrical, exploitative competition between different size-classes of the limpet C. tramoserica. The mechanisms determining competitive ability in different sized limpets were also investigated. Small and large limpets had different sized radulae. The radular teeth of large limpets were longer and more widely spaced than those of small limpets. At the Rifle Range, the surface of the feeding substratum is highly pitted, and these pits are a source of microalgae. We propose a model in which smaller radulae allow small limpets better access to food within small pits, and thus a greater amount of the microalgal resource, to explain the superior competitive ability of small limpets.

AB Small-scale (within-shore) and broad-scale (among-shore) patterns of distribution, abundance and size structure of Nodilittorina pyramidalis were measured on a number of shores in New South Wales. This species showed significant patchiness in distribution and size structure. The mean density and mean shell length of snails differed among patches of shore only a few metres apart, among different heights on the shore and from shore to shore. Differences in densities appeared to be strongly correlated to the distribution of particular microhabitats, especially cracks, crevices and pits within the rock surface. This relationship and the presence or absence of these microhabitats appeared to determine the patterns of distribution of this species within and among different shores. The sizes of snails were not correlated with densities of Nodilittorina nor with the coexisting species, Littorina unifasciata, in the populations examined. Processes influencing the distribution and abundance of Nodilittorina were not investigated, but the patterns of distribution found on these shores suggest that recruitment was limited to areas of topographic complexity. It also seems likely that limited dispersal by the adult snails retain them within restricted patches on the shore.

AB Mapping urban vegetation is a prerequisite to accurately understanding landscape patterns and ecological services provided by urban vegetation. However, the uncertainties in fine-scale vegetation biodiversity mapping still exist in capturing vegetation functional types efficiently at fine scale. To facilitate the application of fine-scale vegetation spatial configuration used for urban landscape planning and ecosystem service valuation, we present an approach integrating object-based classification with vegetation phenology for fine-scale vegetation functional type mapping in compact city of Beijing, China. The phenological information derived from two WorldView-2 imagery scenes, acquired on 14 September 2012 and 26 November 2012, was used to aid in the classification of tree functional types and grass. Then we further compared the approach to that of using only one WorldView imagery. We found WorldView-2 imagery can be successfully applied to map functional types of urban vegetation with its high spatial resolution and relatively high spectral resolution. The application of the vegetation phenology into classification greatly improved the overall accuracy of classification from 82.3% to 91.1%. In particular, the accuracies of vegetation types was improved by from 10% to 13.26%. The approach integrating vegetation phenology with high-resolution remote sensed images provides an efficient tool to incorporate multi-temporal data into fine-scale urban classification.

AB 1. Variation in grass height is beneficial to biodiversity conservation in savanna landscapes. Theory predicts that small fires can promote short-grass areas within savannas. We experimentally assessed the influence of fire season and size on grass height and the resultant response of wild grazer communities and tested three hypotheses: (1) repeated small fires in tall-grass savannas increase short-grass grazer densities in the post-burn environment; (2) increased grazer densities maintain grass height in a short, palatable state and drive feedbacks that exclude fire; and (3) late-dry season burns concentrate grazers more effectively than early dry season burns.
   2. We repeatedly applied annual treatments (unburned, early- and late-burns) in 0.25-, 5- and 25-ha plots over a period of 3years in a tall-grass savanna system in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Dung counts for grazer density and grass height data were collected along 50-m transects. Grass height was measured in paired 1-m(2) herbivore exclosures on plots before and after applied fires.
   3. Dung data indicate that wildebeest occurred most frequently in grass heights below 5cm. Their preference for plots regardless of fire size or season increased over time with each repeated burn. Zebra and buffalo favoured burns immediately post-fire, but buffalo did not actively select for burnt areas over longer time periods.
   4. By the second year of treatment, herbivory maintained 28% and 91% of the grass height below 10cm in the early- and late-season burns respectively. In contrast, herbivory on the unburned treatments had no effect on grass height.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Fires less than 25ha in size attracted sufficient grazing herbivores to shorten grass height. Repetition of the fire treatments resulted in the active selection of these areas in the longer term by wildebeest, impala and, to a lesser degree, zebra. Grazing pressure was high enough to initiate positive feedbacks and maintain lawns after only two seasons of burning and, depending on the season of burn, reduced grass height to a level that excluded repeat fires. Our study demonstrated that theory on grazer use of the post-fire environment can be implemented practically by applying small repeated burns to promote the formation of short-grass areas within savannas.

AB Urbanization affects landscape structure and the overall human condition in numerous ways. Green spaces include vegetated land cover (e.g., urban forests, trees, riparian zones, parks) which play a distinctive role in urban ecology. This article reviews emergent literature on the linkages between urban green spaces, social justice, and human health. We explore this subject in the context of landscape structure, ecosystem services, and distributional equity as it relates to various health outcomes. Finally, we conclude by identifying gaps in the scholarship and potential areas of future research.

AB Recent analyses revealed that most of the biodiversity observed in marine microbial communities is represented by organisms with low abundance but, nonetheless essential for ecosystem dynamics and processes across both temporal and spatial scales. Surprisingly, few studies have considered the effect of macroorganism-microbe interactions on the ecology and distribution dynamics of rare microbial taxa. In this review, we synthesize several lines of evidence that these relationships cannot be neglected any longer. First, we provide empirical support that the microbiota of macroorganisms represents a significant part of marine bacterial biodiversity and that host-microbe interactions benefit to certain microbial populations which are part of the rare biosphere (i.e., opportunistic copiotrophic organisms). Second, we reveal the major role that macroorganisms may have on the dispersal and the geographic distribution of microbes. Third, we introduce an innovative and integrated view of the interactions between microbes and macroorganisms, namely sustaining the rares, which suggests that macroorganisms favor the maintenance of marine microbial diversity and are involved in the regulation of its richness and dynamics. Finally, we show how this hypothesis complements existing theories in microbial ecology and offers new perspectives about the importance of macroorganisms for the microbial biosphere, particularly the rare members.

AB Has land surface cover in South America been impacted by the loss of most large herbivores following the severe Pleistocene and Early Holocene megafauna extinctions on this continent? Here, we estimate how mean savanna woody biomass may have changed in the Americas following these extinctions by creating an empirical model to understand how large herbivores impact savanna woody biomass. To create this empirical model, we combine a large recently published dataset of savanna woody cover from Lehmann et al. (2014) (n = 2154 plots) with estimates of mammals ranges and weights from the IUCN database. We evaluate how variables such as number of megaherbivores (mammal species 1000 kg), log10 sum species weights, and total number of mammal species predict changes to woody cover by using both ordinary least squares regression analysis (OLS) and simultaneous auto-regressive (SAR) analysis to control for spatial autocorrelation. Both number of megaherbivores and log10 sum species weights, which both disproportionately weight for megaherbivores, significantly explained much (approximate to 5-13%) variance in woody cover, but the third variable weighting all animals equally, did not. We then combined these biotic variables with abiotic variables such as temperature, precipitation, and fire frequency to create a model predicting 36% of the variance of savanna woody cover. We used this model combined with estimated range maps of extinct South American megafauna to estimate that had those South American megafauna not gone extinct, total savanna woody cover in South America could possibly have decreased by approximate to 29% and that savannas would likely have been more open like current African savannas.

AB Tree densities in tropical and sub-tropical vegetation have, until recently, long been understood as increasing proportionally in response to precipitation. Current understanding is that trees are organised into alternative states with divergent properties that are linked, in the case of savannas, to frequent grass-fuelled fires or the absence of fire in non-savannas. In this paper we explored the hypothesis of functional divergence in three biomes, defined structurally by their dominant growth forms: savannas, 'thicket' and forest, within the vegetation of a South African park (Hluhluwe-iMfolozi). Thicket and forest both lack a continuous C4 grassy layer and are therefore non-savannas. 'Thicket', as defined here, has shorter trees than forests (4-6 m vs. >10 m) and, often a dense understorey of sub-shrubs. We analysed tree species composition in 253 sites across these three biomes. We then compared herbivore use and fire frequency among the three biomes. Finally we characterised functional traits for 58 tree species including several linked to fire and herbivore responses. In support of the emerging alternative states paradigm for both tree density and phylogenetic composition, we found that the three structurally defined biomes had separate tree species assemblages. Differences in growth form, especially the presence or absence of C4 grasses had key consequences for consumers with high fire frequency in savannas, low in thickets and none in forest and high grazing in savannas, high browsing in thickets and very low herbivory in forests. Trait analysis was consistent with these differences among biomes. Consumers appear to be important environmental filters by admitting some tree species to a biome and excluding others, depending on their functional traits. Positive feedbacks between vegetation and consumers may explain the coexistence of biomes in areas with similar climate and geology. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Specialized interactions help structure communities, but persistence of specialized organisms is puzzling because a generalist can occupy more environments and partake in more beneficial interactions. The "Jack-of-all-trades is a master of none" hypothesis asserts that specialists persist because the fitness of a generalist utilizing a particular habitat is lower than that of a specialist adapted to that habitat. Yet, there are many reasons to expect that mutualists will generalize on partners.
   Plant-soil feedbacks help to structure plant and microbial communities, but how frequently are soil-based symbiotic mutualistic interactions sufficiently specialized to influence species distributions and community composition? To address this question, we quantified realized partner richness and phylogenetic breadth of four wild-grown native legumes (Lupinus bicolor, L. arboreus, Acmispon strigosus and A. heermannii) and performed inoculation trials to test the ability of two hosts (L. bicolor and A. strigosus) to nodulate (fundamental partner richness), benefit from (response specificity), and provide benefit to (effect specificity) 31 Bradyrhizobium genotypes.
   Results: In the wild, each Lupinus species hosted a broader genetic range of Bradyrhizobium than did either Acmispon species, suggesting that Acmispon species are more specialized. In the greenhouse, however, L. bicolor and A. strigosus did not differ in fundamental association specificity: all inoculated genotypes nodulated both hosts. Nevertheless, A. strigosus exhibited more specificity, i.e., greater variation in its response to, and effect on, Bradyrhizobium genotypes. Lupinus bicolor benefited from a broader range of genotypes but averaged less benefit from each. Both hosts obtained more fitness benefit from symbionts isolated from conspecific hosts; those symbionts in turn gained greater fitness benefit from hosts of the same species from which they were isolated.
   Conclusions: This study affirmed two important tenets of evolutionary theory. First, as predicted by the Jack-of-all-trades is a master of none hypothesis, specialist A. strigosus obtained greater benefit from its beneficial symbionts than did generalist L. bicolor. Second, as predicted by coevolutionary theory, each test species performed better with partner genotypes isolated from conspecifics. Finally, positive fitness feedback between the tested hosts and symbionts suggests that positive plant-soil feedback could contribute to their patchy distributions in this system.

AB We investigated the role of fire in controlling bush thickening in arid savannas. Three controlled fires were initiated to investigate the responses of planted seedlings, saplings and mature shrubs. The stem diameters of seedlings, saplings and mature shrubs prior to the fire were measured. Other dimensions of the saplings and mature shrubs such as leaf mass were also estimated. The intensity of each fire was estimated. Fire temperatures adjacent to seedlings saplings and mature shrubs were measured using fire paints on steel plates. All three fires were moderately hot. One year after each fire, the mortality of seedlings in the fire treatments was very high (97.1-99.3%) and significantly greater than in adjacent controls (16.1-51.6%). Mortality and topkill of saplings and mature shrubs were negatively related to stem diameter. Fire temperature did not significantly affect mortality and topkill in most cases. Surviving saplings showed a much greater resprout response, relative to pre fire size, than larger shrubs and trees. Our results suggest that fire is crucial in interrupting the transition from open grassy savanna to thicket in arid savannas. Managers who prevent fires at this stage are likely to experience bush thickening in the future. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The southern Africa region is a region of unique floral biodiversity; this study was undertaken to address the limited knowledge regarding the physiochemical, antioxidant activity and the ability of these honeys to protect biomolecules and cells against oxidative damage. The physicochemical properties, total polyphenolic and flavonoid content (TPC and TFC), catalase and antioxidant activity (DPPH, TEAC, and ORAC assays) of 13 representative honey samples was determined. Biological and cellular protection was investigated using the erythrocyte haemolysis, the pBR322 plasmid, as well as the dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assays in SC-1 and Caco-2 cells. High TPC, TFC, catalase and antioxidant activity was obtained, and all honeys protected DNA, erythrocytes and cells in vitro. Colour, TPC, TFC and antioxidant activity correlated well but no correlation was seen between these parameters and catalase activity, biological and cellular effects. Nevertheless, honeys with high catalase activity and/or are dark in colour with high TPC, TFC and/or antioxidant activity did show the highest degree of biological and cellular protection.

AB The influence of both local and global drivers on long-term changes in the vegetation of Namibia's extensive rangelands was investigated. Fifty-two historical photographs of the Palgrave Expedition of 1876 were re-photographed and used to document changes over more than 130 years, in grass, shrub and tree cover within three major biomes along a 1200 km climatic gradient in central and southern Namibia. We showed that patterns of change are correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) and that below a threshold of around 250 mm, vegetation has remained remarkably stable regardless of land-use or tenure regime. Above this threshold, an increase in tree cover is linked to the rainfall gradient, the legacies of historical events in the late 19th century, subsequent transformations in land-use and increased atmospheric CO2. We discuss these findings in relation to pastoral and settler societies, paleo- and historical climatic trends and predictions of vegetation change under future global warming scenarios. We argue that changes in land-use associated with colonialism (decimation of megaherbivores and wildlife browsers; fire suppression, cattle ranching), as well as the effects of CO2 fertilisation provide the most parsimonious explanations for vegetation change. We found no evidence that aridification, as projected under future climate change scenarios, has started in the region. This study provided empirical evidence and theoretical insights into the relative importance of local and global drivers of change in the savanna environments of central and southern Namibia and global savanna ecosystems more generally.

AB 1. Invasive plants destroy the structure and function of many ecosystems but removal is expensive, so the likelihood of success should be assessed before a major control programme commences. Trial clearings can clarify how best to design and perform broad-scale clearing programmes. Such trials need to consider the range of conditions that might affect the outcome of control operations, not least the duration of invasion before clearing commences, a parameter that has rarely been considered previously.
   2. The recovery of plant communities was monitored over 6 years in a Portuguese coastal dune system after the removal of invasive Acacia longifolia plants, together with the underlying litter in half of the cleared areas but not in the remainder. Areas that had been invaded for > 20 years (long-invaded) as opposed to < 7 years (recently invaded) were compared.
   3. After the removal of A. longifolia, recently invaded areas had more exotic plant species but also higher native species richness, plant cover, initial diversity and species turnover rates than long-invaded areas. Generalist native species were initially very abundant in cleared areas but progressively gave way to species more typical of dunes. Six years after clearing, many species that usually occur on dunes were still missing. Therophytes were the most abundant life form immediately after clearing, but nanophanerophytes, chamaephytes and A. longifolia increased with time. Seedlings of A. longifolia were most abundant in long-invaded areas, but litter removal along with plants promoted increased plant species richness and cover and decreased susceptibility to reinvasion.
   4. Synthesis and applications. A number of variables can affect the outcome of clearing invasive plant species. For A. longifolia on Portuguese dunes, recently invaded areas should be prioritized and thick litter layers should be removed along with the invader. Even so, recovery of native flora was not complete in this study, and other management actions are needed to supplement clearing operations, for example propagation of native species or prescribed fires to deplete the invasive species seed bank. Although complete restoration of the ecosystem will almost always be impossible, it should be possible in the long term to create an ecosystem with a structure and function that resembles the original habitat.

AB Coastal transport and cross-shelf exchanges are important factors in controlling the dispersal of human and river discharged pollutants, as well as the advection of nutrients and larvae. Altimetry-based Lagrangian techniques provide accurate information on horizontal transport in the open ocean but are unreliable close to the coast. In order to circumvent this problem, during the Lagrangian Transport Experiment 2010 campaign (Latex10, 1-24 September 2010) transport structures in the western Gulf of Lion were investigated with an adaptive sampling strategy, combining satellite data, ship-based ADCP measurements, and iterative Lagrangian drifter releases. The sampling strategy was able to identify errors in the surface transport patterns derived from altimetry, and to track with in-situ observations attractive and repelling Lagrangian coherent structures for a period of 12 days. The structures maintained a corridor similar to 10 km-wide, roughly parallel to the coast, along which waters from the continental shelf leave the gulf. This is confirmed by high-resolution SST imagery. The use of this sampling strategy to explore surface transport structures may provide important information for the environmental management of coastal regions, and may serve for validating future coastal altimetric products.

AB Desertification is often characterized by the replacement of mesophytic grasses with xerophytic shrubs. Livestock grazing is considered a key driver of shrub encroachment, although most evidence is anecdotal or confounded by other factors. Mapping of velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina) shrubs in and out of exclosures in 1932, 1948, and 2006 in semiarid grasslands of southeastern Arizona, USA, afforded the opportunity to quantify livestock grazing effects on mesquite proliferation over 74 years in the absence of fire to test the widespread assumption that livestock grazing promotes shrub proliferation. In 1932, shrub cover, density, and aboveground biomass were compared on grazed (12%, 173 plants/ha, 4182 kg/ha) and newly protected areas (8%, 203 plants/ha, 3119 kg/ha). By 1948, cover on both areas increased to similar to 18%; yet, density on the protected area increased 300% (to 620 plants/ha), nearly twice that of the grazed area (325 plants/ha). From 1932 to 1948, differences in recruitment of new plants and growth of existing plants were reflected in biomass, which was higher on the protected area (415 plants/ha, 8788 kg/ha) relative to the grazed area (155 plants/ha, 7085 kg/ha), although mortality was equally low (similar to 0.06%). In 2006, 42 years after an herbicide application reset mesquite cover to similar to 10% on both areas, aboveground mesquite mass was comparable on both areas (similar to 4700 kg/ha), but cover and density on the protected area (22%, 960 plants/ha) exceeded that on the grazed area (15%, 433 plants/ha). Mesquite mass in 2006 was substantially below 1948 levels, so continued accrual is likely. That shrub recovery from herbicides on a biomass basis was much less than recovery on a cover basis suggests that remotely sensed biomass estimates should integrate land management history. Contrary to widely held assumptions, protection from livestock since 1932 not only failed to deter woody-plant proliferation, but actually promoted it relative to grazed areas. Results suggest (1) that thresholds for grassland resistance to shrub encroachment had been crossed by the 1930s, and (2) fire management rather than grazing management may be key to maintaining grassland physiognomy in this bioclimatic region.

AB The savanna biome is defined by the codominance of grasses and trees, the precise ratio of which is a function of numerous variables, both natural and anthropogenic. Fire is a critical determinant of the tree-to-grass ratio because it can suppress tree establishment and growth. Despite the fact that nearly all fires have human causes, most savanna fire ecology models are based solely on ecological variables and fail to integrate human land and fire use patterns. To understand how human burning practices, land cover patterns, and fire regimes are linked I combined the results of an image-based burn scar analysis and land cover maps generated from a Landsat database covering thirty years with interview and survey results. I documented the spatially explicit fire regime for an area of Sudan savanna in southern Mali and linked it to human practices and land cover patterns. The study concludes that burning creates a seasonal mosaic in which some patches regularly burn early and others late, whereas some areas rarely if ever burn. Ecologists attribute mosaic fire regimes to natural factors such as plant succession, but this research demonstrates that the regime is a function of the combined effects of edaphic conditions, vegetation patterns, land use, and widespread burning practices. The anthropogenic burning regime documented here differs from the one based on ecological theory in that its spatiotemporal pattern is relatively consistent from year to year. The findings demonstrate the need to "humanize" savanna models by breaking nature-society dichotomies and synthesizing natural and social science explanations.

AB This study describes the dispersal phenology and syndromes in Gutianshan 24 ha plot in a subtropical broad-leaved forest of China. The 130 0.5 m(2) seed traps collected 69,115 mature seeds, representing 27 species (belonging to 24 genera, and 15 families) in 12 months. One marked peak in the number of seeds and species during the year was found in dry season (November). Zoochory was the most common dispersal syndrome (70.4%), followed by anemochory (18.5%), ballistic dispersal (11.1%). Among fruit types, berry (33%), capsule (22%), nut (18%), and drupe (11%) were common in the subtropical evergreen forest. In fruit color, brown was the commonest (40%), followed by dark brown (30%), black (15%), red (11%), and yellow (4%). Overall, the community level seed rain study revealed that one marked peak in seed number occurred in the middle of dry season; zoochory was the principal dispersal mode of woody plants in subtropical forest, and dry seasons favor seed dispersal by animal and wind.

AB Parallel declines of wild pollinators and pollinator-dependent plants have raised alarms over the loss of pollination services in agroecosystems. A spatially explicit approach is needed to develop specific recommendations regarding the design of agricultural landscapes to sustain wild pollinator communities and the services they provide. I modeled pollination services in agroecosystems using a pair of models: a stochastic individual-based simulation model of wild pollinators, pollinator-dependent plants, and crop pollination; and a set of coupled difference equations designed to capture the nonspatial component of the simulation model. Five spatially explicit models of habitat conversion to crops were simulated, and results for pollination services were compared. Mean-field behavior of the simulation model was in good agreement with analysis of the difference equations. A major feature of the models was the presence of a cusp leading to loss of stability and extinction of pollinators and pollinator-dependent plants beyond a critical amount of habitat loss. The addition of pollen obtained from crop visitation caused a breakdown of the cusp preventing extinction of pollinators, but not of wild pollinator-dependent plants. Spatially restricted foraging and dispersal also altered model outcomes relative to mean-field predictions, in some cases causing extinction under parameter settings that would otherwise lead to persistence. Different patterns of habitat conversion to crops resulted in different levels of pollination services. Most interesting was the finding that optimal pollination services occurred when the size of remnant habitat patches was equal to half the mean foraging and dispersal distance of pollinators and the spacing between remnant patches was equal to the mean foraging and dispersal distance. Conservation of wild pollinators and pollinator-dependent plants in agroecosystems requires careful attention to thresholds in habitat conversion and spatial pattern and scale of remnant habitats. Maximization of pollination services was generally incompatible with conservation of wild pollinator-dependent plants. My prediction is that pollination services will be maximized by providing islands of nesting habitat where interisland distance matches mean foraging distances of wild pollinators.

AB 1. Demographic processes, particularly the recruitment of seedlings, are critical to the long-term survival and re-establishment of plant populations. In many perennial grasslands successful recruitment is a rare event that requires the simultaneous favourable alignment of several environmental variables.
   2. Although a few empirical studies have examined demographic processes in perennial grasslands, most of these studies investigate the impact of only one or two environmental factors in isolation. Those studies would lead us to expect that seed availability, irrigation and burning, enhance recruitment rates whereas the presence of established competitors substantially lowers recruitment rates. But how these factors, or recruitment filters, act in concert and how they influence the different components of the recruitment process such as seedling emergence, survival and growth is not understood.
   3. For this reason we explore the relative and combined influence of four factors - seed availability, irrigation, competition by the established vegetation, and fire - on the recruitment process of a perennial grass (Stipagrostis uniplumis) in semi-arid savanna. We used a full factorial experiment to determine how these four factors influence emergence, growth, survival and flowering of seedlings.
   4. Our results show that all of the factors affected some stage of the recruitment process but not all significant effects contributed to enhancing the final number of recruits.
   5. We found enhanced seed availability to significantly enhance rates of seedling emergence but to play no further role in the recruitment process. Competition by the established vegetation exerted a strong negative effect on every step of the recruitment process. Irrigation had a minor effect on recruitment. It enhanced rates of flowering and survival during the growing season but the effect of the stimulus was short-lived and did not influence later stages of the recruitment process.
   6. In contradiction to existing theory, seedling recruitment does therefore not seem to be limited to above average rainfall years. Fire acted similarly to the removal of competitors; that is, it positively affected seedling emergence, growth, flowering and survival.
   7. Synthesis. We conclude that recruitment is not limited to above average rainfall years but triggered by events that open up the grass canopy and reduce the abundance of competitors. Specifically it appears that periodic fires enable the recruitment of new individuals into the population. This study shows that fire can play an important positive role in individual turnover of semi-arid perennial grass populations.

AB Indigenous soil seed banks play a very important role in facilitating the natural recovery of indigenous fynbos vegetation after clearing invasive alien vegetation. In densely invaded areas, there is a reduction in fynbos cover and seed production, and these ecosystems rely heavily on the remaining soil seed bank as a reservoir of plant propagules. This study used the seedling emergence approach to assess recovery potential based on the soil seed banks of riparian and hillslope grassy fynbos communities that had been densely invaded for three decades, with Acacia longifolia as the dominant alien species. Forty-eight species (of which five were aliens), representing 30 genera and 18 families, emerged from the soil seed bank, with Asteraceae and Cyperaccae being best represented. The mean density of indigenous seedlings for the study area was 1582 seedlings/m(2). Senecio rigidus exhibited the highest density, with 274 seedlings/m(2), followed by Chironia baccifera (151 seedlings/m(2)) and Rumohra adiantiformis (136 seedlings/m(2)). Forbs were the most numerous growth form. Two other alien species exhibited comparable seedling densities, i.e. Solanum nigrum (181 seedlings/m(2)) and Conyza canadensis (98 seedlings/m(2)). A. longifolia seed densities of up to 4528 seeds/m(2) were found by sieving the soil. Results revealed that alien-invaded grassy fynbos had a diverse and viable soil seed bank with relatively high seed densities. Pioneer species were well represented, as well as graminoids in the riparian zone. Species representing some guilds were missing; e.g. serotinous species from the genera Leucadendron and Protea, and few geophytes were present in the hillslope soil seed bank, although ericoid shrubs were well represented. Riparian species such as Cliffortia graminea and common Cyperaccae and Restionaceae species were also not represented in the seed bank. It would appear from this data that the soil seed bank would be adequate to enable a functional cover of indigenous vegetation to re-establish after clearing. In order to improve vegetation structure and composition, the addition of some missing guilds would facilitate restoration, provided that post-clearing follow-up treatments do not prevent or hinder the establishment of these indigenous species.

AB This paper is devoted to develop some "ad hoc'' Control Theory formalism useful for the famous Beverton-Holt equation arising in population dynamics. In particular, the inverse equation is redefined for a finite set of consecutive samples under the equivalent form of a discrete linear dynamic system whose input sequence is defined by the sequence of carrying capacity gains and the unforced dynamics is directly related to the intrinsic growth rate for that purpose, the environment carrying capacity gains are allowed to be time-varying and designed for control purposes. The controllability property is also investigated on this dynamic extended system as well as the stability, equilibrium points and attractor oscillating trajectories. The properties of the dynamic system associated with the Beverton-Holt inverse equation allow extrapolate in a simple dual way the above properties to the standard Beverton-Holt equation. Some generalizations are given for the case when there are extra parameters in the equation or when the system is subject to the presence of additive disturbances. In all cases, a reference model being also of Beverton-Holt type is proposed to be followed by the control system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Decades ago the Diablo Canyon site (CA-SLO-2) on the central California mainland revealed one of the oldest and longest sequences (ca. 9400 radiocarbon years ago to contact) of coastal occupation on the shore of the northeastern Pacific. The artifacts from these important deposits were reported in detail by Greenwood (1972), but only a fraction of the site's faunal collections was analyzed in the original site report. Acquisition of 30 additional radiocarbon dates and analysis of the complete vertebrate fauna have produced a coarse-grained record of human foraging on the California mainland from 8300 cal B. C. to cal A.D. 1769. The temporally controlled faunal matrix, constituting one of the largest trans-Holocene records from western North America, speaks in a meaningful way to two significant issues in hunter-gatherer prehistory: early Holocene foraging strategies and economic intensification/resource depression over time. The site's earliest component suggests a population invested in watercraft and intensely adapted to the interface of land and sea along the northeastern Pacific coastline. While boats were used to access offshore rocks, terrestrial mammals (e.g., black-tailed deer) were also of primary importance. Dominance of deer throughout the Diablo occupations is inconsistent with recent generalizations about big-game hunting as costly signaling in western North American prehistory. Diachronic variation, correlated with superimposed burials that show growth in human populations through the Holocene, includes: (1) modest incremental changes in most taxa, suggesting resource stability and increasing diet breadth; (2) gradual but significant variation in a few taxa, including the flightless duck which was hunted into extinction and eventually replaced by sea otters; (3) punctuated, multidirectional change during the late Holocene related to historic contingencies of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly and protohistoric disruptions.

AB Ecological and evolutionary processes in temporary rock pools operate within constraints imposed by their hydrologic regimes. These shallow pools flood when seasonal rains accumulate on impermeable substrates. Despite the ecological importance of hydrologic conditions for these ecosystems, we typically lack tools and empirical data required to understand the implications of hydrologic variability and climate change for biotic populations and communities in these habitats. In this study, we developed a hydrologic model to simulate rock pool hydrologic regimes based on rainfall, evapotranspiration, and basin geometry. The model was used to investigate long-term patterns of seasonal and inter-annual variation in hydroregime. In addition, hydrologic conditions associated with potential climate change scenarios were simulated and evaluated with respect to the biological requirements of the anostracan Branchipodopsis wolfi. The model's output for daily inundation matched with field observations with an overall accuracy of 85% and correctly estimated complete hydroperiods with an overall accuracy of 70%. Simulations indicate large variation in individual hydroperiods (76-115%) as well as in the number of hydroperiods per year (19-23%). Furthermore, this study suggests that climate change may significantly alter the rock pool hydroregime. These findings confirm the hydrologic sensitivity of these ephemeral habitats to precipitation patterns, and their potential sensitivity to future climate change. Modelling indicates that the suitability of average inundation conditions for B. wolfi deteriorates significantly under future climate predictions. High levels of spatial and temporal variation in hydrologic conditions are dominant features of these habitats and an essential consideration for understanding population and community-level ecological processes.

AB Question: What are the effects of grazing abandonment on the vegetation composition of Estonian coastal wetlands? Location: Vormsi Island and Silma Nature Reserve in western Estonia, Europe.
   Methods: Local knowledge and field reconnaissance were used to identify current and historical management levels of wetland sites within the west Estonian study area. Nine study sites, with varying management histories, were selected comprising an area of 287 ha. A total of 198 quadrats were taken from 43 distinct vegetation patches in. ve of the sites. TWINSPAN analysis was used to identify community type, and a phytosociological key was constructed for character taxa. This vegetation classification was then applied within a GIS-based context to classify all the study sites, using a ground survey technique and 1:2000 scale air photos.
   Results: We identified 11 different brackish coastal wetland community types. Indicator species were defined with community characteristics for the seven main vegetation types readily recognisable in the field. Coastal wet grasslands were most extensive in grazed sites, or sites that had been more intensively grazed, while abandoned sites were largely composed of Phragmites australis stands, tall grassland, and scrub. Site variations based on vegetation composition were significantly correlated with past grazing intensity. Plant community types showed significant edaphic differences, with particularly low soil moisture and high conductivity and pH for open pioneer patches compared to other vegetation types.
   Conclusion: Abandonment of traditionally grazed coastal grasslands threatens their characteristic biodiversity. This study found that grazing abandonment reduced the extent of coastal wetland grasslands of particular conservation value. Nevertheless, plant species of conservation interest were found across the sequence of community types described. The study shows that grazing is an important factor influencing coastal wetland plant communities but suggests that vegetation distribution is affected by environmental variables, such as topography.

AB We studied juvenile survival of 20 cohorts of Common Guillemot Uria aalge chicks colour-ringed on the Isle of May, Scotland, using both live observations at the colony and dead recoveries, allowing estimation of fidelity to the colony as well as survival. In this seabird, chicks leave the colony when only partly grown and are cared for by the male parent for several weeks afterwards. First-year survival varied strongly between cohorts, with a mean of 56% (range 30-91%). We did not identify any covariates which could explain this variation, whether relating to climate, population size or prey density. Survival was low during two regime shift episodes in the North Sea (1987-90 and 2000 onwards). Early hatched chicks were substantially more likely to survive than those hatching later in most years, whereas body condition at ringing had no detectable effect. Ringing recoveries indicated that mortality was highest in mid-winter, i.e. well after the cessation of paternal care. These results do not support the hypothesis that variation in prey quantity or energy content before fledging is a primary driver of variation in juvenile survival. Rather, it seems that chicks of high-quality parents are more likely to survive, as high-quality females tend to lay earlier in the season, and high-quality males presumably are better able to prepare their chicks to survive their first winter at sea. Very few (4%) Guillemots emigrated permanently before age 3 years, but from age 5 onwards 25-30% of birds annually left the colony or otherwise became unobservable.

AB Although sea urchins are critical for controlling macroalgae on heavily fished coral reefs, high densities threaten reefs, as urchins are also prodigous bioeroders. This study examined urchin population characteristics, bioerosion rates, their fish predators (Labridae), and potential competitors (Scaridae) on unprotected reefs and a reef within a marine protected area (MPA) in the lagoonal regions off Belize. Urchin density (< 1 m(-2)) and bioerosion rates (similar to 0.2 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1)) were lowest and members of the Labridae were the highest (similar to 20 fish 200 m(-3)) within the MPA, while several unprotected reefs had higher (similar to 18-40 m(-2)) urchin densities, lower Labridae abundances (1-3 fish 200 m(-3)), and bioerosion rates ranging from similar to 0.3-2.6 kg CaCO3 m(-2) year(-1). Urchin abundances were inversely related to Labridae (wrasses and hogfish) densities; however, on reef ridges, low algal cover (similar to 15%), small urchin size (similar to 14 mm), and low proportion of organic material in urchin guts suggested food limitation. Both top-down (predation) and bottom-up factors (food limitation) likely contribute to the control of urchins, predominantly Echinometra viridis, off Belize, thereby potentially diminishing the negative impacts of bioerosion activities by urchins.

AB A map of plant species diversity in Burkina Faso is presented based on field observations and specimen data from the Ouagadougou University Herbarium (OUA) and the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR). A map of collecting intensity and field observations illustrates centres of botanical research activities in Burkina Faso. To overcome problems associated with biased sampling intensity distributions of species have been modelled and extrapolated to maps of vascular plant diversity, life forms and diversity of four selected families (Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Dioscoreaceae and Rubiaceae). The area of most intensive collection and observation is around Gorom-Gorom and Fada N'Gourma. Modelled diversity generally increases towards the south, as does the proportion of phanerophytes, lianas and hemicryptophytes, while the opposite trend is observed for therophytes. Poaceae diversity is highly correlated with total vascular plant diversity, making the family especially suitable as an indicator for overall plant diversity. Cyperaceae are rather evenly distributed throughout the country, Dioscoreaceae are restricted to the Sudanian Zone. Rubiaceae have their highest diversities in the very south.
   Our approach can be transferred to areas with a similar database, certainly to other areas within West Africa. Future research should focus on distribution data for rare species, enabling our approach to evaluate the West African system of protected areas.

AB Dispersal of young life stages is often the predominant connection between spatially separated populations. Thus, one can expect that dispersal plays a critical role in determining the effectiveness of aquatic protected areas as fishery management tools. This piece focuses on two primary aspects of dispersal that result in dispersal not being a simple product of mean flow and time in the plankton: flow features (retention) and behavior (swimming). Recently, increasing attention is being given to retention zones-regions where currents act to retain propagules (regions with limited exchange with surrounding waters). Both observations and models of meroplankton and of recruitment suggest the importance of retention zones in population dynamics and that these may be good sites for aquatic protected areas. Retention zones may occur in a variety of environments, each exhibiting specific circulation patterns, time scales, and opportunities for import or export. In addition, each type of retention zone offers a different habitat type and different exposure to external influences. The value of these retention zones to fisheries depends on the population of interest and the time scale, size, location, and "retentiveness" of the retention zone. Typically, retention zones are not "closed"-they are not isolated from the main flow. Nonzero exchange between retention zones and surrounding waters is critical for both dispersal of propagules and the nature of the habitat. Swimming can have a large influence on retention processes and how retention zones are used by early life stages. Even very weak behavior can exert control on export or import rates and timing. Age-specific behavior may be critical to populations using these retention zones to enhance local recruitment and spillover effects at the same time.

AB Development of gut microflora in abalone Haliotis discus hannai cultured at two abalone farms in Japan was similar: (i) gut microflora of juvenile abalones fed on microalgae matched microflora cultured from seawater; and (ii) gut microflora changed coincident with the abalone switching food sources from microalgae to algal pellets. After abalone reached 4 months of age, the gut microflora was replaced by algal polysaccharide-degrading bacteria, which were almost entirely characterized as facultative anaerobes. Dominant species were alginolytic, non-motile fermenters (NMF) and Vibrio spp. The gut microflora seemed to be stable in abalone older than 1 year, with NMF bacteria dominating. Ninety-six percent of the NMF isolates were identified as Vibrio halioticoli by species-specific identification using the colony hybridization method. These results show that abalone H. discus hannai has a unique developmental process in which gut microflora shifts to alginate-degrading bacteria, especially V, halioticoli.

AB Montane meadows in the Sierra Nevada of California have experienced dramatic expansion of shrubs (Artemisia rothrockii) and reduction in herbaceous species cover since the introduction of livestock in the late 1800s. Increases in meadow aridity due to livestock use has been proposed as the primary factor facilitating sagebrush dominance in these areas. However, our data suggest that sagebrush can readily expand into moist meadow areas where the water table is shallow. We explored how the relative importance of local processes influencing seedling establishment vary with changes in site aridity. We quantified patterns of sagebrush abundance in relation to water table depth and surface soil moisture and sagebrush seedling occurrence relative to distance from reproductive sagebrush plants and the presence of gopher disturbance. We tested the independent and interactive effects of vegetation clipping and surface soil disturbances on sagebrush germination, survival, and growth using experiments established in four vegetation types that differed in water table depth, surface soil moisture, and herbaceous species cover. Experiments were conducted over two growing seasons that differed in water availability. Our results suggest that small <1 m(2)) soil disturbances promote the germination and growth of sagebrush seedlings in intact, ungrazed, moist, herbaceous meadow areas. In the absence of disturbance, dense herbs, whether clipped or not, prevented germination. The effects of disturbance were strongest in sites with moist surface soil that support a dense herbaceous canopy and were less important in sites with lower surface-soil moisture, where seedling establishment rates were low despite abundant exposed soil. The spatial distribution of sagebrush seedlings is consistent with these experimental results. Sagebrush seedling density decreased dramatically with distance from reproductive shrubs. and seedlings were almost always preferentially associated with gopher mounds in moist herbaceous areas. Clipping above-ground biomass of herbs on a relatively small scale (4 m(2)) had no effect on sagebrush germination or early seedling growth; however, the growth and survival of larger transplanted seedlings was enhanced by clipping. We conclude that, while sagebrush expansion is traditionally associated with increased meadow aridity, it exhibits the greatest potential for seedling germination, growth, and survival in mesic, rather than xeric, sites. Realization of this potential is dependent on the confluence of exposed soil, a nearby seed source, and reduction of aboveground herb biomass.

AB The objective of the present study was to investigate the importance of emergent macrophytes as refugia in lakes of different trophic status. Furthermore, the effect of water quality on diel changes in the distribution of littoral cladocerans was of interest, with special attention paid on diurnal fluctuations of filter feeder communities, induced by pH changes under a heavy phytoplankton bloom. The study was conducted by investigating littoral cladoceran populations in different zones (inside, at the edge and outside the macrophyte stands) in two basins with divergent water quality. No tendency towards diurnal migration related to emergent macrophytes was observed in the clear-water, mesotrophic Isontalonselka basin. The dominating cladoceran, Daphnia spp., formed highest densities during daytime in the outer zone. Meanwhile, strong nocturnal cladoceran density peaks in all zones, simultaneous with lowered pH, were witnessed in the very turbid, hypertrophic Kirkkojarvi basin. Reverse horizontal migration was observed in large-bodied filter feeders, Limnosida frontosa and Sida crystallina, conceivably due to predation avoidance from young-of-the-year fish aggregating within the vegetation during the day.

AB One hectare of tropical dry forest in Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica was mapped and all trees larger than 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) identified. The same hectare was sampled for leaf litter and the two data sets, forest and litter, were compared. Dominant and subdominant species of the forest are represented in the leaf litter, whereas rare tree species are highly variable in their representation in:che leaf litter. Relative abundance of dominant and subdominant tree species is represented well by the litter although absolute rank-order is not identical between source forest basal area and leaf litter mass. The litter adds a significant component to the source forest data owing to the presence of vines and lianas, and more rarely small trees or shrubs. This indicates that litter studies may be able to add depth to forest diversity surveys. The source forest also was used to test foliar physiognomic reconstructions of climate that have been proposed recently by paleobotanists as an alternative to taxonomic affinities methods. The observed climate of the area does not conform to the climatic values that were predicted by application of these new methods.

AB I compared the timing of colony departure and body mass of 53 Ancient Murrelet Synthliboramphus antiquus chicks that were retrapped as adults in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, with those of 3992 chicks not retrapped, If the probability of recapture is a measure of survival, survival was related to both mass and date, Chicks that left the colony at 26 g or less had a lower chance of survival than heavier chicks, and those that left after the median date of departure survived better in some years than those that left earlier, The effect of date was not related to a seasonal change in departure mass because chick mass declined with departure date, I suggest that, because of heavy adult mortality during breeding, the timing of breeding in the Ancient Murrelet is based on a compromise between the optimum dates for chick and adult survival. This is in contrast to evidence from other, nonprecocial, seabirds.

AB Life-long somatic growth and egg production responses of Daphnia barbata, Daphnia gibba, Daphnia laevis, Daphnia pulex, Moina micrura and Diaphanosoma excisum were examined in relation to different food and suspended sediment levels, in factorial experiments at 20-degrees-C. Food treatments involved additions of 0, 100, 500 and 2500 mug C l-1 of Selenastrum to 20 mum filtered water, generally from source lakes. These food levels were tested at two suspended sediment levels in all species, viz. (i) natural source-lake nephelometric turbidities of 7-65 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) (approximately 10-70 mg l-1 TSS) and (ii) approximately 3- to 4-fold enrichment of natural levels (8-fold in D.excisum). A third sediment-free treatment was tested in all species of Daphnia other than D.gibba. Growth in body length and reproductive output were assessed daily for individual animals. Main and interactive effects of food and sediment on growth were assessed at selected ages from day 3 through subsequent life using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Strong and highly significant positive food effects were apparent at all ages in all species examined, with the curious exception of D.excisum. The onset of maturity and fecundity were also positively related to food level. Sediment effects on growth, age of maturity and fecundity were variable, but tended to be much weaker than food effects. Both stimulatory (positive, especially at low food levels) and inhibitory (negative) effects of sediment on growth were apparent, both between and within species. Performance in sediment-free water was very poor, except in D.pulex. Food-sediment interaction effects were variable. Generally, turbidwater species were influenced less adversely by sediment than clear-water species, indicating the existence of environmentally appropriate adaptive responses. Overall, the findings indicate that light limitation of algal resources by suspended sediments, rather than the condition of high turbidity per se, is responsible for the apparently negative impact of suspended sediments frequently observed on natural populations of cladoceran zooplankters.

AB Background Given the exceptional diversity of orchids (26 000+ species), improving strategies for the conservation of orchids will benefit a vast number of taxa. Furthermore, with rapidly increasing numbers of endangered orchids and low success rates in orchid conservation translocation programmes worldwide, it is evident that our progress in understanding the biology of orchids is not yet translating into widespread effective conservation.
   Scope We highlight unusual aspects of the reproductive biology of orchids that can have important consequences for conservation programmes, such as specialization of pollination systems, low fruit set but high seed production, and the potential for long-distance seed dispersal. Further, we discuss the importance of their reliance on mycorrhizal fungi for germination, including quantifying the incidence of specialized versus generalized mycorrhizal associations in orchids. In light of leading conservation theory and the biology of orchids, we provide recommendations for improving population management and translocation programmes.
   Conclusions Major gains in orchid conservation can be achieved by incorporating knowledge of ecological interactions, for both generalist and specialist species. For example, habitat management can be tailored to maintain pollinator populations and conservation translocation sites selected based on confirmed availability of pollinators. Similarly, use of efficacious mycorrhizal fungi in propagation will increase the value of ex situ collections and likely increase the success of conservation translocations. Given the low genetic differentiation between populations of many orchids, experimental genetic mixing is an option to increase fitness of small populations, although caution is needed where cytotypes or floral ecotypes are present. Combining demographic data and field experiments will provide knowledge to enhance management and translocation success. Finally, high per-fruit fecundity means that orchids offer powerful but overlooked opportunities to propagate plants for experiments aimed at improving conservation outcomes. Given the predictions of ongoing environmental change, experimental approaches also offer effective ways to build more resilient populations.

AB The importance of large reserves has been long maintained in the scientific literature, often leading to dismissal of the conservation potential of small reserves. However, over half the global protected-area inventory is composed of protected areas that are <100 ha, and the median size of added protected area is decreasing. Studies of the conservation value of small reserves and fragments of natural area are relatively uncommon in the literature. We reviewed SCOPUS and WOK for studies on small reserve and fragment contributions to biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services, and fifty-eight taxon-specific studies were included in the review. Small reserves harbored substantial portions (upward of 50%) of regional species diversity for many taxa (birds, plants, amphibians, and small mammals) and even some endemic, specialist bird species. Unfortunately, small reserves and fragments almost always harbored more generalist and exotic species than large reserves. Community composition depended on habitat quality, surrounding land use (agricultural vs. urban), and reserve and fragment size, which presents opportunities for management and improvement. Small reserves also provided ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological pest control, and cultural services, such as recreation and improved human health. Limitations associated with small reserves, such as extinction debt and support of area-sensitive species, necessitate a complement of larger reserves. However, we argue that small reserves can make viable and significant contributions to conservation goals directly as habitat and indirectly by increasing landscape connectivity and quality to the benefit of large reserves. To effectively conserve biodiversity for future generations in landscapes fragmented by human development, small reserves and fragments must be included in conservation planning.

AB We conducted the first dynamic downscaling of Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate over southern Africa using a regional climate model. Eight coupled global climate model (CGCM) projections of LGM climate were downscaled to 8 km resolution, and compared to a downscaling of present-day climate. it is projected that temperatures were significantly lower during the LGM compared to the present-day, with annual average temperatures 4-6 degrees C lower along the eastern escarpment, south-north aligned Cape Fold Mountains and western escarpment. Southern Africa is projected to have been generally wetter during the LGM, with a significant extension in the northward reach of frontal rainfall. The largest rainfall increases are projected for the south-north aligned Cape Fold Mountains and the western escarpment of South Africa, but with rainfall decreases projected for the Cape south coast region. Rainfall seasonality is projected to have been significantly different from that of the present-day, with an all-year rainfall region plausibly extending as far north and east as the present-day Free State and Gauteng provinces of South Africa. Evaluations of the downscalings against key published proxy records for the LGM from southern Africa suggest good agreement and few deviations. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intestinal microbial manipulation by dietary probiotic supplementation on digestive enzyme activity, immune-related gene transcription, intestinal structure alteration, and viability against pathogenic challenge in olive flounder. Similar-sized flounders (14.92 +/- 0.21 g) were divided into three groups and supplemented with a control (without probiotic) or 1 x 10(8) CFU/g diet of each of Bacillus sp. SJ-10 (ProB) and Lactobacillus plantarwn (ProL) for eight weeks. At the end of the feeding trial, the estimated intestinal microbial richness (Chaol) and diversity (Shannon) demonstrated a significant (P < 0.05) abundance in the ProB group (484.80 +/- 88.75, 5.08 +/- 0.17) compared to the ProL (285.32 +/- 17.78, 4.54 +/- 0.09) and control groups (263.23 +/- 20.20, 4.30 +/- 0.20). A similar alteration phenomenon was also found at the phylum level, with a higher abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria. Trypsin and lipase activities were elevated in both the ProB and ProL groups compared to the control, but amylase was only higher in the ProB group. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and IL-6 were significantly higher in the ProB group than in the other two groups. There was a significant increase in transcription of IL-10 in both the ProB and ProL groups compared to the control. The length of villi and microvilli of probiotic-fed olive flounder was increased but was not significantly different from the control group. In an in vivo challenge experiment with Streptococcus iniae (1 x 10(8) CFU/mL), the survival rates of the ProB and ProL groups were 29.17% and 12.50%, respectively, when control mortality reached 100%. Therefore, intestinal microbiota manipulation by probiotic supplementation increased the richness of the bacterial population, digestive enzyme activity, intestinal immune gene transcription, and infectious disease protection in olive flounder.

AB We assessed drivers of ecological success along resource availability gradients for three invasive woody species: Prunus serotina Ehrh., Quercus rubra L. and Robinia pseudoacacia L. We aimed to check how much of invasion success, measured by invader biomass, is explained by propagule pressure and plant community invasibility. Using 3 years of observations from 372 study plots (100 m(2) each) in temperate forests of Wielkopolski National Park (Poland) we investigated the hierarchy of predictors and partial dependencies using the random forest method. Our study indicated that propagule pressure explained more variance in success of invaders than invasibility-describing availability of resources and competitors in understory vegetation. We also found different responses of seedlings and saplings, connected with dependence on stored carbohydrates, which decreased seedling responses to resource availability gradients. However, resource availability (light and leaf litter predictors) had greater influence than predictors describing understory vegetation. Based on importance and response strength the species studied may be arranged by decreasing requirements for soil fertility and acidity: P. serotina < Q. rubra < R. pseudoacacia, whereas for light requirements and competition vulnerability the order is: P. serotina > Q. rubra > R. pseudoacacia. However, low light requirements of R. pseudoacacia may be biased by high proportion of sprouts supplied by parental trees. Results provide guidelines for effective management of invasive woody species in forest ecosystems and describe complex interactions between factors studied on ecological success of invaders.

AB Controlling complex nonlinear networks is largely an unsolved problem at the present. Existing works focus either on open-loop control strategies and their energy consumptions or on closed-loop control schemes with an infinite-time duration. We articulate a finite-time, closed-loop controller with an eye toward the physical and mathematical underpinnings of the trade-off between the control time and energy as well as their dependence on the network parameters and structure. The closed-loop controller is tested on a large number of real systems including stem cell differentiation, food webs, random ecosystems, and spiking neuronal networks. Our results represent a step forward in developing a rigorous and general framework to control nonlinear dynamical networks with a complex topology.

AB Managing multiple, interacting disturbances is a key challenge to biodiversity conservation, and one that will only increase as global change drivers continue to alter disturbance regimes. Theoretical studies have highlighted the importance of a mechanistic understanding of stressor interactions for improving the prediction and management of interactive effects. However, many conservation studies are not designed or interpreted in the context of theory and instead focus on case-specific management questions. This is a problem as it means that few studies test the relationships highlighted in theoretical models as being important for ecological management. We explore the extent of this problem among studies of interacting disturbances by reviewing recent experimental studies of the interaction between fire and grazing in terrestrial ecosystems. Interactions between fire and grazing can occur via a number of pathways; one disturbance can modify the other's likelihood, intensity or spatial distribution, or one disturbance can alter the other's impacts on individual organisms. The strength of such interactions will vary depending on disturbance attributes (e.g. size or intensity), and this variation is likely to be nonlinear. We show that few experiments testing fire-grazing interactions are able to identify the mechanistic pathway driving an observed interaction, and most are unable to detect nonlinear effects. We demonstrate how these limitations compromise the ability of experimental studies to effectively inform ecological management. We propose a series of adjustments to the design of disturbance interaction experiments that would enable tests of key theoretical pathways and provide the deeper ecological understanding necessary for effective management. Such considerations are relevant to studies of a broad range of ecological interactions and are critical to informing the management of disturbance regimes in the context of accelerating global change.

AB The greater part of the semi-deciduous moist forests of the Congo basin has been given to logging companies for exploitation. In the next decades, very few of these forests will remain intact. In this paper, we aimed to identify large-scale variations in the structure, composition and functioning of African moist forests that could serve as a baseline for both management and conservation purposes. Commercial forest inventory data were assembled for 49,711 0.5-ha plots, covering an area of more than six million hectares, crossing the borders of Cameroon, Central African Republic and Republic of Congo. Floristic composition was analyzed for a subset of 176 genera reliably identified in the field. Three key functional traits of tropical trees: regeneration guild, leaf phenology, and wood specific gravity, were collected at the species level from various sources, and assigned at the genus level. We first investigated the main variations in forest structure and composition, and identified seven forest types based on these variations. Differences in the percentage of pioneer and deciduous stems, and mean wood specific gravity were tested between forest types. Most of the study area was composed of a mosaic of the structural variations of the forests characterized by the occurrence of Celtis (Ulmaceae) species, which are mostly composed of frequent and abundant genera that formed the common floristic pool of the region. Secondary Musanga (Moraceae) forest is located in repeatedly disturbed areas, along roads and around main cities; mixed Manilkara (Sapotaceae) forest covers a huge area in the southern Central African Republic and in the northern Republic of Congo; and monodominant Gilbertiodendron (Fabaceae) forest is sparsely distributed along rivers. The contrasted structure, composition, and functioning of the forest types imply pronounced differences in population and ecosystem processes, and call for adapted management and conservation strategies.

AB The applicability of succession models from temperate and tropical wet forests to threatened seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) is questioned. Plant phenology affects ecosystem functions and changes along forest regeneration gradient. To investigate the recovery of ecological functions after disturbances in a SDTF, we recorded the vegetative and reproductive phenologies for trees (DBH >5cm) for 17 months in southeast Brazil in three successional stages: early (10-15 years after clearing), intermediate (25-30) and late (>50). The vegetative phenology of the 523 individuals was strongly seasonal, with 3% of individuals presenting green leaves in a deciduous dry season. Besides structural and floristic differences, phenological trends were similar between the later stages. Reproduction occurred with higher intensities in the early stage and in the advanced stages only in the dry season, providing key resources to local fauna. The studied SDTF is resilient to ecological functions, rapidly recovering functional processes. The integration of structural and functional knowledge of succession of STDFs may lead to better management of its secondary remnants. Our study suggests that classical forest succession theory developed for other ecosystems may not fully reflect the pattern of SDTF succession, an ecosystem that originally covered 42% of the earth's tropical and subtropical landmass.

AB Deep Lake in Antarctica is a cold, hypersaline system where four types of haloarchaea representing distinct genera comprise >70% of the lake community: strain tADL similar to 44%, strain DL31 similar to 18%, Halorubrum lacusprofundi similar to 10% and strain DL1 similar to 0.3%. By performing comparative genomics, growth substrate assays, and analyses of distribution by lake depth, size partitioning and lake nutrient composition, we were able to infer important metabolic traits and ecophysiological characteristics of the four Antarctic haloarchaea that contribute to their hierarchical persistence and coexistence in Deep Lake. tADL is characterized by a capacity for motility via flagella (archaella) and gas vesicles, a highly saccharolytic metabolism, a preference for glycerol, and photoheterotrophic growth. In contrast, DL31 has a metabolism specialized in processing proteins and peptides, and appears to prefer an association with particulate organic matter, while lacking the genomic potential for motility. H. lacusprofundi is the least specialized, displaying a genomic potential for the utilization of diverse organic substrates. The least abundant species, DL1, is characterized by a preference for catabolism of amino acids, and is the only one species that lacks genes needed for glycerol degradation. Despite the four haloarchaea being distributed throughout the water column, our analyses describe a range of distinctive features, including preferences for substrates that are indicative of ecological niche partitioning. The individual characteristics could be responsible for shaping the composition of the haloarchaeal community throughout the lake by enabling selection of ecotypes and maintaining sympatric speciation.

AB Predicting population establishment based on initial population size is a theoretically and empirically challenging problem whose resolution informs a multitude of applications. Indeed, it is a central problem in the management of introduced, endangered, harvested, and pathogenic organisms. We focus here on introduced species. We synthesize the current state of modeling in this predictive enterprise and outline future directions in the application of these models to developing regulations intended to prevent the establishment of invaders. Descriptive and mechanistic models of single-population introductions are fairly well developed and have provided insight into invasion risk in laboratory and field conditions. However, many invasions stem from large-scale and repeated releases of a multitude of species from relatively indiscriminate invasion vectors associated with international trade and travel. Vector-scale models of invasion risk are less well developed and are characterized largely by the use of untested proxy variables for propagule pressure. We illustrate the problems associated with proxy variables and introduce a more mechanistic theoretical formulation characterizing vector-scale invasion pressure in terms of propagule pressure (number of introduced individuals) and colonization pressure (number of introduced species). We outline key questions to be addressed in applying both single-population and vector-scale models to the development of threshold-based invasion regulations. We illustrate these ecological and applied questions using examples from terrestrial, aquatic, and marine systems. We develop in detail examples from ballast-water transport that, as one of the best-characterized global invasion vectors and one that is subject to emerging international threshold-based biosecurity regulations, provides a rich case study.

AB The number of travel-acquired dengue infections has seen a consistent global rise over the past decade. An increased volume of international passenger air traffic originating from regions with endemic dengue has contributed to a rise in the number of dengue cases in both areas of endemicity and elsewhere. This paper reports results from a network-based risk assessment model which uses international passenger travel volumes, travel routes, travel distances, regional populations, and predictive species distribution models (for the two vector species, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) to quantify the relative risk posed by each airport in importing passengers with travel-acquired dengue infections. Two risk attributes are evaluated: (i) the risk posed by through traffic at each stopover airport and (ii) the risk posed by incoming travelers to each destination airport. The model results prioritize optimal locations (i.e., airports) for targeted dengue surveillance. The model is easily extendible to other vector-borne diseases.

AB We investigated the role of water features as focal attractors for gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and bobcats (Felis rufus) in west Texas to determine if they were foci for interspecific interaction. Mixed effects models indicated that species partitioned use of water features spatially and temporally. Linear models indicated factors influencing relative activity at water features varied by species. For coyotes and bobcats, the water availability model, containing days since last rainfall and nearest-neighbor distance to water was best supported by the data, with relative activity increasing with time between rainfall and distance between waters. For gray foxes, the best approximating model indicated that relative activity was inversely correlated to coyote and bobcat activity indices, and positively correlated to topographical complexity. Encounters between carnivore species were low, with most occurring between coyotes and gray foxes, followed by coyotes and bobcats, and bobcats and gray foxes. These findings suggest a behavioral-environmental mechanism that may function to modulate resource partitioning by carnivores in the arid West. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB Zimbabwe's Mid-Zambezi Valley is of global importance for the emblematic mega-fauna of Africa. Over the past 30 years rapid land use change in this area has substantially reduced wildlife habitat. Tsetse control operations are often blamed for this. In this study, we quantify this change for the Dande Communal Area, Mbire District, of the Mid-Zambezi Valley and analyse the contribution of three major potential drivers: (1) increase in human population; (2) increase in cattle population (and the expansion of associated plough-based agriculture), and; (3) expansion of cotton farming. Although direct effects of land use change on wildlife densities could not be proven, our study suggests that the consequences for elephant and buffalo numbers are negative. All three of the above drivers have contributed to the observed land use change. However, we found farmland to have expanded faster than the human population, and to have followed a similar rate of expansion in cattle sparse, tsetse infested areas as in tsetse free areas where cattle-drawn plough agriculture dominates. This implies the existence of a paramount driver, which we demonstrate to be cotton farming. Contrary to common belief, we argue that tsetse control was not the major trigger behind the dramatic land use change observed, but merely alleviated a constraint to cattle accumulation. We argue that without the presence of a cash crop (cotton), land use change would have been neither as extensive nor as rapid as has been observed. Therefore, conservation agencies should be as concerned by the way people farm as they are by population increase. Conserving biodiversity without jeopardising agricultural production will require the development of innovative technological and institutional options in association with policy and market interventions.

AB International trade is widely acknowledged as a conduit for movement of invasive species, but few studies have directly quantified the invasion risk confronting individual locations of interest. This study presents estimates of the likelihood of successful entry for alien forest insect species at more than 3,000 urban areas in the contiguous United States (US). To develop these location-specific estimates, we first utilized historical merchandise imports and insect incursions data to estimate an annual US rate of alien insect species establishment. Next, we used historical pest interception data to calculate the proportion of all insects arriving at US ports of entry that are associated with forest hosts. We then combined these results to estimate a nationwide establishment rate specifically for alien forest insects. Finally, we employed international and domestic commodity flow networks to allocate this nationwide rate to individual US urban areas. For 2010, we estimated the nationwide rate as 1.89 new alien forest insect species per year. While the establishment rates observed at most urban areas were low (< 0.005 new species/year), for a few select areas the rates predict new alien forest insect species establishments every 5-15 years. This national-scale assessment provides a realistic depiction of human-assisted establishment potential in the US as well as functional inputs for quantitative models of invasion. Overall, these analyses support broad-scale biosecurity and management strategies.

AB Adaptive governance can be conceptualized as distinct phases of: 1) understanding environmental change; 2) using this understanding to inform decision making; and 3) acting on decisions in a manner that sustains resilience of desirable system states. Using this analytical framework, we explore governance in practice in two case studies in Kenya, that reflect the "messiness" of contemporary coastal governance in many developing country contexts. Findings suggest that adaptive marine governance is unlikely to be a smooth process of learning, knowledge sharing, and responding. There are institutional, sociocultural, and political factors, past and present, that influence each phase of both local and state decision making. New local institutions related to fisher associations and Beach Management Units influence learning and knowledge sharing in ways contrary to those expected of institutions that enable collaborative fisheries management. Similarly, state decision making is relatively uninformed by the diverse knowledge systems available in the coastal zone, despite the rhetoric of participation. Historical relations and modes of working continue to play a significant role in mediating the potential for adaptive governance in the future. The case studies are illustrative and point to a number of institutional and political issues that would need to be addressed in processes of governance reform towards more adaptive management in developing country contexts.

AB Chloroquine resistant malaria (CQR) emerged in East Africa during the late 1970s and then spread westward. A molecular marker only became available in the late 1990s, and by that time CQR had permeated throughout Africa. By contrast, resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SPR) has emerged during an era of molecular surveillance, and the changing prevalence of SPR conferred by point mutations in the dhfr and dhps genes has been recorded in hundreds of sites across Africa. We have collated and mapped reports of the dhps K540E mutation, a uniquely informative marker of SPR, and used these to describe the geography of its dispersal through time. Like CQR, dhps K540E appeared first in East Africa and spread west. We discuss whether there are common principles governing resistance dispersal in Africa and how these might guide surveillance in future.

AB Floristic differentiation in the Ryukyu Archipelago has been explained primarily by geohistory, specifically landbridge formation and vicariance at the Tokara and Kerama Gaps, two deep-sea channels through the island arc. This ignores current environmental effects, which may also be important. We therefore tested whether the floristic differentiation pattern is explained primarily by the historical effect of the gaps as barriers, or whether a better understanding of floristic differentiation is achieved when both historical and current environmental factors are incorporated.
   Ryukyu Archipelago, Japan: an assemblage of continental islands.
   We compiled a presence-absence matrix of 1815 plant species on 26 islands. Floristic dissimilarity distances between islands were calculated using Simpson's similarity index and analysed using cluster analysis. We also conducted multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM) to examine the significance of the historical factors of the gaps and current environmental factors: geographical distance among islands and differences in island area and maximum elevation.
   We detected clear patterns of floristic differentiation across the gaps. Using the two gaps as explanatory variables, the MRM showed that both had significant effects on floristic dissimilarity distance. However, when geographical distance was added to the explanatory model, the Kerama Gap effect disappeared. When all five explanatory variables were used, the Tokara Gap and geographical distance had positive effects, but area difference had a negative effect. The Kerama Gap and difference in maximum elevation had no effect.
   The geographical pattern of floristic differentiation appears to indicate the influence of both gaps. However, the MRM indicates that the floristic differentiation across the Kerama Gap is no more than could be explained solely by geographical distance. Across the Tokara Gap, however, floristic differentiation is larger than geographical distance alone can explain. This additional differentiation is attributable to the effect of the historical barrier. To verify the significance of historical effects of vicariance on island biota, the confounding effects of geographical distance must be considered. The distance decay of floristic similarity and negative effect of area difference on floristic differentiation demonstrate that floristic differentiation is better understood by incorporating both historical and current environmental factors.

AB The palynology of two overlapping Holocene cores froth Lake Sibaya in KwaZulu-Natal elucidates the relationship between climate, vegetation and human impact in the region. By means of twenty-one AMS C-14 dates, loss on ignition, and palynological results we established a composite profile. Pollen assemblages include elements of swamp forest (e.g. Rauvolfia, Macaranga), dune forest (e.g. Mimusops), mangrove vegetation (Bruguiera), palmveld (e.g. Phoenix) and bushveld (e.g. Spirostachys. Sclerocarya). Poaceae, aquatics and Cyperaceae are abundant, and fynbos elements like Ericaceae and Restionaceae are rare. Based on comparisons between palynological and archaeological/historical data, the radiocarbon dates seem to show an age error of 50-550 yr, which is probably due to a hardwater reservoir effect. Applying the mean of this error range to our age model suggests that the oldest sediments represent similar to 6750-7100 cal yr BP, that a > 5000 yr hiatus occurs ca. 253 cm depth, and that the upper 253 cm of the composite profile covers the period between similar to 1300-1500 cal yr BP (similar to 450-650 AD, Early Iron Age). and 2004 AD. The Middle Holocene is characterized by high tree pollen values (especially Phoenix) suggesting warm humid conditions. The Early Iron Age is characterized by high Podocarpus percentages that indicate moist but possibly cooler climatic conditions. The upper part of the pollen sequence is characterized by the decrease of Podocarpus. Isoglossa and Celtis and a rise in Spirostachys. Increasing values of cereal pollen and algae might reflect human activity. Zea mays appears similar to 150-300 cal yr BP in the pollen sequence according to the radiocarbon chronology and both archaeological and historical evidence. The curve of Pinus pollen rises to 50-70% at the top of the diagram, reflecting the spread of pine plantations since the 1920's. and Poaceae values decrease. Stoebe and the introduction of neophytes like Ambrosio and Casuarina suggest recent human disturbance. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB How can terrestrial animals survive in a desert with scant primary productivity? The Peruvian coastal desert is hyper-arid, but faces one of the world's most productive marine ecosystems, the Peru-Chile cold current. Given the stark difference in productivity between these adjacent ecosystems, we expected to find strong linkages connecting the terrestrial and marine food web. We investigated how marine resources are incorporated in the diet, and influence the distribution of terrestrial consumers (geckos, scorpions, solifuges and darkling beetles). Stomach contents from geckos, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of geckos and other terrestrial consumers suggest that marine green algae of the genus Ulva provide energy and nutrients to the terrestrial food web. Isotopic values suggest that amphipods, which feed on stranded Ulva, make marine resources available to terrestrial predators by moving between the intertidal and supratidal zones. The relative contribution of terrestrial and algal carbon sources varied among terrestrial predators, because scorpions assimilated a lower proportion of energy from Ulva than did geckos and solifuges. These delta C-13 patterns reflected differences in the spatial distribution of consumers. Our study supports the idea that in places where ecosystems with contrasting productivity levels are spatially juxtaposed, it is not possible to understand the structure and dynamics of food webs without taking into account the effects of energy and nutrients flowing from adjacent ecosystems. In contrast to other studied systems, especially those in Baja California, our site in Peru receives very little rainfall and the amount of precipitation is not affected by El Nino events. The near absence of rainfall promotes an extreme dependence of terrestrial consumers on marine resources, and causes permanent indirect food-web effects that are affected by temporal variability in marine productivity, rather than temporal patterns of plant growth.

AB Intra- and inter-specific competition between seedlings of Acacia etbaica Schweinf. and the grass Hyparrenia hirta (L.) Stapf. was studied to evaluate the influence of the perennial grass on the establishment of the tree seedlings. The experiment was conducted using a replacement series in which plants were grown in a greenhouse at an overall density of six individuals per pot, providing combinations of the two species from 0:6 and 6:0. Indices of intra- and interspecific competition, relative crowding coefficients and relative yield totals (RYTs) were calculated from the dry weight data. For both shoots and roots, the crowding coefficient of Hyparrenia towards Acacia was five- to ten-fold that of Acacia towards Hyparrenia, which indicated a high competitive strength for the grass species. RYT values of the two species averaged 1.25, indicating some degree of resource complimentarity. Both species had comparable intra-specific competition based on shoot yield. However, based on the root yield, intra-specific competition of Hyparrenia was slightly lower than that of Acacia. Inter-specific competition of Hyparrenia on the root yield of Acacia was more than five times greater than vice versa. With more crowding, shoot/root ratio decreased more in Hyparrenia than in Acacia for pure stands as well as for mixtures which indicated that Hyparrenia could adjust biomass allocation. In general, the results indicated that Hyparrenia was competitively aggressive towards Acacia and may inhibit the growth of tree seedlings when the latter are planted within the grass community. Implications of the findings in terms of land reclamation efforts are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study tests the hypothesis that the percentage of tree and shrub species within categories of seed dispersal, fruit size and type is directly related to rainfall in the caatinga vegetation, a tropical dry forest of the north-eastern Brazil. The percentage of vertebrate-dispersed species ranged from 11% in a 246-mm year(-1) plot to 53.6% in a 663-mm year(-1) plot, In addition, the percentage of berry species was positively correlated with annual rainfall, whereas the percentage of drupe species was negatively correlated. Among the group of vertebrate-dispersed species, a significant increase was found in the percentage of Myrtaceae species (0-16.7%) from dry to moist plots. Our results support trends described in the literature reporting gradual and predictable changes in seed dispersal mode in neotropical forests located across rainfall gradients.

AB This study employs scale-dependence as an analytical approach to understanding effects of livestock grazing on rangeland degradation in northern Kenya. It used extensive datasets previously collected from 13200 km(2) rangelands where grazing pressure gradients of livestock (varied from none, light, moderate, heavy and very heavy grazing) in conjunction with seasonality across different ecological scales influenced plant responses and probably contributed to land degradation. The data representing spatial and temporal scales were used to test the equilibrium and non-equilibrium-grazing models and to verify scales at which the models appropriately described range degradation. The equilibrium-grazing models operated at the coarse scales (e.g. range units, km(2)) and non-equilibrium-grazing models at multiple scales (e.g. spatial, temporal and fine scales - plots, landscape patches). The study showed that the equilibrium-grazing hypothesis, which stated that responses of plant species richness, cover and biomass varied along grazing pressure gradients at the coarse scale, was rejected, while the nonequilibrium-grazing hypothesis, which stated that the factors responded to temporal and spatial scales combined with grazing pressure gradients at the fine scale, was accepted. This study emphasized that in future discussions on shifts in the thinking of range science from equilibrium- to non-equilibrium-grazing models should clarify scales at which land degradation is assessed. In conclusion, the paper suggests that understanding plant species responses to grazing pressure and seasonality needs to consider multiple scale effects and that the dogmatic notions about degradation of the and zone rangelands at the coarse scales should be reconsidered. Land degradation assessments in the and zones should focus at the fine scale. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Seedling abundance at four microsites (open fynbos, beneath emergent fynbos shrubs, beneath thicket, and beneath forest) was determined at three coastal dune landscapes, located along a gradient of increasing summer rainfall and where fire-dependent fynbos was the predominant vegetation. At all sites thicket seedlings were most common beneath emergent fynbos shrubs and under thicker clumps: seedlings of forest species were most abundant at forest microsites although some individuals were recorded beneath thicket. Very few thicket seedlings were observed in open fynbos. Birds play a keystone role in facilitating establishment of the fleshy fruit-bearing thicket flora. Seedling abundance at microsites of different thicket and forest species was generally unrelated to fruit abundance. Germination success of most species was highest under shaded conditions; soil organic content had no effect on germination. Removal of pulp and bird-ingestion enhanced the germination, relative to untreated controls, of two out Of three species rested. A simple Markov model predicted a gradual increase in cover of the thicket and forest component and a gradual decline in fynbos under a 'normal' (20-yr interval) fire regime simulated over 10 cycles. Although inter-fire seedling establishment under emergent fynbos shrubs is important in the initial colonisation of fynbos by obligate resprouting thicket shrubs, these species persist and expand by vegetative recruitment after and between fires, respectively. In the prolonged absence of fire, the endemic-rich and fire-dependent fynbos flora would be replaced by species-poor forest and thicket.

AB Fire and herbivory both remove aboveground biomass. Environmental factors determine the type and intensity of these consumers globally, but the traits of plants can also alter their propensity to burn and the degree to which they are eaten. To understand plant life-history strategies associated with fire and herbivory we need to describe both response and effect functional traits, and how they sort within communities, along resource gradients, and across evolutionary timescales. Fire and herbivore functional traits are generally considered separately, but there are advances made in understanding fire that relate to herbivory, and vice versa. Moreover, fire and herbivory interact: the presence of one consumer affects the type and intensity of the other. Here, we present a unifying conceptual framework to understand plant strategies that enable tolerance and persistence to fire and herbivory. Using grasses as an example, we discuss how flammability and fire tolerance, palatability, and grazing tolerance traits might organize themselves in ecosystems exposed to these consumers, and how these traits might have evolved with reference to other strong selective processes, like aridity. Our framework can be used to predict both the diversity of life-history strategies and plant species diversity under different consumer regimes.

AB AimsAlthough many phytosociological studies have provided detailed local and regional descriptions of coastal dune vegetation, a unified classification of this vegetation in Europe and the Mediterranean Basin has been missing. Our aim is to produce a formalized classification of this vegetation and to identify the main factors driving its plant species composition at a continental scale.
   LocationAtlantic and Baltic coasts of Europe, Mediterranean Basin and the Black Sea region.
   MethodsWe compiled a database of 30,759 plots of coastal vegetation, which were resampled to reduce unbalanced sampling effort, obtaining a data set of 11,769 plots. We classified these plots with TWINSPAN, interpreted the resulting clusters and used them for developing formal definitions of phytosociological alliances of coastal dune vegetation, which were included in an expert system for automatic vegetation classification. We related the alliances to climatic factors and described their biogeographic features and their position in the coastal vegetation zonation. We examined and visualized the floristic relationships among these alliances by means of DCA ordination.
   ResultsWe defined 18 alliances of coastal dune vegetation, including the newly described Centaureo cuneifoliae-Verbascion pinnatifidi from the Aegean region. The main factors underlying the differentiation of these alliances were biogeographic and macroclimatic contrasts between the Atlantic-Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Sea regions, along with ecological differences between shifting and stable dunes. The main difference in species composition was between the Atlantic-Baltic and Mediterranean-Black Sea regions. Within the former region, the main difference was driven by the different ecological conditions between shifting and stable dunes, whereas within the latter, the main difference was biogeographic between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.
   ConclusionsThe first formal classification of the European coastal dune vegetation was established, accompanied by an expert system containing the formal definitions of alliances, which can be applied to new data sets. The new classification system critically revised the previous concepts and integrated them into a consistent framework, which reflects the main gradients in species composition driven by biogeographic influences, macroclimate and the position of the sites in the coast-inland zonation of the dune systems. A revision of the class concept used in EuroVegChecklist is also proposed.

AB A 35-day feeding experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different carbon sources addition on nutritional composition and extracellular enzymes activity of bioflocs, and digestive enzymes activity and growth performance of Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles (average 5.52 +/- 0.21 g) in zero-water exchange culture tanks. Molasses, corn flour and wheat bran were used as carbon sources and added into the tanks to promote the development of bioflocs during the experiment. During the entire experiment, good water quality and biofloc development were achieved under the addition of different carbon sources. At the end of the experiment, the proximate composition and extracellular enzymes activities of the collected bioflocs from seven biofloc groups were influenced by the addition of the different carbon sources. Meanwhile, the specific activities of protease, amylase, lipase and cellulase in the hepatopancreas, stomach and intestine of the shrimp showed differences among the seven biofloc groups, and most of them were significantly higher than those obtained in the control group (P < 0.05). There were differences in the performance (growth and FCR) of the shrimp among the seven biofloc groups, and all of them were significantly better than those obtained in the control group (P < 0.05). Based on the results of this study, 60% molasses + 20% corn flour + 20% wheat bran could be an appropriate formula of the addition of carbon sources for intensive culture of L. vannamei (mainly in terms of growth and FCR) in zero-water exchange culture tanks.

AB Many ecological theories and species conservation programmes rely on accurate estimates of population density. Accurate density estimation, especially for species facing rapid declines, requires the application of rigorous field and analytical methods. However, obtaining accurate density estimates of carnivores can be challenging as carnivores naturally exist at relatively low densities and are often elusive and wide-ranging. In this study, we employ an unstructured spatial sampling field design along with a Bayesian sex-specific spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) analysis, to provide the first rigorous population density estimates of cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in the Maasai Mara, Kenya. We estimate adult cheetah density to be between 1.28 +/- 0.315 and 1.34 +/- 0.337 individuals/100km(2) across four candidate models specified in our analysis. Our spatially explicit approach revealed 'hotspots' of cheetah density, highlighting that cheetah are distributed heterogeneously across the landscape. The SECR models incorporated a movement range parameter which indicated that male cheetah moved four times as much as females, possibly because female movement was restricted by their reproductive status and/or the spatial distribution of prey. We show that SECR can be used for spatially unstructured data to successfully characterise the spatial distribution of a low density species and also estimate population density when sample size is small. Our sampling and modelling framework will help determine spatial and temporal variation in cheetah densities, providing a foundation for their conservation and management. Based on our results we encourage other researchers to adopt a similar approach in estimating densities of individually recognisable species.

AB Herbivory is one of the most important biotic disturbance types globally and is important for community structure and composition through species filtering. In northern forest ecosystems the population densities of wild-ranging ungulates, which are managed through hunting, have reached historically high numbers. Conservation concerns frequently arise, both in media and scientific literature. One key question is whether increased deer densities negatively affect biodiversity and whether management should implement reduction in deer densities. Few studies have addressed wild herbivores-plant richness relationships using a full length gradient of herbivory. Such gradient approach where herbivory is studied from very low to very high intensity, may enable us to develop operational management guidelines for deer densities We recorded the ungulate herbivory intensities on the island Svanoy in west Norway across 10 years and related this to the present plant richness of an old-growth pine-forest system, recording all plant species groups of the forest understory. The herbivory intensity-plant richness relationship followed a unimodally peaked curved, but plant richness was lower only at forest sites with artificially high red deer herbivory. Overall, the herbivory-richness relationships of functional groups fitted expectations in that the richness of low-growing functional groups as forbs, graminoids and mosses all increased within natural levels of herbivory intensities, whereas the richness of the taller growing woody species of the forest understory, dwarf-shrubs and young trees, decreased along the intensity gradient. We validated the gradient approach by experimental exclosure data. Management for relatively high deer densities may benefit the overall understory plant richness of such forest ecosystems at the expense of richness of woody plants. We suggest that the herbivory-induced reduction of the understory woody layer is the key to understand the overall increase in plant species richness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Eucalyptus globulus is one of the most widely planted temperate hardwood species in the world, and in Australia there are 538,000 hectares growing in plantations. Although it has been reported as invasive, quantification of E. globulus invasion is rare. We conducted surveys at two geographic scales to assess the level of, and factors influencing, wildling establishment from industrial E. globulus plantations in Australian. We surveyed 290 km of plantation boundary, both within (22 %) and outside (78 %) the species native range. In areas of relatively high establishment, a density triggered paired plot approach (plots with and without wildlings) was used to assess fine-scale factors influencing establishment. We recorded 4,939 wildlings (17/km), 98 % of which occurred within 10 m of the plantation edge (maximum 175 m). Establishment varied between regions, ranging from 1.2 to 39.6 wildlings/km. Generalized linear models showed that the probability of a wildling being present increased with plantation age, that wildling abundance was higher along burnt transects, as well as sites that received regular, relatively high rainfall and had lower mean annual temperatures. The only fine-scale/local factor influencing wildling presence was the reproductive output of the plantation. The current level of E. globulus establishment in Australia is low in comparison to other invasive forestry trees. However, given the relatively young age of the Australian estate, local and regional variation in establishment, and potential future changes in plantation management, monitoring is warranted. Implications for assessing the general invasiveness of Eucalyptus and possibilities for E. globulus wildling control are discussed.

AB Population abundance data vary widely in quality and are rarely accurate. The two main components of error in such data are observation and process error. We used Bayesian state space models to estimate the observation and process error in time-series of 55 globally distributed populations of two species, Cervus elaphus (elk/red deer) and Rangifer tarandus (caribou/reindeer). We examined variation among populations and species in the magnitude of estimates of error components and density dependence using generalized linear models. Process error exceeded observation error in 75% of all populations, and on average, both components of error were greater in Rangifer than in Cervus populations. Observation error differed significantly across the different observation methods, and predation and time-series length differentially affected the error components. Comparing the Bayesian model results to traditional models that do not separate error components revealed the potential for misleading inferences about sources of variation in population dynamics.

AB Plants frequently attract natural enemies of their herbivores, resulting in a reduction in tissue damage and often in enhanced plant fitness. While such indirect defenses can dramatically change as plants develop, only recently have ecologists begun to explore such changes and evaluate their role in mediating plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions. Here we review the literature documenting ontogenetic patterns in plant rewards (i.e. extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), food bodies (FBs) and domatia) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and identify links between ontogenetic patterns in such traits and the attraction of natural enemies (ants). In the case of reward traits we concentrate in ant-plant studies, which are the most numerous. We report that all indirect defensive traits commonly vary with plant age but ontogenetic trajectories differ among them. Myrmecophytic species, which provide both food and shelter to their defenders, do not produce rewarding traits until a minimum size is reached. Then, a pronounced increase in the abundance of food rewards and domatia often occurs as plants develop, which explains the temporal succession or colony size increase of mutualistic ant species and, in some cases, leads to a reduction in herbivore damage and enhanced fitness as plants age. In contrast, ontogenetic patterns were less consistent in plant species that rely on VOC emissions to attract natural enemies or those that provide only food rewards (EFNs) but not nesting sites to their associated ants, showing an overall decline or lack of trend with plant development, respectively. Future research should focus on uncovering: (i) the costs and mechanisms underlying ontogenetic variation in indirect defenses, (ii) the relative importance of environmental and genetic components shaping these ontogenetic trajectories, and (iii) the consequences of these ontogenetic trajectories on plant fitness. Advances in this area will shed light on the context dependency of bottom-up and top-down controls of herbivore populations and on how natural selection actually shapes the ontogenetic trajectories of these traits.

AB The structure of tropical savanna ecosystems is influenced by fire frequency and intensity. There is particular interest in the extent to which long-term fire exclusion can result in a shift from savanna to forest vegetation that is not easily reversed by the reintroduction of fire. This study examined changes in the structure and composition of a long-unburnt site within the northern Australian savannas following an extended period of active fire exclusion (>20 years), and the effect of the reintroducing fire through experimental fire regimes, including fires in the early and late dry season at a range of frequencies. After the long period of fire exclusion, the vegetation community was characterized by a well-developed midstorey and canopy layer, low grass cover, substantially higher densities of woody sprouts and saplings than frequently burnt savanna. The community composition included a high proportion of rainforest-affiliated species. Three years of experimental fires had no detectable effect on the overall composition of grass layer and woody plants but had an effect on woody vegetation structure. Continued fire exclusion further increased the density of woody stems, particularly in the midstorey (2.04.99 m), whereas moderate-intensity fires (>800 kW m-1) significantly reduced the density of midstorey stems. The reintroduction of higher moderate intensity fire events resulted in the vegetation in some compartments reverting to the open savanna structure typical of frequently burnt sites. Such rapid reversibility suggests that in general, the woody thickening resulting from long-term fire exclusion did not represent a biome shift to a non-savanna state. However, there was a small proportion of the site that could not sustain the fires applied to them because grass cover was very low and patchy and therefore appeared to have crossed an ecological threshold towards closed forest.

AB Although grazing livestock may have direct negative effects on woody species through herbivory and trampling, (heavy-)grazing is often associated with woody plant encroachment. Two main mechanisms can explain the positive effects of grazers on woody cover: (1) Grazers reduce the interspecific competition with trees and may reduce fuel load, and (2) gut passage through livestock increases seedling establishment by scarification (increased germination) and fertilization by dung (higher survival and growth of seedlings). We tested the effects of fire, grass, cattle ingestion (transit) and dung on germination, seedling height and survival as well as on recruitment of Acacia sieberiana in a sub-humid grassland of South Africa. About 8,000 seeds were planted in the field in a randomized block design. The removal of grass by grazing and/or fire had the most important effect on Acacia recruitment in savanna. Our findings highlight the hierarchy of the main factors affecting Acacia recruitment, which provides new insights to the understanding of woody plant encroachment.

AB Questions: How does heavy grazing change plant community structure, composition and species richness and diversity in an ecotone between grassland and semi-arid shrub steppe-type vegetation? Does grazing favour plants with arid affinity over those with less arid affinity? Does the grazing-induced transformation constitute a switch to the equivalent of a shrub-dominated biome?
   Location: Central South Africa.
   Methods: Using systematic scanning of SPOT 5 imagery and ground-truthing, a grazing treatment area was selected that met criteria of intensity of grazing, sampling requirements, and biogeographical position within a broad ecotonal zone. Differential vegetation responses to heavy grazing were tested for significant differences in plant traits, vegetation structure, and species diversity, richness and evenness. Gamma diversity was calculated for the whole study site, whereas, independent beta diversity was calculated across the treatments assuming the additive partitioning of diversity. In addition, the biogeographical association of grazing-induced species shifts was determined using a range of available databases.
   Results: Canopy cover and height of woody shrubs increased significantly with heavy grazing whereas that of graminoid plants declined. The resultant species turnover was modest, apparent extinctions of local species were minimal, species richness was maintained and species diversity was significantly enhanced. There was a significant increase in species evenness, through possible suppression of dominant species. Significant increases in species cover were those associated with mainly the Nama-Karoo biome indicating that species from more arid areas are more resistant to grazing as would be expected by the convergence model of aridity and grazing resistance.
   Conclusions: The significant increase in shrub cover in heavily grazed semi-arid grassland followed general global expectations. The study confirmed that the supposed former large shift of grassland to shrubby Nama-Karoo in the eastern upper Karoo can indeed be readily affected by heavy grazing. The negative connotations for biodiversity that have often been associated with intense grazing seem, in terms of the positive responses of plant species diversity in this study, to perhaps be exaggerated. The elevated species diversity with grazing of vegetation with a long evolutionary grazing history in a low resource area may require a reappraisal of the application of certain grazing hypotheses.

AB The present study is the first to determine priorities for the location of marine reserves using spatial prioritization software in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. We used biophysical data from visual census surveys on: fish species abundance, presence of various habitat types, and percent coverage of seagrasses and canopy algae. Efficient conservation planning requires spatially explicit information on how proposed management will affect stakeholders, which in this region was very limited. We created novel socio-economic cost indices to account for fisheries and tourists. Our fishing metrics were based on fisher behaviour including information on the location of ports and areas often inaccessible to fishers due to high wind exposure. We developed a cost index for tourism based on the availability of beds for tourists. We examined how the spatial priorities for marine reserves varied using different combinations of these socio-economic cost metrics. We found about 17% of sites were a high priority regardless of which cost metric was used. We also compared, for the first time in the Mediterranean, our results devised using systematic conservation planning approaches with priorities developed by two non-systematic methods, the Natura 2000 proposed marine reserves and sites that local fishers proposed for protection. Only a few sites identified by our approach were the same as those recommended as part of Natura 2000 or the fishers' proposals. This suggests that much more work is needed to harmonise existing proposals with the principles of efficient systematic conservation planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wood falls in the deep sea have recently become the focus of studies showing their importance as nutrients on the deep-sea floor. In such environments, Crustaceans constitute numerically the second-largest group after Mollusks. Many questions have arisen regarding their trophic role therein. A careful examination of the feeding appendages, gut contents, and gut lining of Munidopsis andamanica caught with wood falls revealed this species as a truly original detritivorous species using wood and the biofilm covering it as two main food sources. Comparing individuals from other geographic areas from substrates not reported highlights the galatheid crab as specialist of refractory substrates, especially vegetal remains. M. andamanica also exhibits a resident gut microflora consisting of bacteria and fungi possibly involved in the digestion of wood fragments. The results suggest that Crustaceans could be full-fledged actors in the food chains of sunken-wood ecosystems and that feeding habits of some squat lobsters could be different than scavenging.

AB Despite low growth rates, plants in arid areas have a strong ability to modify soil surface properties affecting ecosystem processes and community dynamics. But our knowledge on species effects oil soil properties in these areas comes largely from observational studies, increasing the risk of confounding factors and precluding estimations of rates of change. We evaluated changes in soil surface properties underneath Acacia salicina, Pinus halepensis and Eucalyptus occidentalis in a 10-year-old common garden experiment established on a degraded Stipa tenacissima steppe in southern Tunisia. The three species tested improved soil properties compared to those of open areas. Acacia salicina ranked first as soil modifier as the soil underneath this species showed higher total organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, soil CO2 efflux and infiltration rate, and lower soil hydrophobicity than soil in open areas. The richness of vascular plants was higher under A. salicina than under the other types of cover. This species showed higher ability to improve microsite conditions and foster succession. Short rotations of A. salicina could thus be employed for the restoration of degraded S. tenacissima steppes provided that other aspects of its ecology are controlled. Pinus halepensis represents a good alternative when native species are a priority, albeit facilitative ability is lower. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The seasonal dynamics of picophytoplankton communities in shallow turbid alkaline pans in Hungary was studied between July 2006 and May 2007. Similarly to other aquatic environments in the temperate zone, dominance of picocyanobacteria was observed in summer and that of picoeukaryotes in winter. The mild winter in 2006-2007, with midday water temperatures of 5-10A degrees C, resulted in large winter phytoplankton blooms (maximum chlorophyll a concentration 800 mu g l(-1)) in the shallow pans. The phytoplankton was composed of single-celled picoeukaryotes and had a maximum of 108 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) in Budos-sz,k pan, 50 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) in Kelemen-sz,k pan in April 2007, and 47 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) in Zab-sz,k pan in March 2007. In order to explain the winter dominance of picoeukaryotes, we isolated picoeukaryotic and picocyanobacterial strains and determined the temperature and light dependence of their photosynthesis. Under temperatures < 15A degrees C, the photosynthetic activity of the picoeukaryotic strain was higher and their light utilization was better than those of the picocyanobacterial strain. The results indicate that low temperature and light intensity in winter provide a competitive advantage to picoeukaryotes, while higher temperatures and light intensity are more favorable for picocyanobacteria.

AB It has been suggested that during the past several decades, the frequency and the intensity of wildfires have markedly increased in the Mediterranean basin. We came to assess this postulation in the forested region of Mount Carmel, Israel. This region is characterized by Quercus spp. and Pistacia spp. maquis and has been intensely afforested with Pinus spp. stands since the 1920s. We compiled a GIS-based database of the fires recorded in the region since 1983, in addition to archiving data beginning from the 1940s. The data were collected from land stewardship agencies' archives, fire departments and aerial photographs. Prior to the early 1980s, no systematic documentation of the fires was available, rather just sporadic qualitative documentation of the large forest fires that occurred. Between 1944 and 1982, only 6 large fires were documented, while after that 11 large fires occurred. Analysis indicated that the spatial distribution of the fires does not occur at random, and their locations are significantly closer to roadsides compared to an expected random distribution. The annual number of fires and the areas burned during the last two decades were not correlated with annual precipitation in any manner. Accordingly, we suggest that the increased number of large forest fires during the last decades is associated with the maturation and senescence of the planted forest coupled with increased human activities.

AB Bacterial community compositions (BCC) associated with the cladoceran Bosmina coregoni and the cyclopoid copepod Thermocyclops oithonoides in oligotrophic Lake Stechlin versus eutrophic Lake Dagow (northeastern Germany) were compared using molecular techniques. We also transplanted the zooplankton from their native lake to the other lake, and studied changes in their associated BCC as a result of the modified ambient environment. Bacterial community composition associated with B. coregoni was quite conservative between the oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes, and most of the bacteria belonged to Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria. In contrast, BCC associated with T. oithonoides was highly variable and dependent on the environment, and Betaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most represented among the bacteria. Thermocyclops oithonoides from the oligotrophic lake was more able to retain its bacteria after being transplanted to the eutrophic lake than vice versa. This suggests that bacteria in oligotrophic water were more firmly attached to the copepod and better in resisting environmental fluctuations than those in eutrophic water.

AB Soil properties (i.e. soil organic carbon, SOC; soil organic nitrogen, SON; and soil C/N ratio) and vegetation in a semiarid grassland of Inner Mongolia, northern China, were studied with the method of geostatistical analysis. We examined the spatial heterogeneity of soil and plants, and possible impacts of land use on their heterogeneity and on the relationship between soil resources and plant richness. Land use affected small scale spatial heterogeneity in plants and soil. SOC, SON and C/N ratio displayed autocorrelation over a range of similar to 2 m under most circumstances on sites where livestock grazing had been excluded. The uncontrolled grazing site (UG, i.e. unregulated grazing by excessive livestock) displayed an increased range of spatial autocorrelation and the total amount of variability in soil nitrogen over the other land use types. Plant life forms and plant species exhibited spatial autocorrelation over a range of about 2 m on the grazing exclusion (GE) and mowed (MW) sites, while pattern of spatial autocorrelation for several less common species on the UG site were difficult to predict. Plant species richness was positively related with spatial heterogeneity of SOC, SON and C/N on both GE and MW sites, and with only SOC heterogeneity on the UG site. These suggest that spatial soil heterogeneity plays an active role in maintaining plant species richness. However, we call for caution in generalization of the control of spatial soil heterogeneity over plant richness when multiple modes of disturbances are present, as we found in this study that higher total amount of variation in soil nitrogen and C/N ratio on the over-grazed UG site did not lead to increased plant species richness, and that land use had apparent effects on the patterns of spatial heterogeneity in both vegetation and soil.

AB The fragmentation of an environment into developed and protected areas may influence selection pressure on dispersal by increasing the chance of moving from a favorable to an unfavorable habitat. We theoretically explore this possibility through two cases: (1) marine systems in which reduced predation and/or increased feeding drive the evolution of planktonic larval duration and (2) more generally, where stochasticity in reproductive yield drives the evolution of the proportion of offspring dispersing. Model results indicate that habitat fragmentation generally shifts selection pressure toward reduced dispersal, particularly when areas outside reserves are uninhabitable. However, shifts to increased dispersal may occur when temporal heterogeneity is the primary selective force and constant quota harvest occurs outside reserves. In addition, model results suggest the potential for changes in the genetic variability in dispersal after habitat fragmentation. The predicted evolutionary changes in dispersal will depend on factors such as the relative genetic and environmental contributions to dispersal- related traits and the extent of anthropogenic impacts outside reserves. If the predicted evolutionary changes are biologically attainable, they may suggest altering current guidelines for the appropriate size and spacing of marine reserves necessary to achieve conservation and fisheries goals.

   revealed by microsatellite markers
SO MARINE BIOLOGY

DT Article
ID LARVAL; BEHAVIOR
AB Self-recruitment rates are essential parameters in the estimation of connectivity among populations, having important consequences in marine conservation biology. Using ten highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, we estimate, over 3 years, the self-recruitment in a population of Tripterygion delaisi in the NW Mediterranean. Six previously described source populations were used for the assignment (Costa Brava, Columbretes, Formentera, Cabo de Palos, Cabo de Gata and Tarifa). Even though this species has a 16-21 day larval duration, a mean of 66.4 +/- 1.4% of the recruits settled in their natal population. When refining in a more local scale the origin of individuals self-recruited to Costa Brava, using as source the three sampling localities that conform this population (Cap de Creus, Tossa and Blanes), the highest percentage (40.6 +/- 8.9%) was self-assigned to the adult source locality (Blanes) where recruits were sampled each year. Our results suggest that a high proportion of the larvae of T. delaisi remained close to, or never leave, their natal spawning area. This observation can be extrapolated to other species with similar early life-history traits and low adult mobility and can have important implications for the conservation and management of Mediterranean littoral fishes.

AB Physical ecosystem engineers play dominant roles in a wide variety of communities. While many of the direct, positive effects of ecosystem engineers are readily apparent, the roles of engineers are often mediated by indirect interactions stemming from the facilitation of one or a few key species. Although direct and indirect effects are both critical drivers of community dynamics, they are rarely considered together with regards to ecosystem engineering. In the present study barnacle and herbivorous gastropod densities are experimentally manipulated to investigate the direct positive effects of habitat provision by barnacles as well as indirect effects mediated by molluscan grazers. Molluscan grazers (Littorina spp.) and herbivorous arthropods were positively influenced by the presence of barnacles. Arthropod abundance and species richness were lower when Littorina spp. were present. This pattern was not influenced by barnacle cover, suggesting that competition among herbivore functional groups was strong but independent of biogenic habitat complexity. In addition, Littorina spp. had strong negative effects on the filamentous alga Urospora penicilliformis, but this effect was only seen in the absence of barnacles. Finally, Littorina spp. reduced the recruitment of the principal habitat-forming barnacle Balanus glandula, suggesting that Littorina spp. may mediate a negative feedback loop in B. glandula population dynamics. Given the ubiquity of ecosystem engineers, similar combinations of direct and indirect influences may have far-reaching consequences for community dynamics and species richness in a wide range of systems.

AB Archaeological studies of temporal changes in human predation strategy using foraging theory fetid to focus on the role of overexploitation of important prey resources and resulting resource depression. An alternative use of the prey-choice model framed under foraging theory is to investigate the influence of environmental changes. such as increases in climate stress. on prey availability. Environmental change can be expected to produce many. of the same effects on human predation. strategy as resource depression. Here analytical techniques typically used to study the effects of over-predation and resource depression caused by humans are used to monitor their response to fluctuations in prey availability related to climate change during the Holocene in Missouri. Data and interpretations presented here, add to the growing body of zooarchaeological foraging theory literature implicating environmental change as a critical factor in human diet.

AB The distribution maps of a total of 3563 species, which represent 8.9% of the known African angiosperm. flora, were entered into cells representing a one-degree latitude-longitude grid of Sub-Saharan Africa. The computer programme WORLDMAP was used to explore continental scale patterns of biodiversity. The maps were used to assess the use of higher taxa as a surrogate measure for predicting patterns of species richness. Genera were found to predict species richness distributions most closely, with higher taxa (families, orders, subclasses) exhibiting progressively worse correlations. However in two areas, the Cape Region of South Africa and coastal Cameroon, there was a higher species to genus ratio than in other areas of Africa. In the Cape Region this meant that generic richness failed to predict species richness. Hotspots, defined as the 5% of grid cells with the highest scores for richness and range-size rarity, were identified for species and higher taxa. Whilst a high percentage of species richness hotspots were predicted by higher taxa, there were important exceptions like the Cape Region. Species range-size rarity hotspots were not well predicted by higher taxa. Hotspots of higher taxa (families and orders) do not therefore accurately predict the location of species hotspots. Higher taxa appear to provide a powerful and accurate tool that can be used to predict large scale patterns of species biodiversity in Sub-Saharan Africa. However care must be taken when using taxa higher than genera, especially if selecting areas of highest conservation priority. The special case of the Cape Region indicates the danger of extending predictive generalizations as the ecological mechanisms that promote and retain species may not be the same in all places.

AB Foraging decisions are an integral component of growth and maintenance and may reflect both environmental and genetic effects. We used p common garden experiment to evaluate the effects of food, temperature, and population source on pit-building decisions of the larval ant lion Myrmeleon immaculatus. In a laboratory common garden experiment, first-instar larvae from two southern (Georgia, South Carolina) and two northern (Connecticut, Rhode Island populations were reared for 14 months in incubators under high- and low-food and high- and low-temperature regimes. For all populations, there was no effect of larval age on pit-building behavior A II larvae built and maintained pits more frequently fit high temperatures than at low temperatures, and larvae in the low-food treatments built and maintained pits more frequently than larvae in the high-food treatments Larvae from the southern populations built and maintained pits more frequently than larvae from northern populations These results suggest that regional differences in foraging behavior may contribute to latitudinal gradients in life history strategies been in this insect.

AB The ability to regulate O-2 uptake during exposure to acutely declining O-2 tensions developed early (stage 6) in the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana and co-occurred with the appearance of a functional heart and gills. Culture under chronic hypoxia (PO2=10 kPa) resulted in this regulation being brought forward both in development (to stage 3) and in time (hypoxia stimulated early growth), but still before heart and gill formation took place, Consequently, it was suggested that the hypoxia-related early appearance of respiratory regulation is most probably linked to an increase in haemoglobin concentration that occurred at this time. Brine shrimp cultured under conditions of intermittent hypoxia exposure (16 h of normoxia, 8 h of hypoxia) showed a pattern of regulation development intermediate between that of individuals reared in normoxic and chronically hypoxic culture. This occurrence of hypoxia-related, physiological 'heterochrony' in brine shrimp resulted in a decrease in Darwinian fitness las indicated by a decrease in individual lifetime reproductive output), indicating that, in some cases at least, relatively small alterations in the expression of physiological traits may well have major ecological, and ultimately evolutionary, consequences.

AB Concentrations of NH4+, NO3-, PO43-, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ in snow meltwater resulting from summer snow showers were monitored before and after its passage through monospecific stands of the Antarctic macrolichen Usnea sphacelata R. Br. The sampling was conducted under field conditions near Casey Station in East Antarctica between January and March. Total snow deposition during the 61-d period was 44 +/- 1 mm (rainfall equivalent depth) delivering 362 +/- 10, 87 +/- 2 and 9 +/- 1 mu mol m(-2) of NH4+, NO3- and PO43-, respectively. Meltwater that had percolated through U. sphacelata was depleted in NH4+ and NO3- equating with a retention by the lichen of 87 and 92 %, respectively, of the total wet deposition of these ions. Lichen-modified meltwater was slightly enriched in PO43-, but because the volume of the lichen percolate was smaller than that of the original snow deposition, the lichen achieved a net gain of 9 % of the total P deposited. Lichen percolate was also enriched in metal cations. Potassium loss associated with the melting of the heaviest snowfall (18 mm) was equivalent to only 0.05 % of the total K in the lichen suggesting that ion loss did not signal significant cellular damage. There was also a progressive increase in NH4+ concentration in unmodified meltwater from 3 to 21 nmol ml(-1) over a 3-d period whereas levels in the lichen-modified meltwater remained unchanged at less than or equal to 4 nmol ml(-1). This enrichment in NH4+ might have resulted from dry deposition onto the melting snow pack of NH3 emitted from nearby penguin rookeries. During the study, tagged thalli of U. sphacelata made a 2 % loss in dry mass although they appeared healthy and, at the end of the study, showed an effective quantum yield (Delta F/Fm') comparable with field material. The results are discussed in relation to the time of year that is likely to be most suitable for lichen growth in this continental Antarctic environment and the potential growth-led demand for N in U. sphacelata.

AB Satellites allow large-scale surveys to be conducted in short time periods with repeat surveys possible at intervals of <24 h. Very-high-resolution satellite imagery has been successfully used to detect and count a number of wildlife species in open, homogeneous landscapes and seascapes where target animals have a strong contrast with their environment. However, no research to date has detected animals in complex heterogeneous environments or detected elephants from space using very-high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning. In this study, we apply a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically detect and count African elephants in a woodland savanna ecosystem in South Africa. We use WorldView-3 and 4 satellite data -the highest resolution satellite imagery commercially available. We train and test the model on 11 images from 2014 to 2019. We compare the performance accuracy of the CNN against human accuracy. Additionally, we apply the model on a coarser resolution satellite image (GeoEye-1) captured in Kenya, without any additional training data, to test if the algorithm can generalize to an elephant population outside of the training area. Our results show that the CNN performs with high accuracy, comparable to human detection capabilities. The detection accuracy (i.e., F2 score) of the CNN models was 0.78 in heterogeneous areas and 0.73 in homogenous areas. This compares with the detection accuracy of the human labels with an averaged F2 score 0.77 in heterogeneous areas and 0.80 in homogenous areas. The CNN model can generalize to detect elephants in a different geographical location and from a lower resolution satellite. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of applying state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing and deep learning technologies for detecting and counting African elephants in heterogeneous landscapes. The study showcases the feasibility of using high resolution satellite imagery as a promising new wildlife surveying technique. Through creation of a customized training dataset and application of a Convolutional Neural Network, we have automated the detection of elephants in satellite imagery with accuracy as high as human detection capabilities. The success of the model to detect elephants outside of the training data site demonstrates the generalizability of the technique.

AB In parts of the developing world, the expansion of industrial sand mining activities has led to serious environmental concerns. However, current understanding of the effects of this activity on an inland water ecosystem remains limited. Herein, we choose the "most affected" lake in China (Dongting lake), to assess short-term (1 year) effects of sand dredging on key environmental parameters and on the structure of the macroinvertebrate assemblage. Within the dredged area we observed increases in water depth (on average 2.17 m), turbidity and changes in sediment composition (e.g., increase in % medium sand, and a decrease in % clay). In addition, dredging was associated with a 50 % reduction in taxa richness, Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indices, and a 72 and 99 % reduction in abundance and biomass, respectively. Indirect effects were also observed in the zone surrounding the extraction sites (ca. 500 m), most likely as a result of the dredging processes (e.g., sediment screening and overspill) and water flow. No such effects were observed at a nearby reference site. The direct removal of sediment and indirect alteration of physical conditions (e.g., water depth, turbidity and sediment composition) appear to be the most likely cause of variations in the benthic community. Implications of our findings for the planning, management and monitoring of sand dredging in inland waters are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale development projects often overlap forest areas that support the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, threatening in situ conservation strategies for the protection of biological and cultural diversity. To address this problem, there is a need to integrate spatially-explicit information on ecosystem services into conservation planning. We present an approach for identifying conservation areas necessary to safeguard the provision of important ecosystem services for indigenous communities. "Community use zones" (CUZs) were generated using participatory mapping methods that identify place values indicating significant hotspots for ecosystem services. Using principles from landscape ecology, these areas are buffered to provide connectivity and to delineate ecosystem service delivery areas. We demonstrate the use of CUZs for five villages in southern Suriname (n=191 participants) to inform the South Suriname Conservation Corridor project. The mapped data reveal overlapping hotspots for different ecosystem services depicting multifunctional landscapes that provide an empirical foundation for delineating CUZs. In the absence of legal and traditional land rights for indigenous people, CUZs based on the provision of ecosystem services provide a defensible, spatially explicit approach for integrating indigenous needs into regional conservation plans in southern Suriname. We discuss the utility of CUZ maps for promoting land tenure and security and as a basis for collaborative governance in indigenous and community-conserved areas (ICCAs). (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Similarity among species in traits related to ecological interactions is frequently associated with common ancestry. Thus, closely related species usually interact with ecologically similar partners, which can be reinforced by diverse co-evolutionary processes. The effect of habitat fragmentation on the phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions and correspondence between plant and animal phylogenies is, however, unknown. Here, we address to what extent phylogenetic signal and co-phylogenetic congruence of plant-animal interactions depend on habitat size and isolation by analysing the phylogenetic structure of 12 pollination webs from isolated Pampean hills. Phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions differed among webs, being stronger for flower-visiting insects than plants. Phylogenetic signal and overall co-phylogenetic congruence increased independently with hill size and isolation. We propose that habitat fragmentation would erode the phylogenetic structure of interaction webs. A decrease in phylogenetic signal and co-phylogenetic correspondence in plant-pollinator interactions could be associated with less reliable mutualism and erratic co-evolutionary change.

AB Farmed sea cucumbers (Apostichopus japonicus) of the same age displayed significantly different body sizes and weights under the same farming conditions. To examine the gut bacterial diversity of sea cucumbers and whether the growth differences between them were related to intestinal microbiota, the bacterial species from intestinal samples of 30 farmed A. japonicus from the same tank (15 large sea cucumbers vs. 15 small sea cucumbers) were characterized based on 16S rRNA gene analysis by means of high throughout sequencing. The results showed that bacterial phylotypes in both sizes of sea cucumbers were closely related to Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycete, and Spirochaetes, of which Proteobacteria were predominant (> 50%). There were no significant differences in the relative abundances of each bacterial phylotype between the two groups, except for Actinobacteria (P < 0.05). In addition, different species uniquely belonging to all three tested samples in the large group and the small group were found. It was interestingly that Vibrio were absent from both groups. It is likely that the differences in the abundances of Actinobacteria and different species in the two groups may be related to their remarkable disparities in body sizes.

AB In this study, we have examined the bacterial community composition of the laboratory cultured sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus gut microbiome and its culture environment using NextGen amplicon sequencing of the V4 segment of the 16S rRNA gene, and downstream bioinformatics tools. Overall, the gut and tank water was dominated by Proteobacteria, whereas the feed consisted of a co-occurrence of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes at a high abundance. The gut tissue represented Epsilonproteobacteria as dominant, with order Campylobacterales at the highest relative abundance (>95%). However, the pharynx tissue was dominated by class Alphaproteobacteria. The gut digesta and egested fecal pellets had a high abundance of class Gammaproteobacteria, from which Vibrio was found to be the primary genus, and Epsilonproteobacteria, with genus Arcobacter occurring at a moderate level. At the class level, the tank water was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria, and the feed by Alphaproteobacteria. Multi-Dimensional Scaling analysis showed that the microbial community of the gut tissue clustered together, as did the pharynx tissue to the feed. The gut digesta and egested fecal pellets showed a similarity relationship to the tank water. Further analysis of Campylobacterales at a lower taxonomic level using the oligotyping method revealed 37 unique types across the 10 samples, where Oligotype 1 was primarily represented in the gut tissue. BLAST analysis identified Oligotype 1 to be Arcobacter sp., Sulfuricurvum sp., and Arcobacter bivalviorum at an identity level >90%. This study showed that although distinct microbial communities are evident across multiple components of the sea urchin gut ecosystem, there is a noticeable correlation between the overall microbial communities of the gut with the sea urchin L. variegatus culture environment.

ID NETWORK; VIRUS
AB The global flow of air travel passengers varies over time and space, but analyses of these dynamics and their integration into applications in the fields of economics, epidemiology and migration, for example, have been constrained by a lack of data, given that air passenger flow data are often difficult and expensive to obtain. Here, these dynamics are modeled at a monthly scale to provide an open-access spatio-temporally resolved data source for research purposes (www.vbd-air.com/data). By refining an annual-scale model of Huang et al. (2013), we developed a set of Poisson regression models to predict monthly passenger volumes between directly connected airports during 2010. The models not only performed well in the United States with an overall accuracy of 93%, but also showed a reasonable confidence in estimating air passenger volumes in other regions of the world. Using the model outcomes, this research studied the spatio-temporal dynamics in the world airline network (WAN) that previous analyses were unable to capture. Findings on the monthly variation of WAN offer new knowledge for dynamic planning and strategy design to address global issues, such as disease pandemics and climate change. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Understanding movement and dispersal of the common bed bug (Cimex lectularius L.) under field conditions is important in the control of infestations and for managing the spread of bed bugs to new locations. We investigated bed bug movement within and between apartments using mark-release-recapture (m-r-r) technique combined with apartment-wide monitoring using pitfall-style interceptors. Bed bugs were collected, marked, and released in six apartments. The distribution of marked and unmarked bed bugs in these apartments and their 24 neighboring units were monitored over 32 days. Extensive movement of marked bed bugs within and between apartments occurred regardless of the number of bed bugs released or presence/absence of a host. Comparison of marked and unmarked bed bug distributions confirms that the extensive bed bug activity observed was not an artifact of the m-r-r technique used. Marked bed bugs were recovered in apartments neighboring five of six m-r-r apartments. Their dispersal rates at 14 or 15 d were 0.0-5.0%. The estimated number of bed bugs per apartment in the six m-r-r apartments was 2,433-14,291 at 4-7 d after release. Longevity of bed bugs in the absence of a host was recorded in a vacant apartment. Marked large nymphs (3rd -5th instar), adult females, and adult males continued to be recovered up to 57, 113, and 134 d after host absence, respectively. Among the naturally existing unmarked bed bugs, unfed small nymphs (1st -2nd instar) were recovered up to 134 d; large nymphs and adults were still found at 155 d when the study ended. Our findings provide important insight into the behavioral ecology of bed bugs in infested apartments and have significant implications in regards to eradication programs and managing the spread of bed bugs within multi-occupancy dwellings.

AB Identifying the driving forces behind oceanic pelagic shark movements is key to a better understanding of their life history. Some oceanic pelagic shark species have been shown to aggregate in specific regions to mate and/or exploit abundant food resources. The oceanic whitetip shark Carcharhinus longimanus, a subtropical, ectothermic, oceanic pelagic shark that has experienced severe population declines, aggregates seasonally around Cat Island (CI) in The Bahamas. Large pelagic teleosts (e. g. billfish, tunas, and dolphinfish) are abundant in this region and oceanic whitetips are anecdotally reported to feed heavily on recreationally caught teleosts. However, it was unknown whether feeding habits at CI substantially differ from longer-term feeding habits. We used tag-recapture to assess site-fidelity of adult oceanic whitetips to CI and stable isotope analysis (SIA) of 2 different tissues (blood plasma and white muscle) to compare short-and long-term feeding patterns. The relatively high recapture rate (20.3%) confirmed that individual whitetips exhibit site-fidelity to CI. The aggregation consisted of adult individuals; females were more common, more than half were gravid, and no physical or behavioral evidence of mating or parturition was observed at CI. SIA-based Bayesian mixing model estimates of short-term (near CI) diets showed more large pelagic teleosts (72%) than in long-term diets (47%), showing a spatiotemporal difference in oceanic whitetip feeding habits. This suggests that availability of large teleost prey is a possible mechanism underpinning site-fidelity and aggregation of whitetips at CI. These results provide insight into the function of one of the last known aggregations of this once-abundant top predator.

AB Pollinator-plant relationships are found to be particularly vulnerable to land use change. Yet despite extensive research in agricultural and natural systems, less attention has focused on these interactions in neighboring urban areas and its impact on pollination services. We investigated pollinator-plant interactions in a peri-urban landscape on the outskirts of the San Francisco Bay Area, California, where urban, agricultural, and natural land use types interface. We made standardized observations of floral visitation and measured seed set of yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), a common grassland invasive, to test the hypotheses that increasing urbanization decreases 1) rates of bee visitation, 2) viable seed set, and 3) the efficiency of pollination (relationship between bee visitation and seed set). We unexpectedly found that bee visitation was highest in urban and agricultural land use contexts, but in contrast, seed set rates in these human-altered landscapes were lower than in natural sites. An explanation for the discrepancy between floral visitation and seed set is that higher plant diversity in urban and agricultural areas, as a result of more introduced species, decreases pollinator efficiency. If these patterns are consistent across other plant species, the novel plant communities created in these managed landscapes and the generalist bee species that are favored by human-altered environments will reduce pollination services.

AB The paper presents the history of Quercus rubra L. introduction and current distribution in the state forests of Poland. We followed the extent of Q. rubra planting on a spatial and temporal scale, based on data obtained from the Information System of the Polish State Forests (SILP) as of 2011. The current distribution of Northern Red oak, the characteristics of Q. rubra stands, the purposes of cultivation, the type of occupied forest habitat and differences of tree age were also analysed.
   Q. rubra has been deliberately introduced to Poland as a commercially important tree since the beginning of the 19th century. During two hundred year period, the area of its intentional cultivation has been successively increased. In the second part of the 20th century, the scale and the rate of its planting have significantly accelerated. At present, Q. rubra occurs in the whole country and occupies 14.3 thousand ha of the state forests, including 10.5 thousand ha of timber plantations. Within the remaining area, Q. rubra was planted as an admixture woody species. Despite the relatively small proportion of area with planted Q. rubra in the total forest area (just 0.16%), red oak seems to occur commonly, mainly due to the very high number (over 80 thousand) localities through which it is spatially dispersed. It is planted in a wide range of forest soils: from dry and poor areas that are suitable for coniferous forest, to soils that are flooded and rich in nutrients and naturally overgrown by deciduous forests. The biggest area of its plantation, however, is located in mixed deciduous forests (with moisture and medium-rich soils). It is commonly used in forest restoration of post-industrial (e.g. post-mine) soils as well as in the afforestation of abandoned or poor post-agricultural lands. Currently, most of the stands are too young for logging, so the commercial significance of Q. rubra wood in the timber market is still low, but it is considered one of the most commercially important trees of alien origin in Poland.
   The long lasting (200 years) and widespread cultivation of Q. rubra in European forests, however, in combination with the noted abundance of vital acorns, seedlings and saplings produced by numerous mature trees, may lead to a sustained propagule pressure and the expansion of this "sleeper weed".

AB Human-mediated changes in habitat structure may disturb predator-prey relationships. We investigated the influence of perimeter fences on the diet of a reintroduced population of African wild dogs Lycaon pictus Temminck 1820 in a 316 km(2), fenced reserve in South Africa, by tracking radio-collared individuals during hunting periods to determine dietary composition from observed kills. Nutritional status of impala Aepyceros melampus and kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros prey, as measured by the percentage of femur marrow fat, was significantly lower than that of unselectively culled individuals. This supports the hypothesis that wild dog predation is at least partially compensatory. Fence-impeded kills (those for which escape was deemed to be compromised by the fence) comprised 40.5% of kills (n = 316), and 54.1% of all edible biomass consumed. Compared with fence-unimpeded kills, fence-impeded kills comprised larger species (32.9 vs. 25.0 kg, W = 25667.0, P << 0.001), older age classes for one prey category (female kudu: Fisher's exact test, P = 0.02, n = 65) and animals in better condition for adult impala males (Mann-Whitney, W = 111.0, P = 0.012, n = 28). Fence-impeded kills also provided greater catch per unit hunting effort (27.3 vs. 12.2 kg km(-1); chi(2) = 7.89, P = 0.005), resulting in longer interkill intervals. Movement of the pack towards the fence at the start of each hunting period suggested a decision to exploit the advantage that fences conferred for capturing prey.Synthesis and applications. By enabling coursing predators to capture prey that would otherwise have escaped, fences may reduce the compensatory nature of predation, causing shifts in predator-prey dynamics that could influence the ability of small reserves to support such predators. The establishment of larger conservation areas to reduce perimeter-to-area ratios should be encouraged to limit the undesired effects of fences on predator-prey dynamics.

AB Knowledge of the success or otherwise of conservation interventions is often locked within localised networks, resulting in mistakes being replicated unnecessarily. The savannahs of eastern and southern Africa are home to spectacular ecosystems with similar ecology yet markedly different conservation practices between the two regions. Pressures on east African ecosystems are rising in ways similar to those of southern Africa several decades ago. Conservation practitioners and researchers from southern and eastern Africa came together for a 5-day workshop to identify by consensus a short list of 10 most important lessons for management of savannah habitats learnt from the southern experience. The lessons identified concerned (I) protected area design, (2) community relationships, (3) buffer zones, (4) the importance of migrations and corridors, (5) river catchment management, (6) law enforcement, (7) invasive plants, (8) road planning, (9) loss of heterogeneity, and (10) communication between researchers and practitioners. The lessons learnt from southern Africa can prevent many mistakes being made in east African protected area management, providing they are implemented on the ground. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Knowledge of horizontal relative dispersion in nearshore oceans is important for many applications including the transport and fate of pollutants and the dynamics of nearshore ecosystems. Two-particle dispersion statistics are calculated from millions of synthetic particle trajectories from high-resolution numerical simulations of the Southern California Bight. The model horizontal resolution of 250 m allows the investigation of the two-particle dispersion, with an initial pair separation of 500 m. The relative dispersion is characterized with respect to the coastal geometry, bathymetry, eddy kinetic energy, and the relative magnitudes of strain and vorticity. Dispersion is dominated by the submesoscale, not by tides. In general, headlands are more energetic and dispersive than bays. Relative diffusivity estimates are smaller and more anisotropic close to shore. Farther from shore, the relative diffusivity increases and becomes less anisotropic, approaching isotropy similar to 10 km from the coast. The degree of anisotropy of the relative diffusivity is qualitatively consistent with that for eddy kinetic energy. The total relative diffusivity as a function of pair separation distance R is on average proportional to R-5/4. Additional Lagrangian experiments at higher horizontal numerical resolution confirmed the robustness of these results. Structures of large vorticity are preferably elongated and aligned with the coastline nearshore, which may limit cross-shelf dispersion. The results provide useful information for the design of subgrid-scale mixing parameterizations as well as quantifying the transport and dispersal of dissolved pollutants and biological propagules.

AB There are three key drivers of the biodiversity crisis: (1) the well known existing threats to biodiversity such as habitat loss, invasive pest species and resource exploitation; (2) direct effects of climate-change, such as on coastal and high elevation communities and coral reefs; and (3) the interaction between existing threats and climate-change. The third driver is set to accelerate the biodiversity crisis beyond the impacts of the first and second drivers in isolation. In this review we assess these interactions, and suggest the policy and management responses that are needed to minimise their impacts. Renewed management and policy action that address known threats to biodiversity could substantially diminish the impacts of future climate-change. An appropriate response to climate-change will include a reduction of land clearing, increased habitat restoration using indigenous species, a reduction in the number of exotic species transported between continents or between major regions of endemism, and a reduction in the unsustainable use of natural resources. Achieving these measures requires substantial reform of international, national and regional policy, and the development of new or more effective alliances between scientists, government agencies, non-government organisations and land managers. Furthermore, new management practices and policy are needed that consider shifts in the geographic range of species, and that are responsive to new information acquired from improved research and monitoring programs. The interactions of climate-change with existing threats to biodiversity have the potential to drive many species to extinction, but there is much that can be done now to reduce this risk.

AB Estimating the age of individuals in wild populations can be of fundamental importance for answering ecological questions, modeling population demographics, and managing exploited or threatened species. Significant effort has been devoted to determining age through the use of growth annuli, secondary physical characteristics related to age, and growth models. Many species, however, either do not exhibit physical characteristics useful for independent age validation or are too rare to justify sacrificing a large number of individuals to establish the relationship between size and age. Length-at-age models are well represented in the fisheries and other wildlife management literature. Many of these models overlook variation in growth rates of individuals and consider growth parameters as population parameters. More recent models have taken advantage of hierarchical structuring of parameters and Bayesian inference methods to allow for variation among individuals as functions of environmental covariates or individual-specific random effects. Here, we describe hierarchical models in which growth curves vary as individual-specific stochastic processes, and we show how these models can be fit using capture-recapture data for animals of unknown age along with data for animals of known age. We combine these independent data sources in a Bayesian analysis, distinguishing natural variation (among and within individuals) from measurement error. We illustrate using data for African dwarf crocodiles, comparing von Bertalanffy and logistic growth models. The analysis provides the means of predicting crocodile age, given a single measurement of head length. The von Bertalanffy was much better supported than the logistic growth model and predicted that dwarf crocodiles grow from 19.4 cm total length at birth to 32.9 cm in the first year and 45.3 cm by the end of their second year. Based on the minimum size of females observed with hatchlings, reproductive maturity was estimated to be at nine years. These size benchmarks are believed to represent thresholds for important demographic parameters; improved estimates of age, therefore, will increase the precision of population projection models. The modeling approach that we present can be applied to other species and offers significant advantages when multiple sources of data are available and traditional aging techniques are not practical.

AB The exceptional diversity of large mammals in African savannas provides an ideal opportunity to explore the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up controls of large terrestrial herbivore communities. Recent work has emphasized the role of herbivore and carnivore body size in shaping these trophic relationships. However, the lack of across-ecosystem comparisons using a common methodology prohibits general conclusions. Here we used published data on primary production, herbivore and carnivore densities and diets to estimate the consumption fluxes between three trophic levels in four African savanna ecosystems. Our food web approach suggests that the body size distribution within and across trophic levels has a strong influence on the strength of top-down control of herbivores by carnivores and on consumption fluxes within ecosystems, as predicted by theoretical food web models. We generalize findings from the Serengeti ecosystem that suggest herbivore species below 150 kg are more likely to be limited by predation. We also emphasize the key functional role played by the largest species at each trophic level. The abundance of the largest herbivore species largely governs the consumption of primary production in resident communities. Similarly, predator guilds in which the largest carnivore species represent a larger share of carnivore biomass are likely to exert a stronger top-down impact on herbivores. Our study shows how a food web approach allows integrating current knowledge and offers a powerful framework to better understand the functioning of ecosystems.

AB Patterns of vertical distribution in marine invertebrate larvae interact with coastal hydrodynamics to determine cross-shore distributions, dispersal ranges, and scales of connectivity among populations. We present observations on the vertical distribution of barnacle larvae from southern California, collected from 3 depth intervals every 2 h and over a 48-h period at a fixed nearshore station. Larvae were identified to species and stage of development, and their vertical distributions were tested for day/night and between-stage differences within each species, as well as for correlations with environmental variability. Stage-specific patterns of vertical distribution were distinct and consistent across species. Nauplii were most abundant near the surface at all times, and were numerically dominated by Chthamalus spp. (78% of N(n) = 1835). Cyprids were substantially less abundant than nauplii in our samples (N(c)= 146) and corresponded mostly to the subtidal barnacle Balanus nubilus (84%). Despite the lower counts and different species composition, our data suggest that cyprids remain within the mid-depth and bottom layers, and that changes in their mean depth of distribution (MDD) may track changes in pycnocline depth. Temporal changes in nauplii MDD were not correlated with water-column variability, wind forcing, or tidal height. The apparent vertical segregation of nauplii and cyprids may be related to previously documented differences in the cross-shore distribution of these stages. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB It has been argued that canopy trees in tropical rainforests harbor species-rich ant assemblages; however, how ants partition the space on trees has not been adequately elucidated. Therefore, we investigated within-tree distributions of nest sites and foraging areas of individual ant colonies on canopy trees in a tropical lowland rainforest in Southeast Asia. The species diversity and colony abundance of ants were both significantly greater in crowns than on trunks. The concentration of ant species and colonies in the tree crown seemed to be associated with greater variation in nest cavity type in the crown, compared to the trunk. For ants nesting on canopy trees, the numbers of colonies and species were both higher for ants foraging only during the daytime than for those foraging at night. Similarly, for ants foraging on canopy trees, both values were higher for ants foraging only during the daytime than for those foraging at night. For most ant colonies nesting on canopy trees, foraging areas were limited to nearby nests and within the same type of microhabitat (within-tree position). All ants foraging on canopy trees in the daytime nested on canopy trees, whereas some ants foraging on the canopy trees at night nested on the ground. These results suggest that spatial partitioning by ant assemblages on canopy trees in tropical rainforests is affected by microenvironmental heterogeneity generated by three-dimensional structures (e.g., trees, epiphytes, lianas, and aerial soils) in the crowns of canopy trees. Furthermore, ant diversity appears to be enriched by both temporal (diel) and fine-scale spatial partitioning of foraging activity.

AB Invasive species can alter the soil nutrient pools and processes in ecosystems that they invade by altering the quality and quantity of litter inputs. Studies have shown the impact of vegetative understory invasions on soil nitrogen (N) availability in forest ecosystems. In the dry deciduous Vindhyan forest of India we studied the effect of one of the world's most noxious weeds, lantana (Lantana camara L) on soil N availability and N-mineralization beneath the forest canopy and lantana canopy. We observed that the lantana litter inputs increase with increasing lantana cover and the chemical composition of lantana litter was also very much different from the native forest species litter. High N, low lignin content of the lantana litter and favorable microclimate beneath lantana canopy favored faster decomposition and release of N. This alteration in litter inputs and chemistry beneath the lantana canopy positively and significantly altered soil N availability, N-mineralization, and total soil N. The results imply that a positive feed back nutrient cycle might exist beneath the lantana canopy which may favor its growth (cover) by increasing the nutrients beneath its canopy.

AB Non-geniculate coralline red algae are common in all of the world's oceans, where they often occupy close to 100% of the primary rocky substratum. The South African rocky subtidal and intertidal habitats in particular, are rich in diversity and abundance of non-geniculate coralline red algae. Despite their ubiquity, they are a poorly known and poorly understood group of marine organisms. Few scattered records of non-geniculate coralline red algae were published prior to 1993, but these should be treated with caution since many taxa have undergone major taxonomic review since then. Also, generic names such as Lithophyllum and Lithothamnion were loosely used by many authors for a host of different non-geniculate coralline algae. A series of taxonomic studies, based mainly on the Western Cape Province of South Africa, published particularly between 1993 and 2000, has significantly extended our knowledge of these algae from southern Africa. References to these latter papers and the older records are now gathered here and a list of the well delimited families (3), subfamilies (4), genera (17) and species (43) are presented. A catalogue with keys to the various taxonomic categories is also provided. A marked reduction in the number of real taxa has been found largely because many earlier recorded taxa have been reduced to synonymy, or have not been verified, or examined in a modem context and so their placement is considered dubious, particularly because the Corallinales have undergone major taxonomic revisions in recent years.

AB The Ernesto Tornquist nature reserve is a relict of native Pampas vegetation in Argentina. Alien trees were introduced to the reserve in the 1950s, mainly to "improve" the natural landscape, resulting in the arrival of a totally new life form. In 1987, a fire affected an area planted with Pinus halepensis resulting in its massive expansion. In 1999, we removed trees from 17 circular plots of 10 m diameter placed systematically within the area that was colonized after the fire. Trunks were cut 20 cm from the ground and growth rings were counted. We studied the age structure of the population in order to reconstruct the colonizing events after the fire. We found that recruitment occurred throughout this period, except in the three years after the disturbance. We suggest that this delay in recruitment might be caused by low seedling survival under water stress conditions due to low rainfall, combined with scarce vegetation cover after fire. This could have been associated with an initial reduction in propagule pressure due to the scarcity of surviving trees in the vicinity and with the fact that fire occurred after the peak of seed release, during an extremely dry summer, probably killing a great number of seeds that were already in the soil. In the following years, recruitment was probably aided by pioneer trees and later by seeds shed from established pines. Alien trees had been allowed to reach maturity due to wildfire prevention and control in the years preceding the fire and the accumulated dry matter resulted in increased fire intensity that reduced the ability of grasses to re-sprout. As a consequence, the invasion window that allowed the expansion of pines remained open for at least 12 years. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The rapid developments in computer techniques and the availability of large datasets open new perspectives for vegetation analysis aiming at better understanding of the ecology and functioning of ecosystems and underlying mechanisms. Information systems prove to be helpful tools in this new field. Such information systems may integrate different biological levels, viz. species, community and landscape. They incorporate a GIS platform for the visualization of the various layers of information. enabling the analysis of patterns and processes which relate the individual levels. An example of a newly developed information system is SynBioSys Europe, an initiative of the European Vegetation Survey (EVS). For the individual levels of the system, specific sources are available, notably national and regional Turboveg databases for the community level and data from the recently published European Map of Natural Vegetation for the landscape level. The structure of the system and its underlying databases allow user-defined queries. With regard to its application, such information systems may play a vital role in European nature planning, such as the implementation the EU-program Natura 2000. To illustrate the scope and perspectives of the program, some examples from The Netherlands are presented. They are dealing with long-term changes in grassland ecosystems, including shifts in distribution, floristic composition, and ecological indicator values.

AB An analysis of the distribution patterns of 124 Mexican gymnosperm species was undertaken, in order to detect the Mexican areas with high species richness and endemism, and with this information to propose areas for conservation. Our study includes an analysis of species richness, endemism and distributional patterns of Mexican species of gymnosperms based on three different area units (states, biogeographic provinces and grid-cells of 1 degrees x 1 degrees latitude/longitude). The richest areas in species and endemism do not coincide; in this way, the Sierra Madre Oriental province, the state of Veracruz and a grid-cell located in the state of Oaxaca were the areas with the highest number of species, whereas the Golfo de Mexico province, the state of Chiapas and a grid-cell located in this state were the richest areas in endemic species. A weighted endemism and corrected weighted endemism indices were calculated, and those grid-cells with high values in both indices and with high species richness were considered as hotspots; these grid-cells are mainly located in Southern and Central Mexico.

AB Ficus section Galoglychia (subgenus Urostigma; Moraceae) includes 72 species restricted to the African floristic region (a few extending to the Arabian Peninsula and Socotra). We present the first molecular phylogenetic analysis of the section including 56 ingroup (representing 44 species) and three outgroup taxa, to investigate its monophyly, classification and evolution. We used sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers (ITS and ETS). Our results suggest that section Galoglychia is paraphyletic to the neotropical section Americana, although this is not supported by bootstrap analysis and only weakly supported by Bayesian posterior probabilities. Maximum parsimony analysis conflict with maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses with respect to the closest relatives of section Americana in Africa. The subsections of section Galoglychia proposed by Berg [Berg, C.C., 1986. Subdivision of Ficus subg. Urostigma sect. Galoglychia (Moraceae). Proc. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wetensch., Ser. C, 89, 121-127] are generally supported. We find two major clades of section Galoglychia within Africa possibly corresponding to two main centres of diversity. One clade comprises members of subsections Platyphyllae and Chlamydodorae, which are more concentrated in Eastern Africa, and extend to Madagascar and neighbouring archipelagos (Comores, Mascarenes, Aldabra Islands and Seychelles). The other main clade includes members of subsections Caulocarpae, Cyathistipulae, Crassicostae and Galoglychia, which are concentrated in West and Central Africa. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Livestock grazing has long been the most widespread land use on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the world's highest ecosystems. However, there has been increasing concern during recent decades because of the rapid increase in livestock numbers. To assess the possible influences of grazing on the vast grassland, a long-term grazing experiment in a shrub meadow on the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was carried out. The experiment included five treatments with different stocking rates and one non-grazing (N) treatment. After 17 years of grazing, treatment differences were clear. The species composition differed markedly between grazing intensities, with a decrease in palatable grass species and an increase in unpalatable forbs at higher grazing intensities. The species richness and species diversity, however, were not significantly different between treatments. Vegetation height decreased significantly at higher grazing intensities. Total above,ground biomass declined considerably and the biomass of forbs increased significantly under the higher grazing intensities. The amount of litter was significantly lower under the higher grazing intensities. The results suggest that long-term grazing alters the species composition, vegetation height and biomass production of the alpine grassland ecosystem without significantly changing species richness.

AB Assessing the architectural optimality of animal constructions is in most cases extremely difficult, but is feasible for antlion larvae, which dig simple pits in sand to catch ants. Slope angle, conicity and the distance between the head and the trap bottom, known as off-centring, were measured using a precise scanning device. Complete attack sequences in the same pits were then quantified, with predation cost related to the number of behavioural items before capture. Off-centring leads to a loss of architectural efficiency that is compensated by complex attack behaviour. Off-centring happened in half of the cases and corresponded to post-construction movements. In the absence of off-centring, the trap is perfectly conical and the angle is significantly smaller than the crater angle, a physical constant of sand that defines the steepest possible slope. Antlions produce efficient traps, with slopes steep enough to guide preys to their mouths without any attack, and shallow enough to avoid the likelihood of avalanches typical of crater angles. The reasons for the paucity of simplest and most efficient traps such as theses in the animal kingdom are discussed.

AB 1. The coral reefs across the international border between Kenya and Tanzania, Where historical differences in government policy and socio-economic conditions created two different management systems, were examined: a large permanent closed area and a collaborative fisheries management project that used gear management and small voluntarily and temporary closed areas, respectively. The diversity and ecology of the reefs in these two management systems were compared spanning a seven-year period to evaluate the effectiveness of the management and to assess the ecological response to a large-scale water-temperature anomaly in 1998.
   2. Comparisons of rates of predation on sea urchins and of herbivory, using a seagrass assay, were made along with measures of benthic cover and fish abundance and diversity.
   3. The collaborative fisheries management system was successful in increasing fish stocks, reducing erect algae, and maintaining ecological diversity and stability across the thermal anomaly. This management system, however, was not successful in protecting the expected full biodiversity of fish, predation rates on sea urchins, or the sensitive, branching coral species. Management of the fishery also increased fish stocks in the adjacent, large, permanently closed area, compared to Kenyan parks Without this management.
   4. The large, permanently closed area in the other system maintained high diversity, high predation rates on sea urchins and high herbivory rates, which maintained erect algae abundance and diversity at low levels. The temperature anomaly was destructive to a number of the dominant delicate branching coral species, but overall coral cover and diversity were maintained, although dominance switched from branching Porites spp. to Seriatopora spp. over this period. The large closed area system protected the undisturbed ecology of these reefs and associated ecological processes, and the full diversity of fish and coral, including sensitive species such as branching corals and slow-growing fish.
   5. Collaborative fisheries and large permanent closed area management have different attributes that, when combined, should achieve the Multiple purposes of sustainable fisheries, ecosystem functions and protection of fishing-sensitive species. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The whelk Buccinanops globulosum, a very common prosobranch mollusk in northern Patagonian, is the target of a new fishery in San Matias Gulf. Given certain biological characteristics making this species susceptible to overfishing, a study started in 2000 in order to collect data or demography and growth at age of this species, with the aim to design and to implement a provisional management plan.
   Mean density was estimated at 111 individuals m(-2) (S.D. = 16.77). Females outnumbered males in most of the months (P < 0.05) and appeared laying egg capsules from November to January. The smallest female carrying egg capsules was 45.2 mm total conch length (n = 36). Recruitment peak was identified in January 2002 and January-February 2003. Early crawling juveniles had a mean size of 4.2 mm conch length (S.D. = 0.51 n = 60).
   A total of 450 individuals (263 females and 187 males) were examined for growth at age. Significant differences were found in the growth parameters between sexes (maximum likelihood method; chi = 92.34; gl = 3; P < 0.001). Growth of males was lower than growth of females.
   Commercial capture of whelks is done by diving using a bait of fish discarded or open living purple clams. Only adults up 4 cm are retained during the fishing operations in a net bag. During 2000-2004 the annual catch varied from 20 to 9200 kg. Fluctuations in landings have more often reflected market prices rather than changes in the abundance of the resource. If effort for this whelk increases it should be necessary to consider a period of no fishery at all in the reproductive/recruitment period in order to ensure the sustainability of the stock.

AB Bacterial decomposition of Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) guano was followed during 42 days exposure in a rookery in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands, Antarctica. Bacterial abundance, both total counts (TC) determined by epifluorescence microscopy. and colony forming units (CFU) determined on nutrient media, was enhanced by an air temperature of between 7 and 11degreesC, while temperatures above and below this negatively affected abundance. Optimal temperatures for guano decomposition ranged from 3 to 11degreesC. Increasing wind velocity positively influenced photoautotrophic bacteria (TAC: total autotrophic bacteria count); photoautotrophs were enumerated during epifluorescence microscopy by their autofluorescence. Guano dry weight attained the lowest value of 74% of initial dry weight after 20 days in situ exposure. Changes in guano resulted from decomposition of the component fats, proteins, chitin, nitrogen and carbon, as well as of mineral recycling (Ca, P, Mg, and others). All transformations accompanied bacterial growth, with TC and CFU both attaining 10(11) cells g(-1) d wt of guano. Total bacterial biomass (TBB) increased from 594 mug C g(-1) dry weight in fresh guano, to 9101 mug C g(-1) dry weight after 42 days exposure in situ. Mean cell volume (MCV) also increased from 0.236 to 0.343 mum(3). Photoautotrophic bacteria were numerically the smallest TC fraction throughout the incubation, with TAC to TC ratio ranging from 0.01 to 0.22%. Culturable bacteria abundance in guano increased dramatically from 0.28% of TC (in fresh guano) to 26% (3-h day), and 90% (42nd day) of TC. Within the total CFU population, copiotrophic bacteria were ca. two orders of magnitude more abundant than oligotrophic bacteria. Chitinolytic bacteria in guano were detected only late in the incubation; by 42 days, >40% of the initial chitin content remained. This material may comprise a significant fraction of the soil in the penguin rookery. Bacteria Cultivated from the penguin guano displayed high morphophysiological diversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Asynthesis of the impacts of the operation(1884-1986) of a soda ash (Na2CO3) manufacturing facility on Onondaga Lake, NY, its tributaries, and adjoining portions of the river that receives the lake's outflow is presented, based on long. term programs of monitoring, process studies, and mathematical modeling. The lake was used as a source of cooling water and for the disposal of ionic (Cl-, Na+, and Ca2+) waste, related solids and spent cooling water. At peak production the facility discharged similar to1.3 x 10(6) metric tons of ionic waste to the lake annually. The soda ash facility had a profound impact on these ecosystems, by severely altering their structure and function. Portions of the two largest tributaries to the lake have been degraded from solids deposition associated with solution mining for NaCl (process reactant) and precipitation of Ca2+ waste (as CaCO3). The cooling water operation recycled phosphor-us enriched hypolimnetic waters to the epilimnion. Ionic waste impacts on the lake and river included: (1) high salinity (S-3parts per thousand), (2) plunging inflows made dense by high S, that altered fundamental features of the lake's stratification regime and exacerbated the problem of severe dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion, (3) S-based density stratification and severe DO depletion over a 14 km reach of the river downstream of the take, and (4) high levels of CaCO3 precipitation that reduced clarity, increased net sedimentation in pelagic areas, altered the character of near-shore sediments, and reduced alkalinity and pH. These impacts on the take's chemistry and physical properties had profound effects on biological communities, including: (1) altered composition, (2) reduced richness and diversity, (3)limited macrophyte occurrence, (4) enhanced phytoplankton production, and (5) limited effectiveness of zooplankton grazing, thereby preventing intervals of high clarity. Closure of the facility resulted in dramatic improvements in water quality and ecological characteristics of these systems. Further improvement is expected as residual ionic waste loads decrease.

ID RENOVATION
AB Semi-arid rangelands, which have retrogressed beyond a certain threshold and could not rest-recover, can only be restored by mechanical inputs helping the re-establishment of vegetation. Therefore, different over-sown species and mechanical restoration methods (hollows-dyker plough, furrows-ripper/sub-soiler and walking-stick planter) were evaluated for the restoration of bare areas on both a sandy and clayish soil type. Changes in species composition and plant density over time (1987/88-1996/97 growing seasons) were determined. The hollows with a rip action in one cultivation operation remained over a longer period and therefore caught more water for better establishment of grass species, compared with making only hollows where it silted up more easily. Establishment was poorest when only the walking-stick planter was used. Although the well establishment of Eragrostis curvula over the first 3 years, after 10 years only a few plants survived in both clay and sandy soils. Regardless of cultivation treatment or soil form, Digitaria eriantha subsp. eriantha survived the best (p<0.01) after 10 years and even spread into adjacent areas. Anthephora pubescens and Cenchrus ciliaris only established successfully in sandy soil. Restoration in semi-arid rangelands is slow and failures are common because of low and unreliable rainfall.

AB Algal 'gardening' by marine grazers has been described for several species but the possibility that grazers influence their gardens through nutrient enhancement has received less attention. This study examined the hypothesis that nutrient regeneration by the territorial intertidal limpet Patella cochlear enhances the productivity of its algal gardens. Nitrogenous excretions by P, cochlear were quantified by (1) measuring urea and ammonium concentrations under limpet shells at low tide; (2) conducting a laboratory experiment to monitor changes in urea, ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the presence of Limpets; and (3) using an isotope dilution technique in a field experiment to obtain direct estimates of limpet excretion and algal uptake rates. During low-tide exposure, nitrogenous excretions in the form of urea and ammonium (urea: 1.15 mu mol ml(-1); ammonium: 0.07 mu mol ml(-1)) accumulated under P, cochlear shells, in dose contact with the surrounding algal garden. The average quantity of ammonium excreted by a 30 mm limpet was estimated as 458.9 mu g NH4-N d(-1), which is similar to the estimated nitrogen growth requirements of an algal garden (427.8 mu g N-growth garden d(-1)). Algal uptake rates, estimated in an experimental chamber on the basis of N-15 incorporation by the algae, indicated that ammonium excretions by P. cochlear supplied approximately 30% of the algal garden's daily nitrogen growth requirements. Moreover, the algae demonstrated a potential for 'surge' uptake, an adaptation which would enable them to exploit nitrogenous excretions before these are dissipated by water movement in the field. Our findings show that P. cochlear, and potentially other marine gardening species, can enhance the productivity of their algal gardens through the regeneration of Limiting nutrients.

AB 1. Daphnia lumholtzi is a subtropical, Old World species which is rapidly spreading throughout reservoirs in the southern U.S.A. It was first recorded in Lake Texoma (Oklahoma-Texas) in September 1991.
   2. Southern U.S. reservoirs typically have strong spatial and temporal gradients in temperature, conductivity, turbidity and in the distribution of organisms. Therefore, the present experiments examined the reproductive and moulting rates, and survival of D. lumholtzi in relation to extremes of food concentration, temperature, conductivity and turbidity.
   3. Increases in temperature (range 15-29 degrees C) and decreases in turbidity (range = 0.6-470 NTU) increased reproductive and moulting rates, whereas food concentration only affected the rate of reproduction, while conductivity had no effects. Survival was affected only by temperature.
   4. Daphnia lumholtzi tolerates high temperatures (27-30 degrees C) at which other cladocerans in Lake Texoma disappear. Therefore, D. lumholtzi may exploit resources in midsummer, when there are few potential competitors.

AB The relative effects of foraging benefits (food intake) and costs (disturbance = pit destruction) on growth rate and foraging behavior of lan,ae of the ant-lion Myrmeleon mobilis were investigated. In a laboratory experiment second-instar larvae were subjected to combinations of three rates of feeding and three rates of disturbance. Pit relocations were generally rare but occurred more often in starved larvae. Disturbance rate had no significant effect on pit relocation rate. Feeding rate was a major determinant of the energy allocated in pit construction and maintenance (positive relationship), In a second experiment third-instar larvae encountered changing rates of disturbance. Pit size was reduced as a response to increased rates of disturbance, Disturbance had no detectable effect on growth. In general, M. mobilis larvae were cost-conservative foragers.

AB Remarkable large pits were found on the shell surface of many ammonites from the Turonian-Maastrichtian sediments of Hokkaido, northern Japan, and Sakhalin, Russia. These pits are (1) round to elliptical in shape; (2) up to 20 mm (usually around 10 mm) in diameter; (3) shallow depressions to deep holes that almost penetrate the shell; (4) occasionally healed by a thin shell blister from inside the shell; (5) often overlapping one another; (6) several to more than 170 in number on one flank of the ammonites; (7) found on both flanks and predominantly on the body chamber and the final volution of the phragmocone; and (8) found only in the two families Pachydiscidae and Puzosiidae, predominantly of more than 300 mm in shell diameter. They can best be interpreted as the home depressions of patellogastropod limpets. The presence of pits on both flanks of the ammonites and those healed from inside the shell strongly suggest that the limpets were dwelling on mature swimming ammonites. Host specifity, their very small shell size compared with the host ammonites, and sparse occurrence in sediments favor a mode of life as obligate pseudoplankton. We suggest that this remarkable limpet-ammonite association was well established in northwestern Pacific bioprovinces during the late Cretaceous. Taking this live association and the depth limit of algal growth as food for the limpets into consideration, the mature ammonites dwelled or periodically visited the upper layer of the euphotic zone, probably less than around 20 m in depth.

AB Altered fire regimes can drive major and enduring compositional shifts or losses of forest ecosystems. In western North America, ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forest types appear increasingly vulnerable to uncharacteristically extensive, high-severity wildfire. However, unburned or only lightly impacted forest stands that persist within burn mosaics-termed fire refugia-may serve as tree seed sources and promote landscape recovery. We sampled tree regeneration along gradients of fire refugia proximity and density at 686 sites within the perimeters of 12 large wildfires that occurred between 2000 and 2005 in the interior western United States. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to elucidate statistical relationships between tree regeneration and refugia pattern, including a new metric that incorporates patch proximity and proportional abundance. These relationships were then used to develop a spatially explicit landscape simulation model. We found that regeneration by ponderosa pine and obligate-seeding mixed-conifer tree species assemblages was strongly and positively predicted by refugia proximity and density. Simulation models revealed that for any given proportion of the landscape occupied by refugia, small patches produced greater landscape recovery than large patches. These results highlight the disproportionate importance of small, isolated islands of surviving trees, which may not be detectable with coarse-scale satellite imagery. Findings also illustrate the interplay between patch-scale resistance and landscape-scale resilience: Disturbance-resistant settings (fire refugia) can entrain resilience (forest regeneration) across the burn matrix. Implications and applications for land managers and conservation practitioners include strategies for the promotion and maintenance of fire refugia as components of resilient forest landscapes.

AB Urban expansion is an increasing threat to biodiversity, especially in tropical Africa where biodiversity hot spots are being encroached upon by fast-growing cities. Threatened species include bees and other pollinators, which deliver important ecosystem services but are sensitive to land use changes. We investigated the impact of urbanisation and vegetation management practices on pollinator abundance, bee diversity, and bee functional traits. We sampled 126 locations in a stratified random design across an urbanisation gradient in two medium-sized cities in the West African Forests biodiversity hot spot, encompassing three management practices (farmed sites; amenity lands, i.e. green spaces managed for aesthetics; informal green spaces), and tested their effect with generalised linear models. Urbanisation did not affect bee abundances or diversity but had a negative impact on both wasp and beetle abundances. There was also a management-mediated impact of urbanisation on bee abundances, which decreased with urbanisation on farmed sites but not amenity land or informal green spaces. Management practices alone influenced bee abundances with farms harbouring fewer bees, and amenity lands fewer beetles. Bee genera occurrence and dominance patterns were influenced by both urbanisation and management, with some otherwise common genera rare in urban areas. Most functional traits were influenced by management, with fewer polylectic bees, cavity-nesting bees and long-tongued bees in farmed sites. Amenity lands hosted smaller bees and fewer savanna specialists. Some traits were influenced by urbanisation, with more long-tongued bees and cavity-nesting bees found in urban areas. Synthesis and applications. Pollinator responses to urbanisation are complex. In our research, we demonstrate how bee, lepidopteran, and non-fruit fly abundances have been maintained across an urbanisation gradient in tropical Africa, but not wasp and beetle abundances. Moreover, bee community composition and the distribution of traits shifted markedly. How green spaces were managed was also critical. We found that farmed sites hosted the lowest bee abundances and amenity lands the fewest beetles. Retaining informal green spaces and amenity lands in African cities, including protecting nesting sites for stingless bees, and limiting pesticide application would be important for conserving bees and the pollination service they provide to both crops and native vegetation.

AB Theory argues that both soil conditions and aboveground trophic interactions have equivalent potential to limit or promote plant diversity. However, it remains unexplored how they jointly modify the niche differences stabilising species coexistence and the average fitness differences driving competitive dominance. We conducted a field study in Mediterranean annual grasslands to parameterise population models of six competing plant species. Spatially explicit floral visitor assemblages and soil salinity variation were characterised for each species. Both floral visitors and soil salinity modified species population dynamics via direct changes in seed production and indirect changes in competitive responses. Although the magnitude and sign of these changes were species-specific, floral visitors promoted coexistence at neighbourhood scales, while soil salinity did so over larger scales by changing the superior competitors' identity. Our results show how below and aboveground interactions maintain diversity in heterogeneous landscapes through their opposing effects on the determinants of competitive outcomes.

AB Coral reefs harbor diverse assemblages of organisms yet the majority of this diversity is hidden within the three dimensional structure of the reef and neglected using standard visual surveys. This study uses Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) and amplicon sequencing methodologies, targeting mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and 18S rRNA genes, to investigate changes in the cryptic reef biodiversity. ARMS, deployed at 11 sites across a near- to off-shore gradient in the Red Sea were dominated by Porifera (sessile fraction), Arthropoda and Annelida (mobile fractions). The two primer sets detected different taxa lists, but patterns in community composition and structure were similar. While the microhabitat of the ARMS deployment affected the community structure, a clear cross-shelf gradient was observed for all fractions investigated. The partitioning of beta-diversity revealed that replacement (i.e. the substitution of species) made the highest contribution with richness playing a smaller role. Hence, different reef habitats across the shelf are relevant to regional diversity, as they harbor different communities, a result with clear implications for the design of Marine Protected Areas. ARMS can be vital tools to assess biodiversity patterns in the generally neglected but species-rich cryptic benthos, providing invaluable information for the management and conservation of hard-bottomed habitats over local and global scales.

AB Ecology and geomorphology recognize the dynamic aspects of resistance and resilience. However, formal resilience theory in ecology has tended to deemphasize the geomorphic habitat template. Conversely, landscape sensitivity and state-and-transition models in geomorphology downweight mechanisms of biotic adaptation operative in fluctuating, spatially explicit environments. Adding to the interdisciplinary challenge of understanding complex biogeomorphic systems is that environmental heterogeneity and overlapping gradients of disturbance complicate inference of the geographic patterns of resistance and resilience. We develop a conceptual model for comparing the resilience properties among barrier dunes. The model illustrates how adaptive cycles and panarchies, the formal building blocks of resilience recognized in ecology, can be expressed as a set of hierarchically nested geomorphic and ecological metrics. The variance structure of these data is proposed as a means to delineate different kinds and levels of resilience. Specifically, it is the dimensionality of these data and how geomorphic and ecological variables load on the first and succeeding axes that facilitates the delineation of resistance and resilience. The construction of dune topographic state space from observations among different barrier islands is proposed as a way to measure the interdependence of geomorphic and ecological resilience properties.

AB Spatial community reassembly driven by changes in species abundances or habitat occupancy is a well-documented response to anthropogenic global change, but communities can also reassemble temporally if the environment drives differential shifts in the timing of life events across community members. Much like spatial community reassembly, temporal reassembly could be particularly important when critical species interactions are temporally concentrated (e.g., plant-pollinator dynamics during flowering). Previous studies have documented species-specific shifts in phenology driven by climate change, implying that temporal reassembly, a process we term phenological reassembly, is likely. However, few studies have documented changes in the temporal co-occurrence of community members driven by environmental change, likely because few datasets of entire communities exist. We addressed this gap by quantifying the relationship between flowering phenology and climate for 48 co-occurring subalpine wildflower species at Mount Rainier (Washington, USA) in a large network of plots distributed across Mt. Rainier's steep environmental gradients; large spatio-temporal variability in climate over the 6 yr of our study (including the earliest and latest snowmelt year on record) provided robust estimates of climate-phenology relationships for individual species. We used these relationships to examine changes to community co-flowering composition driven by climate change analog' conditions experienced at our sites in 2015. We found that both the timing and duration of flowering of focal species was strongly sensitive to multiple climatic factors (snowmelt, temperature, and soil moisture). Some consistent responses emerged, including earlier snowmelt and warmer growing seasons driving flowering phenology earlier for all focal species. However, variation among species in their phenological sensitivities to these climate drivers was large enough that phenological reassembly occurred in the climate change analog conditions of 2015. An unexpected driver of phenological reassembly was fine-scale variation in the direction and magnitude of climatic change, causing phenological reassembly to be most apparent early and late in the season and in topographic locations where snow duration was shortest (i.e., at low elevations and on ridges in the landscape). Because phenological reassembly may have implications for many types of ecological interactions, failing to monitor community-level repercussions of species-specific phenological shifts could underestimate climate change impacts.

AB The reasons why people adopt unsustainable agricultural practices, and the ultimate environmental implications of those practices, remain incompletely understood in the present world. Archaeology, however, offers unique datasets on coincident cultural and ecological change, and their social and environmental effects. This article applies concepts derived from ecological resilience thinking to assess the sustainability of agricultural practices as a result of long-term interactions between political, economic, and environmental systems. Using the urban center of Gordion, in central Turkey, as a case study, it is possible to identify mismatched social and ecological processes on temporal, spatial, and organizational scales, which help to resolve thresholds of resilience. Results of this analysis implicate temporal and spatial mismatches as a cause for local environmental degradation, and increasing extralocal economic pressures as an ultimate cause for the adoption of unsustainable land-use practices. This analysis suggests that a research approach that integrates environmental archaeology with a resilience perspective has considerable potential for explicating regional patterns of agricultural change and environmental degradation in the past.

AB Tropical and subtropical high mountains forests are mainly situated within ravines. Two alternative and often confronted explanations have been proposed for this pattern: that abiotic environmental conditions are favourable for tree establishment only within ravines, or that ravines are less affected by grazing and fires which negatively affect establishment in other sites. Here we propose a mixed explanation and hypothesize that abiotic environmental conditions associated to spatial variation are important during early seedling establishment and that grazing is the main determinant during later stages through its negative effect on survival and growth of larger saplings. We sowed 302,400 seeds and planted 360 saplings of the dominant tree species from the upper Cordoba Mountain range (Central Argentina) with and without grazing in three contrasting sites: a ravine, a valley and a ridge. We monitored seeding plots 5 years until the seedlings reached the height of the planted saplings and we monitored the planted saplings for 12 years. We integrated life stages using matrix multiplications, which resulted in data simulating 17 years of the trees' early development. Our results showed that seedling establishment was lower in the ravine and ridge sites and higher in the valley site with negative differences due to grazing only in the valley. Planted sapling survival increased but growth decreased from ravine to valley and ridge sites in the absence of large herbivores, while both survival and growth were substantially lower in the presence of large herbivores. Matrix multiplications indicated that differences between sites were 5.0 times more important than grazing when integrating up to year 5, but grazing by large herbivores was 5.4 times more important than differences between sites when assessed across the whole 17 year period. We conclude that there could be a strong influence of grazing in restricting high montane forests to sites like ravines where large herbivores are less frequent and show how the relative importance of site characteristics and grazing changes as a result of the length and the differing life stages which are monitored.

AB Decomposed granite roadcuts are difficult to revegetate after losing the topsoil and vegetation cover. We developed a new drilling machine, Digger, to efficiently drill six holes simultaneously on decomposed granite roadcuts to facilitate revegetation. The Digger consists of a base machine (0.7m(3)-level excavator) and a mounting body with six hydraulic motors instead of a bucket. We tested its performance on two roadcuts in southwest Korea using time-motion studies, which showed that the Digger can drill 240m(2) of decomposed granite roadcuts daily. The unit cost of the Digger was less than a half of other roadcut stabilization and revegetation techniques in Korea, making the Digger a cost-effective revegetation technology. Field germination and growth tests were also conducted to identify appropriate diameter and depth of drilling holes, suitable revegetation species, and mulching treatment. We drilled holes with three different diameters and depths, filled the holes with a mixture of plant seeds and cultivated soil, applied mulching treatments (coir geotextile, shade net, and no mulching), and measured the germination and growth results at two field plots after 1month and 1year. The results showed that drilling diameter 10cm and depth 10cm were large enough to result in better plant germination and growth. Erosion control species, Poa pratensis L. and Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees, survived and grew better than native woody species. Coir geotextile improved the plant germination and growth. The time-motion and revegetation results show that the Digger can be a promising technology to restore decomposed granite roadcuts. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Question What is the effect of invading individuals of the widely invasive species Pinus radiata D. Don on regeneration of native woody species in a semi-arid ecosystem? Location A semi-arid ecosystem in central Chile. Methods We sampled natural regeneration of native woody species in 40 plots in each of three canopy types: (1) under young adult invading trees of P.radiata located in formerly open (disturbed) sites; (2) in patches of native trees; and (3) in open (disturbed) sites, in two localities where this exotic tree is invading. Additionally, we carried out a field experiment in one of these localities; in eight of each of these canopy types we sowed seeds of ten widely distributed woody native species and monitored their recruitment. We also assessed different biotic and abiotic variables in these canopy types. Results We found that soil water content, depth and cover of leaf litter were higher and photosythetically active radiation was lower under P.radiata trees and native patches than in open sites. In the natural regeneration study, species richness of seedlings was higher in native patches and under P.radiata trees than in open sites, and total abundance of seedlings (including all species) was higher only in native patches than in open sites. In the field experiment, both species richness and total abundance of seedlings were higher in native patches and under P.radiata trees than in open sites. Moreover, in the field experiment species richness recruiting in native patches was higher than under P.radiata trees. Conclusions We suggest that native patches as well as P.radiata trees invading open sites facilitate or have the potential to facilitate regeneration of native species, although facilitation produced by native trees was stronger than that produced by P.radiata. Thus, in sites where nurse plants are not available, invasion by this exotic tree may be exploited in restoration processes through sowing or planting native species under the canopy of invading young trees of P.radiata, eliminating P.radiata individuals after native regeneration has established.

AB Synthesis Impending climate changes beg the question: which populations and species will go extinct and which will persist under future environmental conditions? When tolerance in situ is not possible, then species must undergo range shifts to avoid extinction. This synthesis explores ways in which directional air and water flow could impede such redistribution and the characteristics that might allow species to disperse against the flow. Considering flow patterns in tandem with climate and range projections has the potential to improve predictions of persistence for the earths many non-moving foundation and basal species as well as the communities and food webs that they support. Predicting which populations and species will persist (i.e. avoid extinction and continue to exist) in the face of climate change requires an understanding of mechanisms that allow species to cope with altered environmental conditions. When processes of tolerance, acclimation, and adaptation are insufficient to allow persistence in situ, redistribution is required for population or species persistence. Here, I review evidence that directional flows of water and air have the potential to restrict species range boundaries under ambient conditions, the spread of introduced species, and the redistribution of native species under changing climatic conditions. I develop the hypothesis that flow patterns, such as the speed and directionality (i.e. poleward vs equatorward) of asymmetric air and water currents, may need to be considered when assessing the vulnerability of populations and species to climate change. To the degree that directional flows are found to limit redistribution, there may be disproportionate losses of diversity where the dominant flow direction opposes that of shifting climate space. Within this context, I highlight flow conditions and life-history traits that could help the most passively-dispersed species redistribute to track changing climate. These predictions merit further examination in order to better anticipate which populations, species, and associated communities are likely to persist under climate change.

AB A coupled particle-tracking/ocean circulation model of an idealized eastern boundary upwelling current is used to explore the mesoscale pathways of larval transport. We find that simulated larvae are often organized into filaments found between mesoscale eddies that correspond to attracting Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). Such structures are material curves that map filamentation and transport boundaries, often corresponding to the locations of sea-surface temperature fronts. Filamentation and eddy-eddy interactions aggregate larvae from many source regions and release times into small, highly dense packets that can be transported back to the shelf. Larval densities in these packets can be up to 2 orders of magnitude greater than initial release densities near the coast and are robust to strong levels of random 'swimming' perturbations. This study suggests that coherent flow structures play an important role in pelagic transport of marine larvae.

AB Background: Over the past century, the size and complexity of the air travel network has increased dramatically. Nowadays, there are 29.6 million scheduled flights per year and around 2.7 billion passengers are transported annually. The rapid expansion of the network increasingly connects regions of endemic vector-borne disease with the rest of the world, resulting in challenges to health systems worldwide in terms of vector-borne pathogen importation and disease vector invasion events. Here we describe the development of a user-friendly Web-based GIS tool: the Vector-Borne Disease Airline Importation Risk Tool (VBD-AIR), to help better define the roles of airports and airlines in the transmission and spread of vector-borne diseases.
   Methods: Spatial datasets on modeled global disease and vector distributions, as well as climatic and air network traffic data were assembled. These were combined to derive relative risk metrics via air travel for imported infections, imported vectors and onward transmission, and incorporated into a three-tier server architecture in a Model-View-Controller framework with distributed GIS components. A user-friendly web-portal was built that enables dynamic querying of the spatial databases to provide relevant information.
   Results: The VBD-AIR tool constructed enables the user to explore the interrelationships among modeled global distributions of vector-borne infectious diseases (malaria. dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya) and international air service routes to quantify seasonally changing risks of vector and vector-borne disease importation and spread by air travel, forming an evidence base to help plan mitigation strategies. The VBD-AIR tool is available at www.vbd-air.com.
   Conclusions: VBD-AIR supports a data flow that generates analytical results from disparate but complementary datasets into an organized cartographical presentation on a web map for the assessment of vector-borne disease movements on the air travel network. The framework built provides a flexible and robust informatics infrastructure by separating the modules of functionality through an ontological model for vector-borne disease. The VBD-AIR tool is designed as an evidence base for visualizing the risks of vector-borne disease by air travel for a wide range of users, including planners and decisions makers based in state and local government, and in particular, those at international and domestic airports tasked with planning for health risks and allocating limited resources.

AB We examined how the occurrence and structure of grasses and woody plants changed after 12 yr of a fire season manipulation and removal of livestock herbivores. Applying high intensity fires in the summer preserved the structural integrity of this semiarid live oak (Quercus virginiana Mill.) savanna while decreasing or eliminating numerous problematic plants in the understory and overstory, such as prickly pear cactus (Opuntia spp.), sacahuista (Nolina texana S. Watson), Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei J. Buchholz), Pinchot's juniper (J. pinchotii Sudw.), and honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.). In the less intense repeat winter burning treatments, undesirable woody plants were generally maintained at pretreatment levels in the overstory but all woody plants except Ashe juniper increased in the understory. Alternatively, areas excluded from fire in the control treatment rapidly transitioned from a grass-tree codominated savanna environment to one that is heavily dominated by woody plants. In the grass community, the most frequently occurring grass species in the winter burn treatment differed from summer burn and control treatments, whereas the summer burn treatment was not different from the control. Of the herbaceous plants, only little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium [Michx.] Nash) responded to fire treatments. Little bluestem increased in the winter burn treatment, remained fairly constant in the summer burn treatment, and decreased in the control. Other grasses varied largely as a function of annual weather variability, the removal of livestock, and legacy effects resulting from pre-existing variability. These findings suggest that fire can reduce or eliminate woody plant species that threaten the stability of live oak savannas while having little long-term effect on grasses desired by rangeland managers.

AB Climate change is likely to result in significant alterations in the atmospheric and oceanic circulation, which may, as a result, affect species that depend on an ocean-driven nutrient supply and particularly those that possess a dispersal phase in their life history. In this paper we investigate the potential changes in larval dispersal and connectivity of marine populations on the Chilean coast due to altered wind forcing consistent with a future climate change scenario. Numerical ocean simulations forced by modeled present-day and future winds under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario are used to investigate the potential changes in nearshore circulation. Off-line particle-tracking simulations are then analyzed to determine resulting changes in larval dispersal and connectivity under each scenario as a function of pelagic larval duration and for two different possible larval behaviors: passive and vertical migration. It is found that the projected future winds drive an intensification of the upwelling circulation, which results in a relative annual mean surface cooling of 1 degrees C over much of the domain, an increase in the strength of the poleward undercurrent, and a more energetic mesoscale eddy field. Neutrally buoyant larvae are inferred to have low rates of settlement under present conditions and are more strongly disadvantaged under the simulated future conditions than larvae with vertically migrating behavior. Larvae that posses an ability to sink out of the surface Ekman layer are found to have higher rates of settlement under present conditions and are, in fact, favored slightly in the A2 scenario for pelagic larval durations longer than 2 days. This behavior-dependent response to future conditions may potentially drive a reorganization of coastal communities.

AB In West and Central Africa large carnivores have become increasingly rare as a consequence of rapid habitat destruction and lack of resources for protected area management. The Benoue Complex (23,394 km(2)) in northern Cameroon is a regionally critical area for large mammal conservation. In the complex lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are formally protected in three national parks and 28 hunting zones. Over-hunting may be having a strong additive effect precipitating declines in large carnivore numbers across the complex. We used a coarse level track index method to estimate the relative abundance of these three species both in hunting zones and national parks. The results were interpreted with respect to ungulate abundance, and hunting impact. There was no significant difference between the densities of medium to larger species of ungulates in the hunting zones and the national parks, and no difference in leopard and spotted hyena densities in the respective areas. However, lions occurred at significantly lower densities in the hunting zones, and even in the national parks occurred at significantly lower densities than prey biomass would predict.

AB In consumer assemblages, the organization of individual foraging behavior, as well as spatial distribution, can largely determine environmental risks, and the intensity of intra-and interspecific interactions. We characterized distributional and behavioral patterns of the most common benthic grazers coexisting in the rocky shores of central Chile: the chiton Chiton granosus, the pulmonate limpet Siphonaria lessoni, the scurrinid limpet Scurria araucana and the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa. C. granosus and F. crassa were strictly nocturnal foragers whereas S. lessoni foraged during daytime. Most S. araucana individuals foraged at night, but daytime foraging was also common. The spatial distribution at resting varied from aggregated for C. granosus and S. lessoni to a more dispersive pattern for F. crassa and S. araucana. C. granosus dispersed slightly from aggregation when foraging whereas S. lessoni foraged in tight conspecific aggregations. Foraging excursions varied from over 60 cm in F. crassa to less than 7 cm in S. araucana. Homing behavior ranged from extreme fidelity in F. crassa to low fidelity in S. lessoni. Positive associations were observed between C. granosus and F. crassa during resting and foraging whereas negative associations were observed between these species and S. lessoni. These general patterns varied little between 2 sites separated by a few kilometers. Interspecific competition might be important in structuring this guild, but it may affect only some species pairs. Direct interference in the use of shelter or while foraging, rather than food exploitation, seems the most likely mechanism. The marked differences in individual behavior among species, despite ample diet overlap, might translate into different functional effects, which should be explored in future experiments.

AB Near-surface particle dispersion, larval dispersal and connectivity along the U.S west coast were explored using a realistic numerical model of the California Current System. Seasonal model velocities were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated using Global Drifter Program data. The model displayed a clear seasonal cycle of eddy energy near the coast with energy maxima southwest of major headlands. Eddy speeds were correlated with drifter-based estimates during summer and fall when compared spatially. Over six million passive, Lagrangian particles were released in the upper 20 m of the water column within 10 km of the California and Oregon coasts and tracked for 7 years. The effect of subgridscale vertical turbulence was parameterized with a random walk model. Resulting trajectories yielded climatological maps of particle dispersion. Particle densities varied with release region, release season and time-since-release. Dispersal distances and coastal connectivity varied with season of release, release location, release depth and pelagic larval duration (PLO). Connectivity was clearly influenced by major geographic features such as the Gulf of the Farallones and Cape Mendocino. Given a moderate (30-60 day) PLD, mean dispersal distances varied from similar to 10-230 km, with standard deviations of similar to 130-220 km. For release locations from Palos Verdes to Point Sur, the primary direction of dispersal was northward for a moderate PLD, regardless of season. For long PLDs (120-180 day), mean dispersal distances were larger (similar to 40-440 km), with standard deviations of similar to 330-540 km. In winter given a long PLD, dispersal was primarily southward for release locations north of Point Arena. Increasing release depths to 40-60 m altered mean dispersal distances by 50-250 km polewards, but had little effect on standard deviations. Point Conception did not act as a barrier to dispersal for source regions in the Southern California Bight.

AB Dietary investigations of sympatric felids are means for understanding how closely related species deal with food resources in a potentially competitive scenario. The diets of the oncilla Leopardus tigrinus, the jaguarundi Puma yagouaroundi and the ocelot Leopardus pardalis were studied through the analysis of scats in Araucaria Pine Forest with Natural Grasslands of southern Brazil. Small mammals comprised the bulk of the diets of the three felids, followed by birds and reptiles. The smallest food-niche overlap index was 0.84, indicating that these felids shared an important portion of their food resources. Inter-species differences were detected in the consumption of the most frequent rodent prey; L tigrinus was the only species that consumed all the most frequent rodent prey differently from the rate expected from their abundances. Although these findings suggest competitive interactions, with the oncilla being the most subordinate species, further experimental investigations are necessary to elucidate more precisely how these syntopic felids coexist. The effects of sample size and its influences on the evaluation of the diets of the felids, especially of the ocelot, are discussed. We compare our data to a previous study in the same area, to account for the possible influences of biased sampling and uneven distribution of food resources on the diet of the ocelot. The opportunistic feeding behavior and the abundance of their primary prey (cricetid rodents) seem to allow these small cats to be resilient despite severe anthropogenic disturbance in the study area. We further suggest guidelines for future studies in the study region, in order to understand the dynamics of mammalian carnivores demography. (C) 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

AB To characterize the composition of the intestinal bacterial flora in cage-cultured adult small abalone, Haliotis diversicolor, we used both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. In addition, in order to investigate the presence of probable pathogens, the intestinal bacterial community structures of healthy and diseased adult abalones were compared using the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting technique. Bacteria isolated from the healthy abalone intestine belonged to the genera Vibrio, Flammeovirga, Shewanella, Persicobacter and Paraferrimonas. From the 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis, the intestinal bacterial community comprised two groups: the Proteobacteria and Tenericutes. Betaproteobacteria (18.48%), Deltaproteobacteria (30.43%) and Mollicutes (35.87%) were the most dominant components in the clones and the Mollicutes were mainly Mycoplasma-affiliated clones. The DGGE band pattern demonstrated that more bands appeared in the healthy abalones (H group) than in the diseased abalones (D group). Although few potential pathogens were detected from the D group, a clustering dendrogram indicated that individuals of the H and D groups (except for D6) formed two separate clusters. An unidentified Deltaproteobacteria species and Mycoplasma sp. were the dominant components in the intestine of both the H and the D group.

AB Native species arise as an alternative to improve the poor success of traditional hydroseeding with commercial species in degraded areas. The objectives of this study were to (1) establish a procedure to select suitable native species for roadslope revegetation, (2) validate the procedure by means of field sowing experiments, and (3) assess cost effectiveness of the use of native species in hydroseeding as regards commercial ones. Vegetation surveys were performed in semiarid roadslopes of East Spain and species success evaluated according to abundance and frequency. A list of potentially suitable species for revegetation was produced and a subset of species selected and hydroseeded to check their suitability in hydroseeding. Cost effectiveness of the use of native species was estimated. Results support the suitability of the procedure for the selection of native species. Vegetation cover produced by the hydroseeded mixture of native species was high (between 43 and 70% throughout the 4 years) and was 4-20 times higher than the cover produced by a standard commercial seed mixture. The price of the selected seed mixture was 30 times that of the commercial one, but the cost of relevant ecological advantages provided by the use of native species was only twice that of the commercial species on the basis of cost effectiveness assessment. Practical consequences for restorers, policymakers, and practitioners are discussed, and the use of native species is encouraged to improve revegetation success of roadslopes and similar slope types especially in semiarid and arid environments.

AB Seabirds concentrate nutrients from large marine areas on their nesting islands. The high nutrient load may cause runoff into surrounding waters and affect marine communities in similar ways to those reported from marine fertilization experiments. In order to test if cormorant colonies affect algae and invertebrates in surrounding coastal waters, we collected Fucus vesiculosus fronds, its epiphytic algae, and associated invertebrate fauna near abandoned and active cormorant nesting islands as well as reference islands without nesting cormorants in the Stockholm archipelago in the northern Baltic Sea, Sweden. First, we showed, with delta N-15 analyses, that ornithogenic nitrogen provided a significant nitrogen source for algae and invertebrate consumers near islands with high nest density. Second, the nitrogen and phosphorus content of algae near active cormorant islands with high nest density was elevated, and epiphytic algae increased relative to F. vesiculosus. Third, 3 of 5 invertebrate taxa (Jaera albifrons, Gammarus spp., and Chironomidae) showed increased biomasses near islands with high nest density; but, contrary to former fertilization studies, only J. albifrons increased in abundance compared to reference islands. We conclude that runoff from seabird colonies has a profound effect on primary producers and some consumers in the surrounding water, but only if the colonies exceed a certain nest density. Thus, seabirds not only affect marine communities via top-town forces as commonly assumed, but also via bottom-up forces by concentrating nutrients around their nesting islands. Consequently, seabird islands can be seen as natural fertilization experiments and give important insights to the effects of eutrophication of marine systems.

AB P>1. Despite a long history of research on the influence of fruit availability on the population density of large-bodied vertebrate frugivores, operational understanding of the factors regulating density in these taxa remains elusive. We propose that fruit resources can be distinguished from one another on the basis of their functional role for the animals in question, and that such a classification system can aid in identifying the most influential determinants of frugivore density.
   2. We compared the availability of several resource classes between two sites in Kibale National Park, Uganda separated by only 12 km yet differing threefold in density of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).
   3. We categorized plant species used for fruit by chimpanzees according to their availability relative to habitat-wide fruit productivity, and by their tendency towards inter-individual fruiting synchrony. We predicted that the site of high chimpanzee density would support a higher density of food plant species tending to produce crops during periods of high habitat-wide productivity [high fruit abundance (HFA foods)] and of those tending to fruit synchronously among individuals during times of low habitat-wide availability (sLFA foods). The first food class should provide chimpanzees with a high nutrient density (and thus promote population growth), whereas the second should provide stable subsistence during lean periods and thus a temporally consistent resource base.
   4. Counter to our prediction, only sLFA resources were more abundant at the site of high chimpanzee density than at the site of low density. We suggest that sLFA resources are most important in influencing density of large-bodied frugivores.

AB Mulga (Acacia aneura Mimosaceae) and spinifex (Triodia spp. Poaceae) habitats together characterize a large part of and central Australia. Often very abrupt boundaries form between these two habitats, giving rise to a mosaic pattern of contrasting shrub-grass alterations across the landscape. Reasons for such patterning remain poorly understood though current niche-based views relate species' distributions to spatial resource gradients or to fire effects. Field survey work was conducted on central Australian mountain ranges to further quantify floristic, regeneration traits, and structural patterning across mulga-spinifex transitions and to test resource- and disturbance-models that explain these patterns. Compositional analysis demonstrated variability in transition type - in certain cases boundaries denoted true floristic discontinuity and in others, somewhat more of a structural shift. Moreover, it was shown that minimal between-habitat floristic overlap coincided with the occurrence of distinct edaphic changes, while greater compositional commonality occurred when soil gradients were more diffuse. This indicated that floristic patterning cannot be ascribed to any one single process. In the case of strong soil gradients, between-habitat segregation most likely resulted from resource-based niche differentiation; for weaker gradients, fire-frequency assumed greatest importance. Disturbance theory most readily accounted for the distribution of woody species' post-fire regeneration traits across habitat boundaries. The results also suggested that biotic factors - viz competition, facilitation and animal-mediated dispersal - may be of additional consequence for mulga-spinifex coexistence. Overall, the study served to emphasize the importance of multi-factor explanation for within- and between-habitat patterning in these mosaics. It also highlighted the need for experimentation to facilitate distinction between cause and correlation.

AB Beverton-Holt equation of Ecology has a prescribed solution. The way used to achieve the tracking objective is the design of a carrying capacity through a feedback law so that the prescribed reference sequence, which defines the suitable behavior, is achieved. The advantage that the inverse of the Beverton-Holt equation is a linear time-varying discrete dynamic system whose external input is the inverse of the environment carrying capacity is taken in mind. In the case when the intrinsic growth rate is not perfectly known, an adaptive law implying parametrical estimation is incorporated to the scheme so that the tracking property of the reference sequence becomes an asymptotic objective in the absence of additive disturbances. The main advantage of the proposal is that the population evolution might behave as a prescribed one either for all time or asymptotically, which defines the desired population evolution. The technique might be of interest in some industrial exploitation problems like, for instance, in aquaculture management. Copyright (C) 2008 M. De La Sen and S. Alonso-Quesada.

AB Growth of Siphonaria lessoni (Blainville) was studied at two rocky intertidal sites near Quequen (38-degrees-35' S, 58-degrees-42' W), Argentina. One of them was severely affected by sewage pollution and the other was located in a natural area without visible signs of organic enrichment. Results obtained through periodical sampling, recapture of marked specimens and controlled reciprocal translocations between both areas demonstrated increased growth (9.7 mm after one year) and low densities in the vicinity of the outfall. This area is characterized by an abundance of cyanophytes, diatoms and opportunist, ephemeral green algae, and also by the total absence of the mytilid Brachidontes rodriguezi (d'Orbigny). On the other hand, in unpolluted areas monopolized by B. rodriguezi at mid-intertidal levels, densities were high and growth was slower (6.2 mm after two years). Growth was also increased in specimens experimentally transported or swept by waves from the mussel community to tide-pools dominated by the green alga Ulva lactuca L. Growth in the natural environment or in enriched areas was remarkably lower than values reported in a previous study on floating substrata within Mar del Plata (38-degrees-03' S, 57-degrees-33' W) harbour (19.5 mm after one year). A positive correlation between growth and mortality rates was observed. Due to considerable habitat-induced variations in growth rate, estimation of age as a function of size in this species may be unreliable without taking into account the surrounding environment. Results obtained in the present study emphasize the influence of primary production and of the presence of other sessile organisms on the population dynamics of S. lessoni.

AB 1. Pollination niches are important components of ecological niches and have played a major role in the diversification of Angiosperms. In this study, we focused on Euro-Mediterranean orchids, which use diverse pollination strategies and interact with various functional groups of insects. In these orchids, we investigated the determinants of pollination niche breadth and overlap by analysing the orchid-pollinator network and the factors that may have shaped it.
   2. We constructed a database reporting 1,278 interactions between 243 orchid and 773 pollinator species based on a thorough literature review. We then focused on 153 orchid species for which phylogenetic data were available. We used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to study the relationship between specialisation (as estimated by the degree and degree in the projected network), pollination strategy and breadths of orchids' spatial and temporal distributions, while correcting for the effect of phylogenetic relationships among orchid species and sampling effort. We then used a singular value decomposition of the orchid-pollinator matrix combined to a redundancy and variation partitioning analyses to investigate the determinants of similarity in pollination niches between orchids.
   3. Specialisation was higher in deceptive than in nectar-producing orchids and decreased with the breadth of orchids' spatial distribution. When interactions were considered at the insect family level, similarity in pollination niches between orchids was solely explained by their pollination strategy and phylogeny. By contrast, when they were considered at the insect species level, this similarity was primarily explained by their geographical range and flowering time, although other factors had significant effects as well, with orchids using the same pollination strategy, being closely related and growing in the same habitats sharing more insect species than expected.
   4. Synthesis. Specialisation in orchid-pollinator interactions depends on orchids' pollination strategy and geographical range. The pool of insect families with which orchids interact depends on their pollination strategy and phylogeny, with consistent associations between some functional or phylogenetic groups of orchids and some families of pollinators. By contrast, the pool of insect species with which orchids interact depends on their spatio-temporal distribution, suggesting that at a finer scale, orchid-pollinator interactions are more opportunistic than previously thought.

AB Very little is known about how variation in environmental conditions alters the strength and the structure of competitive networks and what are the consequences of this for species coexistence. We performed a competition experiment with 10 annual plant species to parameterise a population model describing species' dynamics according to their vital rates and pairwise competitive coefficients. Seeds from all species were sown under two different climatic scenarios: (1) right before the first major storm of the growing season and (2) after an imposed fall drought of 2months simulating an extreme climatic event of intense aridity. Species' demography and competitive responses were used to estimate pairwise stabilising niche differences and average fitness differences. In addition, we used tools from network theory to characterise the structure of multispecies competition from the determinants of species coexistence. Specifically, we evaluated changes in competitive dominance between species pairs, and the prevalence of intransitive competitive relationships for 120 triplets between these two climatic events. The experimental extreme event significantly reduced fitness differences between species pairs. Such an equalising mechanism promotes coexistence. However, niche differences were also reduced in such a way that the number of species pairs whose niche differences overcame their fitness differences was reduced from six to two. Contrary to our expectations, the extreme event did not increase the hierarchy of competitive dominance. Instead, and depending on the technique used, the prevalence of intransitivity remained marginally similar (17% to 22%) or significantly increased from 19.4% to 29.8%. This pattern was likely a consequence of the significant changes in competitive dominance between species pairs (26 changes out of 45; 58%). Although fitness differences were equalised and intransitive competition promoted, our model predicted a lower likelihood of coexistence under the extreme event for both species pairs and triplets, mainly because competitive interactions did not promote enough niche differences to balance the observed fitness asymmetries in our competitive networks.Synthesis. We empirically proved that an extreme climate results in communities with reduced niche and fitness differences in which species are less likely to coexist despite the increasing prevalence of intransitive competition.

AB Remote sensing applications in biodiversity research often rely on the establishment of relationships between spectral information from the image and tree species diversity measured in the field. Most studies have used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate tree species diversity on the basis that it is sensitive to primary productivity which defines spatial variation in plant diversity. The NDVI signal is influenced by photosynthetically active vegetation which, in the savannah, includes woody canopy foliage and grasses. The question is whether the relationship between NDVI and tree species diversity in the savanna depends on the woody cover percentage. This study explored the relationship between woody canopy cover (WCC) and tree species diversity in the savannah woodland of southern Africa and also investigated whether there is a significant interaction between seasonal NDVI and WCC in the factorial model when estimating tree species diversity. To fulfil our aim, we followed stratified random sampling approach and surveyed tree species in 68 plots of 90 m x 90 m across the study area. Within each plot, all trees with diameter at breast height of > 10 cm were sampled and Shannon index a common measure of species diversity which considers both species richness and abundance was used to quantify tree species diversity. We then extracted WCC in each plot from existing fractional woody cover product produced from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Factorial regression model was used to determine the interaction effect between NDVI and WCC when estimating tree species diversity. Results from regression analysis showed that (i) WCC has a highly significant relationship with tree species diversity (r(2) = 0.21; p < 0.01), (ii) the interaction between the NDVI and WCC is not significant, however, the factorial model significantly reduced the error of prediction (RMSE = 0.47, p < 0.05) compared to NDVI (RMSE = 0.49) or WCC (RMSE = 0.49) model during the senescence period. The result justifies our assertion that combining NDVI with WCC will be optimal for biodiversity estimation during the senescence period.

AB An animal's diet is an important attribute of its niche, and affects the role that it plays in the ecosystem. Comparing the diets of sympatric species reveals the level of dietary niche overlap between them, which can be used to gauge the potential for competition, as well as each species' vulnerability to competitive exclusion. Because of a morphology adapted to predation, sympatric carnivores can have particularly aggressive and dangerous competitive interactions; the intensity of which may be directly related to the amount of overlap in prey species consumed. Using predator scat analysis and prey survey techniques, we analyze and compare the underlying mechanisms of prey selection - prey body size and group size between sympatric populations of leopard Panthera pardus and lion Panthera leo, to test for possible means of competitive avoidance between them. Because leopard and lion differ in both size and social structure, we controlled for the differing prey handling ability of each species, and found that there was still a significant difference in mean prey body size preference between the two carnivores (P = 0.050), despite a relatively high level of dietary niche overlap (0.717). Both species avoid prey in larger groups, but the tendency is more pronounced for leopards. Where intraguild competitors overlap spatiotemporally, dietary niche segregation such as this may be a mechanism through which competition is avoided and, in the case of carnivores, could reduce the frequency of potentially costly interactions.

AB During the period 1980-2000, the yellow-legged gull population underwent exponential growth due to an increase in the availability of anthropogenic food resources. The aim of this study was to highlight the effect of the gull colonies on the P soil cycle and the associated effects on coastal ecosystems. Samples of soil, water and faecal material were collected in a colony of yellow-legged gulls (Cies Islands) and in a control area. Four sampling plots were installed in the study areas, and samples were collected in summer and winter in 1997 and 2011. Sample analysis included soil characterization and determination of the total P content (TP), bioavailable-P and fractionated-P forms in the soils and faecal material. The P-31 NMR technique was also used to determine organic P forms. Clear differences between the gull colony soils and the control soil were observed. The TP was 3 times higher in the gull colony soil, and the bioavailable P was 30 times higher than in the control soil. The P forms present at highest concentrations in the faecal material (P-apatite, P-residual and P-humic acid) were also present at high concentrations in the colony soil. The absence of any seasonal or annual differences in P concentration indicates that the P has remained stable in the soil over time, regardless of the changes in the gull population density. The degree of P saturation indicated that soils are saturated with P due to the low concentration of Fe/Al-hydroxides, which is consistent with a high P concentration in the run-off from the colonies. The P output from the colony soils to coastal waters may cause eutrophication of a nearby lagoon and the disappearance of a Zostera marina seagrass meadow. Similarly, the enrichment of P concentration in dune system of Muxieiro may induce irreversible changes in the plant communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well recognized that seabirds, particularly those nesting in coastal colonies, can provide significant nutrient enrichment to Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known about the fate of bird-derived nutrients that return to the marine environment and potentially concentrate below the colonies. To attempt to assess the influence of this potential nutrient enrichment of the coastal benthic community, samples of macroalgae, sea urchins (mainly algivores), and hermit crabs (scavengers) were collected at two Arctic localities (Spitsbergen), (1) below a mixed colony of guillemots and kittiwakes, and (2) in an adjacent geomorphologically similar location not influenced by the seabird colony. A much higher nitrogen stable isotope ratio (delta N-15) and total nitrogen content were found in terrestrial plants sampled below the colony than away from it. In benthic macroalgae, however, there were no delta N-15 differences. This might result from the timing of an intensive growth period in macroalgae in late winter/early spring, when there is little or no runoff from the land, and/or ornithogenic nutrients being directly incorporated by phytoplankton. Sea urchins showed higher delta N-15 and total N in the control site comparing to the colony-influenced area, suggesting differential food sources in their diet and a role of scavenging/carnivory on higher trophic levels there. Opportunistically feeding hermit crabs showed delta N-15 and total N enrichment below the seabird colony, suggesting dependence on detritus derived from food chains originating from pelagic producers. Our results indicate that seabirds in the Arctic may fertilize coastal benthic communities through pelagic-benthic coupling, while having no direct impact on bottom primary production.

AB Protected areas (PAs) are recognized as the flagship tool to offset biodiversity loss on Earth. Spatial conservation planning seeks optimal designs of PAs that meet multiple targets such as biodiversity representation and population persistence. Since connectivity between PAs is a fundamental requirement for population persistence, several methods have been developed to include connectivity into PA design algorithms. Among these, the eigenvalue decomposition of the connectivity matrix allows for identifying clusters of strongly connected sites and selecting the sites contributing the most to population persistence. So far, this method was only suited to optimize an entire network of PAs without considering existing PAs in the new design. However, a more cost-effective and realistic approach is to optimize the design of an extended network to improve its connectivity and thus population persistence. Here, we develop a flexible algorithm based on eigenvalue decomposition of connectivity matrices to extend existing networks of PAs while optimizing connectivity and population growth rate. We also include a splitting algorithm to improve cluster identification. The new algorithm accounts for the change in connectivity due to the increased biological productivity often observed in existing PAs. We illustrate the potential of our algorithm by proposing an extension of the network of approximate to 100 Mediterranean marine PAs to reach the targeted 10% surface area protection from the current 1.8%. We identify differences between the clean slate scenario, where all sites are available for protection, irrespective of their current protection status, and the scenario where existing PAs are forced to be included into the optimized solution. By integrating this algorithm to existing multi-objective and multi-specific algorithms of PA selection, the demographic effects of connectivity can be explicitly included into conservation planning.

AB Past climatic changes have caused extinction, speciation, and range dynamics, but assessing the influence of past multimillion-year climatic imprints on present-day biodiversity patterns remains challenging. We analyzed a new continental-scale data set to examine the importance of paleoclimatic effects on current gradients in African palm richness patterns. Using climate reconstructions from the late Miocene (approximate to 10 mya), the Pliocene (approximate to 3 mya), and the Last Glacial Maximum (0.021 mya), we found that African palm diversity patterns exhibit pronounced historical legacies related to long-term climate change. Notably, pre-Pleistocene paleoprecipitation variables differentially affected current diversity patterns of palms grouped by contrasting habitat requirements. Accounting for present-day environment, rain forest palms exhibit greater species richness in localities where Pliocene precipitation was relatively high, whereas open-habitat palms show higher species richness in areas of relatively low precipitation during the Miocene Epoch. Our results demonstrate that diversity-climate relationships among African palm species include multimillion-year lagged dynamics, i.e., with historical legacies persisting across much longer time periods than commonly recognized.

AB Using an implementation of the Region Ocean Modeling System, we investigate the influence of larval vertical swimming on spring dispersal for nearshore invertebrate species in the California Current System (CCS), with a focus on central California and the Bodega Bay area. Larvae are given a suite of idealized behaviors designed to reveal the importance of the surface boundary layer (SBL) to transport and settlement. Larvae remain near 5 m, 30 m, or transition between these depths using various strategies, including diel vertical migration (DVM) and ontogenetic vertical migration. Some behaviors result in modeled densities qualitatively similar to observed cross-shelf larval distributions. By remaining primarily below the SBL, larvae released from central California are 500 times more likely to be retained within 5 km of the coast at 30 days from release relative to those that stay near surface, and 145 times more likely to settle along the coast within a 30 to 60 day pelagic larval duration. For most behaviors, nearshore retention over time could be approximated as a modified exponential decay process. Vertical swimming also greatly affects alongshore dispersal, with each behavior resulting in a unique structure of alongshore settlement. Maintaining a depth near 30 m increases settlement throughout most of the CCS by at least an order of magnitude relative to passive larvae. Remaining near surface reduces settlement from Pt. Conception to Pt. Arena, but has less of an effect north of Cape Mendocino. Relative to passive larvae, DVM increases settlement in regional "hotspots," but does not greatly alter overall recruitment in the CCS, and ontogenetic vertical migration increases settlement for central California regions south of Bodega Bay.

AB It is unclear whether inter-tree competition plays a role in determining the woody plant cover of humid savannas. Spatial point-pattern analysis can give insights to the underlying processes affecting the individuals in a population. We assessed the spatial patterns of Acacia karroo trees from savannas in KwaZulu-Natal, using conventional nearest neighbour analysis and second-order spatial statistics such as Ripley's K- and L-functions, and the univariate and bivariate O-ring statistics. We predicted that juvenile trees would be spatially aggregated, because of facilitation between shrubs when zones of overlap are relatively small, while adult trees would be regularly spaced because of the effects of density-dependent mortality (i.e. consistent with the honeycomb rippling model). We found that juvenile trees were more aggregated than expected by chance, and the overall spatial distribution of all trees was also found to be aggregated, with no evidence of regularity among large individuals. Nearest neighbour analysis, however, revealed significant positive correlations between the sum of the distances to the four nearest neighbours and the sum of the canopy diameters of the target tree and its four nearest neighbours, indicating the presence of competition. In sum, these findings suggest that competitive interactions between A. karroo trees at these sites are relatively weak, and result in decreased performance (smaller canopy diameters) rather than mortality, thus preventing a regular pattern of tree distribution. We advocate the use of both methods of detecting competitive interactions in the field, especially if the effects of competition are too subtle to result in differential mortality.

AB 1. Ecological edges (zones separating ecosystems or land cover types) can function as active boundaries, unique habitats and dynamic transition zones. Abiotic factors, species and species interactions exhibit strong responses to edges, and these responses edge effects can profoundly impact ecosystem structure and function.
   2. Edge effects may be altered by the presence or proximity of other nearby edges. This phenomenon edge interaction is poorly understood, though its importance is increasingly recognized. Edge interactions are likely in fragmented or patchy landscapes that contain many edges. In such landscapes, understanding how nearby edges interact may be critical for effective conservation and management.
   3. I examined edge interactions in an East African savanna. In this landscape, abandoned cattle corrals develop into treeless, nutrient-rich 'glades' that persist as preferentially grazed areas for decades to centuries. Glades represent important sources of structural and functional landscape heterogeneity and have major impacts on distributional patterns of plant and animals.
   4. I used existing variation in inter-glade distance to investigate the importance and strength of glade edge interactions for plants, Acacia ants and large herbivores. Specifically, I compared response patterns obtained from transects that extended outward from isolated glades ( >250 m from another glade) and non-isolated glades (<150 in from another glade).
   5. Edge effect patterns between nearby glades differed significantly from patterns around isolated glades. When compared to areas outside isolated glades, areas between glades had almost twice the density of trees, half as much large herbivore use, reduced cover of glade-dominant grasses, and different Acacia ant communities. Many of the edge effects observed between non-isolated glades could not be inferred from effects around isolated glades.
   6. Synthesis. These findings suggest that edge interactions can alter plant and animal distributions in patchy landscapes. Edge effects near multiple edges can be stronger, weaker or qualitatively different from those near isolated edges. Such edge interactions can increase or decrease structural and functional continuity between nearby patches. Appropriate extrapolation of local edge effects in complex and fragmented landscapes will require greater understanding of edge interactions.

AB Despite the importance of early life stages in individuals' life history and population dynamics, very few studies have focused on the constraints to which these juvenile traits are subjected. Based on 10 years of automatic monitoring of over 2500 individuals, we present the first study on the effects of environmental conditions and individual pre-fledging traits on the post-fledging return of non-banded king penguins to their natal colony. Juvenile king penguins returned exclusively within one of the three austral summers following their departure. A key finding is that return rates (range 68-87%) were much higher than previously assumed for this species, importantly meaning that juvenile survival is very close to that of adults. Such high figures suggest little juvenile dispersal, and selection occurring mostly prior to fledging in king penguins. Pre-fledging conditions had a strong quadratic impact on juvenile return rates. As expected, cohorts reared under very unfavourable years (as inferred by the breeding success of the colony) exhibited low return rates but surprisingly, so did those fledged under very favourable conditions. Juvenile sojourns away from the colony were shorter under warm conditions and subsequent return rates higher, suggesting a positive effect of climate warming. The longer the post-fledging trip (1, 2 or 3 years), the earlier in the summer birds returned to their natal colony and the longer they stayed before leaving for the winter journey. The presence of juveniles in the colony was more than twice the duration required for moulting purposes, yet none attempted breeding in the year of their first return. Juvenile presence in the colony may be important for acquiring knowledge on the social and physical colonial environment and may play an important part in the learning process of mating behaviour. Further studies are required to investigate its potential implications on other life-history traits such as recruitment age.

AB Acacia karroo is one of the most widespread and abundant indigenous tree legume species in Southern Africa. The tree possesses positive attributes such as high growth rates, drought tolerance, adaptation to acidic infertile soils and resistance to large temperature variations. In the recent past, A. karroo was deemed to be a severe encroacher, which adversely affected land utilisation and rangeland productivity. Research attention has been diverted from its riddance as a weed to its utilisation as an animal feed. Widespread adoption of feeding strategies based on A. karroo was mainly impeded by the presence of thorns and tannins. Opportunities to minimise the adverse effects of these anti-quality factors are now well documented. A. karroo leaves have desirable fatty acid profiles, high N and mineral concentrations. At present, utilisation of A. karroo for beef production on rangelands is restricted by limited evidence regarding its feeding value. The current paper, therefore, demonstrates the potential of A. karroo to reduce worm burdens, and improve growth rates, carcass traits, beef quality and fatty acid profiles of cattle on rangeland. Economics of feeding A. karroo, strategies for incorporating it into feeding regimes for beef cattle and its relevance to sustainable livelihoods in low input production systems are outlined.

AB One of the environmental concerns associated with producing biofuels from alien plants is the risk of these species becoming invasive. We explored whether insights from commercial forestry and agroforestry could inform strategies to reduce future problems with invasive biofuel plants. The dynamics, dimensions, and extent of invasions of forestry species can be explained using models incorporating species traits, environmental features, stochastic factors associated with plantings, and residence time. Economic driving forces are crucial. Important lessons to be learnt from forestry for reducing problems with invasiveness of alien species for biofuel production include: the use of global databases and screening tools for identifying high-risk species; the design and configuration of plantations to minimize spread risk; and the use of biological control to reduce invasiveness.

AB The Cape Fynbos region of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot, hosted a diverse large mammal fauna till shortly after permanent European settlement (1652). How these animals survived in this exceptionally nutrient-poor environment is puzzling and it is generally believed that they restricted their movements to the more fertile shale areas. We tested the hypothesis that large herbivores avoid nutrient-poor limestone and sandstone fynbos shrublands in favour of shale-derived renosterveld vegetation using strontium (Sr) isotope analysis. If this technique could reconstruct the preferred feeding habitats of the contemporary fauna, it might also be useful for reconstructing the preferred feeding grounds of an extinct fauna. Using the assumption that small rodents have spatially restricted foraging activities, we determined the Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios of rodent teeth to establish the isotopic signal characteristic of the different geological substrates in the area. We then analysed Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios in the bones of a number of different large herbivores found in De Hoop Nature Reserve using laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. These values were compared to the bioavailable (rodent) values on the respective geological substrates. The technique identified differences in feeding substrate selection between different species and groups of the same species. The results also showed that shale renosterveld shrubland is not the exclusive source of nutrition for the large herbivores. Strikingly different isotope ratios among individuals in some populations pointed to significant dispersal events from distant sources. However, we were unable to pinpoint the exact feeding areas using Sr isotope analysis probably because some animals use a combination of substrates for feeding and because the geology of the study area is complex with graded isotope signals. We suggest that this technique is a valuable additional tool for exploring large mammal foraging behaviour on habitats associated with contrasting and less complex geology.

AB Traditional rangelands in many developing countries are currently being encroached by cultivation, driving some herders to illegally use protected areas for grazing their cattle. Since cattle are an exotic species in these ecosystems, they might have an impact on the local wild herbivore communities, notably through competition. We used point pattern statistics to characterise the spatial relationships between wild ungulate species and cattle herds within a protected area in west Africa undergoing seasonal intrusions by cattle. We predicted that the wild ungulate species that are ecologically and morphologically similar to cattle, in terms of body mass and diet, would be more sensitive to grass depletion by cattle and would be separated from cattle to a larger extent. The spatial distribution of browsing and mixed-feeding antelopes did not seem to be affected much by cattle presence, whereas most grazing species showed spatial separation from cattle. Interestingly, elephants also showed significant separation from cattle herds. We discuss the likely processes that may have contributed to the observed spatial patterns. The spatial displacement of certain wild species, including megaherbivores, affects the whole community structure and, thus, other components of the ecosystem.

AB There are many variables within an urban landscape that can be expected to influence faunal diversity. We used a mechanistic approach to observe the relative importance of each of these variables in describing the diversity of avian communities in urban and peri-urban areas of Cape Town, South Africa situated within Cape Floristic Region, a global plant biodiversity hotspot. We expected to find a strong influence of habitat amount and arrangement across a fragmented urban-rural gradient. Birds were sampled in patches of fragmented Cape Flats Sand Fynbos at 39 locations during the middle of summer (November-January 2008/2009). Environmental data included on-site observations, existing GIS layers, and remotely sensed data. Bird community composition was related to habitat amount, arrangement, and quality. Correlations, partial correlations and structural equation analysis showed that habitat amount and arrangement had insignificant effects on species richness across the urban gradient. Changes in urban density and the presence or absence of the invasive alien tree species Acacia saligna (blue wattle) appeared to be the main drivers of avian species richness. Increasing urban density, decreasing A. saligna density and decreasing canopy height correlated with higher avian species richness, with confounding variables corrected for. For the management of urban biodiversity, our results suggest that the most urgent focus should be on retaining the quality remaining areas of native vegetation (and particularly, containing the spread of A salgina) rather than extending current networks with poor quality habitat. More generally, habitat quality appears to be more important than habitat amount or arrangement in this system. We suggest that this observation be encorporated into further research to more effectively predict avian responses to landscape change and that more must be done to adequately capture the critical and complex role of the matrix in terrestrial systems.

AB Environmental heterogeneity influences biodiversity patterns such as species richness and community composition, but we do not know how it shapes community structure in terms of the number of rare and abundant species. This question is particularly relevant to modified landscapes such as agro-ecosystems, where intensive management creates highly homogeneous landscapes, which often lead to loss of rare taxa and dominance by a few aggressive species.
   It can be difficult to evaluate the effects of management on communities in different localities due to regional differences in species richness and composition. Because species abundance distributions (SADs) express assemblage structure in comparable units, they can be used to characterize communities irrespective of species composition, and for this reason provide a novel means of assessing the effects of management.
   We analysed the SADs of weed communities across a gradient of environmental heterogeneity generated by different management treatments. We tested the hypothesis that environmental heterogeneity promotes multimodality in SADs by comparing observed patterns with those predicted for simulated random samples from homogeneous communities.
   Observed SADs from a homogeneous environment did not deviate from predictions. By contrast, SADs from increasingly heterogeneous environments were progressively and consistently multimodal.
   These results demonstrate that environmental heterogeneity, resulting from variation in management treatments, leaves a signature on the SAD.
   Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that Species Abundance Distributions are informative indicators of environmental heterogeneity in modified landscapes. Weed communities include both rare species, which are often of conservation interest and pose little threat to crops, and abundant species, which can be problematic. Our analysis suggests that creating environmental heterogeneity by varying management treatments across the landscape can be an effective way of promoting biodiversity and decreasing the abundance of problematic species.

AB Climate change has strong potential to modify the structure and functioning of ecosystems, but experimental field studies into its effects are rare. On rocky shores, grazing limpets strongly affect ecosystem structure and their distribution in NW Europe is changing in response to climate change. Three limpet species co-occur in SW Britain (Patella vulgata, Patella ulyssiponensis and Patella depressa) on open rock and in pools. Shores in Ireland are similar, but currently lack P. depressa. It is anticipated that P. depressa will expand its range into Ireland as the climate warms, but we currently lack an empirical basis to predict the consequences of this change. Recent studies show that increasing abundance of P. depressa on British shores has been accompanied by a decline of P. vulgata suggesting interspecific competition. In this study, a new experimental framework was used to examine the potential for P. depressa to affect P. vulgata on Irish shores. P. vulgata was experimentally transplanted into enclosures on open rock and in pools in both Ireland and Britain. In pools, treatments also included transplanted P. ulyssiponensis to mimic natural assemblages. Growth and mortality of P. vulgata were measured over 6 months with no differences between Ireland and Britain. In Britain, P. vulgata caged in pools with transplanted P. depressa and P. ulyssiponensis showed reduced growth, compared with when caged in pools with P. ulyssiponensis alone. There was no effect of P. depressa on the growth rate of P. vulgata on open rock. Results indicate that if the range of P. depressa extends into Ireland, it would reduce the growth of P. vulgata where it co-occurs with P. ulyssiponensis in pools. The framework used here provides a field-based approach that could be used to examine the impacts of climate-induced range expansions on the structure and functioning of other ecosystems.

AB We investigated the structure, composition and environmental correlates of leaf-litter invertebrate assemblages in Pinus radiata plantations and in neighbouring native eucalypt woodland in the Jenolan Caves Karst Conservation Reserve, south-east Australia. Invertebrate assemblages of plantations were compared with remnant eucalypt woodland located well away from the influence of plantations to determine the direct effects of plantations as a result of habitat-replacement with a non-native plantation species. We also included in our comparisons edge habitat of eucalypt woodland located immediately adjacent to plantations. This unique edge habitat is exposed to the intrusion of large volumes of pine leaf-litter from plantations, which has the potential to affect indirectly invertebrate assemblages of surrounding woodland. We found that species richness of invertebrates was significantly lower in pine plantations compared with remnant eucalypt woodland. There was a complete absence of species from 12 invertebrate orders that were found in surrounding eucalypt woodland. A rich and abundant native plant understorey that provides increased habitat heterogeneity is the most likely explanation for the richer invertebrate assemblage found in remnant eucalypt woodland. The total abundance of all invertebrate taxa in pine plantations in winter was significantly higher than in remnant eucalypt woodland, pine-litter edges and pine-free edges. Plantations were characterized by particularly high abundances of species in two orders, Acari and Collembola. High abundances of acarine and collembolan species in plantations were associated with a decompositional environment represented by comparatively higher moisture contents and higher C : N ratios of both leaf-litter and soil, higher soil conductivity and lower soil pH. We suggest that implementation of The Plantation Biodiversity Benefits Score will be a fruitful way forward to assess the environmental benefits that can be gained from pine plantations in this region of south-eastern Australia.

AB Once a bird has fledged it becomes hardly accessible for researchers and consequently knowledge about post-fledging ontogeny is scarce. In this study on juvenile Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) we used an automated transponder-based detection and weighing system at Banter See colony, Northern Germany, which enabled us to investigate body mass growth of post-fledglings and its consequences for their survival until first return to the natal colony when 2 years old. We analysed data from two contrasting breeding seasons, 2000 and 2001, in order to determine inter-year and inter-sex variation of post-fledging parameters assumed to potentially affect subadult survival, such as the period a juvenile is still present at colony surroundings (departure age), its fledging mass and last recorded post-fledging body mass, and hatch date. Using an information-theoretic model selection approach, neither the date of hatching nor the departure age was found to affect survival. The only predictor of survival was last post-fledging body mass whereas fledging mass itself was of minor importance. Although there was weak evidence for an interaction with year, individuals of the cohort 2000, which left the colony area on average 5 g lighter than those reared under the more favourable conditions in 2001, did not exhibit lower return probability. We suggest that under unfavourable conditions selection had eliminated weak individuals prior to fledging or during the post-fledging period. This study underlines the importance of the post-fledging period and its consequences for survival, especially in species with prolonged parental care post-fledging.

AB Marine reserves may not only protect populations within their borders but also subsidize harvested populations outside through the spillover of either adults or planktonic larvae. The conservation benefits of marine reserves are well documented, and a growing body of evidence suggests that the spillover of large adults from reserves can enhance fisheries for highly mobile species. However, the proposed benefit: to fisheries through larval export, a crucial benefit for the many marine species without highly mobile adults, remains controversial. We tested for larval export by estimating larval production and recruitment patterns of a harvested intertidal mussel, Perna perna, inside-and a range of distances outside-3 marine reserves in South Africa. Within the borders of 2 reserves, mussels were more abundant and larger than outside the reserves, with significantly higher expected production. Recruitment was highest inside these reserves and declined exponentially with distance. In the third region, where harvest outside reserve boundaries is carefully managed by community members, no differences in production or recruitment inside versus outside the reserve were found. Where production and recruitment were enhanced, we used the inverse relationship of recruitment with distance from the reserves to determine the spatial scale and magnitude of larval export. Our results suggest that larval export from these reserves enhances recruitment to fished areas within several kilometers, This study supports the idea that increased production in reserves may subsidize fisheries outside their borders, even for species with immobile adults.

AB We sampled three habitats (main channel, side channels, and backwater lakes) during 2 yr along 32 km of the Illinois River to compare zooplankton distribution and dynamics, as well as evaluate the possible effects of hydrology on taxonomic abundance and distribution. Zooplankton assemblages displayed both spatial and temporal variation. Whereas the riverine zooplankton assemblage was dominated by rotifers, the backwater lake assemblage was dominated by copepods. Zooplankton densities in the main channel peaked earlier in the season in both years than the backwater lake habitats. To determine if these patterns were caused by fluvial exchanges occurring between habitats during flooding, we sampled the connections between the backwater lake and main channel habitats and found that large numbers of zooplankton entered the main channel via these connections. Further, calculations of main channel population growth, birth, and death rates showed that population growth rates most commonly exceeded birth rates during the flooding period. Seasonal inoculums from off-channel habitats could play an important role in riverine zooplankton dynamics. However, for the main channel to achieve the measured zooplankton densities, similar to 400,000 backwater lakes would be required and zooplankton would need to travel an unrealistic number of days and distance based on estimated growth rates. Thus, other mechanisms (hatching of resting eggs or in situ reproduction) are likely responsible for zooplankton abundances.

AB In some African protected areas, elephant populations have reached high densities causing concern about their influence on other forms of biodiversity, and in particular, other large herbivores. This has led to a debate whether management of elephant populations might need to be implemented. Surprisingly, few studies have focused on the influence of elephants on other herbivores and the existing results are conflicting. We investigated such influence in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, where elephants were culled and maintained at low density up to 1986, and have more than doubled since then, thus providing the opportunity to explore their possible influence on other herbivore species. Trends of different herbivore populations were obtained using long-term waterhole census data, with these results also being correlated to changes in dry season rainfall, as another fundamental determinant of herbivore population fluctuations. While our study did not allow us to properly disentangle the role of elephants and rainfall, it provided valuable insights. For five out of the 13 herbivore species studied, the population increased between 1973 and 1986 (high dry season rainfall; relatively low elephant abundance), then decreased between 1987 and 1995 (extremely low dry season rainfall; increase in the elephant population), and finally have increased since 1996 (high dry season rainfall; high elephant abundance). These results are consistent with an important role of dry season rainfall on herbivore population dynamics. Additionally, for four other species, the population increased between 1973 and 1986 and has decreased since then. As most herbivore declines occurred simultaneously with increase in the elephant population in the 1987-1995 period, and with the recent increase in most populations happening at a lower rate than the 1973-1985 period, our results suggest the possible existence of a negative influence of high elephant densities on other herbivores. We discuss what the possible underlying mechanisms can be and how to investigate them.

AB Crepidula fornicata, one of the most invasive marine sessile invertebrates in Europe, has traits commonly associated with a weak population genetic structure (high population connectivity): wide environmental tolerance, high fecundity, and a long planktonic larval stage (21 d). In order to determine the scale at which effective dispersal occurs in this potentially highly dispersive species, we designed a hierarchical sampling protocol and analyzed genetic variation at 4 microsatellite loci in 17 populations from 6 French bays situated in the English Channel and at the entrance of the English Channel (Iroise Sea). A strong regional pattern with populations clustered into 3 main groups (Iroise Sea, western and eastern English Channel) was revealed, as was significant isolation by distance along the Channel coasts. Conversely, a high degree of genetic connectivity was observed within the study bays. These estimates of effective dispersal were in agreement with outputs of a 2D larval-dispersal model based on local hydrodynamic conditions, suggesting that connectivity between populations of C. fornicata is influenced by hydrodynamic feature. This study suggests the existence of barriers to gene flow of C. fornicata over moderate distances (ca. 100 km).

AB The appropriate configuration of marine reserves for maximizing harvests or ensuring species persistence when there is uncertainty or variability in larval dispersal patterns is not completely understood. This is particularly true in environments with large alongshore advection rates, as the success of a system of marine reserves depends on connectivity through larval and/or adult dispersal between adjacent marine reserves. In this paper, the consequences of alongshore advection in the presence of marine reserves for a fish species with sedentary adults and widely dispersing larvae are examined. First, a uniform configuration of reserves with constant alongshore advection rate is considered. The highest overall catch and recruitment rates occur when the spacing between reserves is precisely tuned to the advection distance. When the alongshore advection distance is allowed to vary in time, catch and recruitment are considerably less sensitive to alongshore advection. At small diffusion distances, catch values differ from what would be predicted from the time-averaged larval dispersal pattern due to density-dependent post-settlement effects. It is important to include short time scale settlement variability in marine reserve models under these conditions. When the spacing between reserves is allowed to vary, the tuning of the system to particular advection distances is less precise. Configurations of marine reserves with a variety of spacings between reserves exhibited more uniform catch levels as a function of advection distance. This suggests that variability in the spacing between reserves is desirable for protecting a diverse group of species with different dispersal patterns.

AB Among primates, only chimpanzees and orang-utans are credited with customary tool use in nature. Among monkeys, capuchins stand out with respect to the number of accounts of tool use. However, the majority of capuchin tool use observations reported in nature is anecdotal or idiosyncratic. In this report, we documented the stone pounding of dry fruits (Hymenea courbaril and Acrocomia aculeata) in two wild free-ranging groups of Cebus libidinosus in the Brasilia National Park, a preserved area representative of the Cerrado biome of Central Brazil. In 2004, we noted 2 episodes at which 4 monkeys used stones to crack open nuts. In 2005, we recorded 5 pounding episodes involving 2 different monkeys. Observations of tool use over the course of 2 consecutive years by some individuals, as well as other indirect evidence, indicate that this behaviour could be habitual in the studied groups. We propose that the probability of the emergence of the use of pounding stones as tools may be dependent on the ecological variables that influence the degree of terrestriality and extractive foraging and the complex interaction of these factors.

AB Knowledge of the sources and distribution of ammonia (NH3) emissions underpins our understanding of the nitrogen budget. Research has focused on quantifying NH3 emissions from anthropogenic sources, whilst those from natural sources have received little attention internationally. Seabirds excrete large quantities of nitrogen, making seabird colonies a major natural source of NH3. Ammonia emissions from each UK seabird species were estimated and combined with population distribution data to model their spatial distribution. Total NH3 emissions from UK seabirds were estimated at 2.7 kt per year. Seabird emissions are concentrated in remote parts of the UK where anthropogenic emissions are small, so that seabirds often represent the main source of NH3 emissions in these areas. Seabird NH3 emissions were found to have increased by 34% since the 1970s. This corresponds to population changes which may be influenced by human activities, showing that even this natural source can be anthropogenically modified. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The possible effects of excreta of the Great Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo on abundance, diversity, and species composition of fungal communities were investigated in a temperate evergreen coniferous forest near Lake Biwa in central Japan. Samples were collected at three. study sites that had the same vegetation composition, but which had been influenced by different stages of breeding colony establishment: Site C (control site), Site 2 (colonizing site), and Site 3 (post-colony site). In forest floor samples and in needles and twigs of Chamaecyparis obtusa, total hyphal length was lowest at Site 3, and clamp-bearing hyphal length (biomass of basidiomycetous fungi) was lower at Sites 2 and 3 than at Site C. Dark-pigmented hyphal length was highest at Site 2. Dilution plating of forest floor samples and mineral soil revealed: (i) species richness was higher at Sites 2 and 3 than at Site C, (ii) diversity was higher at Site 3 than at Sites C and 2, and that (iii) species composition differed among the sites. Surface sterilization of needles and twigs of C. obtusa revealed (i) with the exception of species richness in twigs, species richness and diversity were higher at Site 3 than at Sites C and 2, and that (ii) species composition differed markedly among the sites. In twig samples white rot Marasmius-like fungus and Geniculosporium sp. I were dominant at Site C and reduced at Sites 2 and 3. A coprophilous species, Sordaria sp. 1, showed a marked increase at Site 2 in needle and twig samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The introduction of the predatory Nile perch, Lates niloticus, into the Lake Victoria basin coincided with a dramatic decline in fish species richness and diversity. This study focused on interactions between Nile perch and indigenous fishes in Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, a small satellite lake of Lake Victoria. We evaluated how the foraging impact of juvenile Nile perch on prey fishes varied with the size of the predator. We also evaluated the role of wetland ecotones in minimizing interaction between Nile perch and indigenous fishes. Wetland ecotones in Lake Nabugabo were characterized by complex structure (e.g., dense vegetation) and lower dissolved oxygen levels than non-wetland (exposed) areas. Nile perch (8.6-42.2 cm, TL) were 3.7 times more abundant in offshore exposed areas than in inshore areas near wetland ecotones, and the proportion of Nile perch using wetland and exposed areas was independent of their body size. However, species richness was higher in waters at wetland ecotones than in exposed areas. Nile perch (5-35 cm, TL) exhibited a shift in diet at approximately 30 cm TL from feeding primarily on invertebrates to piscivory. Although the shift to piscivory occurred at approximately the same body size for Nile perch from both wetland and exposed habitats, the shift to piscivory was less abrupt in Nile perch captured near wetland ecotones. Nile perch from wetland areas consumed a greater diversity and a larger percentage of fish prey than those from exposed sites. However, the low abundance of Nile perch in wetland ecotones suggested that interaction between predator and prey in these areas is much reduced.

AB Black locust (Robinia pseudoacaciat L.), a nitrogen-fixing tree species introduced to northern Indiana, is invading disturbed and native communities of the Indiana Dunes. This study investigated three Quercus velutina (black oak) savanna and woodland dune communities to determine the effects of black locust on species diversity and composition. Data revealed that the mean plot basal area and density of black locust were highest in plots containing older black locusts and decreased in outlying plots where the saplings often occurred in ramets. The lowest densities of black locust saplings existed under the oldest trees. At all sites the herbaceous species diversity was lowest in the older black locust stands and higher in the younger stands. Downy brome grass (Bromus tectorum L.), a nonindigenous grass species, was dominant under older black locust trees and decreased in mean cover toward the younger stands. In a black oak savanna, soils of the oldest black locust trees had higher concentrations of nitrate (3.3 +/- SE 0.3 ppm) and ammonium (4.2 +/ SE 0.7 ppm) than the control soils (nitrate 1.4 +/- SE 0.1 ppm, ammonium 2.8 +/- SE 0.25 ppm). The results suggest that (1) black locust tree shade significantly reduced the natural diversity of herbaceous species at these sites, and (2) increased soil nitrogen produced by black locust facilitates dominance by the nitrogen-responsive downy brome. Implications for management are discussed.

AB We studied bird phenology and abundance patterns relative to rainfall, ground inundation, and food abundance in three mangrove sites of northeastern Venezuela over two complete annual cycles. Bird abundance, breeding and molting activities were assessed through mist-netting sessions scheduled twice monthly. At the same frequency, food abundance was evaluated through the percentage of trees bearing flowers, and by sweep-netting arthropods. The birds' breeding season occurred from the mid-dry to the mid-wet seasons and was linked to the abundance of some arthropod taxa including caterpillars. The higher abundance of arthropods and the presence of breeding activities during the dry season suggest that environmental factors are less limiting in mangroves than in adjacent arid habitats. The abundance of most birds, grouped according to their diet and frequency of mangrove use, varied significantly over time. Many species from other habitats exploited the mangroves in the late-wet and dry seasons to take advantage of a higher food abundance and to join mixed-species flocks. Abundance of Nearctic migrants was correlated with the abundance of several arthropod taxa, and diet analyses suggest that these birds feed opportunistically on seasonal abundant arthropods during their stay in mangroves.

AB The microbial biomass present in Windmill Islands soils, under varying degrees of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adelie) influence, was estimated using four different approaches. Average concentrations of 1200, 180, and 440 mug microbial C g-1 (measured as ATP) were detected in active colonies; extinct colonies and soils possessing visible algal growth respectively. This compared with an average of 12 mug C g-1 in control samples from sites remote from penguin colonies. Biomass estimates based on substrate-induced-respiration rates were 1-4 times higher than the equivalent ATP estimates.
   The soil microbiota of active penguin colonies was dominated by bacteria (92% of the total biomass) with tetrad-forming cocci comprising 35% of the total biovolume. Away from the immediate colony site, algal biomass, measured as chlorophyll a, accounted for 78-96% of the total biomass of carbon while bacterial biomass measured microscopically accounted for 4-22%. Yeasts accounted for <1% of the total biomass. Too few fungal hyphae were detected to make useful direct counts and their biomass appeared to be less than for yeast-like forms. Increasing algal predominance corresponded with decreasing soil pH and a 10,000-fold increase in fungal biomass compared to bacterial microbiota, as measured by colony counts.

AB Context Norway spruce (Picea abies) is one of the most widespread tree species in Europe's forests. Due to its high economic value it has been strongly favored by management, especially at the trailing edge of its natural distribution. However, disturbances from wind and bark beetles are increasingly impacting these forests, and their resilience under climate change has been called into question recently. Objectives We quantified the effects of landscape configuration and composition on (1) the risk from natural disturbances, and (2) on the overall resilience of Norway spruce to changing climate at the trailing edge. Methods We simulated the dynamics of a 9183 ha forest landscape in Eastern Austria over 190 years. We used the simulation model iLand to experimentally study a wide range of landscape compositions and configurations under five different climate scenarios. Results Natural disturbances increased considerably under all future climate scenarios. Dispersing Norway spruce throughout the landscape in mixed stands resulted in the highest levels of climate resilience. Reducing the percentage of Norway spruce on the landscape increased the resilience of the remaining Norway spruce trees, yet landscape configuration generally had a stronger effect on resilience than composition. Conclusions The resilience of Norway spruce at the trailing edge of its distribution is challenged by climate change, and considerable efforts are needed to sustain these ecosystems. While currently discussed adaptation measures focus largely on the stand level, we show that modifying landscape composition and configuration can be used to foster Norway spruce resilience while maintaining socio-economically relevant proportions of Norway spruce.

AB Scholars from many different intellectual disciplines have attempted to measure, estimate, or quantify resilience. However, there is growing concern that lack of clarity on the operationalization of the concept will limit its application. In this paper, we discuss the theory, research development and quantitative approaches in ecological and community resilience. Upon noting the lack of methods that quantify the complexities of the linked human and natural aspects of community resilience, we identify several promising approaches within the ecological resilience tradition that may be useful in filling these gaps. Further, we discuss the challenges for consolidating these approaches into a more integrated perspective for managing social-ecological systems. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Climate models predict that precipitation patterns in tropical dry forests (TDFs) will change, with an overall reduction in rainfall amount and intensification of dry intervals, leading to greater susceptibility to drought. In this paper, we explore the effect of drought on phenology and carbon dynamics of a secondary TDF located in the Santa Rosa National Park (SRNP), Costa Rica. Through the use of optical sensors and an eddy covariance flux tower, seasonal phenology and carbon fluxes were monitored over a four-year period (2013-2016). Over this time frame, annual precipitation varied considerably. Total precipitation amounts for the 2013-2016 seasons equaled 1591.8 mm (+14.4 mm SD), 1112.9 mm (+9.9 mm SD), 600.8 mm (+7.6 mm SD), and 1762.2 mm (+13.9 mm SD), respectively. The 2014 and 2015 (ENSO) seasonal precipitation amounts represent a 30% and 63% reduction in precipitation, respectively, and were designated as drought seasons. Phenology was affected by precipitation patterns and availability. The onset of green-up was closely associated with pre-seasonal rains. Drought events lead to seasonal NDVI minimums and changes in phenologic cycle length. Carbon fluxes, assimilation, and photosynthetic light use efficiency were negatively affected by drought. Seasonal minimums in photosynthetic rates and light use efficiency were observed during drought events, and gross primary productivity was reduced by 13% and 42% during drought seasons 2014 and 2015, respectively. However, all four growth seasons were net carbon sinks. Results from this study contribute towards a deeper understanding of the impact of drought on TDF phenology and carbon dynamics.

AB Earth's tropical ecosystems have witnessed several extinctions and a dramatic reduction of the range and abundance of large reptile species, which is directly related to the rise of early and modern humans. The occurrence of such extinctions, range reduction, species loss, and the consequences for several paramount ecosystem processes are poorly documented compared to other large vertebrate species. Here, I reviewed the literature on the ecological processes performed by large tropical reptile species and their human-induced widespread demise in order to determine knowledge gaps and encourage a paradigm shift in understanding on the interactiveness of such species. The interactions and species involved indicate that large abundant reptiles in the tropics are important in ecological processes, and can consequently have an important role in ecosystem function through gene dispersal, nutrient cycling, trophic action, and ecosystem engineering. These important interactions performed by reptiles are not solely performed by few species, or geographically restricted to islands, but instead present a pattern that repeatedly occurs in large reptiles distributed over tropical ecosystems. The observed tendency of reptiles to be tightly involved in these ecological interactions has important implications for the ecology of tropical ecosystems. Lost and current ecological processes performed by large reptiles may be orders of magnitude higher than what is currently perceived, and the misleading baseline of those processes must be addressed otherwise we risk losing species and services that are dependent of such interactions. To fix this bias I suggest: (a) Increase information spreading about Pleistocene-Holocene reptile extinctions using popular media; (b) Improved exchange between the research field of megafauna effects in ecosystems and herpetologists working with large reptiles; (c) Increase research effort on anthropogenic reptile extinctions and their potential to predict future losses; (d) Address the knowledge gaps, as human-reptile conflict, chelonian seed dispersal and nutrient movement; (e) Increase quantitative research on large reptile population ecology, density, and abundance. (f) address the potentially present or lost ecosystem effects of extant and extinct reptile species. Although the importance of reptiles in most tropical ecosystems has been perceived as negligible, this study shows that this may be a misleading paradigm.

AB Recent global commitments have placed forest and landscape restoration at the forefront of countries' efforts to recover ecosystem services, conserve biodiversity, and mitigate the effects of climate change. However, it needs to be asked if current native tree seedling supply meets an increase in demand for forest restoration? This study assessed the current configuration, distribution, and production capacity of forest nurseries producing native trees in Brazil. Brazil provides an interesting example of how global agreements aligned with national policies can lead to the proliferation of native seedling nurseries, and the challenges faced to restore species-rich native forest ecosystems. We found that the nurseries in the Atlantic Forest region can still meet an increase in demand-both in terms of seedling quantity and diversity-because most of their production capacity is not currently used. However, not all Brazilian biomes have sufficient nurseries to meet restoration demands, thus there is a risk of using native species from a few biogeographical regions in a much spatially wider and ecologically diverse area. In addition, lack of seed supply and qualified labor can hamper the growth of the market. Barriers to seed supply may also lead to low levels of genetic variability and floristic representation in the populations and ecosystems to be restored. We conclude that restoration of high-diversity forest ecosystems requires policies and supportive programs, with emphasis on private nurseries, to guarantee adequate supply of native tree seedlings and provide the necessary incentives to develop the emergent economy of forest restoration.

AB Plant biomass consumers (mammalian herbivory and fire) are increasingly seen as major drivers of ecosystem structure and function but the prevailing paradigm in temperate forest ecology is still that their dynamics are mainly bottom-up resource-controlled. Using conceptual advances from savanna ecology, particularly the demographic bottleneck model, we present a novel view on temperate forest dynamics that integrates consumer and resource control.
   We used a fully factorial experiment, with varying levels of ungulate herbivory and resource (light) availability, to investigate how these factors shape recruitment of five temperate tree species. We ran simulations to project how inter-and intraspecific differences in height increment under the different experimental scenarios influence long-term recruitment of tree species.
   Strong herbivore-driven demographic bottlenecks occurred in our temperate forest system, and bottlenecks were as strong under resource-rich as under resource-poor conditions. Increased browsing by herbivores in resource-rich patches strongly counteracted the increased escape strength of saplings in these patches.
   This finding is a crucial extension of the demographic bottleneck model which assumes that increased resource availability allows plants to more easily escape consumer-driven bottlenecks. Our study demonstrates that a more dynamic understanding of consumer-resource interactions is necessary, where consumers and plants both respond to resource availability.

AB The tropical rain forests of Central Africa contain high levels of species diversity. Paleovegetation or bio-diversity patterns suggested successive contraction/expansion phases on this rain forest cover during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Consequently, the hypothesis of the existence of refugia e.g. habitat stability that harbored populations during adverse climatic periods has been proposed. Understory species are tightly associated to forest cover and consequently are ideal markers of forest dynamics. Here, we used two central African rain forest understory species of the palm genus, Podococcus, to assess the role of past climate variation on their distribution and genetic diversity. Species distribution modeling in the present and at the LGM was used to estimate areas of climatic stability. Genetic diversity and phylogeography were estimated by sequencing near complete plastomes for over 120 individuals. Areas of climatic stability were mainly located in mountainous areas like the Monts de Cristal and Monts Doudou in Gabon, but also lowland coastal forests in southeast Cameroon and northeast Gabon. Genetic diversity analyses shows a clear North-South structure of genetic diversity within one species. This divide was estimated to have originated some 500,000 years ago. We show that, in Central Africa, high and unique genetic diversity is strongly correlated with inferred areas of climatic stability since the LGM. Our results further highlight the importance of coastal lowland rain forests in Central Africa as harboring not only high species diversity but also important high levels of unique genetic diversity. In the context of strong human pressure on coastal land use and destruction, such unique diversity hotspots need to be considered in future conservation planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB AimDisturbance and connectivity shape the structure and spatial distribution of animal populations in all ecosystems, but the combined effects of these factors are rarely measured in coastal seascapes. We used surf zones of exposed sandy beaches in eastern Australia as a model seascape to test for combined effects of coastal urbanization and seascape connectivity (i.e. spatial links between surf zones, estuaries and rocky headlands) on fish assemblages.
   LocationFour hundred kilometres of exposed surf beaches along the eastern coastline of Australia.
   MethodsFish assemblages were surveyed from surf zones of 14 ocean-exposed sandy beaches using purpose-built surf baited remote underwater video stations.
   ResultsThe degree of coastal urbanization and connectivity were strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of fish species richness and abundance and were of greater importance to surf fishes than local surf conditions. Urbanization was associated with reductions in the abundance of harvested piscivores and fish species richness. Piscivore abundance and species richness were lowest on highly urbanized coastlines, and adjacent to beaches in wilderness areas where recreational fishing is intense. By contrast, seascape connectivity was correlated with the spatial distribution of omnivore and planktivore abundance. Spatial linkages between surf zones and estuaries were also important to two globally threatened guitarfish that are of international conservation significance.
   Main conclusionsWe show for the first time how vulnerable and iconic fish species in surf zones are affected by the presence of coastal cities and the attributes of seascapes in which these cities are embedded. It is possible that greater connectivity may lessen urbanization' impacts for species with broad diets and strong ecological links to other ecosystems - this offers new perspectives in coastal conservation, for fishes and beyond.

AB Global change will likely affect savanna and forest structure and distributions, with implications for diversity within both biomes. Few studies have examined the impacts of both expected precipitation and land use changes on vegetation structure in the future, despite their likely severity. Here, we modeled tree cover in sub-Saharan Africa, as a proxy for vegetation structure and land cover change, using climatic, edaphic, and anthropic data (R-2=0.97). Projected tree cover for the year 2070, simulated using scenarios that include climate and land use projections, generally decreased, both in forest and savanna, although the directionality of changes varied locally. The main driver of tree cover changes was land use change; the effects of precipitation change were minor by comparison. Interestingly, carbon emissions mitigation via increasing biofuels production resulted in decreases in tree cover, more severe than scenarios with more intense precipitation change, especially within savannas. Evaluation of tree cover change against protected area extent at the WWF Ecoregion scale suggested areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem services concern. Those forests most vulnerable to large decreases in tree cover were also highly protected, potentially buffering the effects of global change. Meanwhile, savannas, especially where they immediately bordered forests (e.g. West and Central Africa), were characterized by a dearth of protected areas, making them highly vulnerable. Savanna must become an explicit policy priority in the face of climate and land use change if conservation and livelihoods are to remain viable into the next century.

AB Africa has the most extensive C4 grassy biomes of any continent. They are highly flammable accounting for greater than 70% of the world's burnt area. Much of Africa's savannas and grasslands occur in climates warm enough and wet enough to support closed forests. The combination of open grassy systems and the frequent fires they support have long been interpreted as anthropogenic artefacts caused by humans igniting frequent fires. True grasslands, it was believed, would be restricted to climates too dry or too cold to support closed woody vegetation. The idea that higher-rainfall savannas are anthropogenic and that fires are of human origin has led to initiatives to 'reforest' Africa's open grassy systems paid for by carbon credits under the assumption that the net effect of converting these system to forests would sequester carbon, reduce greenhouse gases and mitigate global warming. This paper reviews evidence for the antiquity of African grassy ecosystems and for the fires that they sustain. Africa's grassy biomes and the fires that maintain them are ancient and there is no support for the idea that humans caused large-scale deforestation. Indicators of old-growth grasslands are described. These can help distinguish secondary grasslands suitable for reforestation from ancient grasslands that should not be afforested.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'The interaction of fire and mankind'.

AB Ecological theory predicts that diversity decreases variability in ecosystem function. We predict that, at the landscape scale, spatial variability created by a mosaic of contrasting patches that differ in time since disturbance will decrease temporal variability in aboveground plant biomass. Using data from a multi-year study of seven grazed tallgrass prairie landscapes, each experimentally managed for one to eight patches, we show that increased spatial variability driven by spatially patchy fire and herbivory reduces temporal variability in aboveground plant biomass. This pattern is associated with statistical evidence for the portfolio effect and a positive relationship between temporal variability and functional group synchrony as predicted by metacommunity variability theory. As disturbance from fire and grazing interact to create a shifting mosaic of spatially heterogeneous patches within a landscape, temporal variability in aboveground plant biomass can be dampened. These results suggest that spatially heterogeneous disturbance regimes contribute to a portfolio of ecosystem functions provided by biodiversity, including wildlife habitat, fuel, and forage. We discuss how spatial patterns of disturbance drive variability within and among patches.

AB AimWe aimed to produce the first complete pollination network for Africa to test (1) whether South African plants are unusually specialized in their interactions with pollinators, and (2) whether the South African data conform with global patterns of specialization.
   LocationCederberg, Cape Floristic Region, South Africa (32 degrees 0431.52S, 19 degrees 04 48.42E; elevation 320m).
   MethodsWe sampled all plant-pollinator interactions within a 1-ha plot to assemble a network of 62 plant species linked to 217 pollinators species by 10,314 visits. We calculated the standardized Kullback-Leibler distance (d) as an estimate of plant and animal specialization, and standardized two-dimensional Shannon entropy (H-2) as an estimate of network-wide specialization. We compared these metrics with those calculated for 58 other networks from across the world.
   ResultsIn a global context, the South African plant species had an unusually high number of interaction partners (mean=6.32) while the animal species had unusually few (mean=1.81). Animal diversity was high relative to plant diversity (network asymmetry=0.56). Nevertheless, the South African plants, pollinators and network overall were more specialized than any previously studied community (weighted mean d plants=0.824 and animals=0.807, community H-2=0.834), suggesting functional specialization. Overall, specialization was found to increase sharply with latitude in the Southern Hemisphere, whereas no relationship was found in the Northern Hemisphere.
   Main conclusionsThe findings that South African plants have a high diversity of pollinators and that specialization of pollination networks increases with latitude in the Southern Hemisphere only are in contradiction to expectations derived from earlier literature. Long-term climatic stability in the Southern Hemisphere might have allowed phenotypic and functional specialization to manifest and persist.

AB Large carnivores are in rapid global decline, with a broad array of consequences for the ecosystems they inhabit. To efficiently detect and address these declines requires unbiased and precise demographic data. Unfortunately, the characteristics that make large carnivores extinction-prone also pose serious challenges to obtaining these data. Rapid survey methods exist, but provide only relative measures of abundance, cannot detect declines before they become large, and provide little or no information about the causes of decline. African lions (Panthera leo) are declining throughout their range, making accurate monitoring of remaining populations urgent. We provide statistically rigorous estimates of population size, trends, survival rate and age-sex structure from Zambia's South Luangwa lion population from 2008 to 2012, just prior to cessation of hunting in 2013. Mark-recapture models fit to data from intensive monitoring of 210 individual lions in 18 prides and 14 male coalitions indicated a declining population, low recruitment, low sub-adult and adult male survival, depletion of adult males, and a senescing adult female population. Trophy hunting was the leading cause of death, with 46 males harvested. Based on these data we recommend continuing the hunting ban at least to 2016 to allow recovery, with substantially reduced quotas, age-limits, and effective trophy monitoring mandated thereafter should hunting resume. Similar data from intensive monitoring of key Zambian lion populations is required to evaluate effects of the hunting ban and provide management guidance. Effectively integrating intensive long-term monitoring and rapid survey methods should be a priority for future management and monitoring of carnivore species. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Short rotation woody crops (SRWC), fast growing tree species that are harvested on short, repeated intervals, can augment traditional fiber sources. These crops have economic and environmental benefits stemming from their capability of supplying fiber on a reduced land base in close proximity to users and when sensitive sites cannot be accessed. Eucalyptus and Populus appear to be genera with the greatest potential to provide supplemental fiber in the U. S. Optimal productivity can be achieved through practices that overcome site limitations and by choosing the most appropriate sites, species, and clones. Some Eucalyptus species are potentially invasive, yet field studies across multiple continents suggest they are slower to disperse than predicted by risk assessments. Some studies have found lower plant and animal diversity in SRWC systems compared to mature, native forests, but greater than some alterative land uses and strongly influenced by stand management, land use history, and landscape context. Eucalyptus established in place of grasslands, arable lands, and, in some cases, native forests can reduce streamflow and lower water tables due to higher interception and transpiration rates but results vary widely, are scale dependent, and are most evident in drier regions.

AB Many woody plants have been recently recognized as major invasive species with serious impacts on species diversity and functioning of invaded ecosystems. We evaluated the global invasion success of temperate trees and shrubs with native ranges in central Europe and explored the role of their native distribution and that of biological traits in determining whether they have become invasive in other parts of the world. Of the 94 species forming the source-area species pool, 27 % are known to be invasive in at least one region of the world. Generalized linear models on phylogenetically non-informed analyses revealed that tall woody plants flowering early in the season, and occupying many grid cells in the native range are significantly more likely to become successful invaders than species not possessing these traits. However, other traits can partly reduce the disadvantages resulting from low regional frequencies in the native range and consequent lower probability of them being introduced elsewhere. Species that do not depend for reproduction on another individual, those pollinated by wind and dispersed by animals are likely to become invasive even if they do not have extensive native distributions. However, of these traits only the regional frequency in the native range remained significant when phylogenetic relationships were taken into account. This indicates that the effect of the regional frequency is generic, valid across all woody species, and fine-tuned by advantageous biological traits inherited from common ancestors, shared by groups of phylogenetically-related species. Traits that only appeared significant in the phylogenetically non-informed analyses should be considered as specific for shrubs and trees of central Europe. Mode of reproduction was only significant in the phylogenetically-informed analysis, indicating that reproduction exclusively by seed favours invasiveness of woody species. From the management perspective, however, the predictive value of some traits is not diminished by them being phylogenetically constrained since we are not interested whether the behaviour of particular species is a result of evolutionary history but how we can treat specific cases of invasion.

AB Mountain ecosystems support a high biological diversity and a large number of endangered plant species many of which are ecological indicators of those specific habitats. The Himalayas are the world's youngest, highest and largest mountain range and support a high plant biodiversity. People living in this region use their traditional ecological knowledge to utilize local natural resources and hence have valuable understanding about their surroundings. Many areas within this region still remain poorly known for their floristic diversity, plant species distribution and vegetation ecosystem services, yet the indigenous people depend heavily upon local plant resources and, through unsustainable use, can cause an irreversible loss of plant species. The valley used in this study is typical of such areas and occupies a distinctive geographical location on the edge of the western Himalayan range, close to the Hindu Mush range to the west and the Karakorum Mountains to the north. It is also located on geological and climatic divides, which further add to its ecological interest. This paper focuses on (i) identification of ecological indicators at various elevation zones across an altitudinal range of 2450-4100m and (ii) recognition of social perceptions of plant species populations based on the ecosystem services that they provide. We used robust approaches to identify the plant indicator species of various elevation zones. Using phytosociological techniques, Importance Values (IVs) for each plant species were calculated. The statistical package PCORDS was used to evaluate the species area curves and indicator species for each elevation zone. Data attribute plots derived from Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) using CANOCO were deployed to illustrate the location of indicator species in each habitat type. Furthermore, the social perceptions of the local inhabitants as to whether the populations of the recorded species were increasing or decreasing over the recent past were recorded. We argue that the assessment of ecological indicators combined with the ecological knowledge of the indigenous population can assist in developing priorities for local and regional conservation strategies, especially for fragile mountain ecosystems.

AB Ecological changes associated with Kenya's fisheries closures were examined using a space-for-time substitution chronosequence based on 5 fisheries closures that ranged in age since closure from 5 to 41 yr. The chronosequence allowed estimates of the rates of change and recovery of key ecological processes and functional groups. I asked if similar to 35 yr was sufficient time for the ecosystem to recover and stabilize from fishing effects. Total consumer biomass peaked at 15-20 yr, but the magnitude and time scale of other functional group responses varied and were not always predictable based on assumed successional rates of recovery (i.e. plants > herbivore > carnivore > piscivore). For example, piscivore recovery was minor and variable while the biomass of herbivorous fishes was slow and had not clearly stabilized by the end of the time series. In contrast, predation rates on sea urchins were a key process that increased slowly and sea urchin biomass declined to very low levels at similar to 20 yr of closure. Against predictions, total herbivory estimates and fleshy erect algae and hard coral cover did not change with the age of the closures, indicating the importance of multiple types of herbivores and climate disturbances. For benthic cover groups, time since closure was a strong predictor (R-2 > 0.50) for seagrass and red coralline algae, which increased over time, and sand and calcareous green algae, which declined over time. These changes were complete on the 20 to 30 yr time scale. Consequently, processes were generally slow and functional group recovery was not fully complete by similar to 35 yr of closure. I speculate that recovery processes and times in these closures are likely to be influenced by human disturbances in the surrounding seascape and that permanent, old, and large closures are needed to represent fully restored tropical reef lagoon ecosystems.

AB Understanding the history of forests and their species' demographic responses to past disturbances is important for predicting impacts of future environmental changes. Tropical rainforests of the Guineo-Congolian region in Central Africa are believed to have survived the Pleistocene glacial periods in a few major refugia, essentially centred on mountainous regions close to the Atlantic Ocean. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the phylogeographic structure of a widespread, ancient rainforest tree species, Symphonia globulifera L. f. (Clusiaceae), using plastid DNA sequences (chloroplast DNA [cpDNA], psbA-trnH intergenic spacer) and nuclear microsatellites (simple sequence repeats, SSRs). SSRs identified four gene pools located in Benin, West Cameroon, South Cameroon and Gabon, and Sao Tome. This structure was also apparent at cpDNA. Approximate Bayesian Computation detected recent bottlenecks approximately dated to the last glacial maximum in Benin, West Cameroon and Sao Tome, and an older bottleneck in South Cameroon and Gabon, suggesting a genetic effect of Pleistocene cycles of forest contraction. CpDNA haplotype distribution indicated wide-ranging long-term persistence of S. globulifera both inside and outside of postulated forest refugia. Pollen flow was four times greater than that of seed in South Cameroon and Gabon, which probably enabled rapid population recovery after bottlenecks. Furthermore, our study suggested ecotypic differentiation-coastal or swamp vs terra firme-in S. globulifera. Comparison with other tree phylogeographic studies in Central Africa highlighted the relevance of species-specific responses to environmental change in forest trees.

AB Aim Studying plantsoil interactions of introduced species in different parts of their global range could assist in managing biological invasions by elucidating the level of host specificity of key mutualists. We assessed the role of the soil microbial community (with an emphasis on symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, collectively termed rhizobia) in determining cross-continental invasion success of five woody legume species. Location Australia. Methods For each species, we compared growth of plants in soils from their native and non-native ranges using a glasshouse study, a soil dilution method (most probable number) and T-RFLP to assess rhizobial abundance and community composition, respectively. Results Acacia longifolia was the only species that had significantly larger above-ground biomass when grown in soils from its non-native range. Rhizobial abundance was equally high across species and ranges, indicating plants are unlikely to be limited by soil rhizobial abundance in non-native ranges. Acacia cyclops, A.similar to saligna and Paraserianthes lophantha formed associations with different rhizobial communities in non-native vs. native range soils. Acacia longifolia and A.similar to melanoxylon associated with similar rhizobial communities in their native and non-native ranges, suggesting that rhizobia may have been accidentally introduced into their novel range with seeds or seedlings. Main conclusions Invasive success of these five legume species is not constrained by the abundance of rhizobia in novel ranges for established legume populations, at least within Australia. Although differences in rhizobial community composition were evident between the native and non-native ranges for three of the five species, these were not associated with differences in plant growth. Increased above-ground biomass of A.similar to longifolia when grown in soil from its non-native range suggests that invasive success of this species may be associated with differences in the non-rhizobial components of soil microbial communities in the novel range. This information could assist in management practises by facilitating a more instructive and effective screening for invasiveness.

AB Determining the biogeographical histories of rainforests is central to our understanding of the present distribution of tropical biodiversity. Ice age fragmentation of central African rainforests strongly influenced species distributions. Elevated areas characterized by higher species richness and endemism have been postulated to be Pleistocene forest refugia. However, it is often difficult to separate the effects of history and of present-day ecological conditions on diversity patterns at the interspecific level. Intraspecific genetic variation could yield new insights into history, because refugia hypotheses predict patterns not expected on the basis of contemporary environmental dynamics. Here, we test geographically explicit hypotheses of vicariance associated with the presence of putative refugia and provide clues about their location. We intensively sampled populations of Aucoumea klaineana, a forest tree sensitive to forest fragmentation, throughout its geographical range. Characterizing variation at 10 nuclear microsatellite loci, we were able to obtain phylogeographic data of unprecedented detail for this region. Using Bayesian clustering approaches, we demonstrated the presence of four differentiated genetic units. Their distribution matched that of forest refugia postulated from patterns of species richness and endemism. Our data also show differences in diversity dynamics at leading and trailing edges of the species' shifting distribution. Our results confirm predictions based on refugia hypotheses and cannot be explained on the basis of present-day ecological conditions.

   change
ID ZAKOUMA NATIONAL-PARK; WILDLIFE; TRENDS; CHAD
AB A raft of recent studies has highlighted a major decline in large mammal populations in many of Africa's protected areas. A recent continent-wide assessment represented a major step forward also in terms of quantifying the decline on a regional basis, but fell short in its sampling and analysis. In this paper, a way out of the "black box" of large mammal declines in Africa's protected areas is formulated, with the aim of assisting in the preparation of further assessments in the future. First, large mammal assessments are categorized, highlighting the importance of using and sometimes juxtaposing peer-reviewed sources. The importance of the length of time series of large mammal counts is stressed, allowing one to distinguish between natural variation (especially rainfall) and human-induced changes. Setting reference dates, such as 1970, often gives biased results, showing the need to interpret large mammal population assessments in a historic context as well. This holds true particularly for West-Central Africa, which has experienced a considerable decline in rainfall since 1970. Building on a framework that connects herbivore physiology and behavior with environmental gradients, examples are given to explain some striking observed changes. The declines in Africa's protected areas are not limited to large mammals, but have also been observed for large birds of prey. Assessments of large mammal populations should be accompanied by the identification of proximate drivers of change, for which a framework is suggested in this paper. To conclude, some suggestions for countering the declines in large mammal populations are presented.

AB This study aimed to quantify and understand the impact of severe land degradation on plant diversity in part of the Succulent Karoo. Although total number of species declined with heavy grazing, greater evenness resulted in an increase in species diversity. Annuals and geophytes increased while protective nurse plants were decimated and their dependent beneficiary plant species consequently became locally extinct with heavy grazing. The rich biological soil crust dominated by mosses and liverworts with light grazing gave way to brittle physical-chemical or cyanobacterial crusts after heavy grazing. Although heavy grazing can result in extreme levels of degradation in the context of agricultural rangeland use, the implications for plant diversity per se need not be as severe. There appear to be disturbance-dependent indigenous species which may become locally extinct under good rangeland conditions. Our results support the notion of two different species pools, a grazing resistant pool and a grazing beneficiary pool, where changes in grazing intensity can cause substantial changes in composition and some local extinction of species with little or sometimes even positive change in diversity. Beta diversity across the disturbance contrast substantially raised the gamma diversity and hence landscape species diversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tree invasions can lead to changes in the plant community composition and reductions in the number of native species. Acacia dealbata Link (silver wattle) was introduced to Chile as an ornamental. This species originated in Australia and Tasmania has been documented as invader in several ecosystems in the world. In Chile, this species is strongly associated to roads, rivers and human disturbances, performing as an invader in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. However, A. dealbata impacts at community levels have been scarcely studied. In order to determinate the relationship between A. dealbata invasion and the species richness and composition of plants in natural communities of south-central of Chile, we recorded the plant composition in three study conditions: under Acacia canopy, inside an adjacent native forest and in the edges between both conditions. We selected five study sites near to Concepcion, Chile (37 degrees S) and in each condition we surveyed three transects of 20x2 m(2) with a total of 15 transects at the three conditions. Results showed that the total species richness is significantly lower under Acacia canopy compared with the stand edge and native forest. Native species richness is higher within native forest and alien species richness is significantly higher in the stand edge. Plant composition also changes in the presence of A. dealbata. This study demonstrates the positive relationship between the presence of A. dealbata stands and the reduction of plant diversity in the south-central area of Chile.

AB The availability of nitrogen (N) is an important determinant of ecosystem and community dynamics for grasslands and savannas, influencing factors such as biomass productivity, plant and herbivore composition, and losses of N to waters and the atmosphere. To better understand the controls over N availability at landscape to regional scales, we quantified a range of plant and soil characteristics at each of 330 sites in three regions of South Africa: Kruger National Park (KNP), private game reserves adjacent to KNP (private protected areas - PPAs) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP). In comparing regions and sites within regions, grazing appeared to have a strong influence on N availability. Sites in the PPAs adjacent to KNP as well as sodic and alluvial sites in general typically had the highest N availability. The high N availability of these sites was not generally associated with greater potential N mineralization, but instead with less grass biomass and more forb biomass that indicated greater grazing pressure. Whereas sodic sites had a long history of high N availability as evidenced by their high soil delta 15N, the greater N availability in the PPAs over the two parks appeared to be relatively recent. Grazer biomass, average potential mineralization rates and grass biomass for HiP were greater than KNP, yet there were no differences in N availability as indexed by soil and foliar delta 15N between sites in the two parks. Although the short-term increase in N availability in PPAs is not necessarily deleterious, it is uncertain whether current productivity levels in those ecosystems is sustainable. With differences in management causing herbivore biomass to be 150% greater in the PPAs than the adjacent KNP, changes in plant communities and nitrogen cycling might lead to long-term degradation of these ecosystems, their ability to sustain herbivore populations, and also serve as an economic resource for the region.

AB Vegetation gradients developing around water sources (i.e. piospheres) are important features of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. Studied extensively in pastoral areas, piospheres have rarely been investigated in areas hosting rich herbivore diversity. We studied piospheres in woody cover assessed through remote-sensing in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, which has one of the world's largest elephant populations. As no preferred statistical model for piosphere studies has emerged, we first contrasted results from ordinary least-square (OLS) regressions on raw data with those from other statistical models (OLS on aggregated data and simultaneous autoregressive models on raw data), and selected the most parsimonious, unbiased, model to study the influence of artificial and natural waterholes, and the abundance of elephants, others browsers, and grazers on piospheres. OLS models provided unbiased parameter estimates, despite the strong spatial autocorrelation present in woody cover data, whereas other statistical models had important drawbacks. Using an OLS framework we showed that despite an important negative non-linear mean effect, distance-to-water was a poor predictor of woody cover at any location. Woody cover was on average more reduced in the vicinity of water at artificial waterholes than at natural waterholes. Elephant abundance was not consistently associated with lower woody cover, and poorly explained woody cover heterogeneity, as did all other herbivore-related variables. Our study indicates that piospheres may develop differently in pastoral and protected areas, suggesting the importance of herbivore diversity in ecosystem functioning. Our results also show that heterogeneity in woody cover persists within piospheres, calling for further investigation on the origin and role of this heterogeneity in the maintenance of ecological processes and biodiversity within these key-areas of the landscape.

AB The estuarine copepod Acartia tonsa naturally carried diverse strains of bacteria on its body. The bacterial community composition (BCC) remained very conservative even when the copepod was fed different axenic algal species, indicating that the food per se did not much affect BCC associated with the copepod. In xenic algal treatments, however, copepod-associated BCC differed with each alga fed, even though the same bacterial source was used to inoculate the algae. In addition, starved copepods taken at the same location but at different times significantly differed in their BCC. Algal species composition and copepod life history therefore serve to regulate BCC associated with copepods, and spatial and temporal variations in algal species composition and copepod origin would alter bacteria-copepod interactions.

AB Assessing the abundance and distribution of mammalian carnivores is vital for understanding their ecology and providing for their long-term conservation. Because of the difficulty of trapping and handling carnivores many studies have relied on abundance indices that may not accurately reflect real abundance and distribution patterns. We developed statistical analyses that detect spatial correlation in visitation data from combined scent station and camera-trap surveys, and we illustrate how to use such data to make inferences about changes in carnivore assemblages. As a case study we compared the carnivore communities of adjacent communal and freehold rangelands in central Namibia. We used an index of overdispersion to test for repeat visits to individual camera-trap scent stations and a bootstrap simulation to test for correlations in visits to camera neighbourhoods. After distilling our presence-absence data to the most defensible spatial scale, we assessed overall carnivore visitation using logistic regression. Our analyses confirmed the expected pattern of a depauparate fauna on the communal rangelands compared to the freehold rangelands. Additionally, the species that were not detected on communal sites were the larger-bodied carnivores. By modelling these rare visits as a Poisson process we illustrate a method of inferring whether or not such patterns are because of local extinction of species or are simply a result of low sample effort. Our Namibian case study indicates that these field methods and analyses can detect meaningful differences in the carnivore communities brought about by anthropogenic influences.

AB The nitrous oxide emissions were measured at three tundra sites and one snowpack on the Fildes Peninsula in the maritime Antarctic in the summertime of 2002. The average fluxes at two normal tundra sites were 1.1 +/- 2.2 and 0.6 +/- 1.7 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The average flux from tundra soil site with penguin dropping addition was 3.7 +/- 2.0 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), 3-6 times those from the normal tundra soils, suggesting that the deposition of fresh droppings enhanced N2O emissions during penguin breeding period. The summer precipitation had an important effect on N2O emissions; the flux decreased when heavy precipitation occurred. The diurnal cycle of the N2O fluxes from Antarctic tundra soils was not obtained due to local fluky weather conditions. The N2O fluxes through four snowpack sites were obtained by the vertical N2O concentration gradient and their average fluxes were 0.94, 1.36, 0.81 and 0.85 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The tundra soils under snowpack emitted N2O in the maritime Antarctic and increased local atmospheric N2O concentrations, therefore these fluxes could constitute an important part of the annual N2O budget for Antarctic tundra ecosystem.

AB The montane rain forest in Chiapas, Mexico has been subject to continuous human disturbance. mainly by wood extraction, cattle grazing and fire. To address the effect of this kind of disturbance regime on regeneration, survival and growth of naturally established tree seedlings were evaluated during a 3-yr period in three forest stands which varied in frequency and intensity of human disturbance. Frequency of cattle browsing on transplanted seedlings of Cornus disc flora, Liquidambar styraciflua and Oreopanax xalapensis planted on different facing slopes was evaluated over all 18-mo period, their survival and growth was also determined. The density of seedlings, number of species and Survival of naturally recruited tree seedlings decreased with increased intensity of disturbance. Only seedlings of Pinus and Quercus species were recorded in heavily disturbed conditions. Seedlings grew more vigorously under moderately disturbed than in undisturbed or heavily disturbed conditions. More extreme microclimatic variation (air temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation) was recorded in heavily vs moderately disturbed forest. survival and growth of transplanted tree seedlings differed with species. Grazing damage varied among seedlings located oil different facing slopes. Plants located oil NE facing slopes survived better than those oil other slope positions. The mean proportion of surviving individuals of L. styraciflua (80%) and C. disc flora (78%) was higher than those for O. xalapensis (60%). A higher number of C. disc flora and O. xalapensis seedlings were grazed than L. styraciflua in any slope orientation treatment. The results suggest that human disturbance negatively affects natural recruitment, reduces richness of tree seedlings and favours a small number of tree species.

AB Branchipus schaefteri and Streptocephalus torvicornis commonly co-occur in ephemeral ponds throughout the Mediterranean Region. We compared survivorship, growth, and reproduction. Our results show statistically significant differences in all three parameters under laboratory conditions at 25degreesC, reflecting different life history strategies between these species. Branchipus schaefferi grows quickly to 18 mm body length, producing roughly 1700 cysts during an average lifespan of 24 days, while S. torvicornis lives an average of 120 days (length 24 mm), laying 2400 cysts. This suggests that S. torvicornis is better adapted to deep longer-lived pools, whereas B. schaefferi may survive in small, more ephemeral pools as formed from spring melt water and autumn rains. While the lifespan is equal for both sexes in B. schaefferi, the males of S. torvicornis live 2.8 times longer than females (325 days versus 114) compelled into a long postreproductive period by lack of females in their environment.

AB An altitudinal survey of correspondences between fruiting phenologies of fleshy-fruited tree species and seasonal dynamics of frugivorous birds on Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo was carried out for 50 weeks across four vegetation types: a hill forest (800 in asl), a lower montane forest (1700 in), an upper montane forest (2000-3000 m) and a subalpine forest (3000-3500 m). In the hill forest, a large fruiting peak following the general flowering phenomenon was observed during October-November in 1996 and a fruitless period was observed during February-April in 1997. During the fruitless period, the number of resident frugivorous birds decreased. A bimodal fruiting pattern was observed in the lower montane forest. A large number of frugivorous temperate migrants were observed when the fruiting peak occurred. The number of resident frugivorous birds increased and several lowland bird species were observed, when the number of resident birds decreased in the hill forest. In the upper montane forest and the subalpine forest, more continuous and irregular fruiting patterns without outstanding peaks were observed and the number of resident frugivorous birds was more stable throughout the year. These suggested (1) there was a strong relationship between fruiting seasonality and seasonal dynamics of temperate migrants in the lower montane forest; (2) seasonal altitudinal movements of lowland bird species to montane vegetation might occur during the fruitless period in the lowland forest; and (3) the continuous fruiting pattern in the higher vegetation zones might be related to the scarcity of available frugivorous birds. The hypothesis that the influx of temperate migrants into the montane vegetation of Mt. Kinabalu is affected by density and habits of resident frugivorous birds is supported. Montane vegetation in Borneo plays an important role as temporal refugia for temperate and altitudinal migrants by supplying fruit resources.

AB This study focuses on plant species richness, taxonomic diversity, and endemism of the Sinai peninsula as a whole and Saint Catherine area in particular. Beta diversity was also measured using beta(T) to represent the biotic change between different landforms in the St. Catherine area. The peninsula supports about 1285 species including the infraspecific taxa of which about 800 species (also including the infraspecific taxa) are recorded in the southern Sinai south of El-Tih Desert. The present study reveals that southern Sinai is more diverse as compared with the Sinai peninsula as a whole. Southern Sinai also supports more than the expected numbers of rare and very rare species (about 62%) and about 4.3% endemic species. Beta diversity between different landforms in the St. Catherine area reflect a large biotic change between slopes and terraces on the one hand and between terraces and ridges on the other. Finally, the study recommends appropriate management of the peninsula and more research for the management requirements of the numerous endemic and rare species in the Sinai peninsula.

AB Small-scale movements of animals with respect to microhabitat can have important consequences for a species and its interactions with resources and other members of the local assemblage. Patterns of movement of animals in relation to habitat are: sometimes predicted using their patterns of distribution with respect to it. Gastropods (Bembicium auratum (Quoy and Gaimard)) are found in association with fragmented patches of oysters (Saccostrea commercialis) on sheltered rocky shores and in mangrove forests in central NSW. This paper reports an experimental test of models of movement of Bembicium based on its patterns of distribution with respect to oysters. The experiment was replicated at sites on rocky shores and in mangrove forests. On rocky shores, patterns of dispersal of juvenile Bembicium were as predicted by the models based on patterns of distribution. It was not possible to predict patterns of dispersal of adults using such models. Patterns of dispersal in mangrove forests were very different from those on rocky shores, despite similar patterns of distribution. These results suggest that models predicting patterns of movement of Bembicium auratum must incorporate information about the ages of the animals, the arrangement of microhabitat and the habitat they occupy. It is also clear that models based on patterns of distribution of animals will not always be effective in predicting patterns of movement into and out of patches of habitat and that the extrapolation of models from one habitat to another should be attempted with caution.

AB Fourteen phyllopod (Branchiopoda: Crustacea) species were collected from numerous temporary pools in north-eastern Natal, South Africa. Physical and chemical data for 10 pools, and results for hourly (over 41 hours) and 3-day interval (throughout periods when phyllopods were present) monitoring of 3 study pools are presented. Comparisons were made with other pools with phyllopods in Africa. The data reveal the broad tolerance to variation and extremes in both physical and chemical conditions in African temporary waterbodies. Species diversity appears to be related to pool size and vegetation. Phyllopod distribution does not follow a pattern associated with physical and chemical conditions.

AB Canopy-forming macroalgae can construct extensive meadow habitats in tropical seascapes occupied by fishes that span a diversity of taxa, life-history stages and ecological roles. Our synthesis assessed whether these tropical macroalgal habitats have unique fish assemblages, provide fish nurseries and support local fisheries. We also applied a meta-analysis of independent surveys across 23 tropical reef locations in 11 countries to examine how macroalgal canopy condition is related to the abundance of macroalgal-associated fishes. Over 627 fish species were documented in tropical macroalgal meadows, with 218 of these taxa exhibiting higher local abundance within this habitat (cf. nearby coral reef) during at least one life-history stage. Major overlap (40%-43%) in local fish species richness among macroalgal and seagrass or coral reef habitats suggest macroalgal meadows may provide an important habitat refuge. Moreover, the prominence of juvenile fishes suggests macroalgal meadows facilitate the triphasic life cycle of many fishes occupying diverse tropical seascapes. Correlations between macroalgal canopy structure and juvenile abundance suggests macroalgal habitat condition can influence levels of replenishment in tropical fish populations, including the majority of macroalgal-associated fishes that are targeted by commercial, subsistence or recreational fisheries. While many macroalgal-associated fishery species are of minor commercial value, their local importance for food and livelihood security can be substantial (e.g. up to 60% of landings in Kenyan reef fisheries). Given that macroalgal canopy condition can vary substantially with sea temperature, there is a high likelihood that climate change will impact macroalgal-associated fish and fisheries.

AB Large vertebrates affect fire regimes in several ways: by consuming plant matter that would otherwise accumulate as fuel; by controlling and varying the density of vegetation; and by engineering the soil and litter layer. These processes can regulate the frequency, intensity and extent of fire. The evidence for these effects is strongest in environments with intermediate rainfall, warm temperatures and graminoid-dominated ground vegetation. Probably, extinction of Quaternary megafauna triggered increased biomass burning in many such environments. Recent and continuing declines of large vertebrates are likely to be significant contributors to changes in fire regimes and vegetation that are currently being experienced in many parts of the world. To date, rewilding projects that aim to restore large herbivores have paid little attention to the value of large animals in moderating fire regimes. Rewilding potentially offers a powerful tool for managing the risks of wildfire and its impacts on natural and human values.

AB Premise of research. Phenotypic traits that consistently mediate species' responses to environmental variation (functional traits) provide a promising approach toward generalizing ecological and evolutionary patterns and thereby gaining insights into the processes generating them. In the plant functional ecology literature, most trait-based studies have focused on traits mediating either resource competition or responses to variation in the abiotic environment, while traits mediating reproductive interactions have often been neglected.
   Methodology. Here, I discuss the value of herkogamy, the spatial separation of male and female functions in flowers, as a functional trait in plant reproductive biology and review the evidence relevant to the hypothesis that taxa exhibiting greater herkogamy have historically experienced more reliable pollination and more outcrossed mating systems.
   Pivotal results. A large body of work in the field of plant reproductive biology has identified a set of nearly ubiquitous correlations between average herkogamy and features of plant mating systems, notably, autofertility (seed set in the absence of pollinators) and outcrossing rate. Herkogamy often varies extensively among populations and species, and the adaptive interpretation is that herkogamy exhibits local adaptation to the reliability of the pollination environment.
   Conclusions. These results underline the value of herkogamy as a functional trait representing variation in mating histories. Many important insights are likely to emerge from studies leveraging herkogamy as an easily measured proxy of plant mating systems, as already demonstrated in comparative studies and studies of reproductive interactions. Greater consideration of herkogamy and other reproductive-function traits in studies of species coexistence may provide a more complete understanding of community assembly processes.

AB Climate change models project shifts in precipitation patterns at regional and global scales. Increases in dry areas and the occurrence of drought predicted in future scenarios are likely to threaten grassland ecosystems. Calcareous grassland seed banks have proven to be resistant to short-term drought, but their responses to long-term drought are unknown. Here we show that 14 years of summer drought changed calcareous grassland seed bank composition, reducing its size and richness, and that these responses do not simply reflect patterns in the above-ground vegetation. Moreover, the effect of drought was larger on seed banks than on vegetation, and above-ground responses mediated by soil depth were less evident in the seed bank than in the vegetation. These results demonstrate that the severity of drought effects on calcareous grasslands is larger than previously thought, and show that this ecosystem is highly vulnerable and has low resilience to predicted decreases in soil moisture.

AB Bush encroachment and alien plant invasions alter the composition and/or balance of species in natural ecosystems and impact biodiversity, land productivity and water availability. Therefore, the appropriate control and management of bush encroachment and alien plant invasions can restore ecosystems services and enhance the provision of timber and non-timber products to society. To understand the economics of land impacted by bush encroachment and alien plant invasions, we valued a selected number of ecosystem services from landscape restoration in South Africa and Namibia. In Namibia, the estimated value of ecosystem services from the restoration of bush encroachment was US$5.8 billion. In South Africa, the estimated value of ecosystem services from the restoration of bush encroachment was US$2.1 billion, and US$6.6 billion from the restoration of alien plant invasions. The most valued ecosystem service benefit assessed was water, followed by timber products and wood-fuels such as biomass to electricity, and then grazing. The value of these ecosystem services are considerable compared to the direct costs involved to clear invasive alien plants and control bush encroachment. This clearly illustrates that the management of invasive alien plants and bush encroachment can deliver significant ecosystem services benefits whose value outweighs the costs of restoration.

AB The introduction of alien plants can influence biodiversity and ecosystems. However, its consequences for soil microbial communities remain poorly understood. We addressed the impact of alien ectomycorrhizal (EcM) pines on local arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities in two regions with contrasting biogeographic histories: in South Africa, where no native EcM plant species are present; and in Argentina, where EcM trees occur naturally. The effect of alien pines on AM fungal communities differed between these regions. In South Africa, plantations of alien EcM pines exhibited lower AM fungal richness and significantly altered community composition, compared with native fynbos. In Argentina, the richness and composition of local AM fungal communities were similar in plantations of alien EcM pines and native forest. However, the presence of alien pines resulted in slight changes to the phylogenetic structure of root AM fungal communities in both regions. In pine clearcut areas in South Africa, the richness and composition of AM fungal communities were intermediate between the native fynbos and the alien pine plantation, which is consistent with natural regeneration of former AM fungal communities following pine removal. We conclude that the response of local AM fungal communities to alien EcM pines differs between biogeographic regions with different histories of species coexistence.

AB A strategy is devised for the conversion of cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) into fluorescently labeled probes involving the synthesis of CNF-based macroinitiators that initiate radical polymerilation of methyl acrylate and acrylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester producing a graft block copolymer modified CNF. Finally, a luminescent probe (Lucifer yellow derivative) was labeled onto the modified CNF through an amidation reaction. The surface modification steps were :verified with solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) confirmed the successful labeling of the CNF; the CNF have a hydrodynamic radius of about 700 nm with an average number of dye molecules per fibril of at least 6600. The modified CNF was also imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Luminescent CNF proved to be viable biomarkers and allow for fluorescence-based optical detection of CNF uptake and distribution in organisms such as crustaceans. The luminescent CNF were exposed to live juvenile daphnids and microscopy analysis revealed the presence of the luminescent CNF all over D. magna's alimentary canal tissues without any toxicity effect leading to the death of the specimen.

AB Accelerating rates of biodiversity loss have led ecologists to explore the effects of species richness on ecosystem functioning and the flow of ecosystem services. One explanation of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning lies in the spatial insurance hypothesis, which centers on the idea that productivity and stability increase with biodiversity in a temporally varying, spatially heterogeneous environment. However, there has been little work on the impact of dispersal where environmental risks are more or less spatially correlated, or where dispersal rates are variable. In this paper, we extend the original Loreau model to consider stochastic temporal variation in resource availability, which we refer to as "environmental risk", and heterogeneity in species dispersal rates. We find that asynchronies across communities and species provide community-level stabilizing effects on productivity, despite varying levels of species richness. Although intermediate dispersal rates play a role in mitigating risk, they are less effective in insuring productivity against global (metacommunity-level) than local (individual community-level) risks. These results are particularly interesting given the emergence of global sources of risk such as climate change or the closer integration of world markets. Our results offer deeper insights into the Loreau model and new perspectives on the effectiveness of spatial insurance in the face of environmental risks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lions, Panthera leo, and leopards, Panthera pardus, coexist in space and compete for resources. Although direct killing of leopards by lions has been recorded, avoidance behaviour is an important part of leopard ecology that is difficult to measure through direct observation. Using tracking data from simultaneously collared lions and leopards, we investigated the effect of lion proximity on the behavioural ecology of leopards. We show that proximity to lions influenced leopard habitat use, transition probability and behaviour. Within enclosed habitats, lions were allowed to get closer to leopards before leopards engaged in a flight response. Visual observation data suggest that lions and leopards infrequently come into direct contact. However, tracking data indicate that avoidance was based on relative habitat cover and detectability, and as a result the two species were often located within close proximity. Finding new signals of interaction and avoidance within two well-studied predators with relatively small sample sizes suggests that this approach may have value to other systems, such as predator/prey interactions, or relationships between sympatric species, and at a scale hitherto not possible. This could be used to investigate the costs and benefits of animal foraging where competitive exclusion may occur, and is relevant for the large number of animals that are difficult to observe.

AB It is widely assumed that floral diversification occurs by adaptive shifts between pollination niches. In contrast to specialized flowers, identifying pollination niches of generalist flowers is a challenge. Consequently, how generalist pollination niches evolve is largely unknown. We apply tools from network theory and comparative methods to investigate the evolution of pollination niches among generalist species belonging to the genus Erysimum. These species have similar flowers. We found that the studied species may be grouped in several multidimensional niches separated not by a shift of pollinators, but instead by quantitative variation in the relative abundance of pollinator functional groups. These pollination niches did not vary in generalization degree; we did not find any evolutionary trend toward specialization within the studied clade. Furthermore, the evolution of pollination niche fitted to a Brownian motion model without phylogenetic signal, and was characterized by frequent events of niche convergences and divergences. We presume that the evolution of Erysimum pollination niches has occurred mostly by recurrent shifts between slightly different generalized pollinator assemblages varying spatially as a mosaic and without any change in specialization degree. Most changes in pollination niches do not prompt floral divergence, a reason why adaptation to pollinators is uncommon in generalist plants.

AB Biocultural diversity has been conceptualised as the sum of the world's differences regarding biological diversity at all levels and cultural diversity in all its manifestations, and their interactions. The concept is often framed in the context of conservation as a retention versus loss model by emphasizing the religious and spiritual values of the natural environment and the positive interactions between traditional indigenous people and conservation of natural ecosystems and indigenous species. On the basis of our research amongst the 'non-traditional' amaXhosa in South Africa, we argue that this interpretation is too narrow and that the concept needs to be reappraised in order to capture the dynamic, complex and relational nature of biocultural diversity relations. We conclude that the concept involves a complex of human values and practices related to the three main dimensions of biodiversity at landscapes, species and genetic levels. It is not only related to the conservation of wild species in culturally venerated natural ecosystems, but also to human creativity in creating hybrid nature-culture systems, including the incorporation of biodiversity in the human domain through the creation of human-modified landscape elements and agro-biodiversity. The biocultural values and practices are subject to various dynamics in relation to socioeconomic change. Some lose their importance as a result of modernization, but others endure even in urban conditions.

AB Salvia is the largest genus in Lamiaceae and it has recently been found to be non-monophyletic. Molecular data on Old World Salvia are largely lacking. In this study, we present data concerning Salvia in Africa. The focus is on the colonization of the continent, character evolution and the switch of pollination systems in the genus.
   Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference were used for phylogenetic reconstruction. Analyses were based on two nuclear markers [internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and external transcribed spacer (ETS)] and one plastid marker (rpl32-trnL). Sequence data were generated for 41 of the 62 African taxa (66 %). Mesquite was used to reconstruct ancestral character states for distribution, life form, calyx shape, stamen type and pollination syndrome.
   Salvia in Africa is non-monophyletic. Each of the five major regions in Africa, except Madagascar, was colonized at least twice, and floristic links between North African, south-west Asian and European species are strongly supported. The large radiation in Sub-Saharan Africa (23 species) can be traced back to dispersal from North Africa via East Africa to the Cape Region. Adaptation to bird pollination in southern Africa and Madagascar reflects parallel evolution.
   The phenotypic diversity in African Salvia is associated with repeated introductions to the continent. Many important evolutionary processes, such as colonization, adaptation, parallelism and character transformation, are reflected in this comparatively small group. The data presented in this study can help to understand the evolution of Salvia sensu lato and other large genera.

AB QuestionHow does the interaction between silicon (Si) and vegetation affect local and global ecological processes, higher levels of ecological organization, and terrestrial- and watershed-scale Si fluxes?
   LocationWe selected several ecosystems throughout the world, from river headwaters to estuaries, being examples of (i) terrestrial vegetation, (ii) aquatic and floodplain vegetation, and (iii) tidal wetland vegetation.
   MethodsWe provide examples of the importance of linking Si use by terrestrial and aquatic vegetation, to larger-scale Si flux consequences towards and through rivers. Cross-disciplinary studies achieve the best understanding of vegetation effects on the global Si cycle, and the role of Si as a plant functional trait.
   ConclusionSi use by plants has not always received the research attention of other elements. Yet, today the importance of Si for plant functioning is slowly becoming better understood. Silicon is a crucial element for many plant species, being important for decomposition processes, plant competitiveness and stress tolerance. The inclusion by vegetation scientists of Si uptake as a plant functional trait is important to assess links between plant physiology, plant distribution and plant tolerance to environmental changes, but also to understand the role of vegetation on Si fluxes through the watershed. However, lack of knowledge regarding the biological control of the Si cycle hinders accurate quantification. Only a concerted effort bringing scientists together from a broad array of disciplines will provide this new direction for research on vegetation-Si cycling.

AB Introduced tree species are increasingly being considered for use in production forestry due to production targets, and demand for a diversity of wood products. However, prior to expanding their use, active consideration needs to be given to the breadth of potential ecological consequences associated with each introduced tree species. Ecological consequences include the invasion and modification of sensitive ecosystems, changes in habitat provision for native taxa, altered risk of pest and pathogen outbreaks, and hybridization with native con-generics. Here we review the scientific literature to assess the potential ecological consequences from expanding the use of introduced tree species within Swedish forestry. We use an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate ecological risks, and our assessment is based on the scenario that a proportion of Norway spruce (Picea abies) monocultures in southern Sweden will be replaced by monocultures of Sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), hybrid aspen (Populus tremula tremuloides), or hybrid larch (Larix eurolepis/L. marschlinsii). Our results highlight that univariate consideration of the ecological consequences of exotic tree species can be highly misleading, due to the complex suite of costs, benefits, risks and uncertainties that each tree species brings to the region of introduction. We discuss our results in relation to conflicting management goals, and the lack of reversibility of some adverse ecological outcomes. We also highlight the need for assessments of ecological risk to facilitate evidence-based decision making by stakeholders. Our results provide a foundation for adaptive management programs aiming to limit the extent to which introduced tree species used in production forestry are accompanied by adverse ecological impacts.

ID ECOLOGY
AB Community food production in the form of home gardening, community gardening, school gardening, and urban farming continues to increase in popularity in many parts of the world. This interest has led to public and private investment in community food production and increased need for urban agricultural planning as a way to manage growth and prioritize resource allocation. Municipal planning and thoughtful institutional support for the practice will require program evaluation and greater attention to the spatial composition and configuration of this widely dispersed practice. This article explores the results of community-supported landscape socio-ecological research in Madison, WI (USA) to assess the spatial and social dynamics of community food production. Results indicate that community food production resources are unevenly distributed across the study area. Historic community garden placement does appear to be consistent with community prioritization which dictates placing resources in areas with low median household income. However, home garden presence and recent community garden placement both occur in areas of higher than average median household income. Specific focus is placed on how an understanding of landscape placement and pattern has helped inform attempts to meet municipal and regional objectives in addressing urban food insecurity.

AB Topsoil removed during linear infrastructure construction is one of the most valuable resources for the ecological restoration of roadslopes, as it contains high concentrations of micro-organisms, nutrients and seeds. During construction work, topsoil is stockpiled in a way that can harm seed germination and survival capacity. In order to assess the effects of topsoil storage time and seed burial depth on seed survival, germination and mortality, an experiment with three replicates was conducted using two factors: time (1-6 months) and burial depth (0, 5, 30 and 50 cm). At each stockpile depth we buried 25 seeds from 10 natural grassland species (5 families) in permeable nylon sachets. Seed mass and seed functional responses to light (LI) and diurnal temperature fluctuations (DTF) were also measured for each species. Seed survival, germination and mortality during stockpiling were analyzed using binomial GLMs. Explanatory variables were family, depth of burial, time, seed mass. LI and DTF responses. Seed survival decreased with storage time but increases with depth. Seed losses were due to seed germination and mortality in the stockpile. Germination percentage increased with time but decreased with burial depth. This parameter was negatively related to LI and DTF. Mortality increased significantly with time and depth and was negatively related to seed mass.
   Results show that there may be a loss of viable seeds in topsoil stockpiles, particularly in the case of large seeds. Our results also underline the functional role of light requirements for germination and the detection of diurnal temperature fluctuations as mechanisms to achieve higher soil seed persistence. The correct management of topsoil is decisive for the restoration of roadslopes. Seed germination potential decrease with time of storage and burial depth, consequently a serious loss of seeds conducts an impoverishing of topsoil, which is the main natural resource for the restoration of these disturbed ecosystems. Viable seed loss is lower in deeper layers of the stockpile, so short-period topsoil storage and bigger stockpiles could reduce seed loss and increase thus the restoration potential of topsoil.

AB Very little attention has been paid to quantifying ammonia (NH3) emissions from Antarctic marine animal excreta. In this paper, penguin guano and ornithogenic soils from four penguin colonies and seal colony soils were collected in coastal Antarctica, and laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate potential NH3 emissions and effects of environmental factors on NH3 fluxes. Ammonia fluxes were extremely low from the frozen samples. Significantly enhanced NH3 emissions were observed following thawing. The mean fluxes were 7.66 +/- 4.33 mg NH3 kg(-1) h(-1) from emperor penguin guano, 1.31 +/- 0.64 mg NH3 kg(-1) h(-1) from Adelie penguin guano and 0.33 +/- 0.39 mg NH3 kg(-1) h(-1) from seal colony soils during the thawing period. Ammonia emissions from penguin guano were higher than those from ornithogenic soils during freezing-thawing cycles (FTCs). The temperature, pH, total nitrogen (TN) and drying-wetting conversion had an important effect on NH3 fluxes. For the first time, we provide a quantitative relationship between NH3 flux and temperature, TN and pH. Our results show that marine animal excreta and ornithogenic soils are significant NH3 emission sources. In coastal Antarctica, FTC-induced NH3 emissions might account for a large proportion of annual flux from marine animal colonies due to high freezing-thawing frequency.

AB This paper evaluates changes in the composition and structure of plant communities and plant functional groups associated with the continuous presence of feral horses in mountain pampean grasslands in Argentina in order to explore the potential effects of horse removal on vegetation restoration. Specific and functional richness, diversity, evenness, spatial heterogeneity and above-ground biomass were compared between areas subjected to ten years of intensive grazing by horses and exclosures of the same age. Forbs, shrubs and rosettes were more abundant after ten years of grazing, while the spatial heterogeneity of perennial grasses was higher in long-term grazed areas. Nevertheless, grasslands showed good recovery after horse removal, with greater species diversity and evenness, higher abundance of perennial grasses, greater above-ground biomass and lower percentages of exotic species. An understanding of the effect of feral animals on plant communities will lead to the design of a strategy of adaptive management and monitoring tools for measuring the condition of grasslands.

AB Desertification can be an irreversible process due to positive feedback among degraded plant and soil dynamics. The recovery of semiarid degraded ecosystems may need human intervention. In restoration practices, the abiotic conditions often need to be improved to overcome the positive plant-soil feedback loops. Using nurse-plants to improve abiotic conditions for introduced individuals (facilitation) has been suggested as an alternative to direct abiotic amelioration. Here, we compared direct abiotic amelioration and facilitation as tools for restoration of semiarid grasslands in Spain. Seedlings and seeds of Lygeum spartum and Salsola vermiculata were planted and sown in a stably degraded semiarid area in Northeast Spain. Two levels of direct abiotic amelioration (ploughing and damming) and indirect abiotic amelioration through facilitation by Suaeda vera nurse shrubs were compared with a control with no amelioration treatment. The control treatment showed low plant establishment, confirming the practical irreversibility of the degraded state. Plant establishment was significantly higher in the three treatments with interventions than in the control treatment. The best treatment depended on the plant trait considered, but damming was in most cases better than plant facilitation. However, facilitation maintained the nutrient-rich topsoil layer. Given the relative success of facilitation, revegetation using the facilitative effect of nurse-plants would, in principle, be recommended for restoring semiarid grasslands. Direct abiotic amelioration would be needed under extreme degradation or harsh climatic conditions.

   Tanzania.
   We compare and contrast the findings of two recent and seemingly conflicting studies on the effectiveness of conservation protection strategies in Tanzania. We evaluate these studies in the context of a wider body of evidence relating to the problem of determining protected area performance.
   We highlight the importance of landscape-scale management approaches for biodiversity conservation; establishing clear management and monitoring objectives in advance; the interrelation between the choice of target species and the appropriate spatial scale over which to measure their fate; and differences between snapshot and longitudinal scales in assessing the effectiveness of conservation strategies.
   Protected area assessments should not promote an isolated focus on particular conservation targets or methods of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies. Instead we argue for a more pluralistic approach to evaluating conservation performance that can help to reveal where potential synergies in tackling different objectives exist, and clarifying the trade-offs when they do not.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the effects of gall induction on leaf phenolic compounds and their indirect effects on the subsequent attack of folivorous insects in Achatocarpus gracilis, Cordia alliodora, Guapira macrocarpa, Guettarda elliptica and Ruprechtia fusca that occur in both hillside and riparian sites at Chamela-Cuixmala tropical dry forest in western Mexico. There are differences in soil water content between riparian and hillside sites where trees in the first are mainly evergreen and deciduous in the second. A few tree species occur in both sites and their intraspecific phenological response is also different between sites. In this case, trees of a given species that occur in riparian sites will be evergreen whereas trees on hillsides of the same species will be deciduous. Four plant species had significantly greater total phenol concentrations in galled than ungalled leaves in both deciduous hillside and riparian sites. In three plant species associated with galls, host total phenol concentrations were significantly greater in short than in tall plants. The frequency and amount of folivore damage were greater in leaves without galls than leaves with galls in these four plant species. These results indicate that galling insect species may directly affect leaf phenolic concentrations and indirectly may affect the incidence and consumption of folivorous insects in tropical plant species. This may have important consequences on the preference of leaves by folivorous insects that might be excluded by galling insect species in this dry tropical system.

AB Wind is suspected to be a primary dispersal mechanism for large branchiopod cysts on the Colorado Plateau. We used a wind tunnel to investigate wind velocities capable of moving pothole sediment and cysts from intact and disturbed surfaces. Material moved in the wind tunnel was trapped in filters; cysts were separated from sediment and counted. Undisturbed sediment moved at velocities as low as 5.9 m s(-1) (12.3 miles h(-1)). A single all-terrain vehicle (ATV) track increased the sediment mass collected 10-fold, with particles moving at a wind velocity of only 4.2 m s(-1) (8.7 miles h(-1)). Cysts were recovered from every wind tunnel trial. Measured wind velocities are representative of low-wind speeds measured near Moab, Utah. Wind can move large numbers of cysts to and from potholes on the Colorado Plateau. Our results indicate that large branchiopod cysts move across pothole basins at low-wind speeds; additional work is needed to establish velocities at which cysts move between potholes.

AB Aerial surveys of wildlife involve a noisy platform carrying one or more observers moving over animals in order to quantify their abundance. This simple-sounding system encapsulates limits to human visual acuity and human concentration, visual attention, salience of target objects within the viewed scene, characteristics of survey platforms and facets of animal behaviours that affect the detection of animals by the airborne observers. These facets are too often ignored in aerial surveys, yet are inherent sources of counting error. Here we briefly review factors limiting the ability of observers to detect animals from aerial platforms in a range of sites, including characteristics of the aircraft, observers and target animals. Some of the previously uninvestigated limitations identified in the review were studied in central and western New South Wales, showing that inaccuracies of human memory and enumeration processes are sources of bias in aerial survey estimates. Standard protocols that minimise or account for the reviewed factors in aerial surveys of wildlife are recommended.

AB Tropical dry evergreen forests (TDEFs) occur as patches along the Coromandel coast of peninsular India. Investigations on plant biodiversity, bioresource values, and conservation status of 75 TDEF sites were carried out. A total of 149 woody plant species representing 102 trees, 47 lianas, and three native herbs were enumerated. Across 75 sites studied, species richness of woody plants ranged from 10 to 69 species. Physiognomically, evergreen species dominated the forest. Forest growth determined as girth increment ranged from 0.37 to 1.08 cm yr(-1) for trees and 0.39 to 0.41 cm yr(-1) for lianas. At the community level, seasonal flowering with unimodal dry season peak and year-round, bimodal fruiting pattern prevailed. A strong association between the qualitative reproductive traits and pollination and dispersal spectrum among the TDEF species has been demonstrated. In bioresource assessment, 150 medicinal plant species, used for treating more than 52 ailments, were documented. Site disturbance scores were obtained by assessing the various site disturbances such as site encroachment, resource extraction, grazing, fragmentation, weed invasion, etc. Conservation significance of the TDEF sites is emphasized in the light of restricted geographical distribution, moderate level of plant species diversity, representation of the unique forest type, high productivity, and bioresource potential. Restoring the disturbed sites with characteristic TDEF species, and revitalizing the cultural traditions associated with sacred groves by promoting awareness of the ecological and bioresource values of TDEFs, are recommended.

AB Question: Invasion of woody species into grasslands is a global phenomenon. This is also topical in semi-natural temperate grasslands that are no longer profitable for agricultural management. Trees and grasses interact through harsh root competition, but below-ground processes have been neglected in the dynamics of semi-natural grasslands. Trees are thought to have a competitive advantage in resource-rich and heterogeneous soils. We tested whether soil resource quantity and heterogeneity differ between paired temperate semi-natural grasslands and forests (former grasslands), and whether this was caused abiotically by varying soil depth or biotically by fine roots.
   Location: Thin-soil calcareous alvar grasslands with overgrown parts (young Pinus sylvestris forests) in W. Estonia.
   Methods: The quantity and spatial heterogeneity of soil resources (moisture and nutrients), soil depth, and root parameters (mass, length and specific length) were measured in 1-m transects of 11 samples in 26 paired grasslands and forests. The quantity and heterogeneity of soil resources were compared between vegetation types and related to soil depth and root parameters.
   Results: Soil resources were lower and more heterogeneous in forests than in grasslands. The invasion of woody species was enhanced abiotically by deeper soil. Root mass was larger in the forests, but root length was longer in the grasslands. Both root mass and specific root length were more heterogeneous in the forests. Forest root length was negatively correlated with transient soil moisture patches and positively correlated with more persistent nutrient-rich patches. No such relationship was found in grasslands.
   Conclusions: Abiotic soil heterogeneity (local deep-soil patches) supports woody species invasion, but the trees themselves also biotically make soils more heterogeneous, which further enhances woody species invasion. Large trees use soil resources patchily, making soils biotically poorer and more heterogeneous in resources. The dynamics of temperate semi-natural grasslands are strongly linked to below-ground ecological processes, and high soil heterogeneity can be both the cause and the outcome of woody species invasion.

AB In this paper, we have examined carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions in two ornithogenic sediment profiles from the Ardley Island and Barton Peninsula of Antarctica for palaeoecological changes during the past 2000 yr. The delta(13)C values of the two sediment profiles range from -22.26 parts per thousand to - 19.15 parts per thousand (PDB) in Core G and from -24.01 parts per thousand to - 19.87 parts per thousand in profile A, showing that the predominant carbon source in the sediments plausibly comes from terrestrial and aquatic plants in Antarctic such as mosses, lichens, and algae in lakes. As these delta(13)C values are also close to those in the fresh lake sediments that are not influenced by penguin guano, one may not use the delta(13)C values as evidence for the influence of guano on the sediments. The delta(15)N values of the two profiles range from 4.75 parts per thousand to 18.34 parts per thousand (air) and from 5.17 parts per thousand to 10.38 parts per thousand for Core G and Core A, respectively. The delta(15)N variations have positive correlations with the trends of the bio-element contents in the sediments. As the levels of these bioelements in ornithogenic sediments had been used to reconstruct the changes of historical penguin population and tundra vegetation abundance and diversity, we then suggest that the delta(15)N records can be utilized to study palaeoecological processes of penguin. Our results show that penguin population and activity has generally decreased over the past 2000 yr. From 1300 to 900 yr BP and from 1790 to 1860 AD, penguin population and activity experienced two strong decreases. It will be interesting to understand the cause of these decreases.

AB Woody colonization of grasslands is often associated with changes in abiotic or biotic conditions or a combination of both. Widely used as fodder and litter in the past traditional agro-pastoral system, ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) has now become a colonizing species of mountain grasslands in the French Pyrenees. Its present distribution is dependent on past human activities and it is locally controlled by propagule pressure and abiotic conditions. However, even when all favourable conditions are met, all the potentially colonizable grasslands are not invaded. We hypothesize that management practices should play a crucial role in the control of ash colonization. From empirical field surveys we have compared the botanical composition of a set of grasslands (present and former) differing in management practices and level of ash colonization. We have displayed a kind of successional gradient positively linked to both ash cover and height but not to the age of trees. We have tested the relationships between ash presence in grassland and management types i.e. cutting and/or grazing, management intensity and some grassland communities' features i.e. total and local specific richness and species heterogeneity. Mixed use (cutting and grazing) is negatively linked to ash presence in grassland whereas grazing alone positively. Mixed use and high grazing intensity are directly preventing ash seedlings establishment, when low grazing intensity is allowing ash seedlings establishment indirectly through herbaceous vegetation neglected by livestock. Our results show the existence of a limit between grasslands with and without established ashes corresponding to a threshold in the intensity of use. Under this threshold, when ash is established, the colonization process seems to become irreversible. Ash possesses the ability of compensatory growth and therefore under a high grazing intensity develops a subterranean vegetative reproduction. However the question remains at which stage of seedling development and grazing intensity these strategies could occur.

AB Knowing the abundance of larger carnivores is critical for their conservation management. However, direct assessment of carnivore numbers is often difficult, expensive and time-consuming, leaving indirect sampling as a valid and feasible alternative. Indirect census techniques have proved to be cost-effective, repeatable and objective. We therefore estimated the numbers of six larger carnivore species in a relatively small area in northern South Africa, comparing three indirect sampling methods based on track counts and measurements: (i) a qualitative approach, whereby individuals were subjectively identified by comparing differences in track measurements; (ii) a quantitative approach using the strong linear correlation of track density with carnivore density found in other studies; and (iii) a quantitative approach applying repeated measures analysis of variance and post-tests to the track measurement data, in order to test statistically for differences in track sets. All three methods provided similar results that appear to be reasonable and which might be an indication of the real number of larger carnivores that occur in the study area. These results support the reliability of indirect estimates of larger carnivore numbers based on tracking data, which is promising for future research and conservation efforts involving these animals.

AB The Phanerozoic has witnessed major changes, with Africa being an integral part of supercontinental landmass agglomeration forming Gondwana, its amalgamation with smaller landmasses to form Pangaea, and later disintegrating to form the existing continents. At the same time climates, atmosphere, oceanic circulation and tectonic plates shifted. During this upheaval, life was evolving and organisms were adapting and with higher diversity came more ecological interactions, creating more habitats and thus influencing more biological radiation. Plants became more complex, developing from unicellular to multicellular organisms.
   Moving from water onto land, plants had to cope with desiccation, and features evolved enabling them to do this. Patterns of Phanerozoic plant evolution are strongly driven by major changes in the physical environment, most notably continental drift, climate change and bolide impacts, precipitating massive volcanism and other effects leading to mass global extinctions. The products of this evolution were early land plants during Silurian and Devonian times. Subjected to extinction events and environmental changes, these early plants gave rise to the pteridophytes reaching their diversity peak during the Carboniferous and Permian. After the demise of the pteridophytes, the gymnosperms dominated during the Triassic and Jurassic, followed by the emergence of the angiosperms in the Cretaceous. This melange of factors has produced the present plant diversity on earth, which we will examine in context of the African flora. Plant diversification in Gondwana and Laurasia will be covered focussing on Africa, while factors affecting the vegetation and species composition of the present flora will be discussed.

AB The flora of North America north of Mexico was used to study rare species at the two extremes of geographic distribution: endemic species, those with large local populations but small geographic ranges, and suffusively rare species, those with small local populations but large geographic ranges. The taxonomic distribution, geographic distribution, and life history characteristics of the two groups were compared. Only 2% of North American species are suffusively rare, while 22.6% of species are endemic to one state or province. Suffusively rare species are significantly more likely to be seedless vascular plants and monocots than expected, and are less likely to be eudicots. Conversely, endemic species are more likely to be eudicots, and less likely to be monocots. Suffusively rare species are most abundant in Canada and the northeastern United States, whereas there are few endemic species in those areas. The highest proportions of endemic species are found in California, Florida, and Texas. Wetland habitats support many suffusively rare species, but few endemic species. Neither are common in alpine habitats. Suffusively rare and endemic species also differ in the dominant growth form. Suffusively rare species are most likely to be herbaceous eudicots, and less likely to be shrubs or shrub-herbs. Endemic species are also likely to be herbaceous, but are also frequently shrubs. A high proportion of endemic species exhibit plasticity in growth form, whereas few suffusively rare species have plastic growth forms. While both groups contain rare species, they differ considerably in geographic distribution and life history traits.

AB The definition of vegetation types at different hierarchical levels, both to study the vegetation processes and for practical cartographic representation, is still considered a critical issue in many circles of plant ecologists. The problems are mainly related to the misleading idea that classification of the vegetation system, as developed by European phytosociologists during the last century within the discipline called syntaxonomy, would imply the assumption of the organismic concept of the plant community. After a short discussion on the role of Braun-Blanquet approach in plant ecology and in landscape ecology, the methods to detect multispecies responses along environmental gradients are briefly reviewed. In the main part of this article, we intend to stress that concepts considered critical, such as plant association and its ecological niche, are just operational tools that have nothing to do with the individualistic or organismic interpretation of plant communities in vegetation studies. Important to our views on vegetation, we believe that plant associations as well as the higher syntaxa can be regarded as fuzzy sets in an operational context for describing vegetation along ecological gradients in synthetic ways and can further the understanding of vegetation variation.

AB With the aim of characterizing tree growth patterns, this paper reexamines the growth data of 100 selected trees belonging to 24 species that were recorded monthly in a 0.2-ha plot of a wet evergreen forest in the Western Chats of India during the period 1980-82 using dendrometer bands. The mean growth profile, combining all of the selected trees, shelved: (a) a significantly lower annual growth rate during the second year of survey which seemed to be negatively related to monsoon precipitation; (b) significant intra-annual growth variation clearly related to the regular alternation between a period of heavy rain and a quite long dry season of the monsoon climatic regime. Analysis of the variability of the individual smoothed growth profiles representing the 2-y trend of the growth data showed that: (a) the mean growth rate depended on a combination of an intrinsic endogenous variable (the structural class grouping species according to their maximum size), a tree size variable (tree diameter at breast height, dbh) and a neighbourhood variable (the number of taller neighbours in a 10-m radius); (b) the sudden change in growth rate from one year to the other was not predictable using these variables. The amplitude of the seasonal variations, investigated from the detrended growth profiles, appeared to be dependent on a combination of tree dbh and the number of taller neighbours in a 10-m radius. A co-inertia analysis of the smoothed and the detrended growth profiles indicated that the trees with fast growth also exhibited high seasonal variation. It is suggested that fast growing trees are those with favourable crown positions, which are consequently subject to high transpiration rates due to radiation and wind exposure.

AB Several alternative explanations have been proposed to account for the evolution of nestling obesity in a variety of avian groups. These predict quite different patterns of fat accumulation, storage and use by chicks of different ages. Yet surprisingly few studies have measured changes in body composition during chick development. We tested the applicability of these hypotheses for fulmars, Fulmarus glacialis, by direct measurement of changes in water, lipid and lean dry mass in growing chicks. Lipid and lean dry mass increased until ca. 70% of the way through chick rearing, but then levelled off. Total body water also increased until the same stage, but gradually declined thereafter, and it was this change rather than fat metabolism that resulted in mass recession. The observed pattern of a continued increase in stored lipid, and most importantly, its maintenance all the way through the mass-recession phase until chicks reach hedging, is incompatible with many of the proposed hypotheses. We suggest that the most likely ultimate explanation for large fat deposits is to fuel chicks during the initial critical period away from the nest site while they learn to forage effectively.

AB Small mammal communities (shrews and rodents) were studied using mark-and-recapture techniques from November 1991 to June 1992 at six sites on the Accra Plains of Ghana. The sites were two traditionally protected 'sacred groves', two plots in the legally protected Shai Hills Resource Reserve, and two fire-protected sites: secondary forest and a Gmelina tree plantation. A total of 241 individuals representing four species of shrews and nine species of rodents was caught. Abundance, diversity, and composition of small mammals varied greatly between sites. Praomys tullbergi was the most abundant species in the sacred groves, whereas Mastomys erythroleucus dominated in the fire-protected site and in the plantation. The more open grassland areas in the Shai Hills were dominated by Lemniscomys striatus and Uranomys ruddi. Shrews were caught only in forests having dense leaf litter. Legally protected reserve sites had the highest diversity of small mammals but population densities were low. In contrast, the sacred groves had lower diversity levels but much higher population densities, resulting in 1.9 to 14.6 times the biomass of any of the other sites. The rodents Mus minutoides and Hylomyscus alleni and the shrews Crocidura buettikoferi and C. lamottei were found only in the sacred groves. Sacred groves play an important socio-cultural role. Their local ecological and economic importance as reservoirs for rare and useful plants is well known. This study shows that they are also important refuges for certain small mammal species and support characteristic mammal communities. An attempt to measure the impact of the invading exotic tree Azadirachta indica (neem tree) on small mammals was inconclusive, although trapping success was low in areas with dense stands of neem.

AB Floristic differences between cattle-grazed and macropod-grazed sites (protected from domestic stock by enclosure within a Holocene lava flow) were examined in Eucalyptus savanna in north Queensland, Australia. While macropod-grazed sites have had a lower incidence of fire than the cattle-grazed sites, it seems probable that grazing impacts per se are the major differences between these treatments. One dominant (Capillipedium parviflorum) and another common (Sehima nervosa) native perennial grass in the macropod-grazed treatment were not recorded within the cattle-grazed treatment. There was generally a lower species richness and Shannon-Weaver diversity of perennial forbs in the cattle-grazed treatment compared to the macropod-grazed treatment. There was higher richness, diversity, and abundance of annual grasses in the cattle-grazed treatment compared to the macropod-grazed treatment. The relative richness of native and exotic species was not significantly affected by cattle grazing.

AB The Cape Peninsula (area:471 km(2)), situated at the south-western extremity of the Cape Floristic Region, has exceptionally high plant species richness (2285 species and infraspecific taxa) and numbers of endemic (90;88 species and two infraspecific) and threatened (141;138 species and three infraspecific) taxa (termed species from here on). This biodiversity is threatened by urban development and the spread of invasive alien plants. Peninsula endemics are concentrated in a few, predominantly species-rich families and these correspond well with endemic-rich families in other areas of the Cape Floristic Region. A high level of similarity exists between families with threatened and families with endemic species. A frequency analysis of the biological traits of both endemic and threatened species shows that low growing, ant-dispersed shrubs are over-represented in both groups. Endemics are most likely to be non-sprouters, but threatened plants do not have a specific post-fire regeneration strategy. Threatened species have higher frequencies of geophytes, sprouters and wind-dispersed species compared to endemic species. Numbers of endemic and threatened species are not randomly distributed with regard to occurrence in vegetation types and patterns are similar for both groups. The habitat and biological profiles of both endemic and threatened species suggest that they are highly vulnerable to extinction as a result of increasing rates of alien plant infestation, urbanization and inappropriate fire regimes.

AB The shape and relative weight of the shell have been shown to vary intraspecifically and interspecifically in a number of species of gastropods, including many different littorinids. These differences give rise to different shell forms in different habitats. In those species which have non-planktotrophic development, differences in shell form among shores have been usually explained in terms of natural selection because exposure to waves supposedly favours light shells with large apertures, while predation by crabs on sheltered shores favours elongated, thick shells with smaller apertures. Differences in shell shape among species found at different heights on the shore have been explained in terms of resistance to desiccation and temperature. Such variables would tend to act on a relatively broad-scale, i.e. causing differences among heights on a shore or among shores. Rates of growth, which might vary at much smaller scales within a shore, have also been shown to affect the shapes of many shells.
   In this study, the shape and relative weight of shells of three species of co-existing littorinids (Littorina unifasciata, Bembicium nanum and Nodilittorina pyramidalis) were measured. These species all have planktotrophic development and they are found on many shores where there is no evidence that they are preyed upon by crabs. Before explanations of shell shape are proposed, it is necessary that patterns of variation, within different parts of a shore and among different shores are clearly documented. These patterns were measured at a number of different spatial scales within and among replicate shores with different amounts of wave exposure. Large and small specimens were included to allow intraspecific comparisons among snails of different sizes found at different heights on the shore. The results showed significant differences among shores in shape and relative weight of shells, but these differences could not be explained by exposure to waves. In addition, snails of different sizes and different species did not show the same patterns although they were collected from the same sites. Importantly, the shell shape of Littorina unifasciata varied significantly among sites at approximately the same height within a shore. These differences could not be clearly correlated with density, mean size nor exposure to waves. The only consistent pattern was a decrease in relative aperture size in specimens living higher on the shore. Models that have commonly been proposed to explain shape and relative weight of shells in other species of gastropods are not adequate to explain the small- and large-scale variation of the measurements described here. It is proposed that any selective advantage of shell morphology and the effects of any variables on the development of shell morphology in these species can only be identified after appropriately designed and replicated field experiments.

AB Simple Summary
   Aiming to cope with the provisions of Aichi Biodiversity Targets, EU Biodiversity Strategy and EU Green Deal, we conducted the first nationwide, phylogenetically informed identification of vascular plant diversity hotspots and endemism centres in Greece. By this, we identified the most important factors that shaped them, and assessed the effectiveness of the Special Areas of Conservation of the Natura 2000 network in safeguarding them. Qualitative and quantitative results are provided and presented in thematic maps and relevant diagrams, highlighting areas of conservation importance, and identifying current protection scheme gaps. Simultaneously, our work contributes to national efforts for drafting Natura 2000 sites Management Plans, as well as to the MAES implementation in Greece.
   Biodiversity hotspots (BH) cover a small fraction of the Earth's surface, yet host numerous endemics. Human-induced biodiversity loss has been increasing worldwide, despite attempts to halt the extinction crisis. There is thus an urgent need to efficiently allocate the available conservation funds in an optimised conservation prioritization scheme. Identifying BH and endemism centres (EC) is therefore a valuable tool in conservation prioritization and planning. Even though Greece is one of the most plant species-rich European countries, few studies have dealt with the identification of BH or EC and none has ever incorporated phylogenetic information or extended to the national scale. Consequently, we are unaware of the extent that Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) of the Natura 2000 network efficiently protect Greek plant diversity. Here, we located for the first time at a national scale and in a phylogenetic framework, the areas serving as BH and EC, and assessed the effectiveness of the Greek SAC in safeguarding them. BH and EC are mainly located near mountainous areas, and in areas supposedly floristically impoverished, such as the central Aegean islands. A critical re-assessment of the Greek SAC might be needed to minimize the extinction risk of the Greek endemics, by focusing the conservation efforts also on the BH and EC that fall outside the established Greek SAC.

AB Plants are the largest biomass component of most terrestrial ecosystems, and litter decomposition is considered the dominant process by which nutrients return to plants. We show that in terrestrial ecosystems, there are three major pathways by which plant biomass is degraded into forms that release nutrients again available to plants: microbial decomposition; vertebrate herbivory; and wildfires. These processes act at different spatial and temporal scales, have different niches, and generates different ecological and evolutionary feedbacks. This holistic view in which microbes, herbivores, and wildfires play a joint role in the functioning of ecosystems contributes to a better understanding of the diversity of mechanisms regulating the biosphere.

AB The South African Cape South Coast is bordered by one of the broadest continental shelves in Africa. The Agulhas Bank, inshore shelf and presently exposed coastal plain make up the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain (PAP), though our area of study extends beyond this limit and as far inland as the first mountain belt. Quaternary sea levels have been significantly lower than at present for -90% of the Pleistocene, exposing a terrestrial ecosystem on what is now the submerged shelf. The presently drowned component makes up 94% of the total area of the PAP. Past work has hypothesised a contrast in character of this submerged landscape when compared to the subaerial environment. Here, we assimilate newly-acquired geophysical and geological datasets to produce geological- and soil maps from the Last Glacial Maximum on a scale of 1:750,000, covering an area of similar to 55,000 km. Three broad geomorphic zones are defined, including the Western section from Cape Agulhas to Cape Infanta, the Central section from Cape Infanta to Knysna and the Eastern section extending eastward of Knysna. We demonstrate that Mesozoic sedimentary deposits crop out near the surface on this current-swept shelf and soils derived from siltstone and shale bedrock are prominent when the coast is up to 64 km distant from the modern shoreline at its maximum point. Beyond this, weathered limestone dominates the substrate sequences on the Agulhas Bank. We show that the submerged landscape was a unique terrestrial environment and that there is no exact modern-day analogue in the region other than a small (similar to 70 km(2)) area located at the edge of the Agulhas Plain near Cape Agulhas, and map major contrasts in the geological, topographic and edaphic nature of the landscape from the onshore to the offshore. The expansion of this plain is coupled with exaggerated floodplains, meandering shallowly incised rivers and wetlands. The submerged shelf is dominated by fertile soils compared to the dissected onshore belt, and extensive calcareous duneflelds extending up to 10 km inland from their associated palaeoshorelines covered much of the emergent shelf. Sedimentary bedforms may have obstructed or slowed drainage as suggested by leached palaeosols and carbonate mixing observed in petrographic thin sections and grain mounts. The data show a low-relief "plains" landscape, which contrasts strongly to the topographically complex contemporary coastal foreland. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Savannas are commonly described as a vegetation type with a grass layer interspersed with a discontinuous tree or shrub layer. On the contrary, forbs, a plant life form that can include any nongraminoid herbaceous vascular plant, are poorly represented in definitions of savannas worldwide. While forbs have been acknowledged as a diverse component of the herbaceous layer in savanna ecosystems and valued for the ecosystem services and functions they provide, they have not been the primary focus in most savanna vegetation studies. We performed a systematic review of scientific literature to establish the extent to which forbs are implicitly or explicitly considered as a discrete vegetation component in savanna research. The overall aims were to summarize knowledge on forb ecology, identify knowledge gaps, and derive new perspectives for savanna research and management with a special focus on arid and semiarid ecosystems in Africa. We synthesize and discuss our findings in the context of different overarching research themes: (a) functional organization and spatial patterning, (b) land degradation and range management, (c) conservation and reserve management, (d) resource use and forage patterning, and (e) germination and recruitment. Our results revealed biases in published research with respect to study origin (country coverage in Africa), climate (more semiarid than arid systems), spatial scale (more local than landscape scale), the level at which responses or resource potential was analyzed (primarily plant functional groups rather than species), and the focus on interactions between life forms (rather seldom between forbs and grasses and/or trees). We conclude that the understanding of African savanna community responses to drivers of global environmental change requires knowledge beyond interactions between trees and grasses only and beyond the plant functional group level. Despite multifaceted evidence of our current understanding of forbs in dry savannas, there appear to be knowledge gaps, specifically in linking drivers of environmental change to forb community responses. We therefore propose that more attention be given to forbs as an additional ecologically important plant life form in the conventional tree-grass paradigm of savannas.

AB Larval dispersal is arguably the most important but least understood demographic process in the sea. The likelihood of a larva dispersing from its birthplace to successfully recruit in another location is the culmination of many intrinsic and extrinsic factors that operate in early life. Empirically estimating the resulting population connectivity has been immensely difficult because of the challenges of studying and quantifying dispersal in the sea. Consequently, most estimates are based on predictions from biophysical models. Although there is a long history of dispersal modelling, there has been no comprehensive review of this literature. We conducted a systematic quantitative review to address the following questions: (1) Is there any bias in the distribution of research effort based on geographical or taxonomic coverage? (2) Are hydrodynamic models resolving ocean circulation at spatial scales (resolution and extent) relevant to the dispersal process under study? (3) Where, when and how many particles are being tracked, and is this effort sufficient to capture the spatiotemporal variability in dispersal? (4) How is biological and/or behavioural complexity incorporated into Lagrangian particle tracking models. (i.e. are key attributes of the dispersal process well captured.)? Our review confirms strong taxonomic and geographic biases in published work to date. We found that computational 'effort' (i.e. model resolution and particle number) has not kept pace with dramatic increases in computer processor speed. We also identified a number of shortcomings in the incorporation of biology, and behaviour specifically into models. Collectively, these findings highlight some important gaps and key areas for improvement of biophysical models that aspire to inform larval dispersal processes. In particular, we suggest the need for greater emphasis on validation of model assumptions, as well as testing of dispersal predictions with empirically derived data.

AB 1. State transitions are changes in ecosystem structure and self-reinforcing feedbacks that are initiated when an exogenous driver variable crosses a threshold. Reversing state transitions is difficult and costly. While some state transitions are relatively rapid, many take years to decades. Outside of theoretical models, very little is known about slower state transitions and how they unfold in time and space.
   2. We quantified changes in spatial variance as a mesic grassland ecosystem shifts to a shrub-dominated state, using long-term experiments and simulations that maintain grasslands with annual fires or initiate a state transition to shrub dominance by decreasing fire frequency.
   3. In the experiments, the susceptibility to state transitions varied substantially in space. In the less frequent fire treatment, some plots became shrub-dominated around year 20 and grass extirpations began in year 25, but a third of the plots were still grass-dominated in year 37. Variable rates of state transition resulted in increasing spatial variance of grass cover over time, whereas shrub cover variance decreased. In the annually burned treatment, grasses remained dominant and the spatial variance of grass cover declined.
   4. In a separate experiment, less frequent fires were maintained for 23 years and then switched to annual fires. The switch to annual fires occurred shortly after grass variance started to increase and a majority of these plots quickly returned to a grass dominated state.
   5. In simulations, spatial variance remained low and average grass cover was high under frequent fires. If fire frequency decreased below a threshold, the ecosystem transitioned to shrubland, with a transient increase in the spatial variance of grass cover during the transition between states.
   6. Synthesis. Spatial variability in the rate and susceptibility to state transitions is indicative of a system with a patchy spatial structure, high spatial heterogeneity and low connectivity between patches. Increases in spatial variance can serve as an indication that some patches have begun a state transition and that management interventions are needed to avoid widespread transitions. This is one of the first empirical examples where altering management after an increase in spatial variance prevented state transitions.

AB When invasive species become integrated within a food web, they may have numerous direct and indirect impacts on the native community by creating novel trophic links, and modifying or disrupting existing ones. Here we discuss these impacts by drawing on examples from freshwater ecosystems, and argue that future research should quantify changes in such trophic interactions (i.e. the links in a food web), rather than simply focusing on traditional measures of diversity or abundance (i.e. the nodes in a food web). We conceptualise the impacts of invaders on trophic links as either direct consumption, indirect trophic effects (e.g. cascading interactions, competition) or indirect nontrophic effects (e.g. behaviour mediated). We then discuss how invader impacts on trophic links are context-dependent, varying with invader traits (e.g. feeding rates), abiotic variables (e.g. temperature, pH) and the traits of the receiving community (e.g. predators or competitors). Co-occurring invasive species and other environmental stressors, such as climate change, will also influence invader impacts on trophic links. Finally, we discuss the available methods to identify new food web interactions following invasion and to quantify how invasive species disrupt existing feeding links. Methods include direct observations in the field, laboratory trials (e.g. to quantify functional responses) and controlled mesocosm experiments to elucidate impacts on food webs. Field studies which use tracer techniques, such as stable isotope analyses, allow diet characterisation of both invaders and interacting native species in the wild. We conclude that invasive species often drastically alter food webs by creating and disrupting trophic links, and future research should be directed particularly towards disentangling the effects of invaders from other environmental stressors.

AB Human-wildlife conflict (HWC), due to competition for shared natural resources between people and wildlife, influences food security of people and the well-being of people and animals. HWC is a major concern in developing countries, affecting people of different socio-economic classes. We conducted a meta-analysis of the occurrence of published scientific reports on HWC globally and South Africa particularly, to identify vulnerable human communities and their farming practices in developing and developed countries, and vulnerable wildlife guilds. We accessed Institute for Scientific Information publications from 1994 to 2015. Local communities (people living contiguous with protected natural areas) and commercial farmers jointly experienced the highest HWC incidences compared to subsistence farmers, possibly due to reporting bias for commercial farmers. Rural people in Africa and Asia experienced conflict with a diversity of mammals, confirming our expectation that developing countries could potentially experience regular encounters with wildlife. South Africa had more HWC cases than developed countries (e.g., in Australia and North America), yet the dichotomy between first world and third world economies in South Africa provides a regional exemplar of global patterns in HWC. Globally, HWC involved mainly mammals and birds, with carnivores and primates as the most high-scale conflict species and thus were a severely persecuted group. Our foundational research provides the first global assessment of HWC and showed that people in developing countries are vulnerable to HWC, perhaps related to reduced protection of livestock and crops against a larger guild of problem mammals. We suggest that a wider range of literature, including governmental and non-governmental publications, be surveyed to contribute to further research in this area of study.

AB Background: Species delimitation in closely related plant taxa can be challenging because (i) reproductive barriers are not always congruent with morphological differentiation, (ii) use of plastid sequences might lead to misinterpretation, (iii) rare species might not be sampled. We revisited molecular-based species delimitation in the African genus Milicia, currently divided into M. regia (West Africa) and M. excelsa (from West to East Africa). We used 435 samples collected in West, Central and East Africa. We genotyped SNP and SSR loci to identify genetic clusters, and sequenced two plastid regions (psbA-trnH, trnC-ycf6) and a nuclear gene (At103) to confirm species' divergence and compare species delimitation methods. We also examined whether ecological niche differentiation was congruent with sampled genetic structure.
   Results: West African M. regia, West African and East African M. excelsa samples constituted three well distinct genetic clusters according to SNPs and SSRs. In Central Africa, two genetic clusters were consistently inferred by both types of markers, while a few scattered samples, sympatric with the preceding clusters but exhibiting leaf traits of M. regia, were grouped with the West African M. regia cluster based on SNPs or formed a distinct cluster based on SSRs. SSR results were confirmed by sequence data from the nuclear region At103 which revealed three distinct 'Fields For Recombination' corresponding to (i) West African M. regia, (ii) Central African samples with leaf traits of M. regia, and (iii) all M. excelsa samples. None of the plastid sequences provide indication of distinct clades of the three species-like units. Niche modelling techniques yielded a significant correlation between niche overlap and genetic distance.
   Conclusions: Our genetic data suggest that three species of Milicia could be recognized. It is surprising that the occurrence of two species in Central Africa was not reported for this well-known timber tree. Globally, our work highlights the importance of collecting samples in a systematic way and the need for combining different nuclear markers when dealing with species complexes. Recognizing cryptic species is particularly crucial for economically exploited species because some hidden taxa might actually be endangered as they are merged with more abundant species.

AB The proliferation of woody plants has been observed on rangelands globally and has significant impacts on subsistence livestock production. However, adaptation strategies to such environmental changes remain largely unexamined. This paper investigates pastoralists' adaptations to such environmental changes in the Borana zone of southern Ethiopia by integrating pastoralists' ecological knowledge, surveys of plant species composition, and census data on livestock holdings. The results indicated that a proliferation of woody plants and corresponding decline in herbaceous species would have negative impact on forage values for cattle and sheep, whereas goats would remain relatively unaffected, and camels would benefit. While census data showed declines in household herd size from 2000 to 2014, pastoralists have been adapting to the proliferation of woody plants by doubling their goat holdings, and wealthier households are investing in camels. These changes in livestock holdings based on indigenous ecological knowledge will mitigate the negative impacts of vegetation shifts on livestock production, and facilitate adaptive environmental management in the pastoral systems.

AB The concept of a stock of fish as a management unit has been around for well over a hundred years, and this has formed the basis for fisheries science. Methods for delimiting stocks have advanced considerably over recent years, including genetic, telemetric, tagging, geochemical and phenotypic information. In parallel with these developments, concepts in population ecology such as meta-population dynamics and connectivity have advanced. The pragmatic view of stocks has always accepted some mixing during spawning, feeding and/or larval drift. Here we consider the mismatch between ecological connectivity of a matrix of populations typically focussed on demographic measurements, and genetic connectivity of populations that focus on genetic exchange detected using modern molecular approaches. We suggest that from an ecological-connectivity perspective populations can be delimited as management units if there is limited exchange during recruitment or via migration in most years. From a genetic-connectivity perspective such limited exchange can maintain panmixia. We use case-studies of species endangered by overexploitation and/or habitat degradation to show how current methods of stock delimitation can help in managing populations and in conservation.

AB AimPalaeoendemics are clades that are ancient but geographically restricted, often because they have been selected against in other areas. Ecological similarities among palaeoendemics may be indicators of ancient environments. We determine the environmental ranges of the remarkable palaeoendemic plants of Tasmania to deduce whether they indicate the long-term persistence of particular environmental conditions.
   LocationTasmania, Australia, a global centre of plant palaeoendemism, containing some of the world's most relictual plant lineages.
   MethodsPalaeoendemic clades in Tasmania were identified using a scoring system of clade age divided by the square root of the number of 10kmx10km grid cells occupied globally. Total palaeoendemism scores for 1199 30 grid cells were calculated by summing scores for individual clades, and modelled against climate, topography, geology and vegetation type using Random Forest models. Palaeoendemic and non-palaeoendemic species richness in climate space was measured. The global distribution of climates favoured by palaeoendemics was assessed.
   ResultsTwenty-nine phylogenetically and ecologically diverse palaeoendemic clades (51 species) were identified. High levels of palaeoendemism occurred widely in western Tasmania, but the highest scoring areas were at or slightly above the tree line in relatively undisturbed vegetation. Palaeoendemism scores were strongly predicted by constantly moist climates lacking extreme temperatures, and by open vegetation types with rare or no fire. The palaeoendemics occupied a climate space that is globally rare and very different from that of non-palaeoendemics.
   Main conclusionsThese patterns suggest the persistence since the Cretaceous of open vegetation in constantly moist areas with equable temperatures and few or no fires. This conclusion is consistent with an increasing body of fossil and phylogenetic evidence for the antiquity of open vegetation. The methods here produce quantitative values of palaeoendemism that can be compared among regions.

AB The southern Cape of South Africa hosts a remarkably rich Middle Stone Age (MSA) archaeological record. Many of the associated caves and rock shelters are coastal sites, which contain evidence for varied occupational intensity and marine resource use, along with signs of notable landscape, environmental, and ecological change. Here, we review and synthesize evidence for Quaternary landscape and climatic change of relevance to the southern Cape MSA. We seek to highlight the available data of most relevance to the analysis and interpretation of the region's archaeological record, as well as critical data that are lacking. The southern Cape MSA occupation spans the full range of glacial-interglacial conditions (i.e., 170-55 ka). It witnessed marked changes in coastal landscape dynamics, which although driven largely by global eustatic sea level changes, were modulated by local-scale, often inherited, geological constraints. These prevent simple extrapolations and generalizations concerning paleolandscape change. Such changes, including pulses of coastal dune activity, will have directly influenced resource availability around the region's archaeological sites. Evidence for paleoclimatic change is apparent, but it is scarce and difficult to interpret. It is likely, however that due to the same diversity of rainfall sources influencing the region today, compared to parts of the continental interior, the southern Cape climate was relatively equable throughout the last 150 kyr. The region's paleoecology, particularly in relation to the coastal plains exposed during sea level lowstands, is a key element missing in attempts to synthesize and model the resources available to occupants of this region. Technology, settlement, and subsistence probably changed in response to these paleoclimate/landscape adjustments, but improvements in baseline archaeological and paleoenvironmental data are required to strengthen models of ecosystem variation and human behavioral response through the MSA.

AB Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) has become an important tool in promoting environmental and ecological sustainability as well as improving community access to eco-system services. However, CBNRM has been criticised as a programme that is largely driven by initiatives which are exogenous to local communities, promoting the agenda of external actors. In view of this, there is now increased attention given to CBNRM programmes that are co-management driven and which seek the participation of all community stakeholders. Using existing literature and field-based data, this article explores the role of social capital in promoting the management of common pool resources in tribal areas of KwaZulu-Natal. It is argued that social capital can be a vehicle through which the accumulation of different forms of capital can be achieved and contribute to sustainable environmental management.

AB Despite its importance to biodiversity and ecosystem function, patterns and drivers of regional scale variation in forest structure and development are poorly understood. We characterize structural variation, create a hierarchical classification of forest structure, and develop an empirically based framework for conceptualizing structural development from 11,091 plots across 25 million ha of all ownerships in Oregon, Washington, and inland Northern California, USA. A single component related to live tree biomass accounted for almost half of the variation in a principal components analysis of structural attributes, but components related to live tree density and size, dead wood, and understory vegetation together accounted for as much additional variation. These results indicate that structural development is more complex than a monotonic accumulation of live biomass as other components may act independently or emerge at multiple points during development. The classification revealed the diversity of structural conditions expressed at all levels of live biomass depending on the timing and relative importance of a variety of ecological processes (e.g., mortality) in different vegetation zones. Low live biomass structural types (<25 Mg/ha) illustrated the diversity of early-seral conditions and differed primarily in density of live trees and abundance of snags and dead wood. Moderate live biomass structural types (25-99 Mg/ha) differed in tree size and density and generally lacked dead wood, but some structurally diverse types associated with partial stand-replacing disturbance had abundant live and dead legacies. High live biomass structural types (> 100 Mg/ha) substantiated the diversity of later developmental stages and exhibited considerable variation in the abundance of dead wood and density of big trees. Most structural types corresponded with previously described stages of development, but others associated with protracted early development, woodland/savannah transitions, and partial stand-replacing disturbance lacked analogs and indicated alternative pathways of development. We propose a conceptual framework that distinguishes among families of pathways depending on the range of variation along different components of structure, the relative importance of different disturbances, and complexity of pathways. Our framework is a starting point for developing more comprehensive models of structural development that apply to a wider variety of vegetation zones differing in environment and disturbance regimes.

AB Differences among plant species in visitation rate and seed set within a community may be explained both by the species' floral traits and the community context. Additionally, the importance of species' floral traits vs. community context on visitation rate and seed set may vary among communities. In communities where the pollinator-to-flower ratio is low, floral traits may be more important than community context, as pollinators may have the opportunity to be choosier when visiting plant species. In this study we investigated whether species' floral traits (flower shape, size and number, and flowering duration) and community context (conspecific and heterospecific flower density, and pollinator abundance) could explain among-species variation in visitation rate and seed set. For this, we used data on 47 plant species from two Norwegian plant communities differing in pollinator-to-flower ratio. Differences among species in visitation rate and seed set within a community could be explained by similar variables as those explaining visitation rate and seed set within species. As expected, we found floral traits to be more important than community context in the community with a lower pollinator-to-flower ratio; whereas in the community with a higher pollinator-to-flower ratio, community context played a bigger role. Our study gives significant insights into the relative importance of floral traits on species' visitation rate and seed set, and contributes to our understanding of the role of the community context on the fitness of plant species.

AB The net effect of heavy grazing and land degradation on plant diversity and richness is insufficiently understood for incorporation in national biodiversity assessments. A study was undertaken to determine the effects of heavy grazing primarily on richness of vascular plant species across the arid and semi-arid rangeland biomes of South Africa. Major grazing contrasts were systematically identified for sampling in rangelands of Succulent Karoo, Nama-Karoo, Thicket, Grassland, Kalahari dune savanna and Mopane savanna. The related parameters of species diversity, evenness and turnover were also examined and analysed at the whole site level. The study represents a new site-level comparison of earlier individual studies that also necessitated recalculation and standardization of original data, where appropriate. Impacts of heavy grazing on plant species richness were found to vary from negligible or slightly positive to distinctly negative, depending on site. The sharp reductions in richness may have been associated with special secondary conditions that can occur in arid areas. Species diversity did not track species richness well and was often dominated by species evenness patterns. Moderate to substantial turnover of species occurred, even with negligible change in species richness. Species turnover was largely associated with replacement of species, except on one site where turnover was more evenly split between its replacement and nestedness components. Heavy grazing altered species composition on all study sites, usually with reduced grazing quality and favouring annual plants. Surprisingly few of the replacement species on most of the study areas were alien or exotic. Remarkably, the magnitude of change in.species richness across the limited rainfall gradient of the study often greatly exceeded changes associated with the heavy grazing levels at each site. Use of the significant non-linear relationship found between loss of plant canopy cover through grazing and the relative decline in species richness needs further exploration. (C) 2013 SAAB.

AB Understanding the factors that determine altitudinal distribution of species is very important to evaluate the influence of global change. Although climate is the major driver of vegetation distribution, other factors, such as herbivory by livestock, can be more important locally and regionally. Despite its importance, the altitudinal range distribution of species and how it is influenced by climate and livestock are generally unknown. In the Sierras Grandes Mountains of central Argentina, woodlands of lower and upper altitudes are interrupted by an intermediate vegetation belt devoid of forest. Traditionally, this pattern was assumed to be determined by climate, although recent studies suggest that forest distribution would be driven by livestock grazing. However, the potential altitudinal range distribution of the principal woody species of these forests and how it is affected by livestock are still poorly known. In this study, we used an experimental approach to evaluate seedling survival and growth - with and without livestock presence of the three principal woody species of the mountain woodlands along the entire altitudinal gradient of Sierras Grandes. In January 2009, we planted seedlings of Polylepis australis, Maytenus boaria and Escallonia cordobensis inside and outside livestock exclosures at seven altitudinal sites established every 200-400 m asl, from 940 m asl to 2700 m asl (i.e., maximum altitude of Sierras Grandes). During the three following winters, we evaluated seedling survival and height and measured stocking rates. Although the three species were able to sprout after browsing, livestock markedly reduced seedling survival and height. Inside the exclosure, the three species successfully survived and grew along the entire gradient, including the altitudinal belt devoid of forest. Furthermore, after three growing seasons P. australis and E. cordobensis flowered inside the exclosure at the altitudes where seedlings reach greater heights (2200 m asl and 1200 and 1600 m asl, respectively). We suggest that under the current high stocking rates, livestock would strongly hinder seedling establishment of the three principal woody species at most altitudes of Sierras Grandes. Our findings are in agreement with the assumption that the present altitudinal belt devoid of forest is not climatically driven; rather, livestock is the major factor of current forest distribution.

AB Understanding how cooperative interactions evolve and persist remains a central challenge in biology. Many mutualisms are thought to be maintained by "partner fidelity feedback,'' in which each partner bases their investment on the benefits they receive. Yet, we know little about how benefits change as mutualists vary their investment, which is critical to understanding the balance between mutualism and antagonism in any given partnership. Using an obligate ant-plant mutualism, we manipulated the density of symbiotic acacia ants (Crematogaster mimosae) and examined how the costs and benefits to Acacia drepanolobium trees scaled with ant abundance. Benefits of ants to plants saturated with increasing ant abundance for protection from branch browsing by elephants and attack by branch galling midges, while varying linearly for protection from cerambycid beetles. In addition, the risk of catastrophic whole-tree herbivory by elephants was highest for trees with very low ant abundance. However, there was no relationship between ant abundance and herbivory by leaf-feeding invertebrates, nor by vertebrate browsers such as giraffe, steinbuck, and Grant's gazelle. Ant abundance did not significantly influence rates of branch growth on acacias, but there was a significant negative relationship between ant abundance and the number of fruits produced by host plants, suggesting that maintaining high-density ant colonies is costly. Because benefits to plants largely saturated with increasing colony size, while costs to plant reproduction increased, we suggest that ant colonies may achieve abundances that are higher than optimal for host plants. Our results highlight the conflicts of interest inherent in many mutualisms, and demonstrate the value of examining the shape of curves relating costs and benefits within these globally important interactions.

AB We characterised the historical fire regime (1900-2010) in eastern coastal fynbos shrublands, which occur in a poorly studied part of the Cape Floral Kingdom (CFK). Natural (lightning-ignited) fires dominated the fire regime. Fire seasonality decreased from west (Outeniqua region) to east (Tsitsikamma region) within the study area, and between the study area and further west in the CFK. This is consistent with a west-east climatic gradient in the CFK, where rainfall is concentrated in winter in the west, and evenly distributed across months in the east. Median fire return intervals (FRIs) (1980-2010) were broadly comparable to other fynbos areas but estimates varied widely depending on whether or not the data were censored (16-26 years with and 8-13 years without censoring). FRIs appeared to be shorter in the Tsitsikamma, where rainfall and plant growth rates are higher, than in the Outeniqua. The total area burnt annually has increased significantly since 1980, coinciding with an increase in weather conducive to fires, suggesting that fire regimes may be responding to climate change. Frequent recurrence of very large fires and the virtual absence of vegetation in older post-fire age classes are potential causes for concern in achieving fynbos conservation objectives.

AB Policy development can fail when organisations tasked with managing contentious species for different outcomes are at odds. Buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L. syn. Pennisetum ciliare L. Link) has been planted worldwide and is a valuable pasture grass but it is contentious because of its environmental impacts. Due to this contention, government agencies in Australia have been reticent about developing policy for sustainable management of buffel grass. We developed a workshop procedure in which representatives of government and non-government organisations with an interest in buffel grass could discuss impacts and management of the plant in a non-adversarial setting. Orientation of the organisations ranged from a strong pastoral production focus to a strong conservation management focus. Workshops were run in four contrasting regions, which differed in climate, predominant land use and pastoral dependence on buffel grass. The results showed that, perhaps unexpectedly, diverse organisational stakeholders had similar perceptions of the positive and negative impacts of buffel grass on production and conservation, despite differences in their orientation, and there were differences amongst regions. Objectives for managing buffel grass on conservation reserves and on grazing lands of low conservation value were also generally agreed, and the tools appropriate to the objectives were largely uncontroversial although they varied regionally. The main contention was in regard to management objectives for grazing land of high conservation value. We suggest that there is sufficient common ground amongst organisations to initiate policy development for sustainable management of buffel grass in Australia, provided the process is responsive to the needs of stakeholders and to regional differences in environmental, social and economic potential. We also suggest that this process can be a model for reducing contention over other invasive but commercially valuable species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Road traffic is one of the most pervasive forms of anthropogenic disturbance, but its impact on pollination, a potentially sensitive ecosystem process, has not been investigated. Such an assessment is needed in order to evaluate the potential for roadside verges to act as biodiversity refugia and corridors in otherwise transformed landscapes. Here, we document the impact of a two-lane tar road on pollination by birds in the Cape fynbos of South Africa. To do so, we developed a quick and widely applicable method of determining pollination rates in bird-pollinated members of the large genus Erica. Experiments with caged birds showed that the status of the anther ring (broken/perfect) indicated a sunbird visit with 92% accuracy, while field surveys confirmed anther ring status also serves as a proxy for pollen receipt to stigmas. Using this technique we determined pollination rate in Erica perspicua at three distances from the road (0-10, 20-30 and 40-50 m). After controlling for flower colour, robbing rate and plant density, significantly fewer anther rings were disturbed in close proximity to the road. The documented twofold decline in pollination along roadsides could have important implications for the way we view and manage road verges as refugia for species and ecological processes.

AB Transportation of forestry materials results in unintended co-introduction of nonnative species that may cause enormous ecological or economic damage. While the invasion ecology of plants and animals is relatively well-known, that of microorganisms, except aboveground pathogens, remains poorly understood.
   This work addresses host shifts and invasion potential of root symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi that were co-introduced with Australian eucalypts and planted in clear-cut miombo woodlands in Zambia, south-central Africa.
   By use of rDNA and plastid intron sequence analysis for identification and phylogenetic techniques for inferring fungal origin, we demonstrated that host shifts were uncommon in the Australian fungi, but frequent in the African fungi, especially in mixed plantations where roots of different trees intermingle.
   There was evidence for naturalization, but not for invasion by Australian ectomycorrhizal fungi. Nevertheless, the fungi introduced may pose an invasion risk along with further adaptation to local soil environment and host trees. Inoculation of eucalypts with native edible fungi may ameliorate the potential invasion risks of introduced fungi and provide an alternative source of nutrition.

AB Indices of taxonomic abundance are commonly used by zooarchaeologists to examine resource intensification, overexploitation and gender-divisions in foraging labor. The original formulation of abundance indices developed a clear interpretive framework by linking the measure with foraging models from behavioral ecology. However, using the same basic tenets of behavioral ecology, archaeologists disagree about how to interpret variability in abundance index values: some suggest that high proportions of large prey remains represent higher overall foraging efficiency, while others argue the opposite. To help solve this problem, we use quantitative observational data with Martu hunters in Australia's Western Desert to examine how foraging decisions and outcomes best predict variation in the abundance index values that result. We show that variation in the proportional remains of large to small game is best predicted by hunting bout success with larger prey and the time spent foraging for smaller prey. A declining abundance index results from decreasing hunting success with larger prey, increasing time invested in hunting smaller prey, or both; any of which result in a lower overall return rate than if large prey were acquired reliably. We also demonstrate that where large prey acquisition is stochastic, high index values are correlated positively with men's proportional caloric contribution of large unreliable game, while low index values are correlated with women's proportional foraging time for small reliable game. We discuss these results with reference to evidence of resource intensification and gender-specific foraging. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB P>1. Globally, temperate grasslands have been heavily modified by agricultural intensification. The ecological integrity of many remaining semi-natural grasslands is further threatened by the encroachment of invasive alien woody plant species, such as conifers.
   2. Although the ecological impact of conifers is often inferred to be directly related to increasing conifer density at invaded sites, interpretation of these density-dependent effects on native biodiversity is almost always confounded by strong correlations between density and time since invasion. Here, we isolate the direct effects of exotic conifer density on native invertebrate assemblages from the confounding effects due to time since invasion, by establishing replicated experimental plantings of the invasive Pinus nigra (densities of 400, 800, 1600, 2500 and 3500 trees per ha, established in 1993) in New Zealand.
   3. From the 29 549 invertebrates captured, the relative abundance of major classes and orders was largely unaffected by conifer invasion at densities below 800 trees per ha at age 14 years, but differed substantially in higher-density conifer stands (canopy cover > 50%). At the species level, beetle species composition was highly sensitive to conifer invasion at densities as low as 400 trees per ha at age 14 years. Changes in beetle species composition were correlated with reduced soil moisture, increases in canopy cover, and trap distance from the nearest semi-natural grassland.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The effects of exotic conifer invasion on grassland invertebrate assemblages were strongly dependent on conifer density. In our study, the negative effects of conifer invasion on biodiversity were comparatively low at densities below < 800 trees per ha at 14 years after invasion. To conserve invertebrate diversity in semi-natural grasslands we recommend a dual focus of conservation actions targeting: (i) immediate control, or thinning, of high density conifer infestations (> 800 trees per ha) to restore habitat to a state suitable for grassland species, and (ii) longer-term removal of sparse, pre-coning infestations in order to prevent further spread. We propose the use of canopy cover as a proxy for the confounded relationship between conifer density and time since invasion.

AB Wormlion larvae are found in substrates consisting of fine sand or powder, implying that they may be able to distinguish between different substrates according to particle size. To estimate the effects of particle size on wormlions, the pit-building decision of the larvae of the wormlion Vermileo vermileo was observed in four substrates consisting of different sand fractions. Wormlion larvae prefer the finest sand fraction with particle size <= 230 mu m. When wormlions (Vermileo vermileo) and antlions (Euroleon nostras) are placed in the same container with two different substrates, interspecific predation does not occur. In two-substrate choice tests larvae of the two species show opposite preferences for two substrates offered. While wormlion larvae readily build pits in the finest sand fraction (<= 230 mu m), antlion larvae prefer coarser sand (with particle size 230-540 mu m). Wormlion preference for the finest sands and powders, and antlion preference for sands of medium particle size was confirmed by field observations. Sand particle size affects the spatial distribution of sand-dwelling insect larvae and thus may reduce conflicts between heterosp ecifics.

AB 1. Understanding whether Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can be considered as a suitable tool for restoring the structure and function of populations and assemblages is urgently needed to achieve an effective policy of mitigation of human impact in coastal management. However, to date, the role played by MPAs in enhancing ecosystems resilience has been more advocated than unambiguously documented.
   2. This study was designed to test whether full protection in marine reserves facilitates recovery of benthos impacted by the date mussel Lithophaga lithophaga fishery, one of the most harmful human activities affecting subtidal rocky habitats in the Mediterranean Sea.
   3. The effects of this destructive fishery were reproduced at one fully protected location (P) and at two unprotected control locations (Cs) in the SW Mediterranean Sea. At each location, three plots (4 m(2)) of rocky surface at 4-6 m depth were disturbed experimentally, while another three plots served as reference. In each plot, the species composition and relative cover of the sessile benthic assemblages were sampled photographically on each of five occasions during a period of 20 months.
   4. Over and above variation in habitat features among locations, multivariate and univariate analyses revealed significant differences between P-vs.-Cs in patterns of assemblage recovery and showed that, at the fully protected location, recovery was faster than at the unprotected control locations.
   5. Our results suggest that MPAs have the potential to change the trajectories of recovery of disturbed assemblages by accelerating the processes of recolonization and call for further investigation to identify the specific mechanisms underlying increased resilience.

AB The comparison of precision is often advocated for the selection of an appropriate census and/or monitoring method for wildlife, but little attention is generally paid to their cost effectiveness, a crucial criterion given budgetary and logistical constraints. We present six direct count methods conducted in a communal area of the Zambezi Valley, Zimbabwe, and compare them in terms of (1) effort and cost to survey an area (sampling efficiency), and (2) efficiency in data collection (detection efficiency). Methods ranged from c.US$0.2 to over US$6.0/km(2) and needed from 0.1 to 5.0 human-h/km(2). The comparison of efficiencies showed the advantages of simple ground methods: foot counts and particularly bicycle counts appear well adapted to the ecological and human context of our study. The relative benefits and constraints of the different methods are discussed in the context of a community-based wildlife management programme.

AB Patterns of larval dispersal influence the structure of marine biological communities, but many aspects of larval dispersal remain poorly understood. For example, much of our present understanding of larval dispersal is based on models that integrate aspects of physical oceanography and larval biology, but the predictions of those models are generally not tested because we lack the methodology for real-time larval tracking. In the present study, we used both modeled and measured data to track an introduced larval cohort essentially from fertilization to presumed settlement. Larvae of the hard clam Mercenaria were released into a labeled water parcel in the Banana River Lagoon, Florida, within 8.5 h of nursery production and then were tracked for the duration of their estimated 8-d pelagic life span. Comparisons of modeled versus measured larval distribution indicate that the fate of the larvae as predicted by a tracer model and by the concentration of coincidentally released sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) did not agree with the fate of the larvae as predicted by the path of subsurface drifters and by a particle trajectory model. Thus, modeled predictions of larval dispersal must be interpreted with care. Additionally, one component of larval dispersal that was observed in the study but that was not accounted for in the model was the spread of larvae along the path of advection. That trail of larvae may have important consequences for patterns of recruitment and resultant community structure, but it is not considered in most treatments of larval dispersal.

AB Vitellaria paradoxa leafing, flowering and fruiting patterns were monitored in Otuke county ( Lira district), northern Uganda, over a period of 25 months. The monitoring revealed that leaf shedding takes place in the middle of the dry season and the trees are in full leaf by the onset of the wet season. New leaves continue to appear on the new shoots while old leaves persist during the leaf-fall period. The pattern of leafing and leaf loss, flowering and fruiting are unimodal with major peaks in flowering and fruiting, although in the study area rainfall is bimodal. Flowering was concentrated in months when the atmospheric relative humidity begins to rise from an initially low value ( around November), peaks three months later and usually ends when rainy conditions persist. Flowers produced during the rainy season usually abort. Fruiting starts at the end of the dry season (December/January) and peaks from February to April. Seed matures during the rainy season ( March to May) and fruit harvesting occurs mainly from May to August, when the soil is well supplied with plant available water but coinciding with high pre-growing season famine risk in the community.

AB Trade-offs associated with maintaining herbivory resistance and herbivory tolerance are frequently inferred in plant life histories. Invasive success for many non-native plants is often attributed to novel resistance that repels native herbivores. Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum, Euphorbiaceae) is a non-native invader that threatens ecosystems throughout the southeastern United States, including imperiled coastal prairie regions. Low herbivore loads due to costly resistance are generally assumed to give Sapium a competitive advantage over native plants. We predicted that if Sapium experienced higher damage levels it would show significant decreases in growth and reduced ability to compete with native prairie vegetation. We conducted full-factorial, paired greenhouse and field experiments designed to assess the effects of simulated leaf herbivory on Sapium growth in the presence of prairie vegetation at different levels of light and nitrogen. Contrary to our expectations, neither low-intensity, chronic defoliation nor high-intensity, acute defoliation negatively affected Sapium seedlings in any resource combination in either experiment. These studies reveal that Sapium possesses considerable phenotypic plasticity, and herbivory tolerance is a newly appreciated trait that likely contributes to its invasive potential.

AB Crustacean zooplankton was sampled extensively from the River Meuse between 1993 and 1998. The spatio-temporal aspects of their dynamics were examined in relation to the primary forcing factor: hydrology. A time-series obtained at a fixed sampling station revealed a strong dependence of development on discharge patterns, as expected, despite large interannual variability in the recorded maximal densities. Benthic cladocerans were most sensitive to rises in discharge. On the longitudinal plane, much higher densities were recorded in downstream reaches of the river, over distances too short for the necessary number of generations to develop at the generally accepted rates of growth. Short-lived peaks in abundance of large planktonic cladocerans were also recorded downstream, at a well-defined time of the year. These observations suggest that hydrology is not always accountable for all the variations observed, and that the combination of supplementary zooplankton inputs, internal production and trophic effects should also be invoked. In the case of copepods, for the most part represented by cyclopoids, the hypothesis of resident populations is proposed to account for seemingly unrealistic rises in density.

AB Competition and its effects are difficult to demonstrate, as they vary depending on the species present and the environmental conditions in each community. We conducted laboratory and field experiments to evaluate the effects of intra- and interspecific interactions on the use of food resources and behavior of the sea stars Leptasterias polaris and Asterias vulgaris, 2 major predators in subtidal communities of the northern Gulf of St. Lawrence, We demonstrate interference (encounter) competition between the two. For both species, the presence of the other (as detected by both contact and chemical signals) decreased feeding activity and provoked behavioral changes (avoidance, decrease in percentage feeding). These effects were reversible and short-lived, and were more pronounced when there was a shortage of food and when sea stars were exposed to simulated attacks by the other species (involving pedicellarial pinching). L. polaris seemed to be the inferior competitor as (1) it switched to less profitable prey size (smaller mussels, Mytilus edulis) when A. vulgaris was present, and (2) it avoided A. vulgaris and reduced its feeding activity when food was scarce, The dominance of A. vulgaris is possibly attenuated at our study site (near its northern distributional limit) by the reduction of its fitness when water temperatures are low (most of the year) and during the winter when it migrates to deeper water, Competition for food resources seems to occur periodically (mainly summer), in localized areas (patches and beds of mussels) or when sea stars form dense aggregations in which they are likely to interact frequently, Interactions, and thus the chance of competition, are less likely at greater depths. Coexistence seems to be permitted by both the attenuation of the dominance of A. vulgaris and by the great variations in how L. polaris and A. vulgaris interact (strongly affected by variations in prey availability, sea star abundance, and in the patterns of prey use by both sea stars).

AB To determine the relationship between vegetation and environmental parameters in a desert-savanna ecotone, vegetation in the Naukluft Mountains of Namibia (southern Africa) was described and analysed in terms of environmental parameters determining the observed patterns. 12 plant communities, largely characterized by low shrubs, were described on the basis of a classification. Through ordination altitude, clay, potassium content of the substrate and, to a lesser extent, habitats were identified as underlying environmental factors determining the composition of these plant communities. The edaphic parameters showed some correlation with subsurface geology, but microclimatic conditions, water availability and level of disturbance appeared to override the effect of nutrient composition provided by different substrate.
   Communities of conservation importance, such as plant communities composed of Karoo shrubs, are prevalent on the mountain plateau, presenting an isolated outpost of Nama Karoo vegetation. The transitional status between desert and savanna, remnant patches of Nama Karoo and the high habitat diversity mark the importance of this high altitude area for biodiversity conservation.

AB Grazing control has been reported to be effective for the control of desertification in semi-arid regions. However, economic reasons often make complete inhibition of grazing (complete exclosure) difficult to carry out. Grazing control has been applied to the Kerqin Sandy Lands, Inner Mongolia, China, by means of seasonal exclosure, whereby grazing is allowed from November to Apt-ii. The harvesting of hay is also allowed once during September - October. The aim of the reported study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this seasonal exclosure on vegetation restoration. Species compositional data were obtained from 356 quadrats and ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). Ordination indicated that landform was the most important factor influencing the species composition of the vegetation. Regardless of landform and type of grazing control, however, vegetation coverage, vegetation height and species richness were higher at sites where grazing had been controlled, than at sites lacking any control. Perennial species were dominant at the former while annual species were dominant at the latter. Both shrub and toe species were quits rare at the sites where seasonal exclosure had been carried out. It is concluded that seasonal exclosure is sufficient to restore and maintain grassland vegetation in and around the study area. When shrubby or tree vegetation is needed for reasons such as fixing sands or preventing sand dune remobilization, complete exclosure is recommended.

AB The low intertidal on rocky shores in the Transkei region of southern Africa is characterized by extensive turfs of coralline algae. These turfs are punctuated by small gaps maintained by patellid limpets. Recolonization of macroalgae in experimentally cleared gaps of different sizes (0.5, 0.125 and 0.03 m2) was monitored over 1 yr in an initial experiment and then repeated and monitored over a 2 yr period. All quadrats were rapidly recolonized by a green/brown algal component, consisting of Ralfsia spp., Ulva spp., Enteromorpha spp. and Iyengaria sp. Although this component remained dominant there was some growth of coralline algae (Arthrocardia spp. and Jania spp.). Rate of recolonization was directly related to gap size, with the smallest gaps remaining relatively free of algae, and the largest showing greatest recovery after 12 mo. Even after 24 mo, however, the total algal cover was only between 10 and 50 % of that in undisturbed control quadrats. Grazer density (Patella longicosta, P. oculus, Oxystele tabularis) was highest in small gaps and there was a direct relationship between the number of grazers and the ratio of bare rock to algae. A model of the interactions between grazers and algae is discussed in terms of human exploitation of patellid limpets and the implications of this for low-shore community structure.

AB Pollination is thought to be under positive density-dependence, destabilising plant coexistence by conferring fitness disadvantages to rare species. Such disadvantage is exacerbated by interspecific competition but can be mitigated by facilitation and intraspecific competition. However, pollinator scarcity should enhance intraspecific plant competition and impose disadvantage on common over rare species (negative density-dependence, NDD). We assessed pollination proxies (visitation rate, pollen receipt, pollen tubes) in a generalised plant community and related them to conspecific and heterospecific density, expecting NDD and interspecific facilitation due to the natural pollinator scarcity. Contrary to usual expectations, all proxies indicated strong intraspecific competition for common plants. Moreover interspecific facilitation prevailed and was stronger for rare than for common plants. Both NDD and interspecific facilitation were modulated by specialisation, floral display and pollinator group. The combination of intraspecific competition and interspecific facilitation fosters plant coexistence, suggesting that pollination can be a niche axis maintaining plant diversity.

AB Tropical savannas comprise mixed woodland grassland ecosystems in which trees and grasses compete for water resources thereby maintaining the spatial structuring of this ecosystem. A global change in rainfall climatology may impact the structure of tropical savanna ecosystems by favouring woody plants, relative to herbaceous vegetation. Here we analysed satellite data and observed a relatively higher increase in woody vegetation (5%) as compared to the increase in annual maximum leaf area index (LAI(max), an indicator of the total green vegetation production) (3%) in arid and semi-arid savannas over recent decades. We further observed a declining sensitivity of LAI(max) to annual rainfall over 56% of the tropical savannas, spatially overlapping with areas of increased woody cover and altered rainfall climatology. This suggests a climate-induced shift in the coexistence of woody and herbaceous vegetation in savanna ecosystems, possibly caused by altered hydrological conditions with significance for land cover and associated biophysical effects such as surface albedo and evapotranspiration.

AB 1. How do many species coexist within a trophic level? Resource niches are the classical answer, but in plants which share a small set of abiotic resources, the possibilities for resource partitioning are limited. One possible explanation is that plant species have different pollination niches, with each species specialized to a subset of the available animal species. If this pollinator partitioning results in negative frequency dependence such that each plant species' reproduction is reduced when it becomes abundant, pollination niches could maintain plant diversity, provided that the strength of negative frequency dependence is sufficient to overcome fitness inequalities between species.
   2. We tested this idea by quantifying the effect of species relative abundance on pollinator visitation rate in a 7,000 m(2) plot of South African Fynbos vegetation. In addition, we quantified the effect of intraspecific abundance variation at a smaller spatial scale (9 m(2) plots), documented species' pollination niches, and tested the importance of pollinators for seed set in a subset of the plant species.
   3. We found that visitation rate indeed declined sharply across the 33 plant species with increasing abundance, but visitation rate was also somewhat depressed in very rare species such that the resulting relationship between visitation rate and relative abundance was hump-shaped. Pollinator niche partitioning among plant species was evident, but less pronounced than in many other studies. Visitation rate was slightly higher in more generalized species, suggesting that they have access to a larger pollination resource. At the intraspecific level and smaller spatial scale, results were less clear and varied among species. Pollinators enhanced seed set in most species.
   4. Synthesis. The results imply that, above an abundance threshold, intraspecific competition for pollination could limit the reproduction of common species, thus promoting plant species coexistence. However, the rarest plant species could become extinct due to pollen limitation, that is, an Allee effect. In addition, interactions with pollinators may introduce frequency-independent fitness differences between plant species, thereby increasing the strength of negative frequency dependence required for stable coexistence. These findings shed new light on the role of the pollination niche in plant coexistence.

TI Corruption and Wildlife Trafficking: Three Case Studies Involving Asia

ID IVORY
AB As wildlife trafficking or the illegal wildlife trade has taken a more prominent place on the global agenda, discussions are taking place as to how wildlife trafficking happens. An increased understanding has revealed that corruption is a key facilitator of this profitable and pervasive global black market, but limited research has explored exactly what that corruption looks like and how corruption enables wildlife to be trafficked. Furthermore, research shows that Asia, particularly China and Southeast Asia, are focal points for the supply and demand of certain species of wildlife. Through a literature-based investigation, this paper unpacks the role specific acts of corruption play in the trafficking of ivory, reptile skins and live reptiles from, through or to Asia. It is proposed that not only do individual corrupt acts enable wildlife trafficking to happen, but also that corrupted structures (the criminal justice system, and economic and political foundations) in some societies enable trafficking to happen and also increase the resilience of trafficking to reduction measures. In collating detailed data about the forms of corruption facilitating wildlife trafficking, the gaps in knowledge, and therefore the important areas for further research, become evident.

AB Background. A number of biotic and abiotic factors have been proposed as drivers of geographic variation in species richness. As biotic elements, inter-specific interactions are the most widely recognized. Among abiotic factors, in particular for plants, climate and topographic variables as well as their historical variation have been correlated with species richness and endemism. In this study, we determine the extent to which the species richness and endemism of monocot geophyte species in Mesoamerica is predicted by current climate, historical climate stability and topography.
   Methods. Using approximately 2,650 occurrence points representing 507 geophyte taxa, species richness (SR) and weighted endemism (WE) were estimated at a geographic scale using grids of 0.5 x 0.5 decimal degrees resolution using Mexico as the geographic extent. SR and WE were also estimated using species distributions inferred from ecological niche modeling for species with at least five spatially unique occurrence points. Current climate, current to Last Glacial Maximum temperature, precipitation stability and topographic features were used as predictor variables on multiple spatial regression analyses (i.e., spatial autoregressive models, SAR) using the estimates of SR and WE as response variables. The standardized coefficients of the predictor variables that were significant in the regression models were utilized to understand the observed patterns of species richness and endemism.
   Results. Our estimates of SR and WE based on direct occurrence data and distribution modeling generally yielded similar results, though estimates based on ecological niche modeling indicated broader distribution areas for SR and WE than when species richness was directly estimated using georeferenced coordinates. The SR and WE of monocot geophytes were highest along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, in both cases with higher levels in the central area of this mountain chain. Richness and endemism were also elevated in the southern regions of the Sierra Madre Oriental and Occidental mountain ranges, and in the Tehuacan Valley. Some areas of the Sierra Madre del Sur and Sierra Madre Oriental had high levels of WE, though they are not the areas with the highest SR. The spatial regressions suggest that SR is mostly influenced by current climate, whereas endemism is mainly affected by topography and precipitation stability.
   Conclusions. Both methods (direct occurrence data and ecological niche modeling) used to estimate SR and WE in this study yielded similar results and detected a key area that should be considered in plant conservation strategies: the central region of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Our results also corroborated that species richness is more closely correlated with current climate factors while endemism is related to differences in topography and to changes in precipitation levels compared to the LGM climatic conditions.

AB Conifers, which are widely planted as fast growing tree crops, are invading forested and treeless environments across the globe, causing important changes in biodiversity. However, how small-scale impacts on plant diversity differ according to pine size and habitat context remains unclear. We assessed the effects of different stages of pine invasion on plant communities in forest and steppe sites located in southern Chile. In each site, we sampled plant diversity under and outside the canopy of Pinus contorta individuals, using paired plots. We assessed the relative impact of pine invasion on plant species richness and cover. In both sites, richness and cover beneath pine canopy decreased with increasing pine size (i.e. height and canopy area). A significant negative impact of pines on species richness and plant cover was detected for pines over 4 m in height. The impact of pines on plant richness and cover depended on pine size (i.e. canopy area) and habitat type. Larger pines had more negative impacts than smaller pines in both sites, with a greater impact for a given pine size in the Patagonian steppe compared to the A. araucaria forest. Species composition changed between under and outside canopy plots when pines were 4 m or taller. Pine presence reduced cover of most species. The impacts of pine invasions are becoming evident in forested and treeless ecosystems of southern Chile. Our results suggest that the magnitude of pine invasion impacts could be related to how adapted the invaded community is to tree cover, with the treeless environment more impacted by the invasion.

AB Although the co-occurrence of nonnative vertebrates is a ubiquitous global phenomenon, the study of interactions between invaders is poorly represented in the literature. Limited understanding of the interactions between co-occurring vertebrates can be problematic for predicting how the removal of only one invasive-a common management scenario-will affect native communities. We suggest a trophic food web framework for predicting the effects of single-species management on native biodiversity. We used a literature search and meta-analysis to assess current understanding of how the removal of one invasive vertebrate affects native biodiversity relative to when two invasives are present. The majority of studies focused on the removal of carnivores, mainly within aquatic systems, which highlights a critical knowledge gap in our understanding of co-occurring invasive vertebrates. We found that removal of one invasive vertebrate caused a significant negative effect on native species compared to when two invasive vertebrates were present. These unexpected results could arise because of the positioning and hierarchy of the co-occurring invasives in the food web (e.g., carnivore-carnivore or carnivore-herbivore). We consider that there are important knowledge gaps to determinate the effects of multiple co-existing invaders on native ecosystems, and this information could be precious for management.

AB The seasonality of solar irradiance and precipitation may regulate seasonal variations in tropical forests carbon cycling. Controversy remains over their importance as drivers of seasonal dynamics of net primary productivity in tropical forests. We use ground data from nine lowland Amazonian forest plots collected over 3 years to quantify the monthly primary productivity (NPP) of leaves, reproductive material, woody material, and fine roots over an annual cycle. We distinguish between forests that do not experience substantial seasonal moisture stress ("humid sites") and forests that experience a stronger dry season ("dry sites"). We find that forests from both precipitation regimes maximize leaf NPP over the drier season, with a peak in production in August at both humid (mean 0.39 +/- 0.03 MgC ha(-1) month(-1) in July, n = 4) and dry sites (mean 0.49 +/- 0.03 Mg C ha(-1) month(-1) in September, n = 8). We identify two distinct seasonal carbon allocation patterns (the allocation of NPP to a specific organ such as wood leaves or fine roots divided by total NPP). The forests monitored in the present study show evidence of either (i) constant allocation to roots and a seasonal trade-off between leaf and woody material or (ii) constant allocation to wood and a seasonal trade-off between roots and leaves. Finally, we find strong evidence of synchronized flowering at the end of the dry season in both precipitation regimes. Flower production reaches a maximum of 0.047 +/- 0.013 and 0.031 +/- 0.004 MgC ha(-1) month(-1) in November, in humid and dry sites, respectively. Fruitfall production was staggered throughout the year, probably reflecting the high variation in varying times to development and loss of fruit among species.

AB AimLarge ungulate grazers have been a fundamental component of African savannas since the spread of the savanna ecosystem in the Miocene. The magnitude of the impact of ungulates on vegetation has been debated for a long time, but quantifying such effects at the continental scale has been difficult. This study presents an attempt to estimate for the first time the potential impact of large natural ungulate grazer herds on African ecosystems.
   LocationThe African continent (excluding Madagascar).
   MethodThe potential impacts of grazing on grass biomass, competition between grasses and trees, the occurrence and effects of wildfire and biome distribution were simulated with a model that couples a physiological grazer population model with a physiological dynamic vegetation one (not including the effects of browsing). This model has previously been shown to reproduce grazer densities across African wildlife reserves.
   ResultsModelled grazer densities corresponded reasonably well with the continental distribution of African grazers represented by the herbivore functional types in the model. The coupled model predicted a hump-shaped relationship between annual precipitation and grazer biomass densities within a range of estimates from independent studies. In accordance with other studies, net primary productivity and the length of the dry season were the strongest predictors of grazer densities in the model. The inclusion of grazers in the model did not substantially alter an already (without grazers) reasonable fit between simulated vegetation biomass and burned area and estimates of these derived from remote sensing data. Nevertheless, the grazer-vegetation model predicted substantial impacts on grass biomass, tree biomass and burned area, particularly in areas with high grazer densities. The biome distribution at the continental scale, however, was similar with and without grazers.
   Main conclusionThe results suggest that natural large ungulate grazers have been important drivers of ecosystem functioning in some savanna ecosystems, but also that they do not have a large effect on the continental-scale biome distribution and carbon stocks.

AB The estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is an apex predator across freshwater, estuarine and coastal environments. The impact of a changing C.porosus population upon the ecosystem is unknown, but due to large ontogenetic changes in body mass (>1000-fold) their impact may be wide reaching and substantial. Here we investigated the relationship between diet, movement and body size in a population of C.porosus inhabiting a tidal river in northern Australia. Subcutaneous acoustic transmitters and fixed underwater receivers were used to determine the activity space and movement patterns of 42 individuals (202-451cm in total length). There was no size-related spatial partitioning among different sized crocodiles. Large individuals (snout-vent length (SVL): 160cm<SVL<188.5cm) did, however, exhibit a much larger activity space than other size classes. Diet and individual specialization was assessed using the composition of stable carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) isotopes in tissues with different turnover rates. There was a quadratic relationship between body size and N-15, suggesting that medium-sized individuals (110cm<SVL<160cm) incorporated a greater proportion of high trophic prey into their diets than small (SVL<110cm) or large individuals (SVL>160cm). Tissue C-13 composition on the other hand was positively correlated with body size, indicating that different size classes were trophically linked to primary producers in different habitats. Individual-level analyses showed that small crocodiles were generalist feeders while medium and large size classes specialized on particular prey items within the food webs they fed. The findings further our understanding of ontogenetic variation in C.porosus diet, and suggest that change in C.porosus population size or demographics may be influential at various levels across the local food web.

AB 1. Management of apex predators is among the most controversial wildlife management issues globally. In Australia, some ecologists have advocated using the dingo, Canis dingo, as a tool for conservation management, due to evidence that they suppress invasive mesopredators.
   2. Hayward & Marlow (Journal of Applied Ecology, 51, 2014 and 835) questioned the capacity of dingoes to provide benefits to native biodiversity due to their inability to eradicate foxes and cats. They also argued that indices of abundance commonly used in studies of mesopredator release by dingoes (namely, track-based indices) invalidate the conclusions of the studies. Hayward & Marlow caution conservation practitioners against incorporating dingoes into conservation programmes.
   3. Counter to their claims, we summarise research showing that the suppression of invasive mesopredators (cf. eradication) can enhance populations of native species and is therefore a meaningful conservation objective. We highlight literature supporting the hypothesis that dingoes suppress mesopredator abundance and activity, which in turn benefits native biodiversity.
   4. We show that Hayward & Marlow overlook many studies of carnivores that show track indices capture a large amount of the variation in the density of medium-and large-sized carnivores.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Practitioners cannot afford to wait to act given the perilous state of Australia's mammal species, and we argue that the evidence is sufficiently strong to justify managing dingoes for biodiversity conservation.

AB Theoretical studies have shown that coexistence between competitors can be favored in a spatially heterogeneous environment by a number of mechanisms, which ultimately allow the expression of persistent or transitory variation in species competitive abilities, colonization, or reproduction. Four distinctive paradigms to model metacommunities have been identified according to assumptions about the biology of the species and essential aspects of the environment. Missing from these are mechanisms of coexistence that can arise from the dispersal process itself without explicit spatial heterogeneity or biological trade-offs. These mechanisms have only recently received attention, but they may be common in marine communities and other systems in which dispersal is obligatory and modulated by the physical environment. We investigate coexistence in spatially homogeneous metacommunities where there is no partitioning of resources, no competition colonization trade-off, and no possibility of source sink dynamics. Coexistence is shown to be possible through three distinct mechanisms related to the dispersal process itself. Firstly, in a neutral scenario, inclusion of temporal variability in the connectivity matrix, emulating an intrinsic attribute of ocean character and other turbulent environments, can promote the invasion of an equally matched competitor and, in a hierarchical competition scenario, the persistence of an otherwise unviable, inferior competitor (the dispersal variability mechanism). Secondly, a sufficiently large difference in the shape of the time-independent dispersal kernels of the two species, which may result from differences in larval-release timing, buoyancy, or behavior, can produce stable coexistence in the center of their shared range (the dispersal-shape mechanism). Thirdly, asymmetry in the dispersal process due to biased advection renders the metapopulation model reactive,, such that small variations in the upstream abundances can be sufficient for the subordinate species to stably persist (the dispersal-bias mechanism). These results demonstrate that a subordinate species may persist by occupying a dispersal niche that differs sufficiently from that of the dominant species. Further theoretical research is necessary to develop simple empirical tests for these and other dispersal-based coexistence mechanisms.

AB Seasonal fluctuations in water availability cause predictable changes in the profitability of habitats in tropical ecosystems, and animals evolve adaptive behavioural and spatial responses to these fluctuations. However, stochastic changes in the distribution and abundance of surface water between years can alter resource availability at a landscape scale, causing shifts in animal behaviour. In the Okavango Delta, Botswana, a flood-pulsed ecosystem, the volume of water entering the system doubled between 2008 and 2009, creating a sudden change in the landscape. We used African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) to test the hypotheses that seasonal habitat selection would be related to water availability, that increased floodwater levels would decrease forage abundance and affect habitat selection, and that this would decrease buffalo resting time, reduce reproductive success and decrease body condition. Buffalo selected contrasting seasonal habitats, using habitats far from permanent water during the rainy season and seasonally-flooded habitats close to permanent water during the early and late flood seasons. The 2009 water increase reduced forage availability in seasonally-flooded habitats, removing a resource buffer used by the buffalo during the late flood season, when resources were most limited. In response, buffalo used drier habitats in 2009, although there was no significant change in the time spent moving or resting, or daily distance moved. While their reproductive success decreased in 2009, body condition increased. A protracted period of high water levels could prove detrimental to herbivores, especially to smaller-bodied species that require high quality forage. Stochastic annual fluctuations in water levels, predicted to increase as a result of anthropogenically-induced climate change, are likely to have substantial impacts on the functioning of water-driven tropical ecosystems, affecting environmental conditions within protected areas. Buffer zones around critical seasonal resources are essential to allow animals to engage in compensatory behavioural and spatial mechanisms in response to changing environmental conditions.

AB The response of archaeal community to oil spill with the combined effect of the bioturbation activity of the polychaetes Hediste diversicolor was determined in mudflat sediments from the Aber-BenoIt basin (Brittany, French Atlantic coast), maintained in microcosms. The dynamics of the archaeal community was monitored by combining comparative terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprints and sequence library analyses based on 16S rRNA genes and 16S cDNA. Methanogens were also followed by targeting the mcrA gene. Crenarchaeota were always detected in all communities irrespective of the addition of H. diversicolor and/or oil. In the presence of oil, modifications of archaeal community structures were observed. These modifications were more pronounced when H. diversicolor was added resulting in a more diverse community especially for the Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. The analysis of mcrA transcripts showed a specific structure for each condition since the beginning of the experiment. Overall, oiled microcosms showed different communities irrespective of H. diversicolor addition, while similar hydrocarbon removal capacities were observed.

This is the case in Southern South America, where Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay maintain intense commercial relationships, whilst sharing continuous portions of the Pampas grasslands. Transnational similarities in this case exceed ecological features, including a common colonization history and similar development trends. This study represents a tri-national cooperation effort to describe the alien plant flora invading the Pampas grasslands of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and analyses their characteristics in order to detect species and traits that are shared among the three countries and those that have not yet managed to invade the whole region. Furthermore, we highlight the opportunities and needs of a common approach across countries to deal with plant invasions. Information about alien plant species was retrieved from the IABIN Invasives Information Network (I3N) project databases of Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, complemented with some national herbaria. Three hundred and fifty-six alien plant species were recorded growing in natural or semi-natural habitats of the Pampas. A total of 50 species were found in Pampas grasslands of the three countries. Argentina shared 48 and 36 species with Brazil and Uruguay, respectively, while the Brazilian and the Uruguayan Pampas shared only 20 species. Poaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae were the families with the highest number of invasive species, and herbs were the most common life form (75 %). Most invasive plants originated from Europe, Asia and Africa, and almost one-quarter of the species is associated with some human use, especially gardening. We discuss the opportunities and needs for international cooperation, as the prevention of introductions from one country to another through the use of risk analysis tools, definition of priority invasive species, as well as the detection, containment, eradication and control of common invasions. Furthermore, we suggest the establishment of coherent regional legislation and the inclusion of social issues and the public perception in the biological invasion quest.

AB Habitat degradation and fishing are major drivers of temporal and spatial changes in fish communities. The independent effects of these drivers are well documented, but the relative importance and interaction between fishing and habitat shifts is poorly understood, particularly in complex systems such as coral reefs. To assess the combined and relative effects of fishing and habitat we examined the composition of fish communities on patch reefs across a gradient of high to low structural complexity in fished and unfished areas of the Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia. Biomass and species richness of fish were positively correlated with structural complexity of reefs and negatively related to macroalgal cover. Total abundance of fish was also positively related to structural complexity, however this relationship was stronger on fished reefs than those where fishing is prohibited. The interaction between habitat condition and fishing pressure is primarily due to the high abundance of small bodied planktivorous fish on fished reefs. However, the influence of management zones on the abundance and biomass of predators and target species is small, implying spatial differences in fishing pressure are low and unlikely to be driving this interaction. Our results emphasise the importance of habitat in structuring reef fish communities on coral reefs especially when gradients in fishing pressure are low. The influence of fishing effort on this relationship may however become more important as fishing pressure increases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Trait-based community assembly theory suggests that trait variation among co-occurring species is shaped by two main processes: abiotic filtering, important in stressful environments and promoting similarity, and competition, more important in productive environments and promoting dissimilarity. Previous studies have indeed found trait similarity to decline along productivity gradients. However, these studies have always been done on single trophic levels. Here, we investigated how interactions between trophic levels affect trait similarity patterns along environmental gradients. We propose three hypotheses for the main drivers of trait similarity patterns of plants and herbivores along environmental gradients: (1) environmental control of both, (2) bottom-up control of herbivore trait variation, and (3) top-down control of grass trait variation.
   To test this, we collected data on the community composition and trait variation of grasses (41 species) and grasshoppers (53 species) in 50 plots in a South African savanna. Structural equation models were used to investigate how the range and spacing of within-community functional trait values of both grasses and their insect herbivores (grasshoppers; Acrididae) respond to (1) rainfall and fire frequency gradients and (2) the trait similarity patterns of the other trophic level.
   The analyses revealed that traits of co-occurring grasses became more similar toward lower rainfall and higher fire frequency (environmental control), while showing little evidence for top-down control. Grasshopper trait range patterns, on the other hand, were mostly directly driven by vegetation structure and grass trait range patterns (bottom-up control), while environmental factors had mostly indirect effects via plant traits. Our study shows the potential to expand trait-based community assembly theory to include trophic interactions.

AB Species utilizing a wide range of resources are intuitively expected to be less efficient in exploiting each resource type compared to species which have developed an optimal phenotype for utilizing only one or a few resources. We report here the results of an empirical study whose aim was to test for a negative association between habitat niche breadth and foraging performance. As a model system to address this question, we used two highly abundant species of pit-building antlions varying in their habitat niche breadth: the habitat generalist Myrmeleon hyalinus, which inhabits a variety of soil types but occurs mainly in sandy soils, and the habitat specialist Cueta lineosa, which is restricted to light soils such as loess. Both species were able to discriminate between the two soils, with each showing a distinct and higher preference to the soil type providing higher prey capture success and characterizing its primary habitat-of-origin. As expected, only small differences in the foraging performances of the habitat generalist were evident between the two soils, while the performance of the habitat specialist was markedly reduced in the alternative sandy soil. Remarkably, in both soil types, the habitat generalist constructed pits and responded to prey faster than the habitat specialist, at least under the temperature range of this study. Furthermore, prey capture success of the habitat generalist was higher than that of the habitat specialist irrespective of the soil type or prey ant species encountered, implying a positive association between habitat niche-breadth and foraging performance. Alternatively, C. lineosa specialization to light soils does not necessarily confer upon its superiority in utilizing such habitats. We thus suggest that habitat specialization in C. lineosa is either an evolutionary dead-end, or, more likely, that this species' superiority in light soils can only be evident when considering additional niche axes.

AB The ingression of woody plants into the grassy layer of savannas and grasslands has become a global concern. The increase of woody plants has been primarily attributed over grazing, fire and more recently to the increase of atmospheric CO2. We used long-term observations and analyses to assess changes in woody vegetation in Ithala Game Reserve (IGR), South Africa. Textural analysis of aerial photographs was used to detect changes in woody vegetation, from 1943 to 2007 in Ithala Game Reserve (IGR), South Africa. Daily rainfall data from 1905 to 2009 were used in a time-series analysis to determine if rainfall patterns have changed. The time-series analysis showed that the low magnitude (0-10 mm) rainfall events decreased from 1916 to 2009 and high magnitude rainfall events increased (10-20 and >20 mm). The mean annual rainfall increased from similar to 700 to similar to 850 mm from the 1930s to the 2000s. This change in rainfall was a key factor in the increase in woody vegetation from 1943 to 2009. We also used field data from the same reserve collected over 30 years to assess the increases in tree cover. Tree cover and density increased significantly by 32.5% and 657.9 indiv ha(-1) respectively, over 64 years. Before the proclamation of IGR in 1972, increases in woody vegetation from 1943 were non-significant. After the proclamation of IGR, herbivore population numbers and spatial distribution influenced the accumulation of grassy biomass required to fuel fires. In areas with reduced fuel loads, the consequential suppression of fire accelerated the rate of woody plant invasion into savannas. The increase in woody vegetation coincided with a decrease in palatable (e.g. Acacia gerrardii and Acacia davyi) and an increase in unpalatable woody plants. The avoidance of the unpalatable trees (e.g. Euclea and Searsia species) by large mammalian herbivores has allowed these trees to increase in density relatively unhindered. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB Methane (CH4) emitted into the coastal ocean faces two primary fates: escape to the atmosphere or prolonged dissolution that allows sufficient time for oxidation by methanotrophic bacteria. The partitioning of CH4 between these fates is modulated by physical, chemical and biological factors, including the distribution of CH4 in the water, temperature, wind speed, water movement, and the biological CH4 oxidation rate. Because of the underlying complexity, studies rarely quantify all of these factors in unison, thereby leaving gaps in our understanding of CH4 biogeochemistry in the coastal ocean. In this study we estimated the partitioning of CH4 between transport, microbial oxidative loss, and sea-air transfer in a defined plume of dissolved CH4 originating from one of the world's largest seep fields, near Coal Oil Point (COP) in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. Depth distributions of CH4 concentration, biologically mediated oxidation rate, and current velocity were quantified at 12 stations in a 198 km(2) area down-current from COP on July 4-5, 2007. Six stations were sampled again on July 7, 2007 to evaluate temporal plume variability. The observed CH4 distribution revealed two distinct CH4 plumes: a shallow plume centered at similar to 40 m and a deeper plume centered at similar to 200 m. The shallow plume originates at COP; the source of the deeper CH4 plume is not known. Cross-sections of both plumes were used to calculate transport and loss terms for dissolved CH4. The results indicate that the majority of the dissolved CH4 is advected and diffuses horizontally by turbulence whereas microbial oxidation, sea-air gas transfer, and vertical turbulent diffusion are less significant. Based on rates estimated in the study area, a model was developed to simulate the fate of the dissolved CH4. The model results suggest that 60% of the CH4 of the sampled plumes will ultimately be microbially oxidized and 40% will be transferred to the atmosphere by sea-air gas exchange under the sampling conditions. These results illustrate the significance of microbial CH4 oxidation in coastal oceans. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past century there has been a global trend towards tree expansion and densification in rangelands and savannas. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as bush encroachment. In South Africa Acacia karroo is one of the key species responsible for bush encroachment. It has been suggested that the combination of fire and browsing might limit bush encroachment by A. karroo more effectively than either browsing or fire alone. We hypothesized that these repeated disturbances progressively deplete root carbohydrates and compromise resprouting ability. This was tested by burning and then manually defoliating A. karroo once a month for 1 year. Manual defoliation did not inhibit the rapid shoot elongation after topkill of A. karroo saplings. During this initial phase, the growth of the new shoots of A. karroo was dependent more on mobilised root reserves than on photoassimilates from the new shoots. Frequent manual defoliation of resprouting A. karroo saplings prevented the replenishment of starch reserves. We suggest a mechanism for how the interaction of browsing and fire can suppress and perhaps reverse bush encroachment in African savannas. Saplings that have reduced starch reserves at the end of dry season due to browsing will struggle to resprout if they are burnt. Even if they do not die, they will be less able to escape fire damage in the next fire than if they had been able to resprout unimpeded.

AB We focused on responses to grazing by individual species and functional groups in relation to ecological thresholds in Mongolian rangelands, with repeated measures from the same ecological sites to account for rainfall variability. At all sites, even under rainfall fluctuations, there were robust combinations of indicator species that could be used to forewarn managers to take action to minimize the probability of crossing ecological thresholds. Depending on the landscape condition of each site, the cover of functional groups, which shared traits of perennial life history, grass or forb growth form, linear leaf shape, and alternate leaf attachment, or the cover of functional groups of woody shrubs dramatically decreased before an ecological threshold was crossed. Thus, across all sites, the responses of certain functional groups to grazing appeared to predict the crossing of an ecological threshold. The ecological indicators derived in this study should help to improve land managers' ability to prevent adverse changes in states before ecological thresholds are reached.

AB Following mineral sand mining near Eneabba, southwestern Australia, rehabilitation managers have the difficult task of restoring shrubland communities of exceptional plant species richness. Species diversity, composition, structure, and key functional attributes in four mined sites rehabilitated 8 (R8) to 24 (R24) years ago were compared with those of typical nearby natural areas classified on the basis of substrate type (Low and High sand Dunes, shallow sand Swales, sand over Laterite, and sand over Limestone). The rehabilitated sites (except R8) had more species (about 140) than natural sites (about 100) in 40 x 40-m plots, with 12-37% species in common with natural sites. Rehabilitated sites were more similar in composition to each other than they were to the natural sites, with two strong colonizers, the fire-killed Acacia blakelyi and the fire-tolerant Melaleuca leuropoma, universally present. Dendrograms and ordinations based on composition and cover showed that rehabilitated sites grouped with each other before they did with the Dune and Swale sites (physically closest), and last with the Laterite and Limestone sites. Plant densities for R16 and R24 were about half those of the High Dune and Limestone, and about a quarter those of the Swale and Laterite. Fire resprouters were under-represented in the rehabilitated sites. Growth form distribution in rehabilitated sites was most similar to those of the dunes, with some woody shrubs up to 2.5 m tall present. Total iron and soil hardness (penetrability) were the only soil factors consistently different (higher) in the rehabilitated sites.

AB Here we empirically demonstrate that a tidal exchange gradient in a central California estuary leads to inversely related spatial gradients in upwelled nutrients and water residence times. As a result, seasonal phytoplankton blooms (summer-fall) occur in the middle of the bay, where nutrient levels and water residence times are intermediate, while seasonal temperature maximums occur in the inner bay, where water residence times are highest and nutrient levels are lowest. By experimentally out-planting juvenile Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) throughout the estuary, we found that the growth and size of juvenile oysters are better explained by the spatial pattern of phytoplankton concentrations than by that of water temperature. Furthermore, this benthic-pelagic link helps explain the distribution of adult oyster sizes throughout the estuary. Because a phytoplankton maximum can be maintained by a physical interaction between intensive upwelling and a seasonal low-inflow estuary, benthic invertebrates within protected embayments of upwelling regions may not conform to the regional generalization that their growth and size are negatively correlated with upwelling intensity.

AB We evaluated the combined effects of fire after drought on the seed bank composition and its role in the postfire recovery of NW Patagonia grasslands. During three years, we monitored the seed bank and the aboveground vegetation. Species were arranged in functional groups and Detrended Correspondence Analysis was used to separate sites according to species and functional groups. Similarity between aboveground vegetation and seed bank was calculated with Sorensen Index. In the first year, the seed density was similar in the control and burned sites and was lower than following years in all the sites. The species that survived the high temperatures were all annuals with the exception of the perennial species Fabiana imbricata and Rumex acetosella. In the second postfire year, the diversity and seed density increased due to the contribution of fugitive species (rare in the community) and exotic annual species. Seed bank of perennial species was the most affected by fire and just recovered in the third year. Drought did not affect the similarity between the seed bank and vegetation. Fire had low impact on the total seed bank, probably due to the heat buffering nature of the soil, whereas drought reduced significantly seed bank size and richness. Seed bank contributes to grassland richness maintenance.

AB Majority of research papers dealing with the impact of invasive plant species have addressed autecology of invasive species, factors facilitating the spread of these species, change in community structure and economic losses. Soil processes which change in response to plant invasion and, in turn, affect the recruitment and growth of both native as well as invasive species, are often ignored. The authors review the existing literature on the impact of invasive plant species to show that several soil properties and processes are substantially altered. These changes support feed back mechanisms, which could reverberate up to landscape level and affect ecosystem structure and biogeochemical cycles. Evidently, studies need to focus on soil processes for better understanding of the invasion process so that appropriate management strategy could be developed to combat the onslaught of biological invasion.

AB Reliable assessments of large mammal population sizes are crucial for the management of protected areas. We tested feasibility of foot surveys for population assessments of large mammals in western Tanzanian woodland, comparing estimates of herbivore densities from line-transect data from a National Park with those from an adjacent Game Reserve (GR). We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) and Global Positioning System-supported field design, consisting of systematically distributed closed-circuit transects, and recorded sighting distances and angles. Total survey effort was 1,032 km, conducted within the dry season. We fitted detection functions to distance data with the help of DISTANCE 4.1, using the 3 habitat categories woodland, grassland, and swamp as covariates for detection probability. We found estimates of density and abundance to be reliable for 19 out of 20 larger mammalian herbivores and found significant differences in density between the Park and the GR for 5 species, of which 4 had a higher density in the Park and one had a higher density in the GR. Our results show that, using GIS support and modern navigation methods, foot-transect surveys can be effective in providing accurate data on woodland herbivore populations even in large study areas.

AB The implementation of an automated stream monitoring unit that features four probe-based turbidity (T-n) measurements per hour and the capability to collect frequent (e.g., hourly) samples for total suspended solids (TSS) analyses during runoff events to assess the dynamics of T-n, TSS and corresponding loads in sediment-rich Onondaga Creek, NY, was documented. Major increases in both T-n (maximum of 3,500 NTU) and TSS (maximum of 1630 mg/L) were reported for the stream during runoff events. Relationships between T-n, TSS and stream flow (Q) were developed and applied to support estimates of TSS loading (TSS,). Tn was demonstrated to be a better predictor of TSS than Q, supporting the use of the frequent field T-n measurements to estimate TSSL. During the year of intensive monitoring, 65% of the TSSL was delivered during the six largest runoff events that represented 18% of the annual flow. The high Tn levels and extensive in-stream deposition have negatively impacted the stream's biota and the esthetics of a downstream harbor. Onondaga Creek is reported to be the dominant allochthonous source of inorganic particulate material to downstream Onondaga Lake. These sediment inputs have important implications for the lake, within the context of two on-going rehabilitation programs aimed at contaminated lake sediments and the effects of extreme cultural eutrophication, by contributing substantially to sedimentation and turbidity. A satellite image documented the occurrence of a conspicuous turbidity plume that emanated from Onondaga Creek following a minor runoff event, suggesting such an effect is common and that related impacts are not spatially uniform.

AB The importance of wild edible herbaceous species to resource poor households in most rural economies within savannas has been little studied. This is because most of the herbs grow in impoverished species communities and lands, often referred to as 'marginal lands'. The aim of this paper is to conceptualize how the economics of wild edible herbs to households can be used to add value to total livelihoods and conservation within traditional communal areas of South Africa. Analysis of the economics of the consumption of wild edible herbs in Thorndale (Bushbuckridge district) of the Limpopo province is presented. The majority of households consumed wild edible herbs, averaging 15.4 kg dried weight per household per year and valued at $167 per household. The herbs were mostly harvested from uncultivated areas of farms, and rangelands. There was little correlation between household characteristics and the dependence on wild herbs for food. The local people noted a decline in the availability of the species, although not much is known about attempts to cultivate them. The only reasons attributed to the decline were nutrient poor soils and insufficient rains. With this background, developing a local strategy to sustain the species through cultivation by households was found to be feasible. A multiple-use system for the herbs, their improvement and value addition towards commercialization and increased household usage may result in wider acceptance and subsequent cultivation. Species diversity will be enhanced whilst conserving the land on which they grow. This multiple use system may include species roles in soil and water conservation.

AB Waterbirds are one of the most important groups of organisms inhabiting the land-water interface, especially with regard to mediating the transport of materials from the aquatic to the terrestrial environment. The great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) is a colonial piscivorous bird that transports nutrients from fresh water to forest. We measured cormorant-derived nitrogen at two nesting colonies on the Isaki Peninsula and Chikubu Island at Lake Biwa, Japan, and analyzed the long-term effects of cormorant colonization on the forest nitrogen cycle, and the mechanisms of nitrogen retention. Three sites were examined in each colony: a currently occupied area, a previously occupied but now abandoned area, and a control area never colonized by cormorants. High nitrogen stable isotope ratios of cormorant excreta, the forest floor, mineral soil, and living plants showed cormorant-derived nitrogen in both occupied and abandoned areas. The relationship between delta N-15 and N content showed that the high delta N-15 of the excreta and N turnover in the soil were important at the occupied sites, whereas high delta N-15 of litter was important at the abandoned sites. Physiological changes of various organisms are also important for the N decomposition process. In conclusion, cormorant-derived nitrogen remains in the forest ecosystem as a result of two cormorant activities: heavy deposition of excreta and collection of nitrogen-rich nest material. Colony stage (occupied, abandoned, or never inhabited) and historical change of N decomposition process of an area can be identified from the relationship between delta N-15 and N content.

AB Spatial and trophic competitive interactions were analysed for the seldom-studied limpet Patella ferruginea (which is considered as an "extinction risk"). Spatial patterns of distribution of P. ferruginea were studied using quadrats of 1 X 1 m(2) at several transects along the coastline, whereas trophic interactions were studied through manipulations of densities of P. ferruginea and Patella caerulea in experimental plots located at the mid-shore. Physical parameters were measured inside each plot to determine the microenvironmental differences between fenced and unfenced plots. Fenced plots of 50 X 50 cm(2) were used with six different treatments. Mortality was recorded every 15 days and length was measured monthly during the 3.5 months of the experiment. At the beginning and end of the experiment, lengths and weights of limpets were recorded and chlorophyll concentration was measured by spectrophotometric analysis of rock surface. Both species showed increased mortality and reduced size and weight in treatments with greater densities. High intraspecific competition was detected in P caerulea compared with P ferruginea whereas asymmetrical interspecific competition was observed. The results suggest that P. caerulea is the superior competitor, possibly due to differences in radular morphology and mobility between the two species. Microalgal food assessment showed that it is probably a limiting resource, especially for P caerulea, although this species has a lower biomass than P ferruginea. The high intraspecific competition observed in P. caerulea could be responsible for the coexistence of both species. The present study may be useful in helping to conserve P. ferruginea, which is presently under serious threat of extinction, because the results show that experimental fences are a viable means of concentrating breeding individuals.

AB Studies that track the dispersal of eggs and larvae from a point source are important to the emerging field of marine protected area (MPA) science. Two thousand ballasted drifter vials were released over a mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis) spawning aggregation in the Dry Tortugas, Florida, over two consecutive years (1999, 2000). The site, called Riley's Hump, is located within an MPA. The drifter vials were used as a means to model the potential dispersal and distribution of recruits originating from this site. Eleven percent of the vials were recovered each year by beachcombers. Results for each year indicated that Riley's Hump might be a source of mutton snapper recruits for a broad expanse of the Florida Keys and southeast Florida. Riley's Hump may therefore be functioning as an important fisheries reserve.

AB We investigated foraging behaviour of larval dragonflies Aeshna juncea in order to examine the significance of prey density and body size in predator-prey dynamics. A. juncea were offered separately three size-classes of Daphnia magna at low and high densities. The data were collected with direct observations of the foraging individuals. We found that large A. juncea larvae could better enhance their intake of prey biomass as prey size and prey density increased than their smaller conspecifics. However, increasing feeding efficiency of both larval instars was constrained by declining attack success and search rate with increasing prey size and density. With small D. magna, in contrast to large A. juncea, small A. juncea increased their searching efficiency as prey density increased keeping D. magna mortality rate at a constant level. In a predator-prey relationship this indicates stabilizing potential and feeding thresholds set by both prey density and prey-predator size ratio. Attack success dropped with prey size and density, but did not change in the course of the foraging bout. For both A. juncea sizes prey handling times increased as more medium and large prey were eaten. The slope of the increase became steeper with increasing prey-predator size ratio. These observations indicate that components of the predator-prey relationship vary with prey density, contrary to the basic assumptions of functional response equations. Moreover, the results suggest that the effects of prey density change during the ontogeny of predators and prey.

AB Current notions of "pollinator decline" and "pollination crisis" mainly arose from studies on pollinators of economic value in anthropogenic ecosystems of mid-latitude temperate regions. Comprehensive long-term pollinator data from biologically diverse, undisturbed communities are needed to evaluate the actual extent of the so-called "global pollination crisis." This paper analyzes the long-term dynamics of pollinator abundance in undisturbed Mediterranean montane habitats using pollinator visitation data for 65 plant species collected over two decades. Objectives are (1) to elucidate patterns of long-term changes in pollinator abundance from the perspectives of individual plant species, major pollinator groups, and the whole plant community and (2) to propose a novel methodological implementation based on combining a planned missing data design with the analytical strength of mixed effects models, which allows one to draw community-wide inferences on long-term pollinator trends in species-rich natural habitats. Probabilistic measurements ("patch visitation probability" and "flower visitation probability" per time unit) were used to assess pollinator functional abundance for each plant species on two separate, randomly chosen years. A total of 13,054 pollinator censuses accounting for a total watching effort of 2,877,039 flower-min were carried out on 299 different dates. Supra-annual unstability in pollinator functional abundance was the rule, with visitation probability to flowering patches and/or individual flowers exhibiting significant heterogeneity between years in the majority of plant species (83%). At the plant-community level, there was a significant linear increase in pollinator functional abundance over the study period. Probability of pollinator visitation to flowering patches and individual flowers increased due to increasing visitation by small solitary bees and, to a lesser extent, small beetles. Visitation to different plant species exhibited contrasting changes, and insect orders and genera differed widely in sign and magnitude of linear abundance trends, thus exemplifying the complex dynamics of community-wide changes in pollinator functional abundance. Results of this investigation indicate that pollinator declines are not universal beyond anthropogenic ecosystems; stress the need for considering broader ecological scenarios and comprehensive samples of plants and pollinators; and illustrate the crucial importance of combining ambitious sampling designs with powerful analytical schemes to draw reliable inferences on pollinator trends at the plant community level.

AB Rural livelihoods in developing countries are disproportionately vulnerable to multiple shocks and stresses that exacerbate vulnerability, which can result in increased dependence on natural resources. Several studies have been conducted on the safety net role of natural resources, which lower the impact of negative shocks on rural livelihoods. However, the role of social capital as a safety net that can potentially lower natural resource use when households experience negative shocks has been less studied. We examined the role of natural resources and social capital as buffers against negative shocks to reduce vulnerability in rural livelihoods. Using five years of panel data from a rural population in South Africa, multilevel models were constructed to quantify the influence of shocks, social capital and household socio-demographic characterization on three dimensions of natural resource use, namely the number of types of natural resources used, the frequency of natural resource use, and the quantities of natural resources used. Results show that household experience of negative shocks was consistently associated with a significant increase in all dimensions of natural resource use. However, and unexpectedly, social capital did not significantly reduce natural resource use when households experienced shocks. This in no way discounts the role social capital plays in cushioning households post experience of shocks, but rather indicates that reliance on social and natural capital could be complementary rather than substitutable coping strategies post experience of shocks. Efforts to secure rural livelihoods and achieve sustainability should thus focus on building household physical capital to reduce dependency on natural resources in rural households.

However, how can the ideals of stewardship be realised in practice? The links between the theory and practice of stewardship are under-developed, and research to support place-based stewardship practice is limited. We therefore bring together complementary perspectives to guide research on place-based stewardship practice in the context of multifunctional landscapes. We unpack and synthesise literature on stewardship, landscapes, and collaboration for natural resource management, and highlight the ways in which the pathways approach can deepen research on collaboration and stewardship practice. We propose landscapes as a suitable level of analysis and action for stewardship. Since all landscapes are multifunctional, we argue that collaboration among multiple stakeholders is a necessary focus of such research. Our analysis reveals that existing theory on collaboration could be deepened by further research into the agency of individual human actors, the complex social-relational dynamics among actors, and the situatedness of actors within the social-ecological context. These factors mediate collaborative processes, and a better understanding of them is needed to support place-based stewardship practice. To this end, the pathways approach offers a waymark to advance research on collaboration, particularly in the complex, contested social-ecological systems that tend to characterize multifunctional landscapes.

AB In the this study, we evaluated the effect of replacement of fish meal by a marine microalgae Spirulina platensis on growth, digestive enzyme activities, fatty acid composition and responses to ammonia and hypoxia stress in Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (2.6 +/- 0.2 g). Experimental diets contained S. platensis at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% replacement levels. After 8 weeks of feeding trial, growth parameters and proximate body composition were not significantly different among treatments (p > .05). Amylase and lipase activities did not show any significant differences between control group and other experimental diets (p > .05), while activities of trypsin and chymotrypsin were significantly higher in shrimp fed diet with 50% substitution of microalgae compared to control group. Fatty acid contents, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) including arachidonic acid (ARA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), were significantly higher in control diet compared to other experimental diets. On the contrary, the majority of fatty acids including the contents of PUFAs in the whole body of L. vannamei fed with different levels of S. platensis were significantly higher compared to those of control group. After 48-h exposure to ammonia, survival per cent was not statistically different between all groups (p > .05), but in hypoxia challenge, the survival per cent of control group was significantly less than that of treatments fed diets contained S. platensis (p < .05). Altogether, our results demonstrated the effectiveness of S. platensis as a reliable protein source for substitution of fish meal in shrimp aquaculture.

AB The dynamics, control, and evolution of communicable and vector-borne diseases are intimately connected to the joint dynamics of epidemiological, behavioral, and mobility processes that operate across multiple spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The identification of a theoretical explanatory framework that accounts for the pattern regularity exhibited by a large number of host-parasite systems, including those sustained by host-vector epidemiological dynamics, is but one of the challenges facing the coevolving fields of computational, evolutionary, and theoretical epidemiology. Host-parasite epidemiological patterns, including epidemic outbreaks and endemic recurrent dynamics, are characteristic to well-identified regions of the world; the result of processes and constraints such as strain competition, host and vector mobility, and population structure operating over multiple scales in response to recurrent disturbances (like El Nino) and climato-logical and environmental perturbations over thousands of years. It is therefore important to identify and quantify the processes responsible for observed epidemiological macroscopic patterns: the result of individual interactions in changing social and ecological landscapes. In this perspective, we touch on some of the issues calling for the identification of an encompassing theoretical explanatory framework by identifying some of the limitations of existing theory, in the context of particular epidemiological systems. Fostering the reenergizing of research that aims at disentangling the role of epidemiological and socioeconomic forces on disease dynamics, better understood as complex adaptive systems, is a key aim of this perspective.

AB The re-colonization or recovery of grass species after disappearance due to heavy grazing depends on the presence of persistent soil seed banks that might be accumulated over time from the aboveground vegetation. Moreover, successful plant recruitment is a function of seed production, seed germination and seedling survival, which can be mechanistically understood through studying the life cycle processes of grass species populations under field conditions. Therefore, we studied the number of germinable seeds, species richness and life-forms in the soil seed banks under light and heavy grazing conditions, and the changes in grass species populations in a semi-arid savanna of Ethiopia. Accordingly, a total of 103 species (15 perennial and 29 annual grasses, 6 legumes, 52 forbs and 1 woody species) emerged from the soil samples collected. Lightly grazed sites had a higher seed density compared with heavily grazed sites. The seed density increased over the first three months of soil sampling and decreased thereafter. Perennial grasses dominated the light grazing sites, whereas annual species dominated the heavily grazed sites, indicating that perennial grasses were replaced by annual species in the soil seed bank through grazing. The mean mortality rate from the seedling stage to adult plants was 65%. The seed-to-seedling stage was found to be the most critical transitional stage for grass survival. High seedling mortality in the aboveground vegetation and depletion of seeds in the soil seed banks as a result of sustained heavy grazing can lead to local extinction and disappearance of perennial grasses in semi-arid Ethiopian savannas.

AB Although Africa has many threatened species and biological hot spots, there are few citizen science schemes, particularly in rural communities, and there has been limited evaluation of existing programs. We engaged traditional Maasai warriors (pastoralist men aged 15 to 35) in community-based conservation and demographic monitoring of a persecuted African lion (Panthera leo) population. Through direct engagement, we investigated whether a citizen science approach employing local warriors, who had no formal education, could produce reliable data on the demographics, predation, and movements of a species with which their communities have been in conflict for generations. Warriors were given benefits such as literacy training and skill enhancement and engaged in the monitoring of the lions. The trained warriors reported on lion sign across an area nearly 4000 km(2). Scientists worked together with the warriors to verify their reports and gather observations on the lion population. Using the verified reports and collected observations, we examined our scientific knowledge relative to the lion population preceding and during the citizen science program. Our observations showed that data quality and quantity improved with the involvement and training of the participants. Furthermore, because they engaged in conservation and gained personal benefits, the participants came to appreciate a species that was traditionally their foe. We believe engaging other local communities in biodiversity conservation and monitoring may be an effective conservation approach in rural Africa.

AB Managing the pathways by which non-native species are introduced and spread is considered the most effective way of preventing species invasions. Tourism and outdoor recreation involve the frequent congregation of people, vehicles and vessels from geographically diverse areas. They are therefore perceived to be major pathways for the movement of non-native species, and ones that will become increasingly important with the continued growth of these sectors. However, a global assessment of the relationship between tourism activities and the introduction of non-native species-particularly in freshwater and marine environments- is lacking. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of tourism and outdoor recreation on non-native species in terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments. Our results provide quantitative evidence that the abundance and richness of non-native species are significantly higher in sites where tourist activities take place than in control sites. The pattern was consistent across terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments; across a variety of vectors (e.g. horses, hikers, yachts); and across a range of taxonomic groups. These results highlight the need for widespread biosecurity interventions to prevent the inadvertent introduction of invasive non-native species (INNS) as the tourism and outdoor recreation sectors grow.

AB Understanding the effects of predation on disease dynamics is increasingly important in light of the role ecological communities can play in host-parasite interactions. Surprisingly, however, few studies have characterized direct predation of parasites. Here we used an experimental approach to show that consumption of free-living parasite stages is highly context dependent, with significant influences of parasite size, predator size and foraging mode, as well as environmental condition. Among the four species of larval trematodes and two types of predators (fish and larval damselflies) studied here, parasites with larger infective stages (size > 1,000 mu m) were most vulnerable to predation by fish, while small-bodied fish and damselflies (size < 10 mm) consumed the most infectious stages. Small parasite species (size approx. 500 mu m) were less frequently consumed by both fish and larval damselflies. However, these results depended strongly on light availability; trials conducted in the dark led to significantly fewer parasites consumed overall, especially those with a size of < 1,000 mu m, emphasizing the importance of circadian shedding times of parasite free-living stages for predation risk. Intriguingly, active predation functioned to help limit fishes' infection by directly penetrating parasite species. Our results are consistent with established theory developed for predation on zooplankton that emphasizes the roles of body size, visibility and predation modes and further suggest that consumer-resource theory may provide a predictive framework for when predators should significantly influence parasite transmission. These results contribute to our understanding of transmission in natural systems, the role of predator-parasite links in food webs and the evolution of parasite morphology and behavior.

TI Estimating Air Travel-Associated Importations of Dengue Virus Into Italy

AB BackgroundSouthern Europe is increasingly at risk for dengue emergence, given the seasonal presence of relevant mosquito vectors and suitable climatic conditions. For example, Aedes mosquitoes, the main vector for both dengue and chikungunya, are abundant in Italy, and Italy experienced the first ever outbreak of chikungunya in Europe in 2007. We set out to estimate the extent of dengue virus importations into Italy via air travelers.
   MethodsWe attempted to quantify the number of dengue virus importations based on modeling of published estimates on dengue incidence in the countries of disembarkation and analysis of data on comprehensive air travel from these countries into Italy's largest international airport in Rome.
   ResultsFrom 2005 to 2012, more than 7.3million air passengers departing from 100 dengue-endemic countries arrived in Rome. Our Importation Model, which included air traveler volume, estimated the incidence of dengue infections in the countries of disembarkation, and the probability of infection coinciding with travel accounted for an average of 2,320 (1,621-3,255) imported dengue virus infections per year, of which 572 (381-858) were apparent dengue infections and 1,747 (1,240-2,397) inapparent.
   ConclusionsBetween 2005 and 2012, we found an increasing trend of dengue virus infections imported into Rome via air travel, which may pose a potential threat for future emergence of dengue in Italy, given that the reoccurring pattern of peak importations corresponds seasonally with periods of relevant mosquito vector activity. The observed increasing annual trends of dengue importation and the consistent peaks in late summer underpin the urgency in determining the threshold levels for the vector and infected human populations that could facilitate novel autochthonous transmission of dengue in Europe.

AB To study the primary larval transport pathways and inter-population connectivity patterns of the Atlantic surfclam, Spisula solidissima, a coupled modeling system combining a physical circulation model of the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB), Georges Bank (GBK) and the Gulf of Maine (GoM), and an individual-based surfclam larval model was implemented, validated and applied. Model validation shows that the model can reproduce the observed physical circulation patterns and surface and bottom water temperature, and recreates the observed distributions of surfclam larvae during upwelling and downwelling events. The model results show a typical along-shore connectivity pattern from the northeast to the southwest among the surfclam populations distributed from Georges Bank west and south along the MAB shelf. Continuous surfclam larval input into regions off Delmarva (DMV) and New Jersey (NJ) suggests that insufficient larval supply is unlikely to be the factor causing the failure of the population to recover after the observed decline of the surfclam populations in DMV and NJ from 1997 to 2005. The GBK surfclam population is relatively more isolated than populations to the west and south in the MAB; model results suggest substantial inter-population connectivity from southern New England to the Delmarva region. Simulated surfclam larvae generally drift for over one hundred kilometers along the shelf, but the distance traveled is highly variable in space and over time. Surfclam larval growth and transport are strongly impacted by the physical environment. This suggests the need to further examine how the interaction between environment, behavior, and physiology affects inter-population connectivity. Larval vertical swimming and sinking behaviors have a significant net effect of increasing larval drifting distances when compared with a purely passive model, confirming the need to include larval behavior.

AB Understanding patterns of larval dispersal is key in determining whether no-take marine reserves are self-sustaining, what will be protected inside reserves and where the benefits of reserves will be observed. We followed a multidisciplinary approach that merged detailed descriptions of fishing zones and spawning time at 17 sites distributed in the Midriff Island region of the Gulf of California with a biophysical oceanographic model that simulated larval transport at Pelagic Larval Duration (PLD) 14, 21 and 28 days for the most common and targeted predatory reef fish, (leopard grouper Mycteroperca rosacea). We tested the hypothesis that source-sink larval metapopulation dynamics describing the direction and frequency of larval dispersal according to an oceanographic model can help to explain empirical genetic data. We described modeled metapopulation dynamics using graph theory and employed empirical sequence data from a subset of 11 sites at two mitochondrial genes to verify the model predictions based on patterns of genetic diversity within sites and genetic structure between sites. We employed a population graph describing a network of genetic relationships among sites and contrasted it against modeled networks. While our results failed to explain genetic diversity within sites, they confirmed that ocean models summarized via graph and adjacency distances over modeled networks can explain seemingly chaotic patterns of genetic structure between sites. Empirical and modeled networks showed significant similarities in the clustering coefficients of each site and adjacency matrices between sites. Most of the connectivity patterns observed towards downstream sites (Sonora coast) were strictly asymmetric, while those between upstream sites (Baja and the Midriffs) were symmetric. The best-supported gene flow model and analyses of modularity of the modeled networks confirmed a pulse of larvae from the Baja Peninsula, across the Midriff Island region and towards the Sonoran coastline that acts like a larval sink, in agreement with the cyclonic gyre (anti-clockwise) present at the peak of spawning (May-June). Our approach provided a mechanistic explanation of the location of fishing zones: most of the largest areas where fishing takes place seem to be sustained simultaneously by high levels of local retention, contribution of larvae from upstream sites and oceanographic patterns that concentrate larval density from all over the region. The general asymmetry in marine connectivity observed highlights that benefits from reserves are biased towards particular directions, that no-take areas need to be located upstream of targeted fishing zones, and that some fishing localities might not directly benefit from avoiding fishing within reserves located adjacent to their communities. We discuss the implications of marine connectivity for the current network of marine protected areas and no-take zones, and identify ways of improving it.

AB Comparative phylogeography is an effective approach to assess the evolutionary history of biological communities. We used comparative phylogeography in fourteen tree taxa from Lower Guinea (Atlantic Equatorial Africa) to test for congruence with two simple evolutionary scenarios based on physio-climatic features 1) the W-E environmental gradient and 2) the N-S seasonal inversion, which determine climatic and seasonality differences in the region. We sequenced the trnC-ycf6 plastid DNA region using a dual sampling strategy: fourteen taxa with small sample sizes (dataset 1, mean n = 16/ taxon), to assess whether a strong general pattern of allele endemism and genetic differentiation emerged; and four taxonomically well-studied species with larger sample sizes (dataset 2, mean n = 109/species) to detect the presence of particular shared phylogeographic patterns. When grouping the samples into two alternative sets of two populations, W and E, vs. N and S, neither dataset exhibited a strong pattern of allelic endemism, suggesting that none of the considered regions consistently harboured older populations. Differentiation in dataset 1 was similarly strong between W and E as between N and S, with 3-5 significant F-ST tests out of 14 tests in each scenario. Coalescent simulations indicated that, given the power of the data, this result probably reflects idiosyncratic histories of the taxa, or a weak common differentiation pattern (possibly with population substructure) undetectable across taxa in dataset 1. Dataset 2 identified a common genetic break separating the northern and southern populations of Greenwayodendron suaveolens subsp. suaveolens var. suaveolens, Milicia excelsa, Symphonia globulifera and Trichoscypha acuminata in Lower Guinea, in agreement with differentiation across the N-S seasonal inversion. Our work suggests that currently recognized tree taxa or suspected species complexes can contain strongly differentiated genetic lineages, which could lead to misinterpretation of phylogeographic patterns. Therefore the evolutionary processes of such taxa require further study in African tropical rainforests.

AB Acacia cyclops is an invasive species within Mediterranean ecosystems, characteristically low in soil nutrients. Thus associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) and arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) may provide an advantage to these legumes. This study investigated the role of AM and NFB in the growth and nutritional physiology of A. cyclops.
   Seedlings were inoculated with naturally occurring NFB, Glomus mosseae or both, and grown under glasshouse conditions for 5 months. Plants were cultivated in sand and supplied with a 20 % strength nutrient solution. Xylem sap nutrients, photosynthetic rates, biomass and chemical compositions, were recorded.
   The dual inoculation decreased the colonization of both symbionts, compared to a single symbiosis with either symbiont. Despite low colonization levels, the dual symbiosis increased host biomass and relative growth rates. This was associated with increased photosynthetic rates and enhanced nutrition. Additionally, dual symbiotic plants had enhanced N and P acquisition and utilization rates. Xylem sap analysis showed higher levels of NH (4) (+) being exported from the roots to the shoots in the dual symbiotic plants compared with other treatments.
   These findings suggest the dual symbiosis is an important factor in the growth and development of A. cyclops under nutrient limiting conditions.

AB Phyto-climatic gradient and ecological indicators can be used to understand the requirements, long term management and conservation strategies of natural habitats and species. For this purpose phytosociological attributes were measured using quadrats along transects on different slope aspects across an elevation range of 2450-4400 m. The 198 recorded plant species were placed in five Raunkiaer life form classes among which the Hemicryptophytes (51%) dominate the flora of the study area followed by Phanerophytes and Cryptophytes (Geophytes) with 15 and 13% dominance respectively. Therophytes and Chamaephytes are represented by smaller numbers (12 & 10% each). The phyto-climatic gradient of the vegetation was evaluated using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Phyto-climatic relationships show that Phanerophytes especially tree species are widely distributed on northern aspect slopes whilst shrubs are more dominant on southern aspect slopes. Woody plants are dominant at lower altitudes (2450-2800 m), with a much smaller proportion occurring at middle elevations (2800-3300 m) whilst higher (3300-3900 m) and highest elevations (3900-4400 m) are dominated mainly by hemi-cryptophytes and cryptophytes. Our findings further elucidate that vegetation changes gradually from moist-cool temperate Phanerophytic and Chamaephytic elements to dry-cold subalpine and alpine herbaceous Cryptophytic and Hemi-cryptophytic vegetation in the upper elevations. Assessment of life forms and ecological gradient provide a basis for more extensive conservation studies on biodiversity in mountain ecosystems. Our findings further advocate that the Naran Valley appears to be at a transitional floristic position bridging the contrasting moist and dry temperate zones of the Sino-Japanese and Irano-Turanian floristic regions.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in woody cover affects biodiversity and ecosystem function, and may be particularly influential in savanna ecosystems. Browsing and interactions with herbaceous plants can create and maintain heterogeneity in woody cover, but the relative importance of these drivers remains unclear, especially when considered across multiple edaphic contexts. In African savannas, abandoned temporary livestock corrals (bomas) develop into long-term, nutrient-rich ecosystem hotspots with unique vegetation. In central Kenya, abandoned corral sites persist for decades as treeless 'glades' in a wooded matrix. Though glades are treeless, areas between adjacent glades have higher tree densities than the background savanna or areas near isolated glades. The mechanisms maintaining these distinctive woody cover patterns remain unclear. We asked whether browsing or interactions with herbaceous plants help to maintain landscape heterogeneity by differentially impacting young trees in different locations. We planted the mono-dominant tree species (Acacia drepanolobium) in four locations: inside glades, far from glades, at edges of isolated glades and at edges between adjacent glades. Within each location, we assessed the separate and combined effects of herbivore exclusion (caging) and herbaceous plant removal (clearing) on tree survival and growth. Both caging and clearing improved tree survival and growth inside glades. When herbaceous plants were removed, trees inside glades grew more than trees in other locations, suggesting that glade soils were favorable for tree growth. Different types of glade edges (isolated vs. non-isolated) did not have significantly different impacts on tree performance. This represents one of the first field-based experiments testing the separate and interactive effects of browsing, grass competition and edaphic context on savanna tree performance. Our findings suggest that, by excluding trees from otherwise favorable sites, both herbaceous plants and herbivores help to maintain functionally important landscape heterogeneity in African savannas.

AB Understanding the factors that drive the global distribution of alien species is a pivotal issue in invasion biology. Here, we used data on naturalized conifers (Pinaceae, Cupressaceae) from sixty temperate and subtropical regions and five continents to test how environmental and socio-economic conditions of recipient areas as well as introduction efforts affect naturalization probabilities. We collated 18 predictor variables for each region describing environmental, biogeographic and socio-economic conditions as well as a measure of the macro-climatic match with the species' native ranges, and the extent to which alien conifers are used in commercial forestry. Naturalization probabilities across all species and regions were then related to these predictor variables by means of generalized linear mixed models.
   For both Pinaceae and Cupressaceae, naturalization probabilities were generally higher in the Southern Hemisphere, and increased with indicators of habitat diversity of the recipient region. The match in macro-climatic conditions between the native and introduced regions was a significant predictor of conifer naturalization, but socio-economic variables were less powerful predictors. Only for Cupressaceae did a socio-economic variable (human population density) affect naturalization probabilities. Key attributes facilitating naturalization were related to introduction effort. Moreover, usage in commercial forestry generally fostered naturalization, although the actual size of alien conifer plantations in a region was only correlated with the naturalization of Pinaceae.
   Our results suggest that climate matching, habitat diversity and introduction effort co-determine the probability of naturalization, which additionally, is modulated by biogeographic features of the recipient area, such as incidence of natural enemies or competitors. To date, the most widely used tools for invasive plant risk assessment only account for climate match and rarely factor in other attributes of the recipient environment. Future tools should additionally consider biotic environment and introduction effort if risk assessment is to be effective.

AB Dispersal of individuals among subpopulations is a key process underlying metapopulation dynamics. Many metapopulation models, including those of coastal benthic organisms under marine reserve scenarios, have assumed a particular and time-independent dispersal pattern. The behavior of such models, however, may be sensitive to more realistic representations of oceanic dispersal. We examine the importance of environmental variability and dispersal characters for metapopulation persistence using a space-limited metapopulation model, in which the dispersal phase is represented by a connectivity matrix and environmental fluctuations by stochastic perturbations of adult abundances. The model is suited to marine organisms, but the same principles apply to other systems. When dispersal is asymmetrical, as expected in the presence of a dominant current, environmental variability can allow the metapopulation to persist, even when the per capita larval production rate is too low to otherwise sustain the population. This suggests that metapopulations inhabiting finite ranges in an advective environment may be more susceptible to variations related to climate change. Generalized stability theory is a powerful tool for identifying the local populations that have greatest impact on the metapopulation, and hence the optimal sites for protection from exploitation. We show that the inclusion of realistic environmental variability and complex dispersal patterns in models of marine reserve networks can bring unsuspected and sometimes largely positive effects for conservation and management of benthic species. Thus, marine reserve monitoring of abundance and recruitment in systems with longshore currents should include the region of long-distance dispersal of the species.

AB Three main hypotheses are commonly employed to explain diachronic variation in the relative abundance of remains of large terrestrial herbivores: (1) large prey populations decline as a function of anthropogenic overexploitation: (2) large prey tends to increase as a result of increasing social payoffs; and (3) proportions of large terrestrial prey are dependent on stochastic fluctuations in climate. This paper tests predictions derived from these three hypotheses through a zooarchaeological analysis of eleven temporal components from three sites on central California's Pecho Coast. Specifically, we examine the trade-offs between hunting rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) and deer (Odocoileus hemionus) using models derived from human behavioral ecology. The results show that foragers exploited a robust population of deer throughout most of the Holocene, only doing otherwise during periods associated with climatic trends unfavorable to larger herbivores. The most recent component (Late Prehistoric/Contact era) shows modest evidence of localized resource depression and perhaps greater social benefits from hunting larger prey; we suggest that these final changes resulted from the introduction of bow and arrow technology. Overall, results suggest that along central California's Pecho Coast, density independent factors described as climatically-mediated prey choice best predict changes in the relative abundance of large terrestrial herbivores through the Holocene.

AB Aim
   To examine how current and historical environmental gradients affect patterns of millipede (Diplopoda) endemism and species turnover in a global hotspot of floristic diversity, and to identify regions of high endemism and taxonomic distinctness for conservation management.
   Location
   South-western Australia.
   Methods
   Museum database records of millipedes (subclasses Pentazonia and Helminthomorpha), supplemented with extensive fieldwork, were used to map species richness, species turnover (beta-diversity), weighted endemism, average taxonomic distinctness and variation in taxonomic distinctness in half-degree grid squares (c. 2500 km2). Generalized linear models were used to examine relationships between these parameters with rainfall (present day and historical), topography and human disturbance (clearing for agriculture and urbanization).
   Results
   Millipede species richness, particularly within the order Spirostreptida, and millipede endemism were positively associated with large within-cell differences in elevation (mountainous regions). Large variation in taxonomic distinctness (unevenness in the taxonomic tree) in higher-rainfall areas was mainly due to speciation within the Spirostreptida genus Atelomastix. Hotspots of millipede endemism and taxonomic distinctness were identified within three categories of importance: primary (Stirling Range East, Cape Le Grand, Cape Arid, Walpole, Porongurups), secondary (Mount Manypeaks, Bremer Bay, Stirling Range West, Duke of Orleans Bay, Ravensthorpe, Albany, Busselton) and tertiary (Nornalup). A species turnover boundary was positively associated with rainfall, broadly located in the transition zone of 300-600 mm year-1.
   Main conclusions
   The current lack of knowledge on the endemism of invertebrates hampers their incorporation into conservation planning. With this knowledge we can identify global biodiversity hotspots and, at a smaller scale, significant conservation areas within a region. Here we have shown that weighted endemism and taxonomic distinctness are useful tools in identifying centres of high endemism and speciation for millipedes within the south-west Australian hotspot. Moreover, it is unlikely that either vertebrates or vascular plants will be useful surrogates for identifying significant areas for invertebrate conservation. While other workers have shown that vascular plants, mammals and frogs have different centres of endemism within south-west Australia, our results show that centres of endemism for millipedes encompass all of these plus other areas.

AB Monitoring of lynx Lynx lynx populations in Scandinavia is largely based around unreplicated minimum counts of family groups, i.e. adult females with dependent kittens. When observations cannot be separated from each other on the basis of back-tracking in the snow it is desirable to use a distance rule to separate observations of groups that are so far apart that they are unlikely to be derived from the same group. We have analysed radio-telemetry derived movement data from five study areas, corresponding to three ecologically different regions, in Scandinavia, and included data from Poland for comparison. We derive examples of two different distance rules; one is a static rule based on home-range size and length which is suitable for observations accumulated during a whole winter, and the other is a dynamic rule suitable for observations collected within 1-7 days of each other. Because of inter-study area variation in home-range size and movement there is a need to use different rules in different regions. Within Scandinavia, average maximum home-range lengths varied from 28 to 54 km, and average maximum daily distances travelled varied from eight to 16 km in the three regions. This implies that locally collected movement data are a prerequisite for application of this type of methodology.

AB Special Protected Areas (SPAS) were established within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in 1997 to address a variety of management goals including coral reef resource protection and recovery. Within these areas all consumptive activities are prohibited. To evaluate whether SPA establishment has resulted in reef assemblage differences on inshore patch reefs, we quantified reef fish abundance and biomass, grazing intensity and benthic cover on abiotically similar protected and reference reefs. Transect surveys indicated that biomass and mean body lengths for several common predatory fish species were significantly greater within SPAS. Size classes of herbivorous fish also varied with protection; adult herbivorous fish were significantly more abundant, while juveniles were significantly less abundant within SPAS. Grazing intensity and benthic cover were site-specific and did not vary consistently with protection, suggesting that SPA establishment has not immediately (within 10 yr) driven observable indirect effects on the benthos.

AB Expansion of the and zone of sub-Saharan tropical Africa during the Miocene is posited as a significant contributing factor in the evolution of contemporary African flora. Nevertheless, few molecular phylogenetic studies have tested this hypothesis using reconstructed historical biogeographies of plants within this zone. Here, we present a molecular phylogeny of Commiphora.. a predominantly tropical African, arid-adapted tree genus, in order to test the monophyly of its taxonomic sections and identify clades that will help direct future study of this species-rich and geographically widespread taxon. We then use multiple fossil calibrations of Commiphora phylogeny to determine the timing of well-supported diversification events within the genus and interpret these age estimates to determine the relative contribution of vicariance and dispersal in the expansion of Commiphora's geographic range. We find that Commiphora is sister to Vietnamese Bursera tonkinensis and that its crown group radiation corresponds with the onset of the Miocene, (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial structures are becoming common features of the landscape in shallow waters of urban areas, but very little is known about their ecology. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), intertidal seawalls replace considerable portions of natural habitats, including rocky shores. Previous studies have shown that seawalls and rocky shores generally support similar assemblages of plants and animals, with important differences in relative abundances of some species. The behaviour of key consumers can have a fundamental role in structuring benthic assemblages, and it is, therefore, necessary to assess whether it is changed by the replacement of natural habitats with artificial structures. This study compares patterns of movement of the common patellid limpet Cellana tramoserica between seawalls and vertical rocky shores. The distances displaced, the orientation of movement and the homing behaviour of marked individuals were recorded from day to day, over a period of several tidal cycles (14 d) and for a longer period (ca. 3 mo), on several seawalls and rocky shores. Short-term patterns of movement (1 to 14 d) did not differ between structures. In contrast, after 3 mo, although the orientation of the movement remained random on both kinds of structures, limpets on seawalls had dispersed longer distances and tended not to retain their original positions. These results suggest that long-term dispersal of C. tramoserica, rather than foraging bouts, could be altered by the replacement of rocky shores with artificial structures. Differences in use of habitat by key consumers should be incorporated in models aimed at identifying the mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of different assemblages on natural and artificial structures.

AB 1 Effects of fire on the demography of a population of a long-lived perennial tussock grass, Hyparrhenia diplandra, were investigated in a West African savanna that normally burns annually. Seedling growth, survival and fecundity were recorded in burned and unburned plots during 3 years for a first cohort and during 1 year for a second cohort initiated 1 year later.
   2 Seedling growth and survival rates were significantly higher in unburned plots, with larger seedlings surviving burning better. Regardless of treatment/fire regime, seedlings grew faster when located further from the nearest tuft, but differences between clones showed that growth rate also had a genetic basis in this apomictic species. Adult survival was always high, but exclusion of fire increased size, and therefore age, at maturity. Fire therefore affects life-history traits in this grass species of fire-prone environments.
   3 Size-structured matrix models were constructed separately for each fire treatment, incorporating demographic and fire parameters estimated from field data.
   4 The asymptotic population growth rate was higher in the unburned model (lambda = 1.23) than in the burned one (lambda = 1.07), indicating that the population of H. diplandra expanded quickly in the absence of fire.
   5 Overall, results indicate that annual burning limits population growth rate. Less frequent, but still regular fires may allow establishment while preventing the accumulation of litter and accelerating nutrient recycling; thus lead to more stable populations than in the total absence of fire.

AB Low water availability is a leading contributor to mortality of woody seedlings on grasslands, including those of the invasive shrub Prosopis. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration could favor some genotypes of this species over others if there exists intraspecific variation in the responsiveness of survivorship to CO2. To investigate such variation, we studied effects of CO2 enrichment on seedling survival in response to uniform rates of soil water depletion in six maternal families of honey mesquite (P. glandulosa Torr. var, glandulosa). Three families each from the arid and mesic extremes of the species' distribution in the southwestern United States were studied in environmentally controlled glasshouses. Relative water content at turgor loss and osmotic potential were not affected by CO2 treatment. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentration, however, increased growth, leaf production and area, and midday xylem pressure potential, and apparently reduced transpiration per unit leaf area of seedlings as soil dried. Consequently, CO2 enrichment about doubled the fraction of seedlings that survived soil water depletion. Maternal families of honey mesquite differed in percentage survival of drought and in several other characteristics, but differences were of similar or of smaller magnitude compared with differences between CO2 treatments. There was no evidence for genetic variation in the responsiveness of survivorship to CO2. By increasing seedling survival of drought, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration could increase the abundance of honey mesquite where establishment is limited by water availability. Genetic types with superior ability to survive drought today, however, apparently will maintain that advantage in the future.

AB The objective of this study was to examine the impact of provision of perennial water supply, as a management strategy to enhance game viewing, on herbaceous vegetation. Changes in herbaceous species composition and functional characteristics were investigated in relation to (1) distance from perennial and ephemeral surface water (spatial component), and (2) change over a 16-year period (1980-1996; temporal component). Herbaceous functional characteristics revealed a gradient of herbivore utilization in relation to proximity to perennial and ephemeral water. Herbaceous composition change since 1980 revealed significant deterioration in range condition. It has been hypothesized that the implications of an abundance of perennial water for game are made manifest by drought conditions and that a history of heavy utilization by herbivores prevents or inhibits recovery of the herbaceous vegetation to its pre-drought state.

AB This paper compares the occurrence of plant traits in five edaphically matched sites at the Barrens, southwestern Australia and the Agulhas Plain, southwestern South Africa. The two regions are very closely matched in terms of their Mediterranean-type climates, landforms, soil types and disturbance regimes. On both continents, matched sites on all substrata (siliceous sand, quartzite, laterite, limestone and calcareous sand) support sclerophyllous shrublands with a similar mix of growth forms. Soils from all substrata in both Australia and South Africa are extremely nutrient-poor except for the calcareous sands where high levels of phosphorus were recorded. Contrary to expectations, Australian soils are not generally less fertile than their South African counterparts. The frequency of species in different leaf consistence categories was similar on the two continents, as was the leaf specific mass of overstorey shrubs from all substrata. Woody plants with leaf spines are significantly more frequent on Australian nutrient-poor substrata. Among woody plants, species with canopy-stored seed are significantly more frequent on Australian nutrient-poor sites, whereas species with bird-dispersed fruits and inter-fire germination are significantly more frequent on South African timestone and calcareous sand. There was good evidence for convergence between the two continents in the frequency of other seed biological traits. The study indicates strong convergence between Australian and South African shrublands in the frequency of a wide range of traits relating to plant form and function. Examples of non-convergence are probably due to regional and historical processes rather than differences in the contemporary physical environments of the two study areas.

AB Of a total of 273 trees and 91 lianas species for a tropical rain forest at SE Veracruz, Mexico, 68 species (18.7%) are wind dispersed. The anemochorous syndrome is represented better in lianas (42.9% of the species), while trees are predominately zoochorous (80.9%). Specifically, data in relation to the phenology and frequency of diaspore type for 59 anemochorous species trees and lianas are presented. At the community level, winged diaspores predominate (45 species, 76.3%); nonwinged species are much less common. Of a total of 20 families, Bignoniaceae, Leguminosae, and Malpighiaceae are the families with the most species 14, 7, and 6 taxa respectively; all have winged diaspores. For both life forms flowering is highly correlated with the late dry season. Fruiting has two peaks, the first one late in the dry, hot season ("secas"), and the second one in the late wet season, when precipitation is high and temperature is low ("nortes"). The period of fruiting in trees and lianas is clearly separated in time. Dispersal by trees is concentrated in "secas", while dispersal by lianas is more frequent during "nortes." The fruiting in relation to diaspore type revealed two patterns. Plumed diaspores were more abundant during "secas" independent of life form. In contrast, species with winged diaspores had a bimodal distribution, one during "secas" and the other one during "nortes", the latter was due primarily to fruiting lianas.

AB Life histories of two coexisting Anostracan species, inhabiting a group of mountain ponds in Latium (Pantani di Forca Canapine) are described and discussed, with particular regard to hatching requirements, growth rate, fecundity and life span.
   Unlike previously assumed (Mura, 1985), the cysts of the two species Tanymastix stagnalis and Chirocephalus diaphanus seem to respond to the same hatching stimuli, since their nauplii coexist and can be separated by morphological differences.
   Significant differences recorded as to size, time in attaining sexual maturity, fecundity and life span, are in favour of a niche separation by size and by time. In particular, size differences are supposed to reflect significant differences also at filtering apparatus level, thus allowing prey selection by size.

AB Large-bodied predators are well represented among the world's threatened and endangered species. A significant body of literature shows that in terrestrial and marine ecosystems large predators can play important roles in ecosystem structure and functioning. By contrast, the ecological roles and importance of large predators within freshwater ecosystems are poorly understood, constraining the design and implementation of optimal conservation strategies for freshwater ecosystems. Conservationists and environmentalists frequently promulgate ecological roles that crocodylians are assumed to fulfil, but often with limited evidence supporting those claims. Here, we review the available information on the ecological importance of crocodylians, a widely distributed group of predominantly freshwater-dwelling, large-bodied predators. We synthesise information regarding the role of crocodylians under five criteria within the context of modern ecological concepts: as indicators of ecological health, as ecosystem engineers, apex predators, keystone species, and as contributors to nutrient and energy translocation across ecosystems. Some crocodylians play a role as indicators of ecosystem health, but this is largely untested across the order Crocodylia. By contrast, the role of crocodylian activities in ecosystem engineering is largely anecdotal, and information supporting their assumed role as apex predators is currently limited to only a few species. Whether crocodylians contribute significantly to nutrient and energy translocation through cross-ecosystem movements is unknown. We conclude that most claims regarding the importance of crocodylians as apex predators, keystone species, ecosystem engineers, and as contributors to nutrient and energy translocation across ecosystems are mostly unsubstantiated speculation, drawn from anecdotal observations made during research carried out primarily for other purposes. There is a paucity of biological research targeted directly at: understanding population dynamics; trophic interactions within their ecological communities; and quantifying the short- and long-term ecological impacts of crocodylian population declines, extirpations, and recoveries. Conservation practices ideally need evidence-based planning, decision making and justification. Addressing the knowledge gaps identified here will be important for achieving effective conservation of crocodylians.

AB The distance travelled by marine larvae varies by seven orders of magnitude. Dispersal shapes marine biodiversity, and must be understood if marine systems are to be well managed. Because warmer temperatures quicken larval development, larval durations might be systematically shorter in the tropics relative to those at high latitudes. Nevertheless, life history and hydrodynamics also covary with latitude-these also affect dispersal, precluding any clear expectation of how dispersal changes at a global scale. Here we combine data from the literature encompassing >750 marine organisms from seven phyla with oceanographic data on current speeds, to quantify the overall latitudinal gradient in larval dispersal distance. We find that planktonic duration increased with latitude, confirming predictions that temperature effects outweigh all others across global scales. However, while tropical species have the shortest planktonic durations, realized dispersal distances were predicted to be greatest in the tropics and at high latitudes, and lowest at mid-latitudes. At high latitudes, greater dispersal distances were driven by moderate current speed and longer planktonic durations. In the tropics, fast currents overwhelmed the effect of short planktonic durations. Our results contradict previous hypotheses based on biology or physics alone; rather, biology and physics together shape marine dispersal patterns.
   Analysing data on egg size and planktonic duration from >750 marine species with a larval period, the authors show that temperature, life-history and oceanographic processes interact to shape peaks of dispersal at low and high latitudes.

AB 1. Following the removal of invasive plant species, most land managers rely on natural succession to re-establish native plant communities. However, insufficient native propagule pressure combined with legacy effects of invasive plant species means that passive approaches to restoration are often inadequate to establish native communities and prevent reinvasion.
   2. In this paper, we review literature evaluating the ability of active revegetation to suppress re-establishment of invaders in grasslands and woodlands.
   3. We find that existing literature consistently demonstrates reduced performance of invasive plant species in revegetated grasslands, but that the magnitude of impact on invasive plants is highly variable. In contrast, the efficacy of revegetation in woodlands has rarely been reported, but the small number of such studies are consistent with results from grasslands.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our review highlights the mechanisms that lead to revegetation suppressing invasive plants in grasslands and identifies knowledge gaps associated with revegetation using woody species or targeting woody invaders. We recommend concerted efforts be made to evaluate the viability of woody plant revegetation and the efficacy of revegetation in woodlands. Furthermore, we suggest that land managers may need to embrace novel species assemblages in order to prevent reinvasion.

AB Understanding connectivity patterns has implications for evolutionary and ecological processes, as well as for proper conservation strategies. This study examined population genetic structure and migration patterns of the coral Mussismilia hispida, one of the main reef builders in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. For this, 15 sites were sampled along its entire distributional range employing 10 microsatellite loci. M. hispida was divided into five genetically differentiated populations by Structure analysis. Population structure and migration estimates are consistent with present-day oceanographic current patterns, zones of upwelling and historical sea-level changes. The Central Region and Oceanic Islands populations had the highest genetic diversity, were possibly the main sources of migrants for other populations and presented mutual migrant exchange. This mutual exchange and the high diversity of Oceanic Islands, a peripherical population, is highly interesting and unexpected, but can be explained if these sites acted as refugia in past low sea-level stance. This is the first connectivity study in the region using hyper-variable markers and a fine sampling scale along 3,500 km. These results enlighten the population dynamics of an important reef building species and shows how oceanographic processes may act as barriers to dispersal for marine species, providing valuable information for management strategies.

AB Africa's southern Cape is a key region for the evolution of our species, with early symbolic systems, marine faunal exploitation, and episodic production of microlithic stone tools taken as evidence for the appearance of distinctively complex human behavior. However, the temporally discontinuous nature of this evidence precludes ready assumptions of intrinsic adaptive benefit, and has encouraged diverse explanations for the occurrence of these behaviors, in terms of regional demographic, social and ecological conditions. Here, we present a new high-resolution multi-proxy record of environmental change that indicates that faunal exploitation patterns and lithic technologies track climatic variation across the last 22,300 years in the southern Cape. Conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum and deglaciation were humid, and zooarchaeological data indicate high foraging returns. By contrast, the Holocene is characterized by much drier conditions and a degraded resource base. Critically, we demonstrate that systems for technological delivery or provisioning were responsive to changing humidity and environmental productivity. However, in contrast to prevailing models, bladelet-rich microlithic technologies were deployed under conditions of high foraging returns and abandoned in response to increased aridity and less productive subsistence environments. This suggests that posited links between microlithic technologies and subsistence risk are not universal, and the behavioral sophistication of human populations is reflected in their adaptive flexibility rather than in the use of specific technological systems.

AB Context Resilience, the ability to recover from disturbance, has risen to the forefront of scientific policy, but is difficult to quantify, particularly in large, forested landscapes subject to disturbances, management, and climate change.
   Objectives Our objective was to determine which spatial drivers will control landscape resilience over the next century, given a range of plausible climate projections across north-central Minnesota.
   Methods Using a simulation modelling approach, we simulated wind disturbance in a 4.3 million ha forested landscape in north-central Minnesota for 100 years under historic climate and five climate change scenarios, combined with four management scenarios: business as usual (BAU), maximizing economic returns ('EcoGoods'), maximizing carbon storage ('EcoServices'), and climate change adaption ('CCAdapt'). To estimate resilience, we examined sites where simulated windstorms removed > 70% of the biomass and measured the difference in biomass and species composition after 50 years.
   Results Climate change lowered resilience, though there was wide variation among climate change scenarios. Resilience was explained more by spatial variation in soils than climate. We found that BAU, EcoGoods and EcoServices harvest scenarios were very similar; CCAdapt was the only scenario that demonstrated consistently higher resilience under climate change. Although we expected spatial patterns of resilience to follow ownership patterns, it was contingent upon whether lands were actively managed.
   Conclusions Our results demonstrate that resilience may be lower under climate change and that the effects of climate change could overwhelm current management practices. Only a substantial shift in simulated forest practices was successful in promoting resilience.

AB Nitellopsis obtusa (starry stonewort) is a dioecious green alga native to Europe and Asia that has emerged as an aquatic invasive species in North America. Nitellopsis obtusa is rare across large portions of its native range, but has spread rapidly in northern-tier lakes in the United States, where it can interfere with recreation and may displace native species. Little is known about the invasion ecology of N. obtusa, making it difficult to forecast future expansion. Using ecological niche modeling we investigated environmental variables associated with invasion risk. We used species records, climate data, and remotely sensed environmental variables to characterize the species' multidimensional distribution. We found that N. obtusa is exploiting novel ecological niche space in its introduced range, which may help explain its invasiveness. While the fundamental niche of N. obtusa may be stable, there appears to have been a shift in its realized niche associated with invasion in North America. Large portions of the United States are predicted to constitute highly suitable habitat for N. obtusa. Our results can inform early detection and rapid response efforts targeting N. obtusa and provide testable estimates of the physiological tolerances of this species as a baseline for future empirical research.

AB Few studies have successfully monitored community-wide phenological patterns in seasonally flooded Amazonian varzea forests, where a prolonged annual flood pulse arguably generates the greatest degree of seasonality of any low-latitude ecosystem on Earth. We monitored the vegetative and reproductive plant phenology of varzea (VZ) floodplain and adjacent terra firme (TF) forests within two contiguous protected areas in western Brazilian Amazonia, using three complementary methods: monthly canopy observations of 1056 individuals (TF: 556, VZ: 500), twice monthly collections from 0.5-m(2) litterfall traps within two 100-ha plots (1 TF, 1 VZ; 96 traps per plot), and monthly ground surveys of residual fruit-fall along transect-grids within each 100-ha plot (12 km per plot). Surveys encompassed the entire annual flood cycle and employed a floating trap design to cope with fluctuating water levels. Phenology patterns were generally similar in both forest types. Leaffall peaked during the aquatic phase in varzea forest and the dry season in terra firme. Flowering typically followed leaffall and leaf flush, extending into the onset of the terrestrial phase and rainy season in varzea and terra firme, respectively. Abiotic seed dispersal modes were relatively more prevalent in varzea than terra firme; the main contrast in fruiting seasonality was more likely a result of differences in community composition and relative abundance of seed dispersal modes than differences within individual genera. We emphasize the difficulty in distinguishing the role of the flood pulse from other seasonal environmental variables without multiannual data or spatially replicated studies across the spectrum of Amazonian forest types.

AB Aim Although existing bioregional classification schemes often consider the compositional affinities within regional biotas, they do not typically incorporate phylogenetic information explicitly. Because phylogeny captures information on the evolutionary history of taxa, it provides a powerful tool for delineating biogeographical boundaries and for establishing relationships among them. Here, we present the first vegetation delineation of the woody flora of southern Africa based upon evolutionary relationships.
   Location Southern Africa.
   Methods We used a published time-calibrated phylogenetic tree for 1400 woody plant species along with their geographical distributions and a metric of phylogenetic beta diversity to generate a phylogenetic delineation of the woody vegetation of southern Africa. We then explored environmental correlates of phylogenetic turnover between them, and the evolutionary distinctiveness of the taxa within them.
   Results We identified 15 phylogenetically distinct biogeographical units, here referred to as phyloregions. The largest phyloregion broadly overlaps with Savanna vegetation, while the phyloregion overlapping with the south-western portion of the Fynbos biome is the most evolutionarily distinct. Potential evapotranspiration and mean annual temperature differ significantly among phyloregions and correlate with patterns of phylogenetic beta diversity between them. Our phylogeny-based delimitation of southern Africa's woody vegetation broadly matches currently recognized phytogeographical classifications, but also highlights parts of the Namib Karoo and Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park as distinct, but previously under-recognized biogeographical units.
   Main conclusions Our analysis provides new insights into the structure and phylogenetic relationships among the woody flora of southern Africa. We show that evolutionary affinities differentiate phyloregions closely resembling existing vegetation classifications, yet also identify 'cryptic' phyloregions that are as evolutionarily distinct as some of the recognized African vegetation types.

AB Aims
   When sympatric flowering plant species in a natural community share pollinators, study of plant-plant interactions via interspecific pollen transfer (IPT) is essential for understanding species coexistence. However, little is known about the extent of IPT between interactive species and its causes.
   Methods
   To explore how sympatric flowering plants sharing pollinators minimize deleterious effects of IPT, we investigated the pollination ecology of two endemic species, Salvia przewalskii and Delphinium yuanum, in an alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains, southwest China. We quantified conspecific and interspecific visits by shared bumblebee pollinators, amounts of pollen placed on different body sites of the pollinators and stigmatic pollen loads on open-pollinated flowers. To examine whether IPT affects female fitness, we measured pollen germination and seed production in the two species in an artificial pollination experiment.
   Important Findings
   One bumblebee species, Bombus trifasciatus, was found to be the sole effective pollinator for the two coflowering species. Pollination experiments indicated that deposition of heterospecific pollen could significantly decrease seed set in both species. Experiments showed that S. przewalskii pollen could germinate well on stigmas of D. yuanum, inhibiting conspecific pollen germination in D. yuanum. However, seed set was not lower under open pollination than under cross-pollination within species, suggesting that no female fitness loss was caused by IPT. In foraging bouts with pollinator switches, switches from S. przewalskii to D. yuanum were relatively more frequent (8.27%) than the converse (1.72%). However, IPT from S. przewalskii to D. yuanum accounted for only 1.82% of total stigmatic pollen loads while the reverse IPT to S. przewalskii was 8.70%, indicating that more switches of bumblebees to D. yuanum did not result in higher IPT. By contrast, selection for reduced IPT to S. przewalskii would limit pollinator switches from D. yuanum. We found that a bumblebee generally carried pollen grains from both species but the two species differed in the position of pollen placement on the bumblebee's body; S. przewalskii's pollen was concentrated on the dorsal thorax while D. yuanum's pollen was concentrated ventrally on the head. This differential pollen placement along with pollinator fidelity largely reduced IPT between the two species with a shared pollinator.

AB In aquaculture, probiotics have been tested for enhancing the immune system and promoting growth and survival rate of many marine species like shrimp and mollusks. In order to isolate bacteria with a high probiotic potential for marine shellfish aquaculture, homogenates of the gastrointestinal tract from adult mangrove cockle, Anadara tuberculosa, were obtained to perform in vitro and in vivo assays. Isolates were tested in vitro for hemolytic activity, hydrophobicity, tolerance to ammonia nitrogen, salinity and pH as well as for growth kinetics, extracellular enzymatic activity, autoaggregation, coaggregation and molecular identification. Three bacteria with high degree of hydrophobicity (>60% adherence to p-xylene) and four bacteria with medium hydrophobicity, which showed different patterns of attachment to monopolar solvents (chloroform and ethyl acetate) and a high tolerance to ammonia nitrogen (200 mg L-1), were selected. Six different treatments: T1 (without addition of cultured bacteria); T2 (MAt29, Enterococcus casseliflavus); T3 (MAt35, Citrobacter koseri); T4 (GAtB1, Bacillus subtilis subtilis); T5 (GAt7, Staphylococcus sp.); and T6 (1:1:1:1 mix of strains T2, T3, T4 and T5), were used to evaluate the specific growth rate, and cellular immune response of the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. The best specific growth rate was observed for T6 and T4 treatments related to Bacillus subtilis subtilis. A significant difference in total hemocytes count (P < 0.05) was found for T4 treatment with respect to control group. Strains isolated from A. tuberculosa had a beneficial effect on the growth and immune response of L. vannamei, so they have potential use as probiotics in aquaculture of marine shellfish.

AB It is increasingly accepted that coastal habitats such as inshore coral reefs do not function in isolation but rather as part of a larger habitat network. In the Caribbean, trophic subsidies from habitats adjacent to coral reefs support the diet of reef fishes, but it is not known whether similar trophic links occur on reefs in the Indo-Pacific. Here, we test whether reef fishes in inshore coral, mangrove, and seagrass habitats are supported by trophic links. We used carbon stable isotopes and mathematical mixing models to determine the minimum proportion of resources from mangrove or seagrass habitats in the diet of five fish species from coral reefs at varying distances (0-2,200 m) from these habitats in Moreton Bay, Queensland, eastern Australia. Of the fish species that are more abundant on reefs near to mangroves, Lutjanus russelli and Acanthopagrus australis showed no minimum use of diet sources from mangrove habitat. Siganus fuscescens utilized a minimum of 25-44 % mangrove sources and this contribution increased with the proximity of reefs to mangroves (R (2) = 0.91). Seagrass or reef flat sources contributed a minimum of 14-78 % to the diet of Diagramma labiosum, a species found in higher abundance on reefs near seagrass beds, but variation in diet among reefs was unrelated to seascape structure. Seagrass or reef flat sources also contributed a minimum of 8-55 % to a fish species found only on reefs (Pseudolabrus guentheri), indicating that detrital subsidies from these habitats may subsidize fish diet on reefs. These results suggest that carbon sources from multiple habitats contribute to the functioning of inshore coral reef ecosystems and that trophic connectivity between reefs and mangroves may enhance production of a functionally important herbivore.

AB The construction of linear transport infrastructure has severe effects on ecosystem functions and properties, and the restoration of the associated roadslopes contributes to reduce its impact. This restoration is usually approached from the perspective of plant cover regeneration, ignoring plant-soil interactions and the consequences for plant growth. The addition of a 30 cm layer of topsoil is a common practice in roadslope restoration projects to increase vegetation recovery. However topsoil is a scarce resource. This study assesses the effects of topsoil spreading and its depth (10 to 30 cm) on two surrogates of microbial activity (beta-glucosidase and phosphatase enzymes activity and soil respiration), and on plant cover, plant species richness and floristic composition of embankment vegetation. The study also evaluates the differences in selected physic-chemical properties related to soil fertility between topsoil and the original embankment substrate. Topsoil was found to have higher values of organic matter (11%), nitrogen (44%), assimilable phosphorous (50%) and silt content (54%) than the original embankment substrate. The topsoil spreading treatment increased microbial activity, and its application increased beta-glucosidase activity (45%), phosphatase activity (57%) and soil respiration (60%). Depth seemed to affect soil respiration, beta-glucosidase and phosphatase activity. Topsoil application also enhanced the species richness of restored embankments in relation to controls. Nevertheless, the depth of the spread topsoil did not significantly affect the resulting plant cover, species richness or floristic composition, suggesting that both depths could have similar effects on short-term recovery of the vegetation cover. A significant implication of these results is that it permits the application of thinner topsoil layers, with major savings in this scarce resource during the subsequent slope restoration work, but the quality of topsoil relative to the original substrate should be previously assessed on a site by site basis.

AB Future moderate changes in evaporation and precipitation regimes could have pronounced effects on zooplankton populations in small and temporary aquatic habitats, by causing higher salinity and a shorter wet phase and by reducing passive dispersal via hydrological connections between pools and increasing it by exposing propagules to the wind.
   Using a hydrological model, we simulated various climate change scenarios in a natural cluster of temporary rock pools in South Africa.
   In our simulations, a shift towards a drier climate was associated with reduced permanence and increased conductivity, resulting in a lower percentage of inundations sufficient for the hatching, growth and reproduction of aquatic organisms (up to a 21% decline for a fairy shrimp). Connections between pools by overflowing occurred less frequently (by up to 28%). However, more frequent desiccation events (by up to 15%) led to increased exposure of dormant propagules to wind, possibly promoting dispersal within the pool cluster but also leading to losses from the propagule bank.
   Our results suggest that environmental change might not only affect local (within-pool) selection pressures but also regional dynamics in rock pool metapopulations and communities.

AB The ability to discriminate between open vegetation and closed forest in the fossil record is constrained by a paucity of suitable proxies. Taxonomy-based proxies (especially the floristic composition of fossil pollen assemblages) provide the main tool for inferring vegetation type but this approach can be confounded by evolutionary changes in ecology, especially for ancient fossil assemblages. This paper considers a range of indicators of open vegetation that can be observed on fossil leaves. We show that the presence of amphistomatic leaves (i.e. leaves with stomata on both upper and lower surfaces) is unambiguously associated with open vegetation in the ecologically diverse family Proteaceae. This linkage shows very high levels of evolutionary convergence and the relationship is not explained by climate. Similar relationships are also present in a wide range of other plant groups. The combination of these empirical correlations and physiological theory suggests that there is a strong functional link between amphistomatic leaves and open vegetation. Theory says that amphistomy increases the efficiency of water transport and gas exchange by allowing two layers of high performance photosynthetic tissue to be proximal to sources of both carbon dioxide (stomata) and water (veins). However these benefits come at the cost of requiring thick leaves, which are inefficient in shaded environments. Other leaf characteristics observable on fossils (especially very thick cuticles, the presence of thick lignified hypodermal layers and the presence of deeply encrypted stomata) may also indicate the presence of open vegetation, although the functional links between these traits and vegetation type are more indirect. We propose that amphistomatic fossil leaves of dicotyledonous angiosperms provide a strong proxy for open vegetation but any inference will be enhanced by evidence from alternative proxies. We also provide an example of the application of this proxy. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Topsoil is the preferred substrate for areas requiring rehabilitation after bauxite mining. However, topsoil is sometimes lacking and so there is a need to test the suitability of other, locally available substrates. In an abandoned bauxite mine in Southeastern Brazil, small patches of native vegetation spontaneously established in shallow depressions over weathered laterite, suggesting that granulometric reduction may have facilitated the establishment of plants. To test this hypothesis, blocks of laterite collected in the area were crushed to simulate texture observed in the vegetation patches. Topsoil collected in a preserved ferruginous field near to the extraction area was also used as a substrate in which Eremanthus erythropappus seedlings, a native woody species, were grown. Seedlings were cultivated without fertilizers in these two substrates and also directly over the exposed and uncrushed laterite. The species proved to be very promising for the revegetation, showing a high survival rate in all substrates. Higher annual growth rates and higher final biomass values were observed in topsoil, but the granulometric reduction of laterite doubled plant growth rate in comparison to the exposed laterite. This result was likely due to the increased availability of essential nutrients to plants and to the improvement in physical conditions for root growth and functioning. Moreover, seedling allometry was not altered by the type of substrate, suggesting that the species was highly tolerant to the new substrate conditions, a fundamental characteristic for success of revegetation of bauxite extraction degraded areas.

AB The Atlantic blue crab Callinectes sapidus is an important fisheries resource that is subject to mortality and morbidity from hemolymph infections. We used culture-independent methods based on the analysis of 16S rRNA genes to characterize and quantify the microflora from the carapace, gut, and hemolymph of C. sapidus with the goals of (1) characterizing the C. sapidus microbial assemblage and (2) identifying the reservoirs of potential pathogens associated with the crab. We found that the carapace, gut and hemolymph microflora have a core Proteobacteria community with contributions from other phyla including Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Spirochetes, and Tenericutes. Within this Proteobacteria core, gamma-Proteobacteria, including the members of the Vibrionaceae that are closely related to potential pathogens, dominate. Bacteria closely related to hemolymph pathogens were found on the carapace, supporting the hypothesis that punctures, molting damage, or broken dactyls may be routes for hemolymph infections. These results provide some of the first data on the blue crab microbial assemblage obtained with culture-independent techniques and offer insights into the routes of infection and potential bacterial pathogens associated with blue crabs.

AB A sand-dwelling Mediterranean ant, Cataglyphis cursor, recently was discovered to engage in two new forms of rescue behaviour, behavioural patterns that require would-be rescuers to recognize what, exactly, holds nestmates in place. That is, when sand digging and limb pulling, two well-known forms of rescue in ants, did not result in release of victims ensnared with nylon thread and partially buried beneath the sand, rescuers next began to transport sand away from the snare and to direct their behaviour to the snare in particular, biting and tugging at the snare itself. To determine whether these new forms of precisely directed rescue behaviour, as well as their exclusive delivery to nestmates, as in C. cursor, were characteristic of other ants occupying similar ecological niches, we conducted experiments with five sand-dwelling Mediterranean ant species: Cataglyphis floricola, Lasius grandis, Aphaenogaster senilis, Messor barbarus and Messor marocanus. Our experiments revealed the full range of rescue behaviour, including snare biting and sand transport, in two species, C. floricola and L. grandis. Both species directed rescue exclusively towards nestmates, treating other individuals, even conspecifics, with aggression, thus highlighting the ants' discriminative capacities. Differences in the performance of rescue behaviour between these and the remaining species mirror differences in their ecology, including the threat of predatory antlions. Finally, because this precisely directed and exclusively delivered rescue behaviour in ants resembles behaviour that has been labelled empathy in rats, our results demonstrate that what can appear to be complex, cognitively motivated behaviour might come about through much simpler mechanisms.

AB Ecological restoration has a growing role in policy aimed at reversing the widespread effects of environmental degradation. It includes activities to assist the recovery of ecosystem structure and function, and the associated provision of goods and services. Rooted in ecological theory, ecological restoration requires an integrated approach of different disciplines; including soil science, hydrology and conservation biology, together with the relevant socioeconomical and political frameworks. Ecological restoration interventions also rely on applied fields such as agronomy, horticulture and forestry. We clarify some of the main approaches and challenges of ecological restoration in order to encourage cooperation of professionals with a wide array of background and skills needed for successful restoration practices. We also discuss the diverse impacts of ecological restoration on ecosystems and societies. Restoration of soil quality together with improved nutrient cycling, water retention, pollination services and regulation of soil erosion can benefit traditional agricultural production through improved crop or forage production. It also enhances the provision of other important ecosystem services, including clean water, wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration and recreation. Payments for such ecosystem services are a growing source of income for rural inhabitants. Ecological restoration can also create new job opportunities in rural areas, e.g. nature-based tourism, game hunting and businesses based on native plant materials. Agricultural extension services should support these kinds of initiatives by putting ecological restoration to a larger degree on their agenda and provide expertise in this field.

AB Tiger Sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, are large top-level predators usually solitary as adults. Observation of their scavenging activity on the carcass of a dead whale offered a rare opportunity for better understanding the pattern of intra-specific behaviour within the aggregations of these large predators. In January 2002, the stranding, subsequent death and consumption of a 17.4m total length (TL) blue whale, Balaenoptera musculus, was observed and filmed in Prony Bay, southern New Caledonia. After three weeks of confinement in the bay, the cetacean was killed by adult bullsharks Carcharhinus leucas. The first adult Tiger Shark was subsequently observed around the carcass after 36h. The fat slicks from the carcass attracted further Tiger Sharks which arrived after an additional 24h. The use of photo-identification on video footage collected during four observation sessions over an eight-day period identified 46 individual Tiger Sharks (primarily adult females between 3.3 and 4m TL) participating in the feeding aggregation. Only four animals were identified in two seperate observation sessions (over two consecutive days), suggesting a short-term residency pattern of several hours (<36h) around the carcass. As the arrival time of Tiger Sharks to the carcass differed, most arrivals of a new participant were followed by a frenzied period of intense intra-specific interaction. Different biting and agonistic behaviours were demonstrated by the Tiger Sharks on the carcass, including three new behaviours previously undescribed for this species. Size and level of aggressiveness appeared to be the determining factors of dominance amongst Tiger Sharks. These observations and analysis demonstrate that systematic study of feeding aggregations supported by photo-identification could contribute to knowledge of large shark ecology when coupled with capture-recapture, genetic fingerprinting and tagging techniques.

AB Microorganisms play integral roles in the cycling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) for fish and shellfish production. We quantified the pathways of shrimp fecal bacterial activities and their role in C- and N-flux partitioning relevant to culturing Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei, in RAS. Freshly produced feces from P. vannamei contained 0.6-7 x 1010 bacteria g-1 dry wt belonging to Bacteroidetes (7%), Alphaproteobacteria (4%), and, within the Gammaproteobacteria, almost exclusively to the genus Vibrio (61%). Because of partial disintegration of the feces (up to 27% within 12 h), the experimental seawater became inoculated with fecal bacteria. Bacteria grew rapidly in the feces and in the seawater, and exhibited high levels of aminopeptidase, chitinase, chitobiase, alkaline phosphatase, alpha- and beta-glucosidase, and lipase activities. Moreover, fecal bacteria enriched the protein content of the feces within 12 h, potentially enriching the feces for the coprophagous shrimp. The bacterial turnover time was much faster in feces (1-10 h) than in mature RAS water (350 h). Thus, shrimp fecal bacteria not only inoculate RAS water but also contribute to bacterial abundance and productivity, and regulate system processes important for shrimp health.

AB P>1. Small fenced reserves are perceived to require management interventions to maintain ecosystems in a natural state. Such interventions are typically initiated and assessed on the basis of short-term observations, while slow changes are often misunderstood or missed entirely. Long-term monitoring is therefore crucial to understand the effect of reserve management on ecosystem structure and functioning.
   2. We analysed a 15-year data set of herbaceous vegetation data for 59 monitoring sites in two nature reserves of different size and with different management regimes in a semi-arid, South African savanna. Community composition and vegetation structure (basal cover) were assessed in response to rainfall and management variables.
   3. No directional changes over time were found. Basal cover as measured by two proxies (distance to the nearest tuft and tuft diameter) increased with current and previous year rainfall. The relative abundance of functional groups also responded to rainfall, with perennial grasses increasing in relative abundance following a wet year. Compositional responses, as measured by a dissimilarity index of species relative abundance, showed a 2-year lag and responses were larger following dry years than wet years.
   4. The response to rainfall of distance to the nearest tuft was significantly weaker in the smaller reserve, while compositional change during dry years was larger than in the larger reserve.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Most of the variation in herbaceous basal cover and community composition was associated with differences between years (time) at each site, rather than with differences between sites (space), indicating that inter-annual variation in rainfall is the most important driver of herbaceous layer dynamics in these systems. However, management did modify the effects of rainfall on herbaceous structure and community composition. The smaller reserve, which had higher grazer and waterhole density, showed greater fluctuations in key herbaceous variables. Such reserves are common in southern Africa and probably require more careful management than larger reserves in the face of global climate change.

AB Questions
   Is it possible to develop an expert system to provide reliable automatic identifications of plant communities at the precision level of phytosociological associations? How can unreliable expert-based knowledge be discarded before applying supervised classification methods?
   Material
   We used 3677 releves from Catalonia (Spain), belonging to eight orders of terrestrial vegetation. These releves were classified by experts into 222 low-level units (associations or sub-associations).
   Methods
   We reproduced low-level, expert-defined vegetation units as independent fuzzy clusters using the Possibilistic C-means algorithm. Those releves detected as transitional between vegetation types were excluded in order to maximize the number of units numerically reproduced. Cluster centroids were then considered static and used to perform supervised classifications of vegetation data. Finally, we evaluated the classifier's ability to correctly identify the unit of both typical (i.e. training) and transitional releves.
   Results
   Only 166 out of 222 (75%) of the original units could be numerically reproduced. Almost all the unrecognized units were sub-associations. Among the original releves, 61% were deemed transitional or untypical. Typical releves were correctly identified 95% of the time, while the efficiency of the classifier for transitional data was only 64%. However, if the second classifier's choice was also considered, the rate of correct classification for transitional releves was 80%.
   Conclusions
   Our approach stresses the transitional nature of releve data obtained from vegetation databases. Releve selection is justified in order to adequately represent the vegetation concepts associated with expert-defined units.

AB The food habits of the Broad-snouted Caiman (Caiman latirostris) were studied in northwestern Uruguay. The most common prey were insects, the shrimp Pseudopalaemon bouvieri, the snail Pomacea canaliculata, fish and birds. Spiders, crabs, amphibians, snakes, turtles and mammals were consumed less frequently. Arthropods were the most frequent prey for juvenile caiman. Fish and snails were consumed by all size classes. The proportion of stomach contents with invertebrates decreased with increasing caiman size, and that with vertebrates was greater in the diet of larger caiman. Diet composition and ontogenetic shift are similar to that of other crocodilians considered as opportunistic generalist predators.

AB The Forestry and Forest Products Research Centre (CSIR), University of KwaZulu-Natal and MONDI Business Paper have recently embarked on a remote sensing cooperative. The primary focus of this cooperative is to explore the potential benefits associated with using remote sensing for forestry-related activities. A subproject within the cooperative is exploring the utility of various remote sensing technologies for forest structural assessment. This paper reports on the primary findings of a state-of-the-art review conducted by members of the cooperative and seeks to inform and contribute to the development of focused research projects.. Both active and passive sensors are reviewed at varying spatial scales focusing primarily on accuracies attained. Medium-resolution studies focus on contextual forest attributes while high-resolution studies focused on location-based forest variables. Results from research consulted indicate that while remote sensing has a strong theoretical background, there are several limiting factors that need to be explored within a South African context. These include the saturation of satellite signals in mature forests, underestimation of tree heights using LiDAR data and the cost of LiDAR surveys. The review ends with recommendations for future research activities.

AB The range of a marine species varies with a wide range of factors including temperature, currents, interspecific interactions and available habitat. Invasive species offer insights into the processes that influence range expansion because they are in the initial stages of an expansive period. We modelled the range expansion of an invasive seastar with an extended larval period throughout southern Australia using a linked physical and biological model. We found that the establishment of new populations was dependent on larval supply and, critically, on the ability of new habitats to retain larval production within the local habitat to compensate for Allee effects at low population densities. Larval supply from existing populations determined the locations of invasions, whereas local retention of larvae determined how fast and how large a population could grow. Increased diffusion dispersed larvae to areas otherwise inaccessible to them in a purely advective model, and had the potential to increase establishment probabilities. Range extension progressed as new populations were established downstream of source populations in locations where the retention of locally produced larvae was sufficient to generate long-term positive growth rates.

AB 1. Different counting methods are currently used to estimate red deer populations in the open range in Scotland, but there are few data available to compare variation in estimates, or relative cost-effectiveness.
   2. While it is impossible to determine the accuracy of counts (as real numbers are unknown), variation within and between different methods can be measured by repeat counts of the same area within as short a period as possible.
   3. This study aimed to quantify the variation observed from repeat counts using each of four methods (ground, helicopter, infrared helicopter and dung-counting methods) at one of three study sites in late winters 2003, 2004 and 2005. Additional data from digital camera images of groups from counts in other areas of Scotland were also used to assess the accuracy of visual counts.
   4. Coefficients of variation (CVs) within any method of between 5% and 16% were recorded, consistent with previous comparisons for red deer open range counts in Scotland. CVs were lowest for ground and helicopter counts. The infrequency of optimal conditions was likely to limit the applicability of infrared counts in Scotland.
   5. In terms of cost-effectiveness, helicopter counting was the least labour-intensive, with costs of other techniques depending on the availability of existing manpower as an overhead cost.
   6. It is concluded that helicopter counts are most likely to minimize errors while maximizing cost-efficiency. Accuracy can be improved by the use of digital photography for counting larger deer groups. Estimates are likely to be improved further by increasing the frequency of counts and using the same methods, counters and routes for repeat counts.

AB The genetic structure of black abalone populations in the southern California Islands and central California coast was investigated by protein electrophoresis. Detailed sampling of San Nicolas Island (SN) permitted investigation of microgeographic genetic differentiation among local geomorphological features. In addition, temporal genetic differentiation was assessed by comparing juveniles and adults at three islands, San Miguel (SM), Santa Cruz (SC) and San Nicolas (SN). Mainland and island locations were genetically differentiated based on allele frequency differences and the presence of private alleles in some island populations. Although microgeographic genetic structure among sites on SN was weak and not statistically significant, heterozygosity varied among sites, with diversity decreasing from west to east. In addition, investigation among cohorts showed that adults were genetically differentiated among island locations, whereas no differences among juveniles were detected. Genetic differentiation between adult and juvenile abalones was detected at SC but not SM or SN. These data are generally consistent with local recruitment augmented by relatively more gene flow among island populations than among island and mainland populations, and possible selection acting on immigrant recruits.

AB We evaluated the temporal and spatial patterns of abundance and the amount of damage caused by gall-inducing insects (GII) in deciduous and riparian habitats in a seasonal tropical dry forest in Mexico. Plants occurring in these habitats differ in their phenology and moisture availability. decidious habitats are seasonal and xeric, while riparian habitats are aseasonal and mesic. We Found 37 GII species and each one was associated with a specific plant species. In total, 19 species (51.3%) were present in deciduous habitats, 13 species (35.2%) in riparian habitats, and only 5 species (13.5%) Occurred in both. Abundance and leaf damage by GII were greater in deciduous than in riparian habitats during the wet season. For each GII species that occurred in both habitats, host plant species supported greater abundance and leaf damage by GII in deciduous habitats during the wet season. These results indicate a greater association of GII species with host plants in deciduous than in riparian habitats during the wet season. In riparian habitats, 11 plant species (61.1%) had greater density of GII in the dry than in the wet season. Similarly, leaf damage by GII was significantly greater in the dry than in the wet season in riparian habitats for 12 plant species (66.7%). Dry forest plants of riparian habitats presented two peaks of leaf-flushing: GII colonized leaves produced in the first peak at the beginning of the wet season, and accumulated or recolonized leaves in the second peak it the beginning of the dry season. The levels of leaf damage by GII detected ill this Study in the rainy season were considerably, higher than those obtained for folivorous insects in other neotropical forests, suggesting that this GII guild might have all important impact oil their host plant species in this tropical community.

AB Thirty-five museum specimens collected in 1926 and 1947-48 vouch for the distinctiveness of an undescribed large mammal, a form of lechwe antelope. Their preservation has allowed comparative analyses of morphological characters to reveal this new species, the Upernba lechwe Kobus anselli sp. nov. It is most similar to the black lechwe K. smithemani and quite distinct from all other known taxa, including topotypical red lechwes K. leche. Prevailing threats and conservation concerns underwrite its formal description after neglect by science for decades. This lecbwe is restricted to the Upemba wetlands, Kamalondo depression, south-east Congo basin (Katanga Province, Democratic Republic of Congo), and has declined greatly since the 1970s. Commercial poaching through the 1980s reduced c. 20 000 individuals to under 1000 estimated today. Recognition of K. anselli as a distinct evolutionary entity was previously ignored, because the entrenched taxonomy assumed it was just another red lechwe. Its speciation seems to be recent, probably Pleistocene. Lechwes evolved in an archipelago of wetlands formed through vicariance of a more extensive drainage system, the Palaeo-Chambeshi, which extended from Katanga and north-east Zambia across the south-central African plateau, into the Kalahari basin. The Palaeo-Chambeshi was a major endoreic tributary of Palaco-Lake Makgadikgadi. Its fragmentation isolated lechwes in the Kamalondo depression from wetlands in the Upper Zambezi-Okavango, Upper Kafue, and the Chambeshi and Luapula drainages. The belated discovery of K. anselli emphasizes the region's conservation significance. Because of its high species richness and high endemism, Katanga is a biodiversity hotspot within the encompassing Katanga Chambeshi region, also covering eastern Angola and much of Zambia. A secure future for the critically endangered Upemba lechwe hinges on reducing adverse human impact and maintaining the integrity of its wetland habitat. Support for protected areas is critical. Maintenance of ecological processes, focused on aquatic systems, is especially important to conserve biodiversity. Recognition of the complex evolutionary history of the region (since the Late Neogene) underpins the scientific foundation for all conservation plans and activities. It prescribes why a regional conservation strategy should encompass the landscape mosaic, structured across neighbouring drainage systems (Lufira, Upper Lualaba and Chambeshi-Luapula rivers). A trans-frontier conservation area will consolidate the protected areas and land use systems of the region in an ecological context.

ID HERBIVORES; POPULATIONS; SERENGETI; SEX; AGE
AB The number of tsessebes in Kruger National Park, South Africa, increased during 1977-1985, but declined after 1986. We used tsessebe number and age structure to determine year-to-year variation in adult survival. Adult survival rate was positively correlated with dry-season rainfall (a measure of grass productivity during the dry season) and with the cumulative rainfall surplus. Juvenile survival rate (as indexed by the juvenile:female ratio) was also correlated with the cumalative rainfall surplus. Tsessebe feed in broad, grass-covered drain age lines within Colophospermum mopane shrubland on basaltic soils. Here drainage is slow and the cumulative rainfall surplus or deficit, relative to the mean annual rainfall, is an index of dry-season soil moisture, which, in turn, determines dry-season grass productivity and hence the food supply for tsessebe. Adult survival rate was density-dependent, indicating that there was intraspecific competition for food. When the relationships between survival rates and rainfall were used in a model of tsessebe popultion dynamics to predict juvenile and adult survival rates from the recorded annual and dry-season rainfalls, the modelled population changes were similar to those observed. We conclude that changes in tsessebe numbers probably resulted from rainfall-induced changes in food availability during the dry season, which caused adult survival to decline after 1986. The principal management implication is that the tsessebe decline can be reversed only by several successive years of above-average annual rainfall. The importance of green grass during the dry season as a key resource is emphasised, not only for tsessebe, but also for other African antelopes that graze selectively. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The effect of suspended fine sediment on protist growth and behaviour was investigated using kaolinite-dominated clay with a mean grain size of 0.9 mum. Suspended sediment particles about the same size as potential food items of picovorous organisms, i.e. bacteria, were expected to interfere with feeding. Growth rates of Halteria sp. and Tetrahymena pyriformis were 0.056 and 0.15 h(-1) irrespective of the clay concentration, Cyclidium sp. showed slightly higher but significant growth rates in the presence of clay, as did most flagellates. The largest difference in growth was found for Spumella sp., which showed rates of 0.19 and 0.14 h(-1) with and without clay, respectively. An exception was the gliding flagellate Entosiphon sulcatum, which was covered by clay particles and therefore hardly came in contact with food particles. Flagellates discriminated strongly against sediment particles prior to food uptake. With decreasing particle concentration this selection mechanism became less important compared to differential digestion especially in Spumella sp. and an unidentified groundwater flagellate. Both Bodo saltans and Monosiga ovata showed differential digestion as well, but their importance in overall selectivity was low even at a low particle concentration. In contrast to flagellates, the ciliates collected many particles, including clay particles and bacteria, and incorporated them into 1 food vacuole. Discrimination against clay was of minor importance in ciliates, but a high feeding capacity seems to compensate for this low selectivity. In contrast to many zooplankton species, it can be concluded that protists are generally well adapted to environmental situations of high sediment load.

AB A study on grasshopper assemblage response to seasonal grazing, rotational grazing, continuous resting and continuous grazing was undertaken in the eastern Karoo, South Africa. Rotationally-grazed sites supported the highest number and abundance of grasshopper species while continuously-grazed sites had the lowest. Spring-grazed and winter-grazed sites were the most similar, with continuously-rested sites being the next similar to these. Rotationally-grazed sites showed the least similarity to the other sites. There were clear groupings of sites and grasshopper species, with most species associated with rotationally-grazed sites. Continuously-grazed sites had a different grasshopper assemblage. The assemblages followed definite gradients of measured environmental variables. Rotationally-grazed sites occurred along gradients of increasing bare ground, while continuously-grazed and summer-grazed sites occurred along increasing gradients of shrub cover and soil temperature. Spring-grazed, autumn-grazed, winter-grazed and rotationally-grazed sites were characterized by high vegetation density. Grasshopper dominance differed between sites. Summer-grazed sites had high dominance of Pycnodictya flavipes (40%), winter-grazed sites of Pseudogmothela sp. (32%) The significance of variable grazing management systems for maintaining floral and grasshopper diversity is discussed. Rotational grazing in this and system is most suited to maintaining plant and insect diversity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing sediment loads entering Lake Tanganyika owing to widespread catchment deforestation are hastening the need for increased understanding of the effects of influent sediment composition on biotic community structure. Two ex situ experiments were done investigating the effects of exposure to sediments of differing particle size ranges on survivorship of two model groups of benthic invertebrates, gastropods and ostracods, from the lake. In both experiments, it was found that survival rates decreased with decreasing sediment particle size. Gastropod feeding behaviour was also affected significantly by sediment particle size, !;bowing increasing severity of impact with decreasing particle size. In addition, a detrimental effect of experimentally increased sediment loads on gastropod survivorship, irrespective of sediment texture, was found. These results suggest that runoff from sub-catchments with soil or bedrock that weathers to produce fine-grained sediments may have disproportionately detrimental effects on littoral biota in Lake Tanganyika, and, thus, have important implications for ecosystem and biotic community structure.

AB Bischofia javanica is an invasive tree of the Bonin Islands in the western Pacific, Japan. This species has aggressive growth, competitively replacing native trees in the natural forest of the islands. The aim of this study was to examine seed and seedling factors which might confer an advantage to the establishment of Bischofia over native trees. During a 5-yr period we compared the demographic parameters of early life history of Bischofia and Elaeocarpus photiniae-folius, a native canopy dominant, in actively invaded forests. Predation of Elaeocarpus seeds by introduced rodents was much higher before (27.9-32.9%) and after (41.3-100%) dispersal of seeds than that of B. javanica. Most Elaeocarpus seeds lost viability ca. 6 mo after burial in forest soil while some seeds of Bischofia remained viable for more than 2 yr. Seedling survival in the first 2 yr was much higher in Bischofia (16%) than in Elaeocarpus (1.3%). The high persistence of Bischofia in the shade, coupled to its rapid acclimation to high light levels, is an unusual combination because in forest tree species there is generally a trade-off between seedling survival in the shade and response to canopy opening. Compared with a native canopy dominant, greater seed longevity, lower seed predation by introduced rodents, longer fruiting periods and the ability to form seedling banks under closed canopy appear to have contributed to the invasive success of Bischofia on the Bonin Islands.

AB Predators that live in environments with variable prey availability should be capable of modifying their behaviour in order to maximize their consumption rate. Sit-and-wait predators that use passive traps should modify trap architecture depending on the local conditions of prey availability. We quantified the short-term behavioural response of Mvrmeleon sp. larvae in their pit-trap design in response to different experimentally modified prey conditions. The larvae (1) increased the diameter of the trap (which should increase prey encounter rates) but not the depth of the trap when prey were absent or scarce and, (2) increased the depth of the trap (which should minimize the probability of prey escape) under high availability of prey that were capable of escaping from the pit trap. Myrmeleon sp. larvae are thus capable of quickly adapting to different types and availability of prey. This behaviour could have been selected as a strategy to survive in poor environments with unpredictable prey availability.

AB We hypothesized that seedlings of different dominant species in the dry Chaco forests of Cordoba Province were restricted to patches with particular microenvironmental conditions. To test this hypothesis, the seedling habitat was characterized by measuring physical and biotic microhabitat variables such as incident light, distance to the nearest neighbour, and herb, thallophyte, and litter cover. Seedlings of the different dominant species established in different patches representing a broad range of microhabitat conditions. Open, arid microsites with high percentages of incident light were occupied by Cercidium praecox, Larrea divaricata and Prosopis spp. seedlings. These species colonize open patches in the forest, taking advantage of the low competition environment and establishing during the brief favourable period before the dry season. In contrast, seedlings of Celtis pallida, Capparis atamisquea, Mimozyganthus carinatus and Acacia furcatispina tend to establish in closed, canopied microsites, with lower incident light and better moisture and nutrient conditions. These species may benefit from the conditions underneath the canopies. Distance to the nearest neighbour did not restrict seedling establishment when the neighbours were herbs, but the nearest shrub exerted a strong influence, depending on the seedling species as well as the shrub species. Facilitation could be an important mechanism in the regeneration of species in the dry Chaco forests. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB Morphological and isozyme variations between 13 populations of the species hitherto named Patella granularis were investigated to see whether differences in shell structure between the west coast versus the south and east coasts of southern Africa are supported by other morphological features or by genetic differences. The shells showed a definite decrease in size from west to east, but this is correlated with productivity and is of no diagnostic use in distinguishing between populations. Discriminant functions analysis based on shell morphometrics failed to separate populations from the three coastal regions. Shells from the northern east coast do, however, have shell nodules with a dark pigmentation, distinctly separating them from those further south and west. No differences in radular or soft part morphology were detected between the populations, but the four northernmost populations on the east coast have a significantly shorter Z looping of the gut than the other populations along the coast. Significant microstructural differences in the sperm were also detected between these two groups of populations. Electrophoretic analysis of 16 enzyme loci failed to detect any significant differences between the west and south coast populations, but revealed a genetic identity (Nei) of 0.528 as well as four diagnostic alleles between the four northernmost populations from the east coast compared with those to the south and west. The two genetically distinct forms occurred sympatrically at one of the study sites on the east coast (Coffee Bay). It was concluded the two groupings were sufficiently different to warrant the recognition of a separate species, which is centred in KwaZulu-Natal on the east coast and extends south to Coffee Bay, from where it is replaced by P. granularis. There is, however, no evidence at all that the west coast populations are in any way separable from the remaining populations of P. granularis on the south coast.

AB We analysed distribution records of mistletoes (Loranthaceae and Viscaceae) in South Africa in terms of host taxa and geographic patterns.  Few species are found in nutrient-poor Cape shrublands (fynbos) and in the southern evergreen forests on nutrient-poor sands.  The most species-rich areas are the nutrient-rich mesic savannas (including Valley Bushveld, a subset of savanna).  Mistletoe species richness is significantly correlated with the average nitrogen levels of the woody plants in any biome, suggesting that the overall nutrient status of a biome influences mistletoe species richness.  The analysis of host-choice of mistletoes also indicates a non-random distribution; thirty-three genera in twenty-two plant families host from three to twenty-four different mistletoe species, suggesting that parasitism is not related to phylogenetic position.  The most important host genera are Acacia (hosting twenty-four spp. mistletoes), followed by Combretum (fourteen), Maytenus (thirteen) and Rhus (twelve).  The species richness of mistletoes on host genera is significantly correlated with mean host N, and in four of five areas sampled, the number of mistletoes on host trees was significantly correlated with host N.

SO PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A relationship exists between sea surface temperature and the proportion of structural and mineralogical components in the shells of certain mollusc species. The potential application of such skeletal records in the field of palaeothermometry is not yet realised mainly due to the post-depositional alteration of aragonitic shell structures. The shell of the southern African limpet, Patella granularis, is composed of discrete shell layers which can be visually distinguished on the inner shell surface. Each layer represents a particular crystal arrangement (lamellar or foliar) and associated mineralogy (aragonite or calcite). The width of the outer aragonitic layer relative to that of the the outer calcitic layers increases with increasing sea surface temperature. We have quantified both the mineralogical and structural variations in modern populations to test the feasibility of using P. granularis as a palaeotemperature indicator. Aragonite:calcite ratios are estimated from X-ray diffraction traces of whole shell powders. Structural variation is expressed as a ratio of the widths of the outer lamellar and foliar layers, which are measured where these layers crop out on the ventral surface of the shell. The original layer boundaries can be identified and measured in ancient specimens where partial loss or replacement of the aragonite phase has occurred. Sea surface temperature records are strongly correlated with this simple measurement of structural variation. The relationship between sea temperature and whole shell mineralogy is less strongly correlated, and is probably complicated by erosion of the outer calcitic layers and by the addition of extra, inner shell layers to counteract erosion. For these reasons, we suggest that the measurement of structural variation described here has greater potential as a tool for palaeothermometry.

AB To evaluate the influence of diet composition on seabird postnatal development, I examined the relationships between feeding rate, energy intake, energy partitioning, and chick growth in three species of high latitude, plankton-feeding seabirds: Least Auklet (Aethia pusilla), South Georgia Diving Petrel (Pelecanoides georgicus), and Common Diving Petrel (P. urinatrix). Average dietary lipid content varied from 22 to 46% of dry mass among the three species. Least Auklet chicks were fed meals rich in wax esters; on average 63% of total energy intake was in the form of wax. Interspecific comparisons of chick dietary composition and energy budgets indicated that calanoid copepods, a wax ester-rich food, was a balanced source of protein and lipids. However, the lipid content of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) was insufficient to meet maintenance energy requirements of Common Diving Petrels. Lipid-rich diets were associated with shorter brooding periods, higher rates of nestling fat deposition, and larger lipid reserves at fledging. Accumulation rates of lipid-free dry matter were similar in the three species despite differences in energy intake related to diet. The energy cost of growth was a relatively minor component of nestling energy budgets; most assimilated energy was allocated toward maintenance and fat deposition. Selection apparently favors high latitude seabirds that meet the high energy requirements of their chicks by providing a lipid-rich diet. Differences in diet composition explained much of the variation in postnatal development among the three species, but there was no evidence that energy limited growth per se.

AB 1. Non-native plants often alter environments they invade, favouring their own performance through positive feedbacks. Plant-soil interactions represent one such mechanism, but their complexity (e.g. invader-induced changes in soil nutrients, microbial communities, etc.) makes inferences of the precise mechanisms that benefit invaders difficult. Here we aimed to determine: (1) whether invasion by Australian acacias (genus Acacia Mill.) changes nitrogen-fixing soil rhizobial community diversity and structure, and (2) the importance of available rhizobia and overall invader-induced soil changes as significant facilitators of acacia performance.
   2. We sampled soils from various invaded and nearby uninvaded areas in South Africa's Core Cape Subregion and, using next generation sequencing, compared rhizobial communities between invaded and univaded soils. We then determined the relative importance of soil status (invaded vs. uninvaded), in conjunction with rhizobial addition, to the performance of invasive acacias under common garden conditions.
   3. Next generation sequencing data revealed that invaded soils generally harboured lower rhizobial diversity and were compositionally more homogenous compared to uninvaded soils. Bradyrhizobium strains, the most common known rhizobia associated with acacias, were more abundant in invaded than uninvaded sites. Our greenhouse experiment found significantly reduced growth performances of acacias in uninvaded relative to invaded soils for most species by site comparisons, and almost no influence of additional rhizobial inoculum. However, the overall relationship between nodulation and growth kinetics was much steeper for plants grown in uninvaded compared to invaded soils.
   4. Despite invasive acacias homogenizing nitrogen-fixing rhizobial community composition and reducing diversity, it appears that mutualist availability poses no significant barrier to acacia establishment. Although acacia-induced changes to soil conditions enhance plant performance, successful nodulation seems important to early growth performance when encountering novel soil conditions.
   5. Synthesis. We provide evidence that invasions by Australian acacias affect the diversity and structure of soil rhizobial communities. Although overall soil changes benefit their performance independent of rhizobia addition, forming successful mutualistic interactions is critical during the establishment phase under novel environmental conditions. Taken together, our results indicate that interactions between soil abiotic and biotic conditions work in concert to enhance invader performance through positive feedbacks.

AB As with other species of great apes, chimpanzee numbers have declined over the past decades. Proper conservation of the remaining chimpanzees requires accurate and frequent data on their distribution and density. In Tanzania, 75% of the chimpanzees live at low densities on land outside national parks and little is known about their distribution, density, behavior or ecology. Given the sheer scale of chimpanzee distribution across western Tanzania (>20,000 km(2)), we need new methods that are time and cost efficient while providing precise and accurate data across broad spatial scales. Scientists have recently demonstrated the usefulness of drones for detecting wildlife, including apes. Whilst direct observation of chimpanzees is unlikely given their elusiveness, we investigated the potential of drones to detect chimpanzee nests in the Issa valley, western Tanzania. Between 2015 and 2016, we tested and compared the capabilities of two fixed-wing drones. We surveyed twenty-two plots (50 x 500 m) in gallery forests and miombo woodlands to compare nest observations from the ground with those from the air. We performed mixed-effects logistic regression models to evaluate the impact of image resolution, seasonality, vegetation type, nest height and color on nest detectability. An average of 10% of the nests spotted from the ground were detected from the air. From the factors tested, only image resolution significantly influenced nest detectability in drone-acquired images. We discuss the potential, but also the limitations, of this technology for determining chimpanzee distribution and density and to provide guidance for future investigations on the use of drones for ape population surveys. Combining traditional and novel technological methods of surveying allows more accurate collection of data on animal distribution and habitat connectivity that has important implications for ape conservation in an increasingly anthropogenically-disturbed landscape.

AB It is commonly assumed that the geographical distributions of plants are governed mainly by abiotic variables. However, interactions with other organisms, such as pollinators, also have the potential to influence plant distributions. To investigate this, we developed niche models for 32 plant taxa that have specialized pollination systems and which are native to a biodiversity hotspot (South Africa). We found that the distributions of these taxa are best explained by a combination of biotic (pollinators) and abiotic factors, rather than by abiotic factors alone. For approximately 66% of these plant taxa, pollinator distributions were the factor that provided the best predictor of their niches. Furthermore, co-occurrence of these plants and their pollinators was generally not explained solely by shared abiotic niches, and thus probably reflects broad-scale positive ecological interactions. These results are consistent with the proposal that pollinator distributions may constrain plant distributions and highlight the general potential for species distributions to be shaped by positive interactions with other species. This has important consequences for predicting howdistributions of species might change in the face of loss of their key mutualists.

AB The mechanism of pollinator attraction is predicted to strongly influence both plant diversification and the extent of pollinator sharing between species. Sexually deceptive orchids rely on mimicry of species-specific sex pheromones to attract their insect pollinators. Given that sex pheromones tend to be conserved among related species, we predicted that in sexually deceptive orchids, (i) pollinator sharing is rare, (ii) closely related orchids use closely related pollinators and (iii) there is strong bias in the wasp lineages exploited by orchids. We focused on species that are pollinated by sexual deception of thynnine wasps in the distantly related genera Caladenia and Drakaea, including new field observations for 45 species of Caladenia. Specialization was extreme with most orchids using a single pollinator species. Unexpectedly, seven cases of pollinator sharing were found, including two between Caladenia and Drakaea, which exhibit strikingly different floral morphology. Phylogenetic analysis of pollinators using four nuclear sequence loci demonstrated that although orchids within major clades primarily use closely related pollinator species, up to 17% of orchids within these clades are pollinated by a member of a phylogenetically distant wasp genus. Further, compared to the total diversity of thynnine wasps within the study region, orchids show a strong bias towards exploiting certain genera. Although these patterns may arise through conservatism in the chemical classes used in sex pheromones, apparent switches between wasp clades suggest unexpected flexibility in floral semiochemical production. Alternatively, wasp sex pheromones within lineages may exhibit greater chemical diversity than currently appreciated.

AB Density is crucial for understanding large carnivore ecology and conservation, but estimating it has proven methodologically difficult. We conducted 1 year of camera trapping to estimate jaguar (Panthera onca) density and population structure in the Los Llanos region of Venezuela on the Hato Pinero ranch, where hunting is prohibited and livestock are excluded from half of ranch lands. We identified 42 different jaguars and determined their sex, age class, and reproductive status. We estimated adult jaguar densities with spatial capture-recapture models, using sex/reproductive state and session as covariates. Models without temporal variation received more support than models that allowed variation between sessions. Males, reproductive females, and nonreproductive females differed in their density, baseline detectability, and movement. The best estimate of total adult jaguar population density was 4.44 individuals/100 km(2). Based on reproductive female density and mean number of offspring per female, we estimated cub density at 3.23 individuals/100 km(2) and an overall density of 7.67 jaguars/100 km(2). Estimated jaguar population structure was 21% males, 11% nonreproductive females, 26% reproductive females, and 42% cubs. We conclude that extending the sampling period to 1 year increases the detectability of females and cubs and makes density estimates more robust as compared to the more common short studies. Our results demonstrate that the Venezuelan Llanos represent important jaguar habitat, and further, they emphasize the importance of protected areas and hunting restrictions for carnivore conservation.

TI Resilience Assessment Based on Time-Dependent System Reliability
   Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN
LA English
DT Article
DE resilience; uncertainty; time-dependent reliability; mechanical system
ID FRAMEWORK; ECOLOGY
AB Significant efforts have been recently devoted to the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of resilience in engineering systems. Current resilience evaluation methods, however, have mainly focused on business supply chains and civil infrastructure, and need to be extended for application in engineering design. A new resilience metric is proposed in this paper for the design of mechanical systems to bridge this gap, by investigating the effects of recovery activity and system failure paths on system resilience. The defined resilience metric is connected to design through time-dependent system reliability analysis. This connection enables us to design a system for a specific resilience target in the design stage. Since computationally expensive computer simulations are usually used in design, a surrogate modeling method is developed to efficiently perform time-dependent system reliability analysis. Based on the time-dependent system reliability analysis, dominant system failure paths are enumerated and then the system resilience is estimated. The connection between the proposed resilience assessment method and design is explored through sensitivity analysis and component importance measure (CIM). Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience assessment method.

AB The tree species used in planted forests are highly productive and have an important role in countries economy but the expansion of these trees into habitats outside plantations is a concern for managers and conservationists. Among the most planted forest species worldwide, we can find eucalypts and pines species. Understanding spatial patterns and the factors that influence these species colonization is crucial to increase the knowledge about expansion capability of these species and may help managers to improve and prioritize eventual control plans. Our study aimed to identify the recruitment spatial patterns of Pinus pinaster (native species) and Eucalyptus globulus (exotic species) into habitats surrounding plantations in Portugal (native forests, grasslands and shrublands) and to determine the factors that influence recruitment. This was done by looking at the recruitment success in several habitats near plantations, using a spatial gradient of distance to plantations edge. We observed as expected that the recruitment of P. pinaster and E. globulus decreased exponentially from the plantation edge. However, the higher P. pinaster seedling recruitment in this study (P. pinaster: 247 seedlings/ha; E. globulus: 22 seedlings/ha), the smallest decline in seedlings density with distance from plantation boundary (P. pinaster = -0.036 seedlingsim vs E. globulus = -0.048 seedlings/m), and the longer distance of seedling establishment, demonstrate clearly that P. pinaster is more successful colonizing the habitats near plantations than E. globulus. Nevertheless E. globulus can growth seedlings within the planted stands suggesting that the species is becoming naturalized. However, localized recruitment (92% of the total seedlings recorded were located less than 15 m from the plantation edge) and lower levels of establishment of E. globulus from managed plantations, suggested that this species did not demonstrate an invasive behavior. However, future research in abandoned eucalyptus plantation is needed to understand the role of plantation management and age as barriers to E. globulus colonization. Results from our survey revealed the suitability of all habitat types studied for P. pinaster natural regeneration, although their recruitment was more limited in forest habitat type. Forest and grassland were very resistant to E. globulus establishment. The two species recruitment was also influenced by different factors, with P. pinaster being independent of climatic variables, while E. globulus was affected by temperature seasonality and recruitment was found to be higher in areas with lower seasonal differences.

AB The choice of suitable habitats may maximize the survival and reproduction of the individuals choosing them. We examined habitat choice by wormlions, small sand-dwelling insects that construct pit-traps to capture prey. Wormlions prefer shaded habitats over lit ones, do not relocate away, and construct large pits there. However, they compromise over this preference if the shaded habitat is interfered with unfavorable conditions, shallow sand, surface obstacles, or high wormlion density, which hinder them from constructing large pits.The selection of a suitable habitat may maximize the survival and reproduction chances of individuals. We examined the habitat choice of wormlions, small sand-dwelling insects that construct pit-traps to capture prey. Unlike the well-studied antlions, which employ a similar hunting strategy, wormlion behavior has not been thoroughly studied. We first determined whether wormlions prefer 1) shaded versus lit, 2) deep versus shallow sand, and 3) surface-obstructed versus clear microhabitats. The first option of each of the three pairs was highly preferred. In unfavorable microhabitats, larvae were also less likely to construct a pit, mainly in shallow sand, and moved over longer distances. Next, we sought to determine whether the choice is additive (taking more than a single factor into account), hierarchical (ranking the factors according to an order of preference), or based on a threshold rule (accepting a microhabitat that crosses a quality threshold). Combining shade with one of 3 environmental factors - surface obstacles, shallow sand, or high conspecific density - led to lower proportions of wormlions choosing shade. In other words, a combination of shade and any factor was no longer preferred over lit and otherwise favorable microhabitats. We thus conclude that the wormlions' microhabitat choice is additive, taking more than a single factor into account, and that favorable conditions of any sort are traded-off against one another.

AB Many ecosystems receive a steady stream of non-native species. How biotic resistance develops over time in these ecosystems will depend on how established invaders contribute to subsequent resistance. If invasion success and defence capacity (i.e. contribution to resistance) are correlated, then community resistance should increase as species accumulate. If successful invaders also cause most impact (through replacing native species with low defence capacity) then the effect will be even stronger. If successful invaders instead have weak defence capacity or even facilitative attributes, then resistance should decrease with time, as proposed by the invasional meltdown hypothesis. We analysed 1157 introductions of freshwater fish in Swedish lakes and found that species' invasion success was positively correlated with their defence capacity and impact, suggesting that these communities will develop stronger resistance over time. These insights can be used to identify scenarios where invading species are expected to cause large impact.

AB A conceptual model for anostracan biogeography based on the "Monopolisation Hypothesis" and the "Theory of Island Biogeography" is discussed and presented. In this model anostracan species evolve allopatrically (in geographically isolated, unoccupied insular habitats), cladogenically (in small, genetically isolated founder populations via strong priority effects), or anagenically through local adaptation to changing environmental conditions. The Monopolization Hypothesis drives speciation and reverses competitive dominance patterns, leading to selection mediated priority events. Conversely, the spatial distribution of anostracan habitats (basins) drive island biogeographical patterns depending upon the relative isolation and size of any one given pool. The conceptual model presented provides a simple framework for future research in anostracan biogeography.

AB Arid and semiarid savannas are characterized by the coexistence of trees and grasses in water limited conditions. As in all dry lands, also in these savannas rainfall is highly intermittent. In this work, we develop and use a simple implicit-space model to conceptually explore how precipitation intermittency influences tree-grass competition and savanna occurrence. The model explicitly includes soil moisture dynamics, and life-stage structure of the trees. Assuming that water availability affects the ability of both plant functional types to colonize new space and that grasses outcompete tree seedlings, the model is able to predict the expected sequence of grassland, savanna, and forest along a range of mean annual rainfall. In addition, rainfall intermittency allows for tree-grass coexistence at lower mean annual rainfall values than for constant precipitation. Comparison with observations indicates that the model, albeit very simple, is able to capture some of the essential dynamical processes of natural savannas. The results suggest that precipitation intermittency affects savanna occurrence and structure, indicating a new point of view for reanalyzing observational data from the literature.

AB Areas within regional landscapes that make a disproportionate contribution to supporting large herbivore populations have been interpreted as key resource areas, hotspots, buffers, stepping stones or serving other functional roles. We investigated the role that the restricted extent of habitat types exploited at different stages of the seasonal cycle might play in limiting the abundance of a blue wildebeest subpopulation in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. GPS collars enabled the space use patterns of the animals to be related to available habitat types, and faecal nutrient concentrations to be related to the habitats exploited at that time. Wildebeest herds occupied primarily grazing lawn grasslands associated with gabbro uplands or sodic lowlands through the wet season into the early dry season. During the late dry season, they switched to seep-zone grasslands in mid slope regions of granitic landscapes. Use of recently burned areas enhanced forage quality at the beginning of the wet season. The seasonal habitat shifts enabled wildebeest to obtain adequate nitrogen, phosphorus and sodium throughout the year. Lawn and seep-zone grasslands combined constituted 10% of the available area. Grazing lawns, which encompassed only 3% of the study area, appeared to be the primary limitation on the abundance of wildebeest. However, the greater security from predation provided by the open vegetation cover in the grazing lawns is not easily disentangled from the resource benefits that they yield. Nevertheless, findings indicate how local abundance can be restricted by the extent of portions of the landscape providing crucial benefits during particular phases of the seasonal cycle. Hence the key resources concept needs to be expanded to accommodate the functionally distinct contributions made by different habitats towards supporting local herbivore populations.

AB Important insights on the invasion ecology of woody plants are emerging from the study of model groups, but it is important to test how widely such results can be generalised. We examined whether drivers of introduction and invasion in the genus Casuarina are similar to those identified for other groups. We reviewed the literature, mapped current global distributions, and modelled the potential global distribution of the genus. We assessed the rationale behind introductions, impacts of invasions, and the evolution of management approaches. Casuarinas have been introduced to about 150 countries. Ten of the 14 species in the genus have been introduced outside their native ranges, but only three species are recorded as naturalized or invasive (C. equisetifolia, C. cunninghamiana and C. glauca). Species with large native ranges are more likely to be introduced, and the three invasive species have the largest native ranges and the most records of introduction. There were no clear relationships between life-history traits (e.g. seed mass, plant height, or resprouting ability) and the extent of invasion. About 8 % of the Earth's land surface is potentially suitable for casuarinas and large-scale plantings in some climatically suitable areas have not yet resulted in large-scale invasions; there is a substantial global Casuarina invasion debt. Experiences in Florida and the Mascarene Islands highlight that casuarinas have the potential to transform ecosystems with significant control costs. The challenge is to develop management approaches that minimise the impacts of invasions while preserving economic, environmental and cultural values of species in their introduced ranges.

TI Herbaceous Forage and Selection Patterns by Ungulates across Varying

AB Herbivores generally have strong structural and compositional effects on vegetation, which in turn determines the plant forage species available. We investigated how selected large mammalian herbivore assemblages use and alter herbaceous vegetation structure and composition in a southern African savanna in and adjacent to the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We compared mixed and mono-specific herbivore assemblages of varying density and investigated similarities in vegetation patterns under wildlife and livestock herbivory. Grass species composition differed significantly, standing biomass and grass height were almost twice as high at sites of low density compared to high density mixed wildlife species. Selection of various grass species by herbivores was positively correlated with greenness, nutrient content and palatability. Nutrient-rich Urochloa mosambicensis Hack. and Panicum maximum Jacq. grasses were preferred forage species, which significantly differed in abundance across sites of varying grazing pressure. Green grasses growing beneath trees were grazed more frequently than dry grasses growing in the open. Our results indicate that grazing herbivores appear to base their grass species preferences on nutrient content cues and that a characteristic grass species abundance and herb layer structure can be matched with mammalian herbivory types.

AB While protected areas are a centrepiece of conservation, populations of animals in protected areas can still be subject to considerable human influence. Conservation theory suggests that many species should live at lower densities at the periphery of protected areas compared with the core area. Similarly, but more specifically, species subject to exploitation are expected to have lower densities in areas close to human settlements compared with more remote areas. Drawing upon distributional data of eight large African herbivore species (buffalo Syncerus caffer, elephant Loxodonta africana, giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis, impala Aepyceros melampus, topi Damaliscus lunatus, warthog Phacochoerus africanus, waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus and zebra Equus quagga) sampled using ground surveys in 1995 and 1996, and seven large herbivore species (the same species without impala) sampled using aerial surveys from 1987 to 2009, we fitted logistic regression models and used an information theoretic model selection approach to test these two hypotheses in an East African savannah national park subject to illegal hunting from outside. In the vast majority of herbivore species, occupancy was not substantially affected by being close to the edge of the park or in close proximity to human villages. Furthermore, population declines witnessed in this protected area were not reflected in reduced occupancy near park boundaries. We conclude that assumed distributional differences between peripheral and core parts of reserves are not necessarily supported by empirical evidence, and that population declines within reserves do not inevitably proceed from boundaries inwards.

AB The intestinal microbiota of animals play an important role in their energy metabolism and resistance to pathogens, and thus in maintenance of animals in their environment. We surveyed the intestinal microbiota of three species of Planorbidae (Gastropoda: Pulmonata). Cultivation-independent molecular methods were used to investigate the community composition of intestinal bacteria from individual snails: three Biomphalaria pfeifferi (Africa), two Bulinus africanus (Africa) and three Helisoma duryi (North America). PCR amplification and sequencing of 612 bacterial 16S rRNA genes yielded 282 unique DNA sequences (97% sequence similarity) among the eight individual snails sampled. The observed bacterial diversity was distributed over 18 phyla, with the greatest number of 16S rRNA gene sequences derived from the Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Acidobacteria. These results document the presence of highly diverse gut bacterial communities in three snail species and indicate the need for additional study to determine the roles that gut microbes play in the physiology and immunology of planorbid snails.

AB Nile crocodiles undergo a three to five order of magnitude increase in body size during their lifespan. This shift coincides with a change in resource and habitat use which influences the strength, type and symmetry of interactions with other species. Identifying size-specific crocodile groups displaying similar traits is important for conservation planning. Here, we illustrate how stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis of scute keratin, together with breakpoint modelling analysis can be used to characterise ontogenetic niche shifts. Using a sample set of 238 crocodiles from the Okavango Delta, Botswana (35-463 cm total length), we found prominent size-related changes in the scute keratin delta C-13 and delta N-15 profiles close to 40 and 119 cm snout-vent length. The first shift corroborated the findings of a traditional stomach-content study conducted on the same population at the same time, and the second conformed to known crocodile ecology. This approach can be used as a first approximation to identify size-specific groups within crocodile populations, and these can then be investigated further using isotopic or other methods.

AB Alongside the eusocial naked mole-rat, Heterocephalus glaber, Heliophobius argenteocinereus represents the second oldest lineage within the African mole-rat family Bathyergidae, and phylogenetically intermediate between the East African Het. glaber and the South African genera Bathyergus and Georychus. Across its geographic range, Hel.. argenteocinereus is widely distributed on both sides of the East African Rift System (EARS), and is a key taxon for understanding the phylogeographic patterns of divergence of the family as a whole. Phylogenetic analysis of 62 mitochondrial cyt b sequences, representing 48 distinct haplotypes from 26 geographic locations across the range of Heliophobius, consistently and robustly resolved six genetically divergent clades that we recognize as distinct evolutionary species. Early species descriptions of Heliophobius were synonymized into a monotypic taxonomy that recognized only Hel. argentocinereus. These synonyms constitute available names for these rediscovered cryptic lineages, for which combined morphological and genetic evidence for topotypical populations endorses the recognition of six to eight distinct taxa. Bayesian estimates of divergence times using the fossil Proheliophobius as a calibration for the molecular clock suggest that the adaptive radiation of the genus began in the early Miocene, and that cladogenesis, represented in the extant species, reflects a strident signature of tectonic activity that forged the principal graben in the EARS.

AB Detailed information of fish diets is required if we are to understand complex interactions between species and successfully manage resources at an ecosystem level. We compiled diet information from 76 species of fish targeted by recreational and commercial fishers in North West Australia. Based on 81 independent studies we demonstrate that species targeted by the fishery are all carnivores, however the type of prey they consume and their trophic level is variable (3.31-4.49) and trophic range of some species spans different trophic levels (e. g. Lethrinus nebulosus, 3.46-4.35). These findings infer that in highly diverse systems, such as coral reefs, trophic cascades instigated by fishing must be investigated at the species, rather than functional or trophic level. Moreover, as prey availability is likely to vary spatially and temporally, diet must be quantified locally to assess ecosystem level impacts of fishing.

AB P>1. Interspecific interference competition for nest-sites among cavity-nesting birds can have important effects on reproductive fitness and the distribution of competing species.
   2. We observed interference at nest-sites in free-living populations of the endangered Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) and sympatric long-tailed finch (Poephila acuticauda), and also experimentally tested the relative strength and effect of interference at nest-sites in captive populations.
   3. Levels of competitive interference at nest-sites in the wild were high for Gouldian, but not long-tailed finches, and interference frequency was inversely related to Gouldian finch reproductive success. High levels of interference conferred reduced fledging success but did not affect offspring condition.
   4. Captive experiments corroborated the field data, also demonstrating fitness costs of interspecific competition, and that long-tailed finches dominated resources under standardized conditions.
   5. Such asymmetrical competition dynamics are likely to constrain reproduction in Gouldian finch populations, potentially affecting recruitment and hindering the recovery of remaining populations of this endangered species.

AB The area encompassing Southern China and North Vietnam is highlighted by very high levels of biodiversity but also exceptional threats. Guangxi Province was selected as one of the most representative regions within this area to detect biodiversity hotspots for conservation and to evaluate protection effectiveness of present reserve network using herbarium records. Collection data from 6,506 vascular plant species occurring in the province (548 of these are endemic to the province) were used to explore patterns of biodiversity at 10-minute grid resolution, with the main goal of identifying the occurrence of centers of species richness and endemism. Up to eight distinct hotspots, mainly in mountain areas, were recognized, six based on the combination of species richness and endemism, one on richness only and one on endemics only. Of these, three are specific to limestone areas while the remaining five are located in acid soil regions. Most of centers of species richness and endemism are protected by the current reserve network, although several gaps can be recognized. This research can provide an overview of approaches to setting biodiversity conservation priorities and of strategies for filling up gaps in the reserve network of similar regions.

AB The identification of nursery and spawning areas of coastal fish and shellfish populations represents fundamental information for stock assessment essential for giving advice for managers within the framework of Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries. This study investigates the bathymetric and spatial distribution of young-of-the-year and mature females of the deep-water rose shrimp, Parapenaens longirostris, in the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea) in order to describe the species nursery and spawning areas. Data were obtained from trawl surveys carried out yearly in spring and autumn from 1994 to 2004, and nursery and spawning areas were inferred by means of GIS techniques. Species maximum abundance occurred between 100 and 300 m. We found that young-of-the-year concentrated on the outer shelf while mature females occurred mostly between the outer shelf and the upper slope. We detected four large areas of aggregation of young-of-the-year, and three areas of aggregation of mature females. High concentrations of young-of-the-year and mature females persistently occupied some of these areas, representing stable nursery and spawning areas. Young-of-the-year and mature females aggregate where retention and enrichment processes occur, linked to the semi-permanent patterns resulting from the meanders of the Atlantic Ionian Stream. We highlight the importance of studying the spatial distribution pattern of commercial species to identify habitats essential to those species' life cycle. We detected deep-water rose shrimp nursery and spawning areas in the Strait of Sicily and discuss their spatial pattern in relation to the hydrological characteristics of the area.

AB We assessed patterns in soil development at a recently deglaciated foreland on Anvers Island on the Antarctic Peninsula. Soil samples were collected along transects extending 35 m over bare ground from the edge of a receding glacier; the far end of these transects has been ice free for approximately 20 years. We also compared soils at the far end of these transects under bare ground to those under canopies of isolated individuals of Deschampsia antarctica, a caespitose grass, that had recently colonized the site (established for < 6 years). In addition, we compared soils at this young foreland to those in a well-developed tundra island that has been ice free for at least several hundred years. At the foreland site, soil moisture was greatest near the glacier, consistent with proximity to meltwater, and declined with distance from the glacier. This decline in soil moisture may explain the decrease in litter decomposition rates and the greater soil nitrate (NO3 (-)) concentrations that we observed with distance from the glacier. The greater soil moisture near the glacier likely promoted leaching and transport of NO3 (-) to drier soils away from the glacier. The presence of D. antarctica at the glacier foreland had little effect on soil properties, which is not surprising considering it had only colonized sampling areas during the previous 5 years. Compared to the foreland, which contained only mineral soil, soil at the older tundra site had a 2.5- to 5-cm-thick organic horizon that had much higher concentrations of total carbon, nitrogen, and NO3 (-).

AB For almost 50 years ecologists have debated why herbivores generally don't increase in numbers to such levels as to deplete or devastate vegetation. One hypothesis is that herbivore populations are regulated at low densities by predators, and a second hypotheses is that plants are fundamentally poor food for herbivores. This has lead to two main hypotheses about the role of herbivores in structuring vegetation: the "bottom-up'' and "top-down'' hypotheses. Here I survey the literature, with a focus on field experiments designed to investigate the soil resource-vegetation-mammalian herbivore system, specifically asking five questions about how each trophic level responds to (i) resource addition, (ii) vegetation removal, (iii) herbivore removal or reduction, (iv) herbivore addition, and (v) the interaction of resource levels and herbivory? I use these to develop 12 testable predictions. I document the major areas of research as they relate to these 12 predictions, and use these to evaluate weaknesses and limitations in field methods. There are surprisingly few terrestrial studies that conduct factorial manipulations of multiple nutrients or herbivores, even though it is clear that these are essential. Specifically, I argue that a manipulative experimental approach is the most valuable way to advance our theory and understanding, and I advocate the continued use of long-term factorial field experiments that simultaneously manipulate soil resources levels and herbivory (preferably at multiple levels), repeated in a range of environments in which individual species or functional groups are monitored.

AB Wood falls are organic substrates sunken on the ocean floor that house a diversified fauna of marine invertebrates. Among them, the echinoid Asterechinus elegans is found in various localities from the West-Pacific region and observations of its gut content indicate that it is a wood-feeding species. The diversity of the microflora associated with its gut content was investigated by 16 rRNA gene cloning analysis and identified Proteobacteria, Planctomycete, Firmicutes, Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides and Actinobacteria. Clones were related to bacteria from the gut of phytophageous (including wood-feeding) animals but also from sulphide-rich environments such as whale carcasses, mangrove soils and marine sediments of notably hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Furthermore, the analysis of the adenosine 5'-phosphosulphate (APS) reductase gene Put in evidence the presence of several sulphide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) belonging to the Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria While some sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) affiliated to the Delta-proteobacteria were also detected. APS reductase clones were related to thioautotrophic symbionts of various marine invertebrates including tube worms and gutless oligochaetes. These results suggest that a part of the bacterial community associated with the gut content of A. elegans would be able to participate in the wood digestion and therefore to the echinoid nourishment. Further analyses are however needed to clarify several aspects of this association.

AB Populus alba is a thermophilic forest tree present in the Mediterranean basin. Its habitat is highly fragmented and its distribution range has been subject to long-term human interference, resulting in debate surrounding whether certain populations are native or exotic in origin. In particular, populations from the islands of Corsica and Sardinia are of uncertain origin. While populations of P. alba mainly reproduce sexually, clonal reproduction is also common. The aims of this study were to locate and molecularly characterize the poorly studied island populations of P. alba and compare these with samples from various spatial scales, in order to provide information on the genetic structure and phylogeography of this species. This information will provide evidence on whether the species is native to Sardinia, which is important for the development of conservation strategies.
   DNA extracts were obtained from the following P. alba trees: 159 from Sardinia, 47 from Ticino regional park (northern Italy), 15 acquired from an Italian Germoplasm Bank (IRC; Italian Reference Collection) and 28 from the Mediterranean basin (MB). Genetic polymorphisms were revealed at nuclear and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) microsatellite loci, both at the island scale (Sardinia) and at broader scales, for comparative assessment of the genetic and genotypic diversity and phylogeography.
   Based on nuclear microsatellite loci, Sardinian white poplar consists of a small number of genets (26), each of which is represented by several ramets. Despite the uniqueness of the Sardinian haplotypes and the very low value of genetic diversity at the cpDNA level (v(K) = 0.15), the H-T (0.60) and the A(R) (3.61) values, estimated at the nuclear level for Sardinia, were comparable with those of the other populations and collections.
   The uniqueness of the cpDNA haplotypes, the prevalence of clonality and the restricted number of genets recorded suggest that Sardinian white poplar could be a floristic relict of the native flora of the island, which has spread through available habitats on the island mainly by means of vegetative propagation and human activities.

AB Biodiversity is defined by the scales at which organisms coexist. Coexistence at larger spatial scales may be underpinned by segregation at smaller spatial scales or temporal variability in behaviour and/or distribution. Limpets of the genus Patella are keystone grazers controlling the growth of macro-algae on many rocky shores. This study examined the distribution and abundance of P. vulgata and P. ulyssiponensis in relation to habitat and to each other at a range of spatial scales. Limpets were sampled on four shores on each of the east and west coasts of Ireland, in two different transects (10 m apart) at each of three shore heights in winter 2003 and summer 2004. P. vulgata and P. ulyssiponensis coexist around the coast of Ireland, but on shores where they co-occur, the pattern of coexistence begins to break down at the level of shore height: P. ulyssiponensis were more abundant on the low-shore than mid-shore, and P. vulgata were distributed evenly throughout the low and the mid-shore. At the level of habitat (pools vs. open rock), the two species exhibited a high degree of segregation: P. vulgata of all sizes were more common on open rock and P. ulyssiponensis of all sizes were more common in pools. The presence or absence of P. ulyssiponensis had no effect on the distribution of juvenile P. vulgata with respect to pools. Unexpectedly, however, a greater proportion of adult P. vulgata were found in pools at sites where P. ulyssiponensis were present in the pools than at sites where they were absent. The results of this study emphasize the need for multiple-scale analyses of the distribution and abundance of organisms to understand the organisation of natural assemblages.

AB Total arsenic and arsenic species in the tissues of three growth stages of the macroalgae Ecklonia radiata and within organisms that feed on it are reported. Arsenic concentrations in E. radiata tissues varied from 40 to 153 mu g g(-1). Growth stage did not influence arsenic concentrations or arsenic species. E. radiata contained glycerol arsenoriboside (1-8.5%), phosphate arsenoriboside (10-22%) and sulfonate arsenoriboside (73-91%). Arsenic concentrations varied significantly among animal species and between tissues (5-123 mu g g(-1)). Animals contained variable quantities of arsenobetaine (14-83%). Haliotis rubra tissues contained high concentrations of glycerol trimethylarsonioriboside (0.7-22%) and the fish Odax cyanomelas contained large quantities of phosphate arsenoriboside (25-64%) with little arsenobetaine (1.5-15%).
   Arsenoribosides consumed from macroalgae are substantially converted or differentially accumulated as glycerol and phosphate arsenoribosides in animal tissues. In all animals, phosphate arsenoriboside would appear to be conserved or synthesised de novo. In gastropods, glycerol trimethylarsonioriboside and thio arsenic species are formed in the digestive system. Thus, the intermediate arsenic species that form a plausible pathway for the formation of arsenobetaine from dimethylarsenoribosides are present.

AB Epigaeic arthropods were studied in intermediate-aged pure plantations of the exotic American Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and of European sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.), which had both been established after forest clear-cuts. Studies took place in two blocks in a forest in northwestern Lower Saxony, Germany. Pitfall trapping throughout the vegetation period of 2004 delivered quantitative data for epigaeic macro-arthropods. Communities of ants (Formicidae), ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and spiders (Araneae) were studied in further detail. Several differences in catch numbers, species richness and structure of communities became obvious between the studied stands and are partially interpreted as effects of the different tree cover. As far as environmental factors are concerned, the studied Douglas fir stands showed a high cover of mosses and needle litter, a low weed cover, and a higher soil acidity as compared to the sessile oak plantations. Activity of isopods and diplopods was significantly higher within Douglas fir stands than in those of sessile oak, whereas activity of ants, carabids and weevils was lower in the plantations of this exotic tree species. For all three taxa studied in detail, the numbers of exclusively recorded species were higher in oak stands. Except for wolf spiders (Lycosidae), spider communities of sessile oak sustained to a certain degree in the Douglas fir plantations. On the other hand, communities of ants and carabids were quantitatively impoverished under Douglas fir. Overall, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and cluster analysis showed that the communities of all three taxa in focus were strongly altered by treatment and by area, with treatment prevailing over area. Furthermore, we expected especially carabid communities to recruit individuals continuously from the surrounding deciduous forests. With some reservations resulting from the few replicates studied we conclude, that (1) intermediate-aged pure Douglas fir plantations are no biodiversity deserts as a broad spectrum of epigaeic arthropods persists in the plantations, at least, when these are small.-sized. Furthermore, we conclude that (2) afforestation with exotic Douglas fir leads to conspicuous changes in epigaeic invertebrate communities as compared to autochthonous, deciduous forests of the same age class. Recommendations for forestry using Douglas fir and aimed at conserving biodiversity include the restriction of Douglas fir to recent and new forests, to avoid pure and dense stands, as well as to limit the total area stocked.

AB Tropical forest animals are at high risk worldwide as a result of over-exploitation and forest clearing. Zooarchaeological. studies of animal. use by the ancient Maya of the southern lowland regions of Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, and Mexico provide long-term historical information on animal populations under conditions of human population growth and climatic change that is valuable to both archaeology and conservation biology. In this paper, zooarchaeological data from 35 chronologically defined faunal sub-samples recovered from 25 ancient Maya archaeological sites are used to assess the effects of ancient hunting on animal populations of the Maya region between the Preclassic and Colonial. periods (2000 BC-AD 1697). The variations in species abundance are used as a proxy for describing changes in ancient Maya hunting practices and hunted animal. populations, interpreted on the basis of hunting efficiency models from foraging ecology. A significant reduction in the proportion of large mammals, particularly Odocoileus virginianus, in zooarchaeological assemblages between the Late Classic (AD 600-850) and Terminal Classic/Postclassic periods (AD 850-1519) suggest that over-hunting during the Late Classic may have led to a reduction in availability of these animals to the ancient Maya hunters in the later periods. This finding is discussed in relation to important social and environmental. variations to evaluate the impact of hunting and other factors such as forest clearance and climate on ancient animal populations in the Maya region.

AB We devised a set-up in which microsensors can be used for characterising the gut microenvironment of aquatic macrofauna. In a small flow cell, we measured microscale gradients through dissected guts (O-2, pH, redox potential [E-h ]), in the haemolymph (O-2), and towards the body surface (O-2) of Chironomus plumosus larvae. The gut microenvironment was compared with the chemical conditions in the lake sediment in which the animals reside and feed. When the dissected guts were incubated at the same nominal O-2 concentration as in haemolymph, the gut content was completely anoxic and had pH and E (h) values slightly lower than in the ambient sediment. When the dissected guts were artificially oxygenated, the volumetric O-2-consumption rates of the gut content were at least 10x higher than in the sediment. Using these potential O-2-consumption rates in a cylindrical diffusion-reaction model, it was predicted that diffusion of O-2 from the haemolymph to the gut could not oxygenate the gut content under in vivo conditions. Additionally, the potential O-2-consumption rates were so high that the intake of dissolved O-2 along with feeding could be ruled out to oxygenate the gut content. We conclude that microorganisms present in the gut of C. plumosus cannot exhibit an aerobic metabolism. The presented microsensor technique and the data analysis are applicable to guts of other macrofauna species with cutaneous respiration.

AB Many recent studies of nonindigenous species (NIS) have used life history and morphological characteristics of invaders to either (i) build statistical models that predict new invaders or (ii) test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. However, species characteristics may be confounded if NIS are transported or introduced nonrandomly with respect to the chosen contrast group, which typically consists of native or globally available species. For example, deliberately introduced NIS are often chosen according to economic rather than ecological factors. Here, I use stocking records of salmonid species introduced into Nevada, USA, to test for propagule biases within this system. I find that established salmonids are introduced significantly more times, and in greater numbers, than are those that fail and that species chosen for introduction are a nonrandom sample of the global salmonid species pool. Statistical differences among characteristics of salmonid species that established, those that were introduced, and those from the global source pool suggest that maximum reported size and weight as well as latitudinal range and midlatitude all represent propagule-biased characteristics of salmonids introduced into Nevada. These results highlight the need for caution when using characteristics of invaders to develop statistical models or to test hypotheses relevant to ecology and evolution.

AB Biodiversity conservation is a challenge within developing regions of the world. Landscape heterogeneity is largely directed by interconnected economic and social systems, which are largely driven by political, communal, and private control of the land estate. There is increasing evidence that areas of high species richness may coincide with dense human settlement. Influences of landscape pattern, human impact, and divergent past political land management on functional groups of bird species richness were examined in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The functional groups included species of breeding, non-breeding, generalist, and specialist birds. A database of land-use/land-cover (LULCC) and human impact indicators was used to develop relationships and infer historic changes in bird richness derived from two censusing periods (1975-1979 and 1988-1992). The objective was to examine richness and compare relationships based on analyses using land management regions, avifaunal zones and socio-economic regions. Paired and two-sample t-tests documented differences in richness among land management regions and between regions over time. Landscape metrics, LULCC proportion, and other human impact variables were examined using Monte Carlo permuted multiple regressions to develop relationships for bird richness groups. Significant increases in bird group richness were shown between survey periods, as well as differences between land management regions. The statistical models explained 22-79% of variation in bird richness among avifaunal zones by functional group, and 32-99% of variation in bird richness among the socio-economic regions. The majority of the relationships were explained by LULCC proportion rather than landscape metrics denoting spatial arrangement. The analysis concludes that there have been significant increases in bird richness apparently related to land-use development during the study period. The apparent increase in richness may be due to maintenance of original vegetation-specific species in untransformed fragments in highly transformed areas combined with species that exploit transformed habitats well in the transformed areas. It is concluded that research on the interface between biogeography and human development should be seen as a perquisite for conservation assessments in developing regions of the world.

AB 1 We studied mortality, growth and spatial distribution of individuals of Lysimachia rubida to elucidate causes and consequences of temporal and spatial variations in mortality. This short-lived monocarpic biennial grows in open dry habitats on rocky coastal cliffs of the subtropical Bonin (Ogasawara) Islands, Japan.
   2 All individuals of two successive cohorts that appeared in a 8 x 8-m quadrat were mapped, and their fate and size were recorded at 2-3 month intervals from March 1998 to July 2000. We analysed spatial and temporal changes in the relative importance of plant size, local densities of neighbouring plants and ground surface conditions to determine plant mortality. We also examined spatially non-random mortality and its spatial scales.
   3 Patchy seed dispersal from scattered mother plants resulted in a clumped distribution of seedlings. During the growth cycle of L. rubida , we recognized two growth stages that differed in the relative importance of the factors affecting plant mortality.
   4 At the earlier growth stage, after germination in March until July, mortality was caused mainly by local density. Smaller plants within areas of high local densities were more likely to die. The spatial patterns of surviving and dead plants tended to be regular and aggregated, respectively, in comparison with those expected from random mortality. The spatial scale of aggregation of the dead plants was 5-25 cm, corresponding to the distance of direct interactions between neighbours.
   5 At the later growth stages, in October until May of the following year, mortality was affected mainly by ground surface conditions. Both surviving and dead plants were spatially aggregated at spatial scales of 20-100 cm. Plants tended to survive in microhabitats of smaller gravel, which had a greater water-holding capacity.
   6 This study also showed the consequence of spatial variations in mortality on population structures of L. rubida . Patchy seed dispersal and subsequent temporal and spatial variations in mortality are likely to contribute to the scattered distribution of L. rubida individuals observed at the study site.

AB The extensive presence of artificial reefs in marine coastal habitats demands a better understanding of the extent to which these structures can be considered surrogates of natural rocky shores for populations of plants and animals. The primary aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that removing limpets from the midlittoral of artificial breakwaters in the northwest Mediterranean led to changes in assemblages similar to those observed on rocky shores in the same area. Orthogonal combinations of the presence/absence of two species of limpets, P. aspera and P rustica, were produced using manual removals from June 1997 to February 1998. To test the hypothesis that the effects of limpets were variable at spatial scales comparable to those investigated on rocky shores, we repeated the experiment at two locations tens of kilometres apart, and on two reefs within each location a few kilometres apart. The results revealed strong and relatively consistent negative effects of limpets on filamentous algae, whereas interactions with other members of assemblages were complex and variable. Several taxa (Cyanophyta, encrusting and articulated coralline algae, Ralfsia and Rissoella) were abundant at one location but nearly absent at the other. This large-scale variability in patterns of distribution generated inconsistencies in the effects of limpets between locations. Within locations, several effects of P. aspera and P. rustica were observed, ranging from independent effects on some organisms, to additive or interactive effects on others. Apparently, the removal of filamentous algae by limpets resulted in positive indirect effects on Ralfsia and Rissoella. Collectively, these effects were comparable to those described for rocky shores in the northwest Mediterranean. The processes accounting for large-scale variation in grazing, however, appeared different between the natural and the artificial habitat. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phenology of flowering and fruiting of Rhizophora mangle L., R. harrisonii Leechman, Avicennia germinans (L.) Stearn and Laguncularia racemosa (L.) Gaertn. f., were studied on Maraca Island, a continental island situated between Cape Orange (04 degrees 20'N) and Cape North (01 degrees 40'N) in the state of Amapa, North Brazil. The study was carried out during a complete annual cycle from May 1995 to April 1996. All the phenophases were produced throughout the entire year at almost all of the six studied sites. However, they presented significant peaks which characterized seasonality for all of the measured variables focused in this study. Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa showed significant annual variation in flowering. By contrast, Rhizophora harrisonii presented evenly distributed flowering throughout the same period of observation. The fruiting patterns showed significant variation for all sites. In general, species presented flowering peaks from August to January when temperatures were high. Fruiting peaked from October to April and occurred mostly during the wet period. Although fruiting has correlated significantly with the wet period, the correlation was less significant than that between flowering and the dry period. The flowering burst during the driest period seems to complement the strategy in which massive fruit production is obtained during the wet period. Consequently, it may ensure the development of propagules and the continued occupation of mangrove forests along the intertidal zone in the Amazon region.

AB We sampled zooplankton from mid-May to early September over 2 years to study the spatial and seasonal distribution of animals in a large urban wetland of Lake Ontario. Samples were from several habitat types including open water, vegetated areas, fast-flow areas, and a sewage lagoon. Mean seasonal densities ranged from 17 individuals/L (5 mu g/L) in fast-flow areas to 1800 individuals/L (1100 mu g/L) in low-flow, highly vegetated areas. All of our sites were dominated by herbivorous rotifers (e.g., Brachionus sp., Polyarthra sp., Keratella sp.), small herbivorous cladocerans (Bosmina longirostris; mean length <300 mu m), cyclopoid nauplii, and medium-sized cladocerans (e.g., Moina micrura; mean length 300-600 mu m), which were absent from the most eutrophic sites. The high levels of inorganic suspended solids in the marsh appeared to select against large filter feeders such as Daphnia and allowed smaller zooplankton to dominate. Multivariate analyses indicated that the zooplankton distribution was related to flow rate, extent of macrophyte cover, and level of site degradation. if the forthcoming carp (Cyprinus carpio) exclusion from Cootes Paradise Marsh results in increased macrophyte growth, we predict that zooplankton biomass will increase and that the zooplankton community may shift to larger forms.

AB Cysts of three species of anostracans (Branchipus schaefferi, Chirocephalus diaphanus, and Tarzymastigites perrieri), two species of Notostracans (Triops numidicus and Lepidurus apus) and one species of Spinicaudata (Leptestheria mayeti) were collected from the upper 2 cm of dry sediments at intervals along transects from a temporary pool in an arid zone of Morocco and from two ditches in France. The horizontal distribution of viable cysts was patchy and is discussed in relation to several ecological parameters prevailing during the aquatic phase. These include vegetation distribution, depth and morphometry of the pond, dominant wind pattern, and granularity of the sediments.
   The densities reached more than 1700 cysts of C. diaphanus per 100 cm(2), and 1150 cysts of L. apus per 100 cm(2) in the two ditches. The mean densities of cysts per 100 cm(2) calculated for each transect ranged from 250 to 450 for C. diaphanus and 240 to 260 for L, apus tin the ditch populations) and about 1-6 for T. perrieri and L. mayeti, 3-15 for B. schaefferi, and 16-58 for T. numidicus in the pool in Morocco.

AB Environmental and biological conditions of the intertidal zone vary according to tidal level. Monodonta labio (Gastropoda; trochidae) occurs over the whole range of the intertidal zone, but juveniles occur only in the mid intertidal zone. In this study, vertical migration of this snail was investigated by mark-recapture techniques for 1 yr at Amakusa, Japan. Snails migrated vertically throughout the year, but varied with season and size. Generally, juvenile snails (<7 mm in shell width) did not actively migrate. Upward migration was conspicuous only in small snails (7 to 10 mm) in summer. Downward migration was greatest in the larger size classes. Thus, large snails (greater than or equal to 13 mm) gradually migrated downward to the lower zone. Seasonal fluctuations in the vertical distribution pattern of M. labio could be explained by this vertical migration. Possible factors affecting this vertical migration and the adaptive significance of migration in the life history of M. labio are discussed.

AB Neusiedler See, a shallow alkaline lake, has become increasingly eutrophic; this enrichment improved the nutritive situation of the herbivorous zooplankton leading to a higher standing stock. A multiple regression analysis of the long-term development of the crustacean plankton indicates that abiotic factors (i.e. wind, temperature) have the most important impact on the community in spring and autumn, biotic factors (i.e. food, predation) during the summer months. Currently an invertebrate (Leptodora kindti) and two planktivorous fish (Pelecus cultratus and Alburnus alburnus) control the population development of Diaphanosoma mongolianum during summer. L. kindti predation acts on immature stages, whereas the fishes consume adult stages. L. kindti densities of 100 to 200 ind. x m-3 affect the prey population to a negligible extent; densities between 300 and 500 ind. x m-3 result in elimination rates of 5 % to > 40 % of the juvenile Diaphanosoma stock. The impacts by the invertebrate predator are pronounced but short-term events. Juvenile and underyearling fish eliminate 4-13% of the zooplankton in the open lake and 5-33% inshore; their predation pressure acts on all younger stages of the crustaceans. Planktivorous fish older than 0 + concentrate on the large food items (adult stages of the crustaceans). A. alburnus is able to consume 6-16% of the zooplankton standing stock during summer. P. cultratus eliminates about 1-49% of D. mongolianum, 1-4% of A. spinosus and 1-31% of L. kindti. From May until August the position of the dominant predator changes, beginning with juvenile fish which are then followed by P. cultratus and then by A. alburnus. Predation by L. kindti is of importance in July and August; at that time it causes suppression of the juveniles of D. mongolianum, but, on the other hand, the older stages of L. kindti are endangered themselves by the predatory impact of planktivorous fish.

AB A number of authors have hypothesized that outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) are initiated by increased larval survival. This is then linked to the presence, in the water column, of various components of terrestrial runoff (pesticides, lowered salinity, nutrients, and dissolved and particulate organic matter) during the pelagic larval stage of the starfish. A related hypothesis suggests that recent outbreaks on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are initiated by the eutrophic condition of the GBR lagoon. It is claimed that this eutrophication is caused by anthropogenic input of terrestrially derived nutrients.
   The present paper reviews current knowledge of the possible influence of components of terrestrial runoff on various stages in the life cycle of larval and juvenile A. planci. Processes that could be most influenced by enhanced nutrient conditions are those of planktonic survival, settlement success and juvenile survival. Available data on the state of eutrophication of parts of the GBR lagoon do not support assertions of general eutrophication but do suggest that elevated nutrient conditions exist in localized areas and that this may be caused by terrestrial runoff. The areas affected coincide with areas suggested as the primary initiation areas of two waves of crown-of-thorns outbreaks.
   Further research required to understand larval survival includes studies on differences in the kinds and amounts of food available to A. planci larvae in low- and high-nutrient conditions, the effects of elevated nutrients on coralline algae and their associated bacteria and hence larval settlement processes, and the offshore effects of river-borne nutrients in coral reef regions.

AB The lives lost and economic costs of viral zoonotic pandemics have steadily increased over the past century. Prominent policymakers have promoted plans that argue the best ways to address future pandemic catastrophes should entail, "detecting and containing emerging zoonotic threats." In other words, we should take actions only after humans get sick. We sharply disagree. Humans have extensive contact with wildlife known to harbor vast numbers of viruses, many of which have not yet spilled into humans. We compute the annualized damages from emerging viral zoonoses. We explore three practical actions to minimize the impact of future pandemics: better surveillance of pathogen spillover and development of global databases of virus genomics and serology, better management of wildlife trade, and substantial reduction of deforestation. We find that these primary pandemic prevention actions cost less than 1/20th the value of lives lost each year to emerging viral zoonoses and have substantial cobenefits.

AB Sustainably managed non-native trees deliver economic and societal benefits with limited risk of spread to adjoining areas. However, some plantations have launched invasions that cause substantial damage to biodiversity and ecosystem services, while others pose substantial threats of causing such impacts. The challenge is to maximise the benefits of non-native trees, while minimising negative impacts and preserving future benefits and options.
   A workshop was held in 2019 to develop global guidelines for the sustainable use of non-native trees, using the Council of Europe - Bern Convention Code of Conduct on Invasive Alien Trees as a starting point.
   The global guidelines consist of eight recommendations: 1) Use native trees, or non-invasive nonnative trees, in preference to invasive non-native trees; 2) Be aware of and comply with international, national, and regional regulations concerning non-native trees; 3) Be aware of the risk of invasion and consider global change trends; 4) Design and adopt tailored practices for plantation site selection and silvicultural management; 5) Promote and implement early detection and rapid response programmes; 6) Design and adopt tailored practices for invasive non-native tree control, habitat restoration, and for dealing with highly modified ecosystems; 7) Engage with stakeholders on the risks posed by invasive nonnative trees, the impacts caused, and the options for management; and 8) Develop and support global networks, collaborative research, and information sharing on native and non-native trees.
   The global guidelines are a first step towards building global consensus on the precautions that should be taken when introducing and planting non-native trees. They are voluntary and are intended to complement statutory requirements under international and national legislation. The application of the global guidelines and the achievement of their goals will help to conserve forest biodiversity, ensure sustainable forestry, and contribute to the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations linked with forest biodiversity.

AB Protected areas fall far short of securing the space needed to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem function at a global scale and in the face of climate change. The prospects of conserving biodiversity in working landscapes help buffer the insularization effects of protected areas and hold great potential for biodiversity conservation on a landscape scale but depend on finding adequate space and a meaningful place in the lives of rural land users. Using a case study in southern Kenya, we show that the conservation of large open landscapes, biodiversity and the coexistence between wildlife and livestock can be achieved indirectly by reinforcing pastoral practices that depend on open space, mobility, social networks and institutional arrangements governing common-pool resources. Pastoral practices and wildlife both depend on large multiscale interactions within interlinked social and ecological systems, which are threatened by land fragmentation, alienation and degradation. We show that large open spaces can be maintained by using a conservation approach starting from within community aspirations that emphasize the links between livelihoods, productivity, efficiency and resilience in pastoral economies and the secondary benefits of wildlife enterprises. Scaling up from an ecosystem to multi-scale approach benefits pastoral communities by building resilience and new economic opportunities. In the process, the expanded scale conserves regional biodiversity and large free-ranging herbivore and carnivore populations underpinning ecosystem function and the nationally important tourism industry centered on the Kenya-Tanzania boundary. The 'inside-out' approach to the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity is place-based, draws on local knowledge and informal governance arrangements and avoids the stigma of wildlife conservation driven by outside agencies. The human-centered approach reinforces land health and spatial connectivity and encourages multi-level and distributed governance arrangements embedded in large regional and national jurisdictions.

   Kikemikali
   Maeneo ya uhifadhi, ukuzingatia mabadiliko ya hali ya hewa, hayajafikia kiwango kinachohitajika kudumisha uendelevu wa bianuwai na utenda kazi wa ikolojia ulimwenguni. Kuhifadhi bianuwai kwenye ardhi inayotumika na watu yaweza kusaidia kuzuia maeneo ya uhifadhi kuwa visiwa, hivyo basi kuimarisha uwezo wa kuhifadhi bianuwai kwa maeneo makubwa ya mazingira. Lakini hili lategemea kupata nafasi ya kutosha, na umuhimu wake kutambulika katika maisha ya watumia ardhi vijijini. Kutumia uchunguzi wetu kwenye eneo la kusini mwa Kenya, twaonyesha ya kwamba uhifadhi wa maeneo makubwa ya mazingira yaliyowazi, uhifadhi ya bianuwai, na usawa wa utangamano baina ya wanyamapori na mifugo kwawezekana kupitia kuimaarisha tabia za ufugaji zinazotegemea maeneo yaliyowazi, uhamaji, mifumo ya kijamii, na mipangilio ya taasisi zinazoongoza rasilimali za watuwengi kwa pamoja. Mila na itikadi miongoni wa jamii za ufugaji, na wanyamapori, wote hutegemea mwingiliano ya kijamii na kiikolojia, ambayo inayotishiwa na ugavi wa ardhi, kutengwa na uharibifu. Tunaonyesha kwamba maeneo mengi ya ardhi yaliyo wazi yaweza kudumishwa kutumia njia ya uhifadhi mazingra ambayo inanzia ndani ya matamanio ya jamii, ambayo inasisitiza uhusiano kati ya riziki, tija, ufanisi, na ujasiri katika uchumi wa ufugaji, na pili, faida zinginezo zitokanazo na biashara zinazotegemea wanyamapori. Kupanua kiwango kutoka kwa mfumo mmoja wa ikolojia, hadi kwa mifumo nyingi, inafaidi jamii za wafugaji kwa kujenga ujasiri na fursa mpya za kiuchumi. Katika mchakato huo, kiwango kilichopanuliwa huhifadhi bianuwai ya kikanda pamoja na idadi kubwa ya wanyamapori, walanyasi na walanyama, ambao inashikiria utendakazi wa ikolojia pamoja na kumarisha chumi muhimu ya utalii kwenye eneo ya mipaka ya Kenya na nchi jirani ya Tanzania. Njia hii ya, "kuanzia ndani kuelekea nje" kakita uhifadhi wa wanyamapori na bianuwai, hutofautiana kutoka mahali moja hadi nyingine, kulingana na ujuzi ulioko mtaani na mipango ya utawala isiyo rasmi na huzuia unyanyapaa unaotokana na uhifadhi wa wanyamapori ambao unaendeshwa na mashirika ya nje. Njia hii inayozingatia binadamu, huimarisha afya ya ardhi, uunganisho wa anga na pia inahimiza mipangilio ya utawala ya ngazi tofauti iliyowekwa kwenye mamlaka kuu ya kikanda na ya kitaifa.

AB Cities and urban regions have become central to ensuring a sustainable future. Many regions employ strategic spatial planning, a transformative and integrative public-sector-led activity, to create a coherent spatial development strategy in order to pursue sustainable development. Due to its encompassing, cross-sectoral qualities, landscape science is expected to strengthen nature-related aspects of urban planning. The aim of this paper is thus to assess the role of landscape in contemporary strategic spatial planning. This study is based on content analysis of the strategic spatial plans of 18 European urban regions. Plans were assessed following a framework that focuses on how plans took advantage of landscape's integrative power, how plans are based in knowledge on functioning of landscape systems, and how plans show the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. The findings show that landscape science contributes considerably to strategic planning. Overall, the strategic plans of European urban regions had a strong anthropocentric perspective on landscapes. Most of the plans are based on knowledge about landscape functioning and show the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. However, only few use the full potential of the integrative power of landscapes in terms of governance processes. Based on our analysis, we identified research needs and suggested recommendations for future strategic planning with the aim of strengthening nature-related aspects in strategic spatial planning.

AB Increasingly frequent and severe droughts under climate change are expected to have major impacts on vegetation worldwide. However, research to date has focused on tree vulnerability to drought in forests. Less is known about trees and drought in savannas, where a sparse tree layer coexists with grass. These tree-grass interactions (often mediated by fire and herbivory) shape savanna tree ecology, and confound predictions of how strongly drought might affect trees. On the one hand, drought is physiologically stressful, which could harm trees and be exacerbated by herbivore impacts; on the other hand, trees adapted to semiarid savannas might be relatively drought tolerant, and the considerable impacts of drought on grass could even benefit trees via reduced grass competition and fire risk, especially in the year following a drought. Here, we sought to understand the net effects of severe drought on the savanna tree layer, and how fire and herbivory mediate these effects. We monitored tree growth, mortality, and community structure for 2 yr within existing long-term fire and herbivory experiments across a drought-severity contrast, following a major drought in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Overall, severe drought was a major stressor for trees. Tree mortality rates in most species increased by an order of magnitude in the year following drought, and slower growth rates for some persisted for 2 yr. At the community level, this translated into substantial decreases in tree densities. Herbivory and fire did little either to mitigate or exacerbate drought effects on trees, and overall, drought swamped effects of herbivory and fire that have otherwise been observed. However, species differed in their responses to drought, with some dominant encroaching species especially vulnerable. We suggest that increasing drought frequency and severity could drastically alter savanna vegetation by repeatedly killing off trees.

AB 1. Savanna ecosystems span a diverse range of climates, edaphic conditions, and disturbance regimes, the complexity of which has stimulated long-standing interest in the mechanisms that maintain tree-grass coexistence. One hypothesis suggests that tree establishment is strongly limited by one or several demographic bottlenecks at early stages of the tree life cycle. A major impediment to testing this hypothesis is the lack of data on the relative strengths of different bottle-necks across key environmental gradients.
   2. To identify demographic bottlenecks that limit early tree establishment (0-18 months), we conducted a series of transplant experiments with two savanna trees species (Acacia robusta and Acacia tortilis) across a natural rainfall and soil fertility gradient in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania. We tested the interactive effects of precipitation, herbivory, seed scarification, grass competition, water limitation, and tree species identity on two key life stages: germination and early seedling survival (0-2 months), and juvenile seedling survival (2-18 months).
   3. Germination and early seedling survival increased as a function of rainfall, in the absence of herbivores and when seeds were scarified. Juvenile seedling survival, in contrast, decreased with rainfall but increased in the absence of herbivores. Grass removal had the single strongest (positive) effect on juvenile seedling survival of any treatment. Soil moisture monitoring and grass-addition treatments revealed that grasses negatively affected seedlings in ways that were not necessarily linked to soil moisture.
   4. A demographic model combining all effects across early life stages showed that the strength of grass competition on juvenile seedling survival was the key factor limiting early tree establishment. While rainfall had an unexpected opposing effect on the two life stages, the net effect of mean annual precipitation on early tree establishment was positive.
   5. Synthesis. Successful tree establishment in Serengeti is maximized by a seemingly unlikely sequence of events: (a) scarification of seeds by browsers, (b) heavy rainfall to promote germination, (c) intensive grazing (but absence of browsers), and (d) dry conditions during juvenile seedling growth (>2 months) to reduce competition with grasses. By considering a wide suite of conditions and their interactions, our experimental results are relevant to ongoing debates about savanna vegetation dynamics and structural shifts in tree:grass ratios.

AB This paper aims to contribute to the ongoing conceptual development and practical pursuit of resilience, the ability to absorb and respond to shocks, in an agricultural and climate change context. It builds on work that aims to dissolve the nature-society dualism and naturalisation of power relations inherent in systems thinking by developing and extending a framework originally conceived to integrate research on biological and cultural diversity. The resultant 'biocultural' framework examines livelihood practices, institutions, knowledge and beliefs and is applied to a case study of cocoa communities in Ghana's Central Region. Drawing on data collected over three years spanning an El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related drought event, the analysis demonstrates the utility of an expanded conception of resilience that links livelihood practices, which define the impact and response to droughts, with the constituent knowledge, institutions and beliefs that shape those practices. The study focuses on two key factors that underpin cocoa farmers' resilience to climate shocks: access to wetlands and access to credit. We argue that particular characteristics of livelihood practices, knowledge, belief and institutions, and their interactions, can be both resilience enhancing and undermining, when viewed at different spatial, temporal and social scales. Although such contradictions present challenges to policy-makers engaging with climate resilience, the analysis provides a clearer diagnoses of key challenges to the resilience of agricultural systems and insights into where policy interventions might be most effective.

AB Populations of large carnivores are declining at a rapid rate, primarily resulting from land use change due to increasing human pressure. Such changes can restrict available habitat for many species, particularly wide-ranging large carnivores. In Botswana, aside from protected areas, large tracts of land are set aside as wildlife management areas (WMAs). Wildlife management areas are important regions of habitat for many species and can serve as buffer zones between protected areas and agro-pastoral land, while allowing communities to utilise resources. It was hypothesised that land use type surrounding WMAs, human settlements and prey availability might affect carnivore distribution patterns. We conducted a camera-trap study with 96 stations in two WMAs in the Ghanzi district and used a Royles-Nichol multi-species occupancy model to test which factors influenced habitat use for nine carnivore species. Detection probability was low across all species, whereas occupancy varied substantially. Lion occurrence was highest close to protected areas, whereas leopards and brown hyaena occurred closer to commercial farms. Black-backed jackal and caracal had high occurrence probabilities near both protected and commercial farming areas. Settlement locations and wild prey availability did not strongly influence occurrence of any species, although black-backed jackals had higher occurrence in areas with high livestock frequency. As pressure for land continues to increase, available habitat for wildlife is reduced and wide-ranging species like carnivores are vulnerable to edge effects. The WMAs provide vital habitat for carnivores and can be used to improve livelihoods for communities, whilst maintaining biodiversity in the Kalahari.

   Condition indicators
ID INVASIVE ALIEN PLANTS; VEGETATION; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY
AB The presence, diversity and abundance of non-native plant species in natural vegetation are common condition indicators used to determine conservation status, with consequences for management strategies and investment. The rationale behind non-native species metrics as condition indicators is the assumption that non-natives have negative consequences on native biodiversity and habitat condition. The case against non-native species is not so clear-cut, with some studies reporting neutral or even facilitative interactions, often depending on spatial scale. Observational and experimental evaluations of the impact of particular non-native species on biodiversity provide a vital evidence-base for general conservation management strategies. Unintentionally though, many studies that quantify the impacts of non-native species have resulted in a publication bias in which species with known impacts are selected for investigation far more often than benign species. Here we argue that meta-analyses of the impacts of individual non-native species on natives, no matter how meticulous or objective, should not be generalized beyond the set of 'training' species. The likelihood of such extrapolation is increased when meta-analyses are reported with little qualification as to the skewed sampling towards problematic species, and because alternative findings such as non-native assemblages having positive interactions with native biodiversity, are under-reported. To illustrate, we discuss two meta-analyses that make general conclusions from impact studies skewed towards 'transformers', the most extreme invaders. We warn that if generic non-native species management strategies were to be based on these conclusions, they could not only fail to meet objectives but in some instances harm native biodiversity.

AB Topsoil replacement is a standard procedure in restoration of mined landscapes as it provides a source of propagules via the soil seed bank, as well as provides favourable physical, chemical and microbiological properties for plant establishment. With the availability of topsoil frequently limited in mining, soil cover designs that maximise the use of this resource across the newly-created surfaces after mining should be considered. In this paper, we examine the use of different soil covers and their influence on seedling recruitment for restoration of a Threatened Ecological Community (TEC) with limited topsoil. The properties of a standard topsoil and topsoil diluted with waste-rock to optimise spread were compared between two topsoil sources with different textures and a fine-textured waste material that is a mining by-product. We studied the physicochemical and hydrological traits of five soil covers (unblended TEC topsoil; TEC topsoil mixed with waste rock; fines; fines mixed with waste rock, and waste rock) with two TEC topsoil sources (plateau and hillslope). Soil characterisation included texture, gravel content, soil surface crust strength, soil moisture and temperature, and surface infiltration. Finally, we quantified seedling emergence for four key taxa sown (Acacia acuminata, Allocasuarina acutivalvis, Melaleuca nematophylla, Waitzia nitida) and the seedling community arising from the topsoil seedbank and naturally dispersed seeds, and related this emergence with the soil properties. The standard topsoil cover promoted the greatest seedling emergence showing marked differences between the two topsoil provenances. Importantly, the addition of waste rock to topsoil did not compromise the ability of topsoil to support seedling emergence and is therefore a useful strategy to maximise this resource. Overall, our results show the importance of hydrological properties of soil covers for seedling recruitment and highlight the importance of topsoil selection in restoration success.

AB Background: Air travel is associated with the spread of influenza through infected passengers and potentially through in-flight transmission. Contact tracing after exposure to influenza is not performed systematically. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the evidence for influenza transmission aboard aircraft. Methods: Using PubMed and EMBASE databases, we identified and critically appraised identified records to assess the evidence of such transmission to passengers seated in close proximity to the index cases. We also developed a bias assessment tool to evaluate the quality of evidence provided in the retrieved studies. Results: We identified 14 peer-reviewed publications describing contact tracing of passengers after possible exposure to influenza virus aboard an aircraft. Contact tracing during the initial phase of the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 pandemic was described in 11 publications. The studies describe the follow-up of 2,165 (51%) of 4,252 traceable passengers. Altogether, 163 secondary cases were identified resulting in an overall secondary attack rate among traced passengers of 7.5%. Of these secondary cases, 68 (42%) were seated within two rows of the index case. Conclusion: We found an overall moderate quality of evidence for transmission of influenza virus aboard an aircraft. The major limiting factor was the comparability of the studies. A majority of secondary cases was identified at a greater distance than two rows from the index case. A standardized approach for initiating, conducting, and reporting contact tracing could help to increase the evidence base for better assessing influenza transmission aboard aircraft.

In Eastern and Southern Africa, land-use change and a loss of connectivity have coincided with widespread declines in the abundance and geographic range of ungulate populations. Using photographic capture-mark-recapture, we examine the historical pattern of loss of connectivity and its impact on population trends in a partially migratory wildebeest population in northern Tanzania. To estimate abundance, we use a novel modeling approach that overcomes bias associated with photo misidentifications. Our data indicate (1) diminished connectivity within and between seasonal areas as a result of human activities, (2) a reduction in the overall population size compared to historical numbers, with high variability over time, (3) the continued use of highly constrained movement corridors between the three main seasonal ranges, (4) higher recruitment in the non-migratory subpopulation (Lake Manyara National Park) than in other areas of the ecosystem, and (5) an increase in the relative abundance of resident to migrant wildebeest. Recent conservation efforts to protect seasonal habitat and to enforce anti-poaching policies outside protected areas have likely helped stabilize the population, at least temporarily, but we caution that several key vulnerabilities remain.

AB Forest cover is notoriously sparse across neotropical southeastern South America. In particular, the practically treeless landscapes of the Campos, as they are locally known, have puzzled ecologists since Darwin's time. We used remote-sensing information and spatial regression models to relate tree cover to resource availability (i.e. climate, soil fertility, soil water holding capacity), disturbances (i.e. fire occurrence, cattle grazing) and landscape features that can mediate the effects of both (i.e. topography, distance to rivers). To better understand these relationships, we conducted the analysis at different spatial scales across non-cultivated areas of southeastern South America. Overall, tree cover in southeastern South America increases with precipitation but is limited by livestock densities and fire occurrence. Forests are concentrated close to rivers, especially in the Campos region, where cattle grazing seems to prevent tree expansion into the grasslands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Landscapes of the eastern Cape Floristic Region are extremely rich in biomes. Analysis of the determinants of boundaries between biomes can generate insights and predictions that are useful for the applied ecological sciences. Here we used a historical data set and multivariate methods to explore the determinants of the boundaries of Forest, Fynbos, Grassland, Renosterveld and Thicket biomes in a 1200 km(2) area of the Kouga region. The data set comprised 203 (10 m x 10 m) sites with corresponding landscape-scale environmental variables, and 100 sites with corresponding site-bound edaphic (physical and chemical) variables. Of the landscape variables, soil drainage and fire exposure had the strongest biome-specific associations; most Grassland occurred on seasonally waterlogged soils and Renosterveld on moderately drained soils. While Forest was exclusively associated with landscapes protected from fire, much Fynbos and Thicket were found in areas exposed to fires of intermediate frequency; however, in these situations Fynbos is restricted to sandstone-derived soils and thicket to shalederived soils. Other strong patterns were the restriction of Forest to sandstone-derived soils and of Thicket to soils of deep to intermediate depth. Soils of the majority of Fynbos and Grassland were shallow, rocky and infertile, while those of Forest and Thicket were deep, rock-free and fertile, especially in terms of oxidizable carbon and total nitrogen. The relatively high fertility of Forest and Thicket soils is attributed canopy-induced enrichment in the prolonged absence of fire. Renosterveld occupied soils of intermediate fertility. These patterns can provide useful insights for developing experimental approached to simultaneously assess the determinants of multiple boundaries in the biome-rich landscape of the eastern Cape Floristic Region.

AB To assess the impacts of Ailanthus altissima and Robinia pseudoacacia on the whole litterfall process and on soil properties of riparian ecosystems of Central Spain by comparing invaded and non-invaded forests.
   We selected 3-4 plots of four different types of forests: invaded by A. altissima or R. pseudoacacia, or dominated by the native Fraxinus angustifolia or Populus alba. In each plot we collected the litter monthly over 2 years and separated the litter from different plant organs. We calculated annual inputs of litter, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to soil. We also analyzed soil pH, organic matter (OM), N and P.
   Most litter fractions from the two invasive trees contained over twice as much N as those from the native P. alba. Although not significantly different, the annual inputs of N in invaded forests were 1.7-2.2 times higher than in native forests. In the invaded forests, extra litterfall peaks were found in summer and/or late-spring (June), corresponding to reproductive and/or leaf litter fractions. The percentage of annual litter represented by these peaks was over twice those in native forests. Soil OM, N and P were higher in invaded than in P. alba forests. In addition, forests invaded by R. pseudoacacia had higher soil OM and N than F. angustifolia forests.
   This study showed the capability of A. altissima and R. pseudoacacia to alter soil properties and litterfall dynamics in riparian ecosystems.

AB Short rotation woody bioenergy crops (SRWC) could contribute a substantial portion of the biomass required to meet federal mandates and offset carbon emissions. One SRWC with strong bioenergy potential is black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), planted extensively for wood and energy applications globally, but under-studied in its native US. This member of the Fabaceae family can fix nitrogen, tolerate stress, and sequester carbon while generating biomass yields up to 14 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). This article offers a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of production practices, biomass and energy yield estimates, environmental risks and benefits, and economic considerations for this promising feedstock.

AB Animals use a variety of escape mechanisms to increase the probability of surviving predatory attacks. Antipredator defenses can be elaborate, making their evolutionary origin unclear. Trap-jaw ants are known for their rapid and powerful predatory mandible strikes, and some species have been observed to direct those strikes at the substrate, thereby launching themselves into the air away from a potential threat. This potential escape mechanism has never been examined in a natural context. We studied the use of mandible-powered jumping in Odontomachus brunneus during their interactions with a common ant predator: pit-building antlions. We observed that while trap-jaw ant workers escaped from antlion pits by running in about half of interactions, in 15% of interactions they escaped by mandible-powered jumping. To test whether escape jumps improved individual survival, we experimentally prevented workers from jumping and measured their escape rate. Workers with unrestrained mandibles escaped from antlion pits significantly more frequently than workers with restrained mandibles. Our results indicate that some trap-jaw ant species can use mandible-powered jumps to escape from common predators. These results also provide a charismatic example of evolutionary co-option, where a trait that evolved for one function (predation) has been co-opted for another (defense).

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID MATRIX-BOUND PHOSPHINE; SEDIMENTS; EMISSION; ESTUARY; CHINA
AB Most studies on phosphorus cycle in the natural environment focused on phosphates, with limited data available for the reduced phosphine (PH3). In this paper, matrix-bound phosphine (MBP), gaseous phosphine fluxes and phosphorus fractions in the soils were investigated from a penguin colony, a seal colony and the adjacent animal-lacking tundra and background sites. The MBP levels (mean 200.3 ng kg(-1)) in penguin colony soils were much higher than those in seal colony soils, animal-lacking tundra soils and the background soils. Field PH3 flux observation and laboratory incubation experiments confirmed that penguin colony soils produced much higher PH3 emissions than seal colony soils and animal-lacking tundra soils. Overall high MBP levels and PH3 emissions were modulated by soil biogeochemical processes associated with penguin activities: sufficient supply of the nutrients phosphorus, nitrogen, and organic carbon from penguin guano, high soil bacterial abundance and phosphatase activity. It was proposed that organic or inorganic phosphorus compounds from penguin guano or seal excreta could be reduced to PH3 in the Antarctic soils through the bacterial activity. Our results indicated that penguin activity significantly increased soil phosphine formation and phosphorus contribution, thus played an important role in phosphorus cycle in terrestrial ecosystems of maritime Antarctica.

AB The rapid growth in plantation forestry over the past two decades attests to the sector's importance in meeting rising global demand for timber, fuel and fiber. However, plantation forests differ dramatically from natural forests in the types of ecosystem services they can provide. As a result, it is important to understand the aggregate effects of plantation expansion on natural forests. Using a simple partial equilibrium model and a global panel dataset of forest statistics, this paper assesses the impacts of plantation expansion upon the extent of natural forests. The analysis shows that plantation expansion has resulted in a contraction of natural forests dedicated to forest product extraction, but an expansion of un-harvested natural forests and the associated generation of ecosystem services. The model and empirical evidence emphasize, however, that there is significant heterogeneity in this outcome depending upon the own-price elasticity of demand for forest products and, as a result, the trade intensity of the forestry sector. The potential for beneficial effects of plantation expansion on un-harvested natural forests is diminished in countries with trade-oriented forestry sectors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB In shallow-water systems, fisheries management influences herbivory, which mediates ecosystem processes by regulating algal biomass, primary production, and competition between benthic organisms, such as algae and corals. Sea urchins and herbivorous fishes (scrapers, grazers, browsers) are the dominant herbivores in Kenya's fringing coral reef and their grazing influences coral-macroalgal dynamics and dominance. Using experimental substrata and grazer exclusions, we tested the hypothesis that herbivores differentially affect algal composition and succession using 3 levels of fisheries management: fished reefs, community-managed closures (<10 yr old, <0.5 km(2)), and government-managed closures (20 to 40 yr old, 5 to 10 km(2)). In fished reefs and government closures, herbivores facilitated maintenance of early successional algal species, such as turfs, associated with sea urchins in the former and scraping fishes in the latter. Crustose coralline algae were only abundant in government closures, and video recordings showed that fish grazing was greatest at these sites, most notably for parrotfishes (scrapers). A combination of sea urchins and small grazing and detritivorous fishes was present in community closures, which allowed macroalgae to quickly develop from turf into early then late successional stages. These reefs may represent an intermediate or transitional system of herbivore dominance characterized by macroalgae. Consequently, reefs in heavily fished seascapes initially protected from fishing may require additional management efforts to facilitate the recovery of larger-bodied scraping fishes, including bans on capturing parrotfishes and restricting gear (e.g. spearguns) that target these species.

AB The structure and function of savannas is contingent upon tree sapling establishment into the ecosystem. Frequent rainfall, canopy shade and nutrient availability are the main factors influencing recruitment of tree saplings. Grass competition has potential to change the tree establishment dynamics by interacting with these factors. The factors affecting tree sapling establishment have been well studied and tested in arid and semi-arid environments (approx. 0.350-0.750 m mean annual precipitation [MAP]) compared to humid (>1.000 m MAP) savanna ecosystems. We studied the effects of water (frequent irrigation vs. rainfall), shade (presence vs. absence), nutrients (addition vs. no addition) and grass competition (presence vs. absence) on sapling survival and functional traits related to growth and size of four dominant humid savanna species and four dominant mesic savanna species (approx. 0.750 m MAP), under controlled field conditions in a humid South African savanna. None of the treatments had an effect on sapling survival. Growth of the saplings did not depend on the frequency of watering, probably due to high rainfall received in humid savannas. Shade had a strong negative effect on sapling growth, suppressing the beneficial effects of nutrient availability and absence of grass competition. Net positive effects of nutrient availability had less influence over sapling growth than the negative effects exerted by grass competition. Overall shoot growth increased with nutrient addition while investment in leaves drastically declined with grass competition. We conclude that canopy shade is a strong potential driver of structure and function of humid savanna ecosystems, although we recognize that nutrient limitation and grass competition additionally influence tree sapling establishment.

AB Persistence or disappearance of plants under grazing pressure has led to their categorisation as grazing increasers or decreasers. We aimed to extend this classical indicator concept in rangeland ecology by interpreting the shape of species responses and trait patterns modelled along continuous grazing gradients at different spatial scales.
   Taking transects of two different lengths, we recorded the cover of vascular plant species along grazing gradients in central Namibian rangelands. We used a hierarchical set of ecologically meaningful models with increasing complexity - the HOF (Huisman-Olff-Fresco) approach - to investigate species' grazing responses, diversity parameters and pooled cover values for two traits: growth form and life cycle.
   Based on our modelling results, we classified species responses into eight types: no response, monotonic increasers/decreasers, threshold increasers/decreasers, symmetric unimodal responses, left skewed and right skewed unimodal responses.
   The most common category was that of no response (42% of the short and 79% of the long transect responses). At both scales, decreaser responses with higher grazing pressure were more frequent than increaser responses. Monotonic and threshold responses were more frequent along the short transects.
   Diversity parameters showed a slight but continuous decline towards higher grazing intensities. Responses of growth form and life cycle categories were mostly consistent at both scales. Trees, shrubs, dwarf shrubs, and perennials declined continuously. Woody forbs tended to show a symmetric unimodal distribution along the gradients, while herbaceous forbs and annuals showed skewed unimodal responses towards lower grazing intensities.
   The different grazing response types proposed in this study allow for a differentiated picture of niche patterns along grazing gradients and provide a basis to use species as indicators for a continuum of vegetation states altered by livestock impact. The general decline of plant diversity with increasing grazing intensities highlights the importance of reserves that are less impacted by grazing to support the resilience of the studied system.

AB Afromontane forest ecosystems share a high similarity of plant and animal biodiversity, although they occur mainly on isolated mountain massifs throughout the continent. This resemblance has long provoked questions on former wider distribution of Afromontane forests. In this study Prunus africana (one of the character trees of Afromontane forests) is used as a model for understanding the biogeography of this vegetation zone.
   Thirty natural populations from nine African countries covering a large part of Afromontane regions were analysed using six nuclear microsatellites. Standard population genetic analysis as well as Bayesian and maximum likelihood models were used to infer genetic diversity, population differentiation, barriers to gene flow, and recent and all migration among populations.
   Prunus africana exhibits strong divergence among five main Afromontane regions: West Africa, East Africa west of the Eastern Rift Valley (ERV), East Africa east of the ERV, southern Africa and Madagascar. The strongest divergence was evident between Madagascar and continental Africa. Populations from West Africa showed high similarity with East African populations west of the ERV, whereas populations east of the ERV are closely related to populations of southern Africa, respectively.
   The observed patterns indicate divergent population history across the continent most likely associated to Pleistocene changes in climatic conditions. The high genetic similarity between populations of West Africa with population of East Africa west of the ERV is in agreement with faunistic and floristic patterns and provides further evidence for a historical migration route. Contrasting estimates of recent and historical gene flow indicate a shift of the main barrier to gene flow from the Lake Victoria basin to the ERV, highlighting the dynamic environmental and evolutionary history of the region.

AB Restoration is gaining importance in the management of plant invasions. As the success of restoration projects is frequently determined by factors other than ecological ones, we explored the ecological and financial feasibility of active restoration on three different invaded sites in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. The aim of our study was to identify cost-effective ways of restoring functional native ecosystems following invasion by alien plants. Over three years we evaluated different restoration approaches using field trials and experimental manipulations (i.e. mechanical clearing, burning, different soil restoration techniques and sowing of native species) to reduce elevated soil nutrient levels and to re-establish native fynbos communities. Furthermore we investigated the possibility of introducing native fynbos species that can be used for sustainable harvesting to create an incentive for restoration on private land.
   Diversity and evenness of native plant species increased significantly after restoration at all three sites, whereas cover of alien plants decreased significantly, confirming that active restoration was successful. However, sowing of native fynbos species had no significant effect on native cover, species richness, diversity or evenness in the Acacia thicket and Kikuyu field, implying that the ecosystem was sufficiently resilient to allow autogenic recovery following clearing and burning of the invasive species. Soil restoration treatments resulted in an increase of available nitrogen in the Acacia thicket, but had no significant effects in the Eucalyptus plantation. However, despite elevated available soil nitrogen levels, native species germinated irrespective whether sown or unsown (i.e. regeneration from the soil seed bank).
   Without active introduction of native species, native grasses, forbs and other shrubs would have dominated, and proteoids and ericoids (the major fynbos growth forms) would have been under-represented.
   The financial analysis shows that income from flower harvesting following active restoration consistently outweighs income following passive restoration, but that the associated increase in income does not always justify the higher costs. We conclude that active restoration can be effective and financially feasible when compared to passive restoration, depending on the density of invasion. Active restoration of densely invaded sites may therefore only be justifiable if the target area is in a region of high conservation priority. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Marine reserves (areas closed to fishing) have been advocated for the management of many species, including the rock scallop Spondylus calcifer in the northern Gulf of California (NGC), Mexico. We developed an explicit coupled biological-oceanographic model (CBOM) to assess connectivity among fished subpopulations of S. calcifer. We focused on the Puerto Penasco corridor, located in the northeastern portion of the NGC. We validated CBOM's outputs through 2 different techniques: population genetics with 9 microsatellite loci and measurements of spat abundance on artificial collectors. We found strong demographic connectivity between the corridor and southern sources. Sampled localities showed low levels of genetic structure; however, we identified 2 subtly differentiated genetic clusters. On average, the spatial scale of demographic and genetic connectivity is in agreement, suggesting that connectivity decreases when the spatial scale is > 100 km. We observed a gradient of higher values of both predicted particles and observed densities of settled spat for the northern and southern sites and lower values for the central sites. Larval recruitment within the corridor could be linked to a large spatial scale of larval inputs, including local sources and subpopulations further south. The absence of a strong barrier to migration suggests that the siting of marine reserves along upstream sites would likely benefit downstream subpopulations. The spatial scale of connectivity (similar to 100 km) could be used as a reference for the strategic siting of marine reserves in the study area. CBOMs and population genetics are powerful complementary tools to assess the relative strength of connectivity among sites.

AB The coexistence of multiple species on a smaller number of limiting resources is an enduring ecological paradox. The mechanisms that maintain such biodiversity are of great interest to ecology and of central importance to conservation. We describe and prove a unique and robust mechanism for coexistence: Species that differ only in their dispersal abilities can coexist, if habitat patches are distributed at irregular distances. This mechanism is straightforward and ecologically intuitive, but can nevertheless create complex coexistence patterns that are robust to substantial environmental stochasticity. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is noted for its diversity of reef fish species and its complex arrangement of reef habitat. We demonstrate that this mechanism can allow fish species with different pelagic larval durations to stably coexist in the GBR. Further, coexisting species on the GBR often dominate different subregions, defined primarily by cross-shelf position. Interspecific differences in dispersal ability generate similar coexistence patterns when dispersal is influenced by larval behavior and variable oceanographic conditions. Many marine and terrestrial ecosystems are characterized by patchy habitat distributions and contain coexisting species that have different dispersal abilities. This coexistence mechanism is therefore likely to have ecological relevance beyond reef fish.

AB Rangeland degradation is a serious problem in semiarid Africa. Extensive areas of bare, compacted, nutrient-poor soils limit the productivity and biodiversity of many areas. We conducted a set of restoration experiments in which all eight combinations of soil tilling, fertilization, and seeding with native perennial grasses were carried out in replicated plots. After 6 months, little aboveground biomass was produced in plots without tilling, regardless of seeding or fertilization. Tilling alone tripled plant biomass, mostly of herbaceous forbs and annual grasses. Perennial grasses were essentially limited to plots that were both tilled and seeded. The addition of fertilizer had no significant additional effects. After 7 years, vegetation had declined, but there were still large differences among treatments. After 10 years, one tilled (and seeded) plot had reverted to bare ground, but the other tilled plots still had substantial vegetation. Only one seeded grass (Cenchrus ciliaris) was still a contributor to total cover after 10 years. We suggest that restoration efforts on these soils be directed first to breaking up the surface crust, and second to the addition of desirable seed. A simple ripping trial inspired by this experiment showed considerable promise as a low-cost restoration technique.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of food resources by juveniles and adults of Acestrorhynchus lacustris, Hemisorubim platyrhynchos, Hoplias aff. malabaricus, Plagioscion squamosissimus, Pseudoplatystoma corruscans e Salminus brasiliensis from the upper Parana River floodplain, sampled quarterly between March 2007 and December 2008. The quantitative trophic composition was obtained by prey volume (% volume) and diet niche breadth of each piscivorous species, as well as trophic relationships among them through diet similarity and prey size. The diet of the species was composed of fish-preys (42 species), crustaceans and insects, with ontogenetic diet changes, except to P. corruscans. The niche breadth was high to H. aff. malabaricus adults and low to P. corruscans adults and P squamosissimus juveniles. Diet similarity was high to Characidae species consumers and low to P. squamosissimus juveniles, which consumed mainly crustaceans. Positive correlation was found between prey and predator size, however, each piscivorous species consumed different prey sizes, showing no correlation among them. Results showed that the six species consumed fish since juveniles, however, with low diet similarity intra and inter specific to most of them, and the prey size consumed increased in relation to predator size and varied among species. Thus, the piscivorous species diet depends of prey species distribution and colonization, morphology and feeding behavior of the prey as well as the predator.

AB Aim
   Conifers are invasive species in many parts of the world, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. There are many introduced conifers in Europe, but their status as alien species is poorly documented. We conducted a comprehensive literature review to ascertain the extent to which alien conifers can be considered invasive.
   Location
   Europe.
   Methods
   We reviewed the historical record of alien conifer invasion in Europe (i.e. species with a native range outside the continental boundaries of Europe) by screening the DAISIE database and the ISI Web of Science.
   Results
   According to DAISIE, there are 54 alien conifer species in Europe. Pseudotsuga menziesii is the species recorded as naturalized in the most countries (12) and the UK is the country with the most naturalized species (18). Thirty-seven of these conifers have been studied, to some extent, in a total of 131 papers (212 records). Nevertheless, only a few papers have investigated aspects related to biological invasions. In fact, the species are not referred to as alien by the authors in more than half of the papers (66%). Twenty-five per cent of the papers have investigated plant traits, 46% are about biotic and abiotic factors influencing tree performance and 29% deal with ecological and economic impacts. Most papers are related to entomology, dealing with natural enemies affecting the alien conifers.
   Main conclusions
   Scientists have not yet perceived alien conifers in Europe as problematic species. Moreover, the low introduction effort, long lag-time since plantation and phylogenetic closeness between alien and native conifers are possible reasons for their low expansion in Europe to date. From a management point of view, careful observations of sites with alien conifers is necessary to watch for new invasions. From a scientific perspective, thorough analyses of the extent that introduction, rates of naturalization and biogeographical differences influence invasive spread between the two hemispheres will prove timely.

AB A recent decline in population numbers of Cape gannets (Morus capensis) breeding off the west coast of South Africa coincided with decreased availability of lipid-rich fish prey: anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) and sardine (Sardinops sagax). Seabirds can use fishery discards as an alternative, but the quality of this food in the Benguela ecosystem is lower than that of their natural prey species. We consider whether chick growth and survival during chick rearing co-vary with the periods of high and low availability of their lipid-rich prey species and whether fishery discards would be an alternative. The proportion of anchovy and sardine in the diet was between 66 and 84% in the years 1986-1988, but just 16-35% from 2004 to 2006. Months with large proportions of anchovy and sardine in the diet were associated with faster chick growth. No association between the proportion of fishery discards in the diet and chick growth was found. The patterns are consistent with the notion that a distributional shift of anchovy and sardine decreased their contribution to the diet of Cape gannets and slowed chick growth along with lessening chick survival at the breeding colony. The reduced survival may partially explain the decline in numbers of Cape gannets breeding in the southern Benguela.

AB Angola is the Only Southern African Country for which a plant inventory has not been produced to date. The lack of a country-level floristic checklist has seriously hampered the estimation of levels of diversity and endemism, and other conservation-driven initiatives. This deficiency was addressed in a collaborative initiative recently concluded among over 30 international project participants. This paper presents the results of the project that aimed, among other things, to survey the Angolan flora as part of producing a floristic checklist. The Study revealed that Angola has a total number of 6,735 indigenous species, and a total vascular flora of 7,296 taxa (including naturalised taxa), of which 1,069 taxa (997 species and 72 infraspecific taxa) are endemic.

AB The occurrence of gut bacteria in freshwater and marine zooplankton has long been recognized, but knowledge about the composition of the gut "microflora" and its permanent presence in different zooplankters is still inadequate. In this study, we tested the suitability of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), catalysed reporter deposition (CARD)-FISH, cultivation and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on homogenates and whole-specimen sections to assess the presence and identity of gut bacteria in several freshwater copepod and cladoceran species. Unambiguous results about the presence of a permanent gut "microflora" were obtained for freshly caught Daphnia pulex by TEM. CARD-FISH on gut homogenates from Acanthodiaptomus denticornis and D. pulex revealed a very similar bacterial composition to that present in the water column. Major bacterial groups found in cladocerans and copepods were alpha-, beta-, gamma-Proteobacteria and Cytophaga-Flavobacteria. The high contribution of alpha-Proteobacteria in A. denticornis suggested a specific niche for this group, but probably in association with its carapace. FISH on paraffin semithin sections had the potential to provide quantitative and qualitative information about the composition of the gut "microflora", but loss of bacteria and gut content was significant.

AB Biodiversity is recognised as an integral part of people's daily livelihoods. This study therefore aims to understand the use of NTFPs at an intricate level by determining what role these resources fulfil in six rural villages and 1011 households' livelihoods. It examines how the use of NTFPs are influenced by intra-household variables, such as wealth and gender, and inter-community variables, such as accessibility to the natural resource. The results reveal that approximately 4453 kg of wild material is used annually per household, of which 1598 kg is used for cultural purposes. The influence of vegetation type and differences between villages are statistically more significant than inter-household variables. At an inter-household level, an increase in the financial status of households did not result in a decrease in the use of natural resources, nor in the quantity of material used. Similarly, gender only influenced the use of cultural resource use categories. Over 200 plant species were identified as being used, demonstrating the crucial role for biodiversity in rural livelihoods, which has implications for conservation of biodiversity also to occur outside of protected areas. An appreciation of the multitude of cultural values that affect the use of biodiversity would add value to biodiversity conservation approaches.

AB We analyze distributional patterns of Neotropical flowering plants between 38 degrees N and 55 degrees S. Along with identification of centers of angiosperm biodiversity and endemism, we explore range size patterns and discuss implications for angiosperm evolution and conservation. Based on monographic and herbarium specimen data, a database for Neotropical angiosperms was created containing distributional and ecological data of more than 4,000 species and subspecific taxa, representing approximately 5% of all Neotropical angiosperms. Maps of species richness and endemism at F grid resolution were produced using a geographical information system (GIS). We found that the distribution area of most species was small (1% or less of the total Neotropical area) and that centers of narrow endemism were irregularly distributed, not coinciding with the hypothesized Pleistocene refugia and diversity hotspots. Based on identified centers of narrow endemism and forest conversion rates, we estimate that approximately 100 narrow endemic species are lost annually. Areas rich in narrow endemics but without protection status according to the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) Consortium are recognized. Our results suggest that the success of long-term conservation of angiosperm diversity relies on future protection of areas covering a larger portion of the identified centers of narrow endemism.

AB There is limited information regarding biogeochemical pools and fluxes in maritime tundra ecosystems along the Antarctic Peninsula. To collect baseline information on biogeochemical processes in a tundra ecosystem dominated by two vascular plant species (Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica) at Biscoe Point off the coast of Anvers Island, we measured pools and fluxes of C and N in transplanted tundra microcosm cores, complemented with sampling of precipitation and surface runoff. Snow and snowmelt from the tundra collection site and soil leachates from the cores were enriched with N and dissolved organic carbon compared to precipitation and snowmelt samples collected at Palmer Station, indicating high loading of N and organic matter from the penguin colonies adjacent to the tundra site. Relatively high values of delta N-15 in the live and dead biomass of D. antarctica and C. quitensis (5.6-25.1 degrees C) indicated an enrichment of N in this tundra ecosystem, possibly through N inputs from adjacent penguin colonies. Stepwise multiple linear regressions found that ecosystem respiration and gross primary production were best predicted by live biomass of D. antarctica, suggesting a disproportionately high contribution of D. antarctica to CO2 fluxes. The cores with higher delta N-15 and lower delta C-13 in the soil organic horizon exhibited higher CO2 fluxes. The results suggest that abundant N inputs from penguin colonies and the competitive balance between plant species might play a critical role in the response of tundra ecosystems along the Antarctic Peninsula to projected climate change.

AB 1 Themeda triandra and Digitaria macroblephara are dominant grasses in the herbaceous layer of Serengeti National Park. Catena topography creates variation in soil texture and grazing that may have important physiological implications for these species. Through a combination of laboratory and field experiments, we tested whether variation in soil texture and grazing differentially affected growth, photosynthesis, leaf enzyme activities and nitrogen assimilation of the two species.
   2 In the laboratory, simulated grazing (weekly clipping at 7 cm above soil) increased photosynthesis and enzyme activities for D. macroblephara. Clipping also increased photosynthesis for T. triandra, but did not affect enzyme activity. D. macroblephara and T. triandra were affected oppositely by soil texture; enzyme activities and photosynthesis were greater for D. macroblephara in sandy soils but greater for T. triandra in fine-textured soils.
   3 Across a natural catena gradient, species abundances of D. macroblephara and T. triandra were negatively correlated with each other and related to grazing frequency in opposite ways, D. macroblephara positively and T. triandra negatively. In a field experiment, rates of (NO3-)-N-15 uptake for unclipped plants of D. macroblephara and T. triandra were similar and did not vary with soil texture. However, when clipped,(NO3-)-N-15 uptake was stimulated in both species but in opposite ways across a gradient of percentage sand, positive for D. macroblephara and negative for T. triandra.
   4 These results suggest that species responded to defoliation and variation in water availability created by different soil textures. At sites where D. macroblephara and T. triandra co-occur, catena variation in soil texture and grazing may provide spatial variation in habitat suitability. Moreover, herbivory may promote species coexistence by facilitating differential physiological responses to topographic and soil heterogeneity.
   5 This study illustrates how interactions between a direct biotic process and an indirect environmental variable can cause different plant physiological responses that may promote species coexistence in a heterogeneous environment.

AB The Argentine ant is a common pest of mediterranean-type ecosystems worldwide, causing widespread extirpation of many native ant species. This study examines spatial and temporal patterns of invasion at a local scale, investigates the effects of this invader on native ant communities and assesses causal mechanisms for these spatial, temporal and numerical patterns, particularly in relation to local climate. Argentine ant workers were more active in the drier months of summer and fall, and abundance was correlated with cumulative precipitation the previous winter. Argentine ant worker abundance greatly increased in conjunction with EI Nino events. No similar relationship existed for native ants. This invasive ant affected native ant abundances differently by species: some species were able to tolerate its presence temporarily. Overall, this study provides a framework of factors to consider when devising control strategies for the invasive Argentine ant.

AB The role of artificial forests in the UAE to protect floral diversity was evaluated, through the determination of the effect of forest trees on species diversity and abundance of perennial plants in six forests. The impact of artificial forests on physical and chemical characters of the soil was also evaluated.
   The results showed insignificant variation in species richness and species diversity index among the six studied forests. The effects of type and size of trees grown in the forest trees were significant on all the studied community attributes. All the attributes were significantly greater inside than outside forests cultivated with the native Prosopis cineraria (L.) Druce and Acacia arabica (Lam.) Willd. trees. The reverse was true in forests cultivated with exotic Eucalyptus sp. and Prosopisjuliflora trees. It is recommended, therefore, that exotic trees be replaced with native ones, in order to promote species richness and diversity. Species richness, diversity and density were higher under medium than under large size P. cineraria trees. This suggests the importance of reducing forest crowns to promote species growth. The palatable Panicum turgidum and Pennisetum divisum grasses attained significantly high frequencies and densities inside the forests, but were not recorded at all outside. The reverse was true for other non-palatable species. Afforestation significantly reduced soil pH under and between the tree crowns, compared to outside them. Organic matter content, salinity, total sodium ions, total sulfate, total soluble nitrogen, total chromium and copper attained significantly greater values under the crowns of the trees than both between the crowns and outside the forests. The great increase in soil salinity, especially Na ions, is an indicator of the high salinity in irrigation waters. Afforestation in the UAE can be an effective toot to promote diversity and improve soil quality, provided afforestation programs are carefully planned and well executed, because any miscalculations could lead to serious environmental damages.

AB Invasion of natural habitats by conifer species is a well-known phenomenon worldwide. Here, we describe naturalization by the American Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas fir) in Montseny Natural Park (Catalonia, NE Spain). Establishment of seedlings started 15 years after plantation. Seedling density was positively associated to low tree density, small plantation area, grazing and the presence of a shrubland understorey of intermediate cover. Seedling recruitment outside the plantations occurred at high altitudes (> 1000 m). In less than 30 years after plantation, P. menziesii invaded adjacent areas 100 m far from the plantation. We conclude that at high altitudes, under disturbance, seedling establishment can take place as soon as planted trees produce cones. Therefore, the time-lag appears to be primarily related to propagule availability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB After the eradication of the Tse-Tse fly in the Mid-Zambezi valley, human settlements and fields extended mainly along the main rivers. In order to investigate the consequences of this human development on wildlife diversity we monitored three rivers of the Mid-Zambezi valley in Zimbabwe: Angwa, Manyame and Kadzi. The rivers were divided in segments of 200 m which were checked for spoors in order to assess the number of species and the number of individuals that used the segments. Human settlements were also recorded. We used a GIS to define the spatial characteristics of the fields present along the rivers, and related them to the distribution and abundance of wild species spoors in the river beds and banks. Our results show that the number of species in one segment of the river decreased with the increasing size of the field area bordering the segment. For all the major ungulate species, the numbers of individuals recorded per segment decreased with increasing field area. A similar trend was observed for small and medium-sized carnivores, though they were in lower numbers when present. Our analyses thus confirm that the extension of human agriculture in wildlife areas has an impact on most wild species, but we also define some threshold value of field size above which there seem to be an acceleration of the decrease in wildlife density and diversity: 3.2 ha for medium and small herbivores and carnivores; only the elephant seem to tolerate larger field area with a threshold value of 32 ha.

AB A population of the giant leather fern Acrostichum danaeifolium was observed during an 18-mo period at La Mancha (19degrees36'00"N, 96degrees22'40"W), Veracruz, Mexico. The study site was 230 m from a brackish-water lagoon, in the understorey of the mangroves, which are dominated by Avicennia germinans (Avicenniaceae). Acrostichum danaeifolium showed a clumped distribution pattern, and one third of the population became fertile during this time. Plants had a mean number of 9.4 +/- 0.45 sterile leaves, which developed continuously at a rate of 14.6 +/- 0.44 leaves y(-1). The mean life span of sterile leaves was 7.7 mo. Although soil water was always available, phenological patterns of fertility, leaf production and leaf growth were strongly correlated with the seasonal climate. Individual leaf growth and leaf size increased significantly during the rainy season. Fertile leaves emerged exclusively from April to August and had a mean life span of 4.1 mo. Spore release was restricted to the wet season, when conditions for germination were favourable. Environmental triggers of fertility are discussed and phenological patterns are compared with ferns and angiosperms from other habitats.

AB The composition (% relative abundance) of the benthic diatom community was studied in the littoral zone (0-5 m) of the NW and E coasts of the brackish, non-tidal Gulf of Riga, in the Baltic Sea. The samples were collected concomitantly with measurements of sediment primary productivity and chlorophyll a during three cruises, representing three seasons (autumn, spring, summer). At all depths, the living diatom community was dominated by epipsammic species, the most abundant taxa being Martyana atomus, a species of Fragilariaceae and Achnanthes delicatula. The community was characterized by a stable composition and a high species diversity throughout the study period (Shannon-Weaver, mean H' = 4.4). Principal Component Analyses (PCA), together with Redundancy Analysis (RDA) based on 129 taxa, revealed both spatial (site and depth) and seasonal differences in the diatom communities. However, these differences were mainly caused by the varying proportions of taxa common in both sampling areas in ail three seasons, rather than by actual major taxonomic changes in the species present in communities. The distribution of the typical epipsammic species along the depth gradient was not uni-directional. The dominance of attached life forms, and the absence of a well-developed epipelic community, reflects the physically dynamic substratum, particularly in the eastern part of the Gulf. As a result, primary productivity is kept rather low, decreasing rapidly with depth due to frequent turbidity of the water column.

AB Marine birds of the family Alcidae exhibit extreme variation in the mass and age at which offspring leave the nest. A previously proposed, theoretical model of intraspecific variation in optimal timing of nest departure in alcids predicts that: (1) variation in growth rate among chicks will result in negative correlations between departure mass and departure age, and (2) in the absence of seasonal declines in chick growth rates (such declines are consistent features of alcid biology), variation in timing of hatching among chicks will cause both mass and age at departure to decline with hatching date, We tested these predictions for Thick-billed Murres and Razorbills, two alcids that employ a unique development strategy. To control for the confounding effects of seasonal variation in growth rates, caused at least in part by variation in the characteristics of adults breeding at different times, we switched eggs at random among breeding pairs in each of two years for both study species.
   Contrary to prediction 1, there were no significant negative correlations between departure mass and departure age, and in fact, there was one significant positive relationship. Contrary to prediction 2, departure mass did not decline with hatching date; in agreement with prediction 2, departure age often declined with date. Our results suggest that, for Thick-billed Murres and Razorbills: (1) variation in growth rate probably does not influence timing of nest departure in the manner outlined in the model, and (2) it is unlikely that variation in hatching date affects the departure decision in the manner predicted by the model. Based on our experimental results, and previously reported observations of Thick billed Murres, we develop alternative hypotheses, emphasizing the roles of parental quality and wing growth (rather than increase in mass), to explain the close correspondence between the model's predictions and patterns in the timing of nest departure within the Alcidae that are reported frequently.

AB Foraging activity of two mid- to low- shore species of limpet, Patella granularis (Prosobranchia) and Siphonaria concinna (Pulmonata) from an exposed shore on the Eastern Cape coast of South Africa was monitored. In both species, activity was compared during spring and neap tides and, in P. granularis between summer and winter. Rhythms of activity of the two species were similar, with foraging excursions being mainly associated with nocturnal low tide times, although some P. granularis foraged during daytime low tides. It is suggested that foraging excursions in P. granularis are triggered by wave action. Both species foraged further on spring tides than on neap tides and this is suggested to be a result of the limited time limpets have to forage. P. granularis was also found to forage further during summer when compared to winter and the possibility that seasonal micro-algal productivity influences foraging distances in limpets is discussed.
   The foraging activity of both species could be divided into 3 distinct phases, a relatively rapid outward phase, a much slower foraging phase and a rapid homeward phase. Whether or not these limpets graze throughout an excursion is not known. S. concinna was found to home to a fixed scar, although during the experiment some scar-swapping occurred. P. granularis did not home to a fixed scar but possessed a 'home range' (approx. 5 cm(2)) to which it returned after each excursion.
   Patella granularis was found to move randomly during foraging, whilst S. concinna foraged in a nonrandom direction which took individuals upshore. No tidal-influence is thought to be present in this case and the possibility of a learning component in the foraging behaviour of certain limpet species in relation to the return to optimal feeding patches is discussed.

AB 1. Intraspecific competition was investigated in the pit-digging larvae of the ant-lion Morter sp., which normally occurs at low density in a food-rich habitat.
   2. Morter larvae interact by displays, challenges, and sand tossing. Challenges/displays affected pit spacing while sand tossing affected pit size. Pit ownership determined the outcome of contests regardless of the relative sizes or feeding condition of the contestants.
   3. Competition had no effect on the pit size of winners but losers showed a density dependent reduction in pit size. Interference competition caused a density dependent reduction in larval growth rates.
   4. Macroleon quinquemaculatus (Hagen) always won contests with Morter, even when smaller. Cannibalism occurred in 60% of these contests.
   5. Little intraspecific competition occurs in Morter in the field. Morter is more willing to incur energy costs than Macroleon.

ID BLUE-FOOTED BOOBY; SIBLING AGGRESSION; BROOD REDUCTION; BUBULCUS-IBIS;
   ROLES
AB Previous studies of food allocation among nestlings of siblicidal birds have focussed on the proximate link between food and aggression. However, food sharing among sibs (and brood reduction) need not involve aggression. Here I examine the role of hunger (defined operationally in terms of the amount of food eaten recently) within the broader framework of passive and aggressive food-sharing among nestlings of facultatively siblicidal ospreys (Pandion haliaetus). Feeding among brood members was hierarchical; senior, dominant sibs ate more when hungry, leaving a smaller residual share of food for junior sibs. Senior sibs did not become more generous at large meals (i.e., the prospect of a large meal did not quell the selfish tendencies of senior sibs). That individuals ate more when hungry indicates a proximate link between food and the allocation of resources among siblings. Overall, aggression was infrequent and seemed to be used when junior sibs contested food allocation at meals. Aggression was diminished and food allocation was skewed toward the junior sib in broods with artificially exaggerated hatching intervals, suggesting that senior sibs were more generous when their dominant status was not threatened.

AB Seascape ecology, the marine-centric counterpart to landscape ecology, is rapidly emerging as an interdisciplinary and spatially explicit ecological science with relevance to marine management, bio-diversity conservation, and restoration. While important progress in this field has been made in the past decade, there has been no coherent prioritisation of key research questions to help set the future research agenda for seascape ecology. We used a 2-stage modified Delphi method to solicit applied research questions from academic experts in seascape ecology and then asked respondents to identify priority questions across 9 interrelated research themes using 2 rounds of selection. We also invited senior management/conservation practitioners to prioritise the same research questions. Analyses highlighted congruence and discrepancies in perceived priorities for applied research. Themes related to both ecological concepts and management practice, and those identified as priorities include seascape change, seascape connectivity, spatial and temporal scale, ecosystem-based management, and emerging technologies and metrics. Highest-priority questions (upper tercile) received 50% agreement between respondent groups, and lowest priorities (lower tercile) received 58% agreement. Across all 3 priority tiers, 36 of the 55 questions were within a +/- 10% band of agreement. We present the most important applied research questions as determined by the proportion of votes received. For each theme, we provide a synthesis of the research challenges and the potential role of seascape ecology. These priority questions and themes serve as a roadmap for advancing applied seascape ecology during, and beyond, the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030).

AB Coastal habitats, such as seagrasses, mangroves, rocky and coral reefs, salt marshes, and kelp forests, sustain many key fish and invertebrate populations around the globe. Our understanding of how animals use these broadly defined habitat types is typically derived from a few well-studied regions and is often extrapolated to similar habitats elsewhere. As a result, a working understanding o their habitat importance is often based on information derived from other regions and environmental contexts. Contexts such as tidal range, rainfall, and local geomorphology may fundamentally alter animal-habitat relationships, and there is growing evidence that broadly defined habitat types such as "mangroves" or "salt marsh" may show predictable spatial and temporal variation in habitat function in relation to these environmental drivers. In the present article, we develop a framework for systematically examining contextual predictability to define the geographic transferability of animal-habitat relationships, to guide ongoing research, conservation, and management actions in these systems.

AB China is one of the megadiverse freshwater regions in the world, but the detailed diversity inventory, distribution pattern and ecological drivers are incompletely known, which hinders large-scale freshwater diversity conservation and pattern analysis at the global scale. Aiming to fill this knowledge gap, we compiled a comprehensive richness and distribution database of freshwater fishes in China and adject areas based on our long-term survey and exhaustive data collection from 165 hydrologic units at tributary and sub-basin grain. Then, we elucidated a biogeographical pattern using a beta dissimilarity matrix with species presence/absence data and taxonomic relationships. Finally, we evaluated the explanatory power of three hypotheses, i.e., 'area', 'energy', and 'history', in explaining the diversity patterns. A total of 2,063 species utilizing freshwater habitats were identified in the study area. Among them, 1,651 freshwater species were recorded in China, of which 1034 species are endemic to China. Four major freshwater zoogeographic regions, the Palearctic, High Central Asia, East Asia, and South Asia, were identified from a dendrogram, and each region was characterized by different taxonomic categories (i.e., from species to order). 'Historical' factors play the most important role (43.64-62.96% of the total variation), or at least a comparable role to that of contemporary climate, in explaining the freshwater fish diversity patterns (species richness and species endemicity). In conclusion, the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, nearby orogeny, and the following formation of the East Asian monsoon climate had profound impacts on the diversification and distribution of ichthyofauna in China and adjacent areas.

AB Aim Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) within natural plant communities can be large, influencing local ecological processes and dynamics. Here, we shed light on how ITV in vegetative and floral traits responds to large-scale abiotic and biotic gradients (i.e., climate and species richness). Specifically, we tested whether associations of ITV with temperature, precipitation and species richness were consistent with any of four hypotheses relating to stress tolerance and competition. Furthermore, we estimated the degree of correlation between ITV in vegetative and floral traits and how they vary along the gradients.
   Location Global.
   Time period 1975-2016.
   Major taxa studied Herbaceous and woody plants.
   Methods We compiled a dataset of 18,401 measurements of the absolute extent of ITV (measured as the coefficient of variation) in nine vegetative and seven floral traits from 2,822 herbaceous and woody species at 2,372 locations.
   Results Large-scale associations between ITV and climate were trait specific and more prominent for vegetative traits, especially leaf morphology, than for floral traits. The ITV showed pronounced associations with climate, with lower ITV values in colder areas and higher values in drier areas. The associations of ITV with species richness were inconsistent across traits. Species-specific associations across gradients were often idiosyncratic, and covariation in ITV was weaker between vegetative and floral traits than within the two trait groups.
   Main conclusions Our results show that, depending on the traits considered, ITV either increased or decreased with climate stress and species richness, suggesting that both factors can constrain or enhance ITV, which might foster plant-population persistence in stressful conditions. Given the species-specific responses and covariation in ITV, associations can be hard to predict for traits and species not yet studied. We conclude that consideration of ITV can improve our understanding of how plants cope with stressful conditions and environmental change across spatial and biological scales.

AB Dimensions of tree root systems in savannas are poorly understood, despite being essential in resource acquisition and post-disturbance recovery. We studied tree rooting patterns in Southern African savannas to ask: how tree rooting strategies affected species responses to severe drought; and how potential rooting depths varied across gradients in soil texture and rainfall.
   First, detailed excavations of eight species in Kruger National Park suggest that the ratio of deep to shallow taproot diameters provides a reasonable proxy for potential rooting depth, facilitating extensive interspecific comparison. Detailed excavations also suggest that allocation to deep roots traded off with shallow lateral root investment, and that drought-sensitive species rooted more shallowly than drought-resistant ones.
   More broadly across 57 species in Southern Africa, potential rooting depths were phylogenetically constrained, with investment to deep roots evident among miombo Detarioids, consistent with results suggesting they green up before onset of seasonal rains. Soil substrate explained variation, with deeper roots on sandy, nutrient-poor soils relative to clayey, nutrient-rich ones. Although potential rooting depth decreased with increasing wet season length, mean annual rainfall had no systematic effect on rooting depth.
   Overall, our results suggest that rooting depth systematically structures the ecology of savanna trees. Further work examining other anatomical and physiological root traits should be a priority for understanding savanna responses to changing climate and disturbances.

AB On-farm diversification is a promising strategy for farmers to adapt to climate change. However, few recommendations exist on how to diversify farm systems in ways that best fit the agroecological and socioeconomic challenges farmers face. Farmers' ability to adopt diversification strategies is often stymied by their aversion to risk, loss of local knowledge, and limited access to agronomic and market information, this is especially the case for smallholders. We outline seven steps on how practitioners and researchers in agricultural development can work with farmers in decision-making about on-farm diversification of cropping, pasture, and agroforestry systems while taking into account these constraints. These seven steps are relevant for all types of farmers but particularly for smallholders in tropical and subtropical regions. It is these farmers who are usually most vulnerable to climate change and who are, subsequently, often the target of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) interventions. Networks of agricultural innovation provide an enabling environment for on-farm diversification. These networks connect farmers and farmer organizations with local, national, or international private companies, public organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and research institutes. These actors can work with farmers to develop diversified production systems incorporating both high-value crops and traditional food production systems. These diversified farm systems with both food and cash crops act as a safety net in the event of price fluctuations or other disruptions to crop value chains. In this way, farmers can adapt their farm systems to climate change in ways that provide greater food security and improved income.

AB Although studies have shown that mammalian herbivores often limit aboveground carbon storage in savannas, their effects on belowground soil carbon storage remain unclear. Using three sets of long-term, large herbivore exclosures with paired controls, we asked how almost two decades of herbivore removal from a semiarid savanna in Laikipia, Kenya affected aboveground (woody and grass) and belowground soil carbon sequestration, and determined the major source (C-3 vs. C-4) of belowground carbon sequestered in soils with and without herbivores present. Large herbivore exclusion, which included a diverse community of grazers, browsers, and mixed-feeding ungulates, resulted in significant increases in grass cover (similar to 22%), woody basal area (similar to 8 m(2)/ha), and woody canopy cover (31%), translating to a similar to 8.5 t/ha increase in aboveground carbon over two decades. Herbivore exclusion also led to a 54% increase (20.5 t/ha) in total soil carbon to 30-cm depth, with similar to 71% of this derived from C-4 grasses (vs. similar to 76% with herbivores present) despite substantial increases in woody cover. We attribute this continued high contribution of C-4 grasses to soil C sequestration to the reduced offtake of grass biomass with herbivore exclusion together with the facilitative influence of open sparse woody canopies (e.g., Acacia spp.) on grass cover and productivity in this semiarid system.

AB The management of non-native tree species in European forests has a long history, but the information on the current number and geographic distribution of these species in European forests is incomplete and scattered across various datasets. This study aims to perform an inventory of the most frequent non-native tree species growing in European forests and analyse their current extent, geographic distribution and geographic origin. Our results show that at least 150 non-native tree species are currently growing in European forests and provenance trials. The genera represented by largest number of species are Eucalyptus, Pinus, Acacia and Abies. Species growing at the largest areas are Robinia pseudoacacia (2.44 million ha), Eucalyptus globulus (1.46 million ha), Picea sitchensis (1.16 million ha) and Pseudotsuga menziesii (0.83 million ha). In total, non-native tree species in Europe are found in an area of approximately 8.54 million ha, or 4.0% of the European forest area, and the five most abundant species account for up to 77% of this area. The largest number of these 150 species were introduced from North America (71), followed by Asia (45) and Australia (20). North American species occupy by far the largest area.

AB Climate warming has the potential to disrupt plant-pollinator interactions or to increase competition of co-flowering plants for pollinators, due to species-specific phenological responses to temperature. However, studies focusing on the effect of temperature on solitary bee emergence and the flowering onset of their food plants under natural conditions are still rare. We studied the effect of temperature on the phenology of the two spring bees Osmia cornuta and Osmia bicornis, by placing bee cocoons on eleven grasslands differing in mean site temperature. On seven grasslands, we additionally studied the effect of temperature on the phenology of the red-list plant Pulsatilla vulgaris, which was the first flowering plant, and of co-flowering plants with later flowering. With a warming of 0.1 degrees C, the abundance-weighted mean emergence of O. cornuta males advanced by 0.4 days. Females of both species did not shift their emergence. Warmer temperatures advanced the abundance-weighted mean flowering of P. vulgaris by 1.3 days per 0.1 degrees C increase, but did not shift flowering onset of co-flowering plants. Competition for pollinators between P. vulgaris and co-flowering plants does not increase within the studied temperature range. We demonstrate that temperature advances plant flowering more strongly than bee emergence suggesting an increased risk of pollinator limitation for the first flowers of P. vulgaris.

AB This study investigated the influence of L-tryptophan (L-trp) on the survival, immune response and gut micro biota of the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis (with an average weight of 16.58 +/- 2.20 g). After 30 days of feeding with diets supplemented with L-trp at 0.36%, 0.47%, 0.73% and 1.05% (groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively), the survival rate and bacterial challenge (Aeromonas hydrophila) were evaluated, the activities of antioxidant and phosphatase enzymes in the serum were assessed, and the gut microbiota were measured via high-throughput Illumina sequencing. The results showed that the supplementation of L-trp significantly improved the survival rate of crabs (P < 0.05). After feeding for 7 days, it was observed that a high L-trp diet significantly increase the survival rate relative to a basal diet after a 96-h post-challenge with A. hydrophila (P < 0.05). The activity of CAT and AKP in the serum were increased by the addition of L-trp. The activity of CAT and AKP in the serum in group 4 were higher than those in group 1 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we observed that adjunction of the L-trp can significantly increase the richness and diversity of the gut microbiota. The dominant phylum in the intestine of the Chinese mitten crab were Tenericutes, Proteobacteria, Fimicutes, Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria. The L-trp in the diets increased the richness of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in the intestine significantly. These bacteria were all dominant bacteria and had a specific role in promoting the immunity of E. sinensis. Therefore, it could be inferred that L-trp supplementation is beneficial in the diet of E. sinensis. Based in these results, the dietary 0.47% or 0.73%L-trp supplemented is found to be optimum to improve E sinensis survival.

AB Background: Pollinators are well known for the ecosystem services they provide, an d while urban areas are generally perceived as low-quality habitat for most wildlife, these cities often support a surprising degree of pollinator diversity. The current rapid growth of urban areas and concern over global pollinator declines have spurred numerous studies examining pollinator communities in temperate cities, but knowledge about tropical urban pollinators remains scarce.
   Methods: This study investigated the effects of habitat and landscape factors on pollinator richness and abundance in a highly-populated, tropical city: Bangkok, Thailand. We conducted pollinator observations in 52 green areas throughout the city and collected data on patch size, floral abundance, plant richness, location type, and percent vegetation at five spatial scales.
   Results: Of the 18,793 pollinators observed, over 98% were bees. Both patch size and floral abundance generally had positive effects on pollinators, although there was a significant interaction between the two factors; these findings were generally consistent across all focal taxa (Tetragonula stingless bees, Apis honey bees, Xylocopa carpenter bees, and butterflies).
   Discussion: Our results demonstrate the importance of maintaining large green areas in cities, since small green areas supported few pollinators, even when floral resources were abundant. Moreover, most pollinator taxa utilized a variety of location types (e.g., public parks, school campuses, temple grounds), with the exception of butterflies, which preferred parks. Our findings are generally consistent with those of temperate urban studies, but additional studies in the tropics are needed before global patterns can be assessed.

AB Aim: To predict Rhododendron diversity patterns and identify Rhododendron hotspots and priority areas for their conservation.
   Location: China.
   Methods: We predicted the distribution of 212 Rhododendron species by applying a spatially explicit species assemblage modelling (SESAM) framework on a 10 x 10 km grid across China. We evaluated Rhododendron diversity based on species richness, beta-diversity and weighted endemism (also known as range-size rarity), and then identified hotspots formed by the top 1%, 5%, 25% and 50% of record-containing grid cells for each diversity metric separately and for the combination of the three diversity metrics. We determined the priority conservation areas for Rhododendrons by overlaying the hotspots with the map of the 2139 nature reserves existing in China, and calculated the percentage of hotspots that is protected. The same analysis was also applied to threatened Rhododendron species.
   Results: Rhododendron species richness, beta-diversity and weighted endemism decrease within China from the south-west to the north-east, mainly along mountain ranges. In total, 12 general hotspots for Rhododendron species are detected, covering 1.4% of China's land area. Five separately discerned hotspots (i.e. southern Chongqing, south-eastern Tibet, north-western Yunnan, south-western Sichuan and northern Guangdong) comprising threatened Rhododendron species largely overlap (86.3%) with the general hotspots, and form priority areas for conservation. However, the remaining hotspots, especially southern Zhejiang and north-eastern Guizhou, need more protection.
   Main conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of Rhododendron diversity patterns across the whole of China in terms of species richness, beta-diversity and weighted endemism, thereby offering a sound basis for the conservation of Rhododendrons in China. We demonstrate that as much attention should be paid to the small hotspots in south-western and south-eastern China, as to the largest hotspot (i.e. Mt Hengduan), to achieve conservation of Rhododendrons.

AB Evergreen broadleaved woody plants (EBWPs) are dominant components in forests and savanna of the global tropic and subtropic regions. Southern China possesses the largest continuous area of subtropical EBWPs distribution, harboring a high proportion of endemic species. Hotspot and gap analyses are effective methods for analyzing the spatial pattern of biodiversity and conservation and were used here for EBWPs in China. Based on a distribution data set of 6,265 EBWPs with a spatial resolution of 50 x 50 km, we measured diversity of EBWPs in China using four indices: species richness, corrected weighted endemism, relative phylogenetic diversity, and phylogenetic endemism. According to the results based on 10% threshold, 15.73% of China's land area was identified as hotspots using at least one diversity index. Only 2.14% of China's land area was identified as hotspots for EBWPs by all four metrics simultaneously. Most of the hotspots locate in southern mountains. Moreover, we found substantial conservation gaps for Chinese EBWPs. Only 25.43% of the hotspots are covered by existing nature reserves by more than 10% of their area. We suggest to promote the establishment and management of nature reserve system within the hotspot gaps.

AB Current research details methodological framework for the land planning of the recreational activities based on ecologic approach. Human impacts on landscapes caused by touristic activities should be in accordance with sustainability level, i.e. without changing natural landscape elements, their function and processes, as well as environmental quality. Region of Stiavnicke Bane in Slovakia represents a case study area that is completely under nature and landscape conservation. The methodological framework for the planning of recreational activities is based on the methodology of ecologic carrying capacity which is implemented by the Landscape ecological planning. The main result from this work is suitable tourism activities determined by the ecological approach. Methodological steps include spatial analysis, interpretation, evaluations and propositions which were suggested for recreational activities. The most suitable activities for winter periods are downhill skiing, cross-country skiing and winter tourism. For the summer period the best activities are the following ones: hiking, water sports and recreational activities linked to watering and sport fishing. The most suitable activities for the year-round period are service facilities and therapeutic recreational facilities. This sum of the activities represents the level of the land using that has not any negative environmental impact.

AB Biological invasions are a major driver of ecological and social change globally. The negative effects of these invasions have led to the initiation of programs to manage these invasions across the world. Management aims to reduce impacts and in some cases improve the benefits that some invasive species can provide. This study assesses the barriers that hinder the effective management of widespread tree invasions, drawing insights from a case study of invasions of Prosopis species (mesquite) in South Africa. We used questionnaire surveys and focussed workshops to identify barriers and adaption responses in four key stakeholder groups involved in different stages of management. More than 100 barriers were identified, most of them relating to social issues. Key barriers related to limited knowledge, insufficient funds, conflicts of interest, the ecology of the genus and the nature of the invaded land, as well as poor planning, co-ordination and co-operation, and a lack of prioritisation. There were marked differences in how stakeholders perceived the importance of some barriers. Most Farmers (>80%) placed high importance on a lack of planning, and poor management as important barriers, while few Managers (<20%) regarded these as important; this reflects different views about the context in which management projects operate. Workshops identified more barriers and, overall, provided greater insights into the dimensions of barriers. The questionnaires were, however, useful for providing quantitative data which helped to rank the importance of barriers amongst stakeholders. Although adaptation responses were identified, not all barriers are conducive to simple solutions. Among the most intractable barriers were the lack of adequate funds and factors relating to the ecology of Prosopis species. Problems such as adopting new clearing methods and strategic planning need to be overcome to improve the effectiveness of control with the available funds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most ecosystems of the world are being increasingly invaded by a variety of alien species. However, little is known about the combined ecological impacts of multiple co-occurring invaders. We assessed the impact of a community of exotic mammals (five domestic and four wild) on forests of monkey puzzle (Araucaria araucana), a globally endangered tree restricted to ca 400 km(2) on the slopes of the Andes in Chile and Argentina. Seeds of monkey puzzles provide food during winter to a small community of native mice and Austral parakeets (Enicognathus ferrugineus). We recorded the number of uneaten seeds and the number of young seedlings at the end of winter under 516 female monkey puzzle trees located across the species' distribution, and identified the signals of native and exotic species that visited the under-canopy of each tree. Moreover, we studied the diet and foraging behavior of Austral parakeets to explore the potential indirect effects of exotic mammals through the disruption of a key ecosystem service (seed dispersal) supposedly provided by parakeets. All but one tree were visited by at least one seed predator species. Austral parakeets and mice predated seeds from 85% and at least 45% of the trees, respectively, and both the number of remaining seeds and seedlings were significantly larger when only parakeets or mice predated seeds than when exotic mammals also visited the trees. At least 90% of trees were visited by one or more exotic species, and the number of seeds and seedlings dropped drastically when at least two and four exotic species visited the tree, respectively. Austral parakeets mostly foraged on monkey puzzle trees during the winter period and dispersed their seeds in most feeding instances once seeds fell to the ground. The proliferation of exotic mammals may reduce the populations of native seed-predators in the long-term as well as the regeneration of monkey puzzle forests, directly through a reduction of seed availability and seedling survival, and indirectly through the disruption of dispersal processes. Our results show how strategies based on protecting areas may assure the survival of individuals of this long-lived (up to 1300 yr) tree species. However, forest regeneration and the community of native seed-predators and related ecological processes further depend on the proper management of exotic mammal invasions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Plant functional group dominance has been linked to climate, topography and anthropogenic factors. Here, we assess existing theory linking functional group dominance patterns to their drivers by quantifying the spatial distribution of plant functional groups at a 100-km grid scale. We use a standardized plant species occurrence dataset of unprecedented size covering the entire New World. Functional group distributions were estimated from 3648533 standardized occurrence records for a total of 83854 vascular plant species, extracted from the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN) database. Seven plant functional groups were considered, describing major differences in structure and function: epiphytes; climbers; ferns; herbs; shrubs; coniferous trees; and angiosperm trees. Two measures of dominance (relative number of occurrences and relative species richness) were analysed against a range of hypothesized predictors. The functional groups showed distinct geographical patterns of dominance across the New World. Temperature seasonality and annual precipitation were most frequently selected, supporting existing hypotheses for the geographical dominance of each functional group. Human influence and topography were secondarily important. Our results support the prediction that future climate change and anthropogenic pressures could shift geographical patterns in dominance of plant functional groups, with probable consequences for ecosystem functioning.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2016, 180, 141-160.

AB We tested whether direct placement of forest floor material (FFM: litter, fibric, humus layers and surface mineral horizons) and sowing of a cover crop (Melilotus officinalis) could facilitate the establishment of native forest understory species at a reclaimed coal mine in Alberta, Canada. FFM was salvaged at two depths (15 and 40 cm) from a recently harvested native aspen forest and immediately placed at the same depths on the reclamation site. Total richness (approximately 61 species in 96 subplots) was similar in each of 3 years post-placement; total richness for all 3 years combined was 87 including 34 typical boreal forest understory species plus 30 other natives. The deeper treatment reduced cover of all species, native and non-native species in year 1. In year 3, the deeper treatment still had lower cover of non-native species but had higher cover of forest understory species in years 2 and 3. The deeper treatment also resulted in lower species richness per plot, but only in year 1. In year 2 (when the biennial clover was at its tall stage), the cover crop treatment was associated with lower cover of non-native species but did not affect the cover of native forest understory species. Direct placement of FFM can help facilitate establishment of a diverse native boreal forest understory in a reclaimed landscape. Although richness and cover may be initially higher with shallower salvage and placement, deeper salvage may ultimately be better for encouraging establishment of native forest understory species.

AB Direct seeding is a promising technique for ecological restoration, but it has been poorly studied in neotropical savannas. Different types of plant cover (no cover, crops, or green manure) and fertilization (unfertilized, synthetic fertilizer, or poultry litter) were used to verify if survival and growth of different tree species after direct seeding could be enhanced by the use of any combination of these techniques. Seedling emergence, establishment, and growth were followed for 2 years for six savanna tree species sown in an agricultural field in Central Brazil. Germination was high (52%, on average) for Anacardium occidentale, Aspidosperma macrocarpon, Hymenaea stigonocarpa, Dipteryx alata, Eugenia dysenterica, and Magonia pubescens. Six additional species were planted, but less than 5% of these seeds germinated. Crops (60% shade) did not affect seedling survival and biomass compared with the control treatment, supporting the use of this strategy during the initial phase of restoration to involve farmers in the process. In contrast, the excessive shading (95%) from the green manure treatment decreased the survival of two species and the growth in biomass and diameter of five species, especially when combined with fertilization. Seedling growth was very slow throughout the experiment, requiring extended weed management. This study supports the use of direct seeding of the studied species for savanna restoration, but methods could be improved to include a larger number of species.

AB Proposed introductions of non-native bioenergy feedstocks have resulted in disagreements among industry, regulators, and environmental groups over unintended consequences, including invasion. Attempting to ban or "black list" known or high probability invasive species creates roadblocks without offering clear alternatives to industry representatives wishing to choose low invasion risk feedstocks. Therefore, a "white list" approach may offer a proactive policy solution for federal and state agencies seeking to incentivize the cultivation of promising new feedstocks without increasing the probability of non-native plant invasions in natural systems. We assessed 120 potential bioenergy feedstock taxa using weed risk assessment tools and generated a white list of 25 non-native taxa and 24 native taxa of low invasion risk in the continental USA. The list contains feedstocks that can be grown across various geographic regions in the USA and converted to a wide variety of fuel types. Although the white list is not exhaustive and will change over time as new plants are developed for bioenergy, the list and the methods used to create it should be immediately useful for breeders, regulators, and industry representatives as they seek to find common ground in selecting feedstocks.

AB Riparian forests are precious, complex habitats fostering high biodiversity where effective monitoring of habitat quality is particularly important. We present a composite indicator, referred to as Riparian Forest composite Indicator: focus on Structure (RFI_S), for the assessment of habitat quality and identification of 'hot-spot' areas where conservation actions need to be taken. The RFI_S is composed of seven indicators derived from very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery and LiDAR data, calculated on patch level. These indicators assess four important attributes of riparian forest quality: (1) tree species composition, (2) vertical forest structure, (3) horizontal forest structure and (4) water regime. For the aggregation of the RFI_S, two different weighting schemes, expert-based and statistical weighting, are applied. Forest patches with high cumulative RFI_S values represent patches of good habitat quality. These patches are primarily found along water bodies, reflecting the importance of water bodies for the structural complexity, an optimum water regime and tree species composition. For forest patches of low habitat quality the RFI_S helps to design suitable measures to improve habitat quality status through its decomposability into the underlying indicators. A sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the RFI_S shows that the indicator variance in terrain roughness has the strongest influence on the composite indicator. Finally, a comparison with an existing expert-based map on conservation status reveals the potential of a complementary quantitative assessment of habitat quality in the study site. We hence conclude that the RFI_S has a high capability to support sustainable forest management complementing regularly gathered in situ data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For many mussel species, the model of planktonic development followed by metamorphosis and settlement in the benthic habitat is complicated by the existence of planktonic post-metamorphic stages and/or pediveliger benthic stages that can relocate after initial settlement. This has led to the long-standing hypothesis of 'primary' settlement from the plankton onto intertidal algal substrate followed by 'secondary' relocation to mussel beds. Here, we investigate settlement of the intertidal mussels Perumytilus purpuratus and Semimytilus algosus in central Chile to test this hypothesis and explore physical drivers. Our results indicate that: (1) these species do not have planktonic post-metamorphic stages, (2) larvae typically arrive to the intertidal zone at a size 80-150 mu m larger than the largest planktonic larva, which based on growth rates, corresponds to a 3-20 d delay, (3) there are no differences in pediveliger sizes between different algal substrates, mussel beds, or artificial collectors, and (4) there is no evidence that larvae metamorphose in the intertidal and grow in alternative habitat before relocation to mussel beds. In 2 summers, daily settlement of both species was tightly and positively associated with wave height, despite large inter-annual variability in wind conditions. Our results reject the primary-secondary settlement hypothesis and support a new settlement model in which, after metamorphosis beyond the surf zone, the negatively buoyant settlers become semi-benthic and readily sink to the bottom. There, they can be transported onshore through the surf-zone by wave-driven near-bed transport. The process of tumbling under the surf may take from a few hours to several days, with larvae arriving at the shoreline in a wide range of sizes at any given time. For some larvae, relocation continues in the intertidal zone for months.

AB Melanosuchus niger is a caimanine alligatorid widely distributed in the northern region of South America. This species has been the focus of several ecological, genetic and morphological studies. However, morphological studies have generally been limited to examination of interspecific variation among extant species of South American crocodylians. Here, we present the first study of intraspecific variation in the skull of M. niger using a two-dimensional geometric morphometric approach. The crania of 52 sexed individuals varying in size were analysed to quantify shape variation and to assign observed shape changes to different types of intraspecific variation, that is, ontogenetic variation and sexual dimorphism. Most of the variation in this species is ontogenetic variation in snout length, skull depth, orbit size and the width of the postorbital region. These changes are correlated with bite force performance and probably dietary changes. However, a comparison with previous functional studies reveals that functional adaptations during ontogeny seem to be primarily restricted to the postrostral region, whereas rostral shape changes are more related to dietary shifts. Furthermore, the skulls of M. niger exhibit a sexual dimorphism, which is primarily sizerelated. The presence of non-size-related sexual dimorphism has to be tested in future examinations.

AB Background: The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera is one of the most important crop pests worldwide. It has developed high levels of resistance to synthetic insecticides, and hence, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) formulations are used as a safer pesticide and the Bt genes have been deployed in transgenic crops for controlling this pest. There is an apprehension that H. armigera might develop resistance to transgenic crops in future. Therefore, we studied the role of gut microbes by eliminating them with antibiotics in H. armigera larvae on the toxicity of Bt toxins against this pest.
   Results: Commercial formulation of Bt (Biolep (R)) and the pure Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac toxin proteins were evaluated at ED50, LC50, and LC90 dosages against the H. armigera larvae with and without antibiotics (which removed the gut microbes). Lowest H. armigera larval mortality due to Bt formulation and the Bt toxins Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac was recorded in insects reared on diets with 250 and 500 mu g ml(-1) diet of each of the four antibiotics (gentamicin, penicillin, rifampicin, and streptomycin), while the highest larval mortality was recorded in insects reared on diets without the antibiotics. Mortality of H. armigera larvae fed on diets with Bt formulation and the delta-endotoxins Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac was inversely proportional to the concentration of antibiotics in the artificial diet. Nearly 30% reduction in larval mortality was observed in H. armigera larvae from F-1 to F-3 generation when the larvae were reared on diets without antibiotics (with gut microbes) and fed on 0.15% Bt or 12 mu g Cry1Ab or Cry1Ac ml(-1) diet, indicating development of resistance to Bt in the presence of gut microflora. However, there were no differences in larval mortality due to Bt, Cry1Ab or Cry1Ac across generations in insects when they were reared on diets with 250 g of each antibiotic ml(-1) diet (without gut microflora).
   Conclusions: The results suggested that antibiotics which eliminated gut microflora influenced the toxicity of Bt towards H. armigera, and any variation in diversity and abundance of gut microflora will have a major bearing on development of resistance to Bt toxins applied as foliar sprays or deployed in transgenic crops for pest management.

AB Counting animals to estimate their population sizes is often essential for their management and conservation. Since practitioners frequently rely on indirect observations of animals, it is important to better understand the relationship between such indirect indices and animal abundance. The Formozov-Malyshev-Pereleshin (FMP) formula provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the relationship between animal track counts and the true density of species. Although this analytical method potentially has universal applicability wherever animals are readily detectable by their tracks, it has long been unique to Russia and remains widely underappreciated. In this paper, we provide a test of the FMP formula by isolating the influence of animal travel path tortuosity (i.e., convolutedness) on track counts. We employed simulations using virtual and empirical data, in addition to a field test comparing FMP estimates with independent estimates from line transect distance sampling. We verify that track counts (total intersections between animals and transects) are determined entirely by density and daily movement distances. Hence, the FMP estimator is theoretically robust against potential biases from specific shapes or patterns of animal movement paths if transects are randomly situated with respect to those movements (i.e., the transects do not influence animals' movements). However, detectability (the detection probability of individual animals) is not determined simply by daily travel distance but also by tortuosity, so ensuring that all intersections with transects are counted regardless of the number of individual animals that made them becomes critical for an accurate density estimate. Additionally, although tortuosity has no bearing on mean track encounter rates, it does affect encounter rate variance and therefore estimate precision. We discuss how these fundamental principles made explicit by the FMP formula have widespread implications for methods of assessing animal abundance that rely on indirect observations.

AB Question: Removal of vegetation and disturbance of the soil profile during mining reduce nutrient pools available for plants during mine site restoration. Thus, fertilizer is needed to replace the loss of nutrients available to support vegetation establishment. Yet the application of fertilizer can promote the establishment of competitively dominant species to the exclusion of others, particularly in low-fertility ecosystems. Here, we test effects of fertilizer application rates on the establishment of jarrah forest.
   Location: Five restored mine pits in the jarrah forest that grows on low-fertility soils in southwest Western Australia.
   Methods: Nitrogen (0 and 20kg elemental N center dot ha(-1)) and phosphorus (0, 10, 20 and 40kg elemental P center dot ha(-1)) were applied factorially to 20mx20m field plots at five sites restored after bauxite mining with seeds and seedlings of jarrah forest species.
   Results: Two and a half years after the experiment was established, there were no effects of N application rates on species richness, percentage vegetation cover or community composition of the restored jarrah forest. In contrast, P application had a number of effects on the restored jarrah forest. Species richness was highest at intermediate P application rates (10-20kg center dot ha(-1)) and lowest at the two extreme treatments (0 and 40kg center dot ha(-1)). Higher rates of P application resulted in a higher seedling density (2.5 vs 5.0m(-2) for 0 and 40kg P center dot ha(-1), respectively) and increased plant cover. Fertilizer P also significantly affected community composition, favouring ephemerals and weeds at high application rates and re-sprouting species at lower application rates. Community composition was more similar to the restoration target (unmined jarrah forest) at 0kg center dot P center dot ha(-1) (similarity value of 36%) than at higher P application rates.
   Conclusions: The data suggest that, in terms of maximizing species richness and percentage cover, a P application rate of between 10kg center dot P center dot ha(-1)and 20kg center dot P center dot ha(-1)is optimal for jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining. Additionally, the data suggest no benefit of N application at a rate of 20kg center dot N center dot ha(-1).

AB The geographically isolated, environmentally unique and biologically diverse coral reefs of north-west Australia are under threat from climate change and other localised human impacts. Similar to many other regions around the world, effective mitigation of these threats through ecosystem-based marine spatial planning is currently constrained by a lack of knowledge of the extent and direction of dispersal of eggs, larvae, recruits, juveniles or adults among the coral reefs (termed population connectivity). Here, we present the outcomes of a series of consultations between Marine Protected Area planners, managers and scientists aimed at facilitating the integration of this connectivity knowledge into effective management guidelines and policy in north-west Australia. Through this process, we first synthesised current knowledge of population connectivity in the fields of oceanography, larval biology and population genetics, and then identified and answered to the best of our ability the most useful questions for the spatial planning of Marine Protected Area networks. Key findings indicate that these systems are likely ecologically independent for many coral reef organisms, with hard corals exhibiting the most localised dispersal of species studied so far. Thus, given that hard corals are also the habitat forming species, and that more widely dispersing species such as fish are likely less vulnerable to small scale disturbance, we propose that no-take areas that facilitate resilience of hard coral populations should maximise biodiversity more generally. This means no-take areas that are large enough to encompass routine dispersal distances of corals (10-20 km), and are spaced at similar distances, will not only maintain self-replenishment, but also aid recovery after disturbance through connectivity between no-take areas. The results can be applied in a regional and wider context, and provide a valuable template for transfer of scientific knowledge into effective policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Effective monitoring programs are required to understand and mitigate biodiversity declines, particularly in tropical ecosystems where conservation conflicts are severe yet ecological data are scarce. "Locally-based" monitoring has been advanced as an approach to improve biodiversity monitoring in developing countries, but the accuracy of data from many such programs has not been adequately assessed. I evaluated a long-term, patrol-based wildlife monitoring system in Mole National Park, Ghana, through comparison with camera trapping and an assessment of sampling error. I found that patrol observations underrepresented the park's mammal community, recording only two-thirds as many species as camera traps over a common sampling period (2006-2008). Agreement between methods was reasonable for larger, diurnal and social species (e.g., larger ungulates and primates), but camera traps were more effective at detecting smaller, solitary and nocturnal species (particularly carnivores). Data from patrols and cameras corresponded for some spatial patterns of management interest (e.g., community turnover, edge effect on abundance) but differed for others (e.g., richness, edge effect on diversity). Long-term patrol observations were influenced by uneven sampling effort and considerable variation in replicate counts. Despite potential benefits of locally-based monitoring, these results suggest that data from this and similar programs may be subject to biases that complicate interpretation of wildlife population and community dynamics. Careful attention to monitoring objectives, methodological design and robust analysis is required if locally-based approaches are to satisfy an aim of reliable biodiversity monitoring, and there is a need for greater international support in the creation and maintenance of local monitoring capacity.

AB Coral reefs have been affected by natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Coral cover has declined on many reefs, and macroalgae have increased on some. The existence of alternative stable states with high or low coral cover has been widely debated, but not clearly established. We evaluate the evidence for alternative stable states in benthic coral-reef dynamics in the Caribbean, Kenya and Great Barrier Reef (GBR), using stochastic semi-parametric models based on large numbers of time series of cover of hard corals, macroalgae and other components. Only the GBR showed a consistent short-term regional decline in coral cover. There was no evidence for regional increases in macroalgae. The equilibrium distributions of our models were close to recently observed distributions, and differed among regions. In all three regions, the equilibrium distributions were unimodal rather than bimodal, and thus did not suggest the existence of alternative stable states on a regional scale, under current conditions.

AB Grazing by livestock can influence ecosystems in various ways, including altering plant communities, influencing woody plant encroachment, and determining livestock productivity. Evaluating long term effects of grazing on plant composition is valuable not only to understand herbivory on rangelands but to be able to address the primary factors that can threaten long term livestock productivity. We examined plant species composition and woody plant encroachment 45 years after the initiation of differing grazing treatments within a semiarid savanna of the southern Great Plains, USA. Grazing treatments varied in herbivore type (domestic cattle, sheep, and goats vs. goats only) and grazing intensity (heavy, moderate, and no-herbivory). All individual trees of Juniperus ashei Buchholz, the encroaching woody plant of the area, were removed prior to treatment initiation. Moderate and heavy grazing by a combination of species resulted in similar plant communities, while a history of heavy browsing by goats only and no-herbivory resulted in more distinct communities. Cover of J. ashei did not differ between mixed grazing and no-herbivory treatments, indicating that grazing was not responsible for woody plant encroachment. J. ashei cover within the browsed treatment was a third less compared to other treatments; compositional differences within this treatment are possibly due to reduced cover of woody vegetation. Declines in livestock productivity of the area are likely related to compositional changes resulting from increased woody plants. Livestock production within this semi-arid rangeland is likely unsustainable without management of woody plant encroachment, as communities tend to a closed canopy woodland.

AB In dryland ecosystems, understanding the effects of heterogeneity in soil moisture and geophysical properties on vegetation structure and dynamics poses a suite of challenging research questions. Heterogeneity in soil depth can affect resource availability and the subsequent organization of woody vegetation, while spatiotemporal variation in soil moisture can reveal important ecohydrological feedbacks that govern the outcome of anthropogenic activities on the organization of dryland vegetation. In this research we investigate two cases of soil resource heterogeneity that affect the organization of dryland vegetation patterns by expanding previous electromagnetic induction (EMI) imaging techniques. In the first case we examine the influence of soil depth as a control on soil resource availability on hillslopes in tree-grass systems in central Kenya. Our results indicate that woody vegetation clumping occurs where soil depth changes, and the deeper rooted Acacia tortilis occurs on deep soils while the drought tolerant Acacia etbaica occurs on shallow soils. In the second case we examine daily patch-interpatch scale moisture dynamics following two different-sized rain events in a degraded landscape. With the aid of a numerical subsurface flow model, EMI, and soil moisture data, we have identified a possible positive feedback mechanism ("soil moisture halo effect'') that we believe may have contributed to the proliferation and two-phase pattern formation of a native succulent Sansevieria volkensii in degraded ecosystems of Kenya. By determining how different plants respond to, and modify, the soil environment, we can better understand resource capture and dynamics, which in the longterm will help to develop management strategies.

AB It is generally accepted that disturbances increase community invasibility. Yet the role of disturbance in plant invasions may be less predictable than often assumed, due to the influence of environmental stochasticity and interactions between disturbance regimes. We evaluated the single and interactive effects of prescribed burning (large-scale, infrequent event) and animal diggings (small-scale, frequent events) on the invasion success of Gleditsia triacanthos L. in a tussock grassland relict of the Inland Pampa, Argentina. Tree seedling emergence and survival were monitored over 4 years, after adjusting for propagule pressure through copious seed addition to all disturbance treatments. Burning altered community structure by suppressing tussock grasses and promoting exotic forbs, whereas simulated, armadillo-like diggings had little impact on herbaceous composition. Overall, seedling emergence rather than survival represented the main demographic bottleneck for tree invasion. Tree establishment success varied among seedling cohorts emerged in different climatic years. In a dry year, emergence was only slightly affected by disturbances. In contrast, for two consecutive wet years, initial burning and armadillo-like diggings exerted strong, antagonistic effects on tree recruitment. Whereas fire alone increased recruitment, the simulated burrowing regime prevented seedling emergence in both burned and unburned plots. The latter effect might be explained by reduced soil moisture, and increased seed burial and predation in excavated patches. Thus, the impact of a single, large-scale perturbation promoting woody plant invasion was overridden by a regime of small-scale, frequent disturbances. Our results show that grassland invasibility was contingent on inter-annual climatic variation as well as unexpected interactions between natural and anthropogenic disturbance agents.

AB To assesses the effect of geomorphology, topography, and vegetation changes on spatial pattern of soil organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) in sand dunes, we used the quantitative methods to examine the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation cover, soil organic C, and total N in an 11-year naturally restored mobile dune (RMD11) and a 20-year naturally restored mobile dune (RMD20) that had been fenced to exclude grazing in Horqin Sandy Land, northern China. Our results showed that the vegetation cover, plant density, species number and diversity, soil organic C, and total N increased from RMD11 to RMD20 and increased from the 50 x 50-m plot (crest) to the 100 x 100-m plot (slope) in each dune. Geostatistical analysis showed that the spatial structural variance accounted for the largest proportion of the total sample variance in vegetation cover, soil organic C, and total N in each dune plot. Calculated spatial autocorrelation ranges of vegetation cover, soil organic C, and total N increased from RMD11 to RMD20, indicating that longer time since vegetation restoration results in a more homogeneous distribution of vegetation cover, soil organic C, and total N in sand dunes. In addition, the spatial continuity of vegetation cover, soil organic C, and total N decreased from the 50 x 50-m plot (crest) to the 100 x 100-m plot (slope) in each dune. These results suggest that the spatial distribution of soil organic C and total N in sand dunes is associated closely with geomorphic position related to the dune crest and slope, relative elevation of sampling site, and vegetation cover. Understanding the principles of this relationship between them may guide strategies for the conservation and management of semiarid dune ecosystems.

AB Pit-building antlion larvae are sit-and-wait predatory insects that construct conical pits, from which they ambush prey, in sandy soils. We examined the behavioural responses of antlions to the detection of various sized prey, which they were not allowed to capture. We found that antlions responded faster to smaller prey items, probably because larger prey may be considered a source of disturbance rather than a food source. Antlion response time to provided prey decreased after feeding and was negatively correlated with antlion body mass. Both of these results were indicative of a response to prey that depended on both internal and external factors. Pit dimensions increased with time at a constant rate among antlions in the unsuccessful prey capture or fed groups, but at a decelerating rate in the unfed control group. Contrary to our expectation, we could not detect differences in the rate of mass loss between antlions that were unfed and those experiencing unsuccessful prey captures. We also posited that antlions should exploit a specific prey type more efficiently as the number of encounters they had with it increased. However, there was no support for this prediction in our study. Exploring the responses of predators to prey in general, and in light of the conditions characterizing their natural habitat in particular, can improve our understanding of how predators adapt to cope with environmental variability.

AB Monitoring of large herbivores is central to research and management activities in many protected areas. Monitoring programs were originally developed to estimate (trends in) population sizes of individual species. However, emphasis is shifting increasingly towards conservation of diversity and communities instead of individual species, as a growing literature shows the importance of herbivore diversity for ecosystem functioning. We argue that the design of monitoring programs has not yet been adapted well to this new conservation paradigm. Using large herbivore census data from Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa, we studied how monitoring methodology (observational counts vs. dung counts) and spatial scale interact in influencing estimates of large herbivore species richness and diversity. Dung counts resulted in higher herbivore species richness and diversity estimates than direct observational counts, especially at finer monitoring resolutions (grid cells smaller than 25 km(2)). At monitoring resolutions coarser than 25 km(2) both methods gave comparable diversity estimates. The methods also yielded different spatial diversity estimates, especially at finer resolutions. Grid cells with high diversity according to the dung count data did not necessarily have high diversity according to the observational counts, as shown by low correlation of grid cell values of both methods. We discuss these results in the light of estimates of the sampling effort of each method and, hence, suggest new monitoring designs that are more suitable for tracking temporal and spatial trends in large herbivore diversity and community composition.

AB We focused on land units as landscape characteristics and selected seven typical land units on a land catena comprising two areas of southern Mongolia. Hierarchical analysis was used to test the hypothesis that a land unit's edaphic factors could explain the differences in vegetation responses to grazing. We established the survey sites at increasing distances from a livestock camp or water point within each land unit, then analysed patterns of change in floristic and functional compositions, vegetation volume and soil properties within each land unit to reveal differences in vegetation responses to grazing. We also examined the variations in floristic and functional compositions across land units to identify the edaphic factors that may underlie these differences. Changes in vegetation and soil properties at increasing distances from a camp or water point within each land unit were into three different patterns. Ordination techniques consistently indicated that land unit groups categorised using edaphic factors corresponded to those categorised using response patterns. Our study revealed that edaphic factors were responsible for the observed landscape-scale differences in vegetation responses to grazing in the study areas. In addition, the mechanisms underlying vegetation responses to grazing may have been primarily determined by edaphic factors.

AB The native flora of Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean is threatened by invasive woody plants introduced for agriculture, forestry or as ornamentals. We reviewed archives to identify woody plants introduced since colonisation and ranked the biological impact of the main non-indigenous species on native vegetation. The relationship between cumulative number of non-indigenous plants and population follows an s-shaped curve, but the rate of introduction was mainly determined by historical periods with five main introduction phases identified. A total of 318 introduced woody species were recorded with 132 identified as naturalized in natural ecosystems. Of these, 26 of the more serious invasive species (i.e. having a large biological impact on the new environment) were selected and ranked by biological impact to native ecosystems. Hiptage benghalensis, Ligustrum robustum var. walkeri, Acacia mearnsii, Ulex europaeus and Psidium cattleianum were identified as having the highest invasiveness capacity and the greatest impacts on succession and utilization of resources in natural areas. A strategy is required to manage high-priority invasive species and reduce the rate of non-indigenous plant introductions to the island.

AB Qualitative reproductive traits of 84 plant species belonging to 41 families were studied in tropical dry evergreen forest on the Coromandel coast of India. Majority of species had rotate type, white-coloured, scented flowers, rewarding nectar and pollen and pollinated chiefly by bees. An association between floral traits and pollination spectrum is evident. Bee pollination was prevalent in pollination systems. Among the fruit types, drupe and berry were common in black and red colour respectively, and dispersed by zoochorous mode. Seeds of brown- and green-coloured dry fruits, without any reward were disseminated by wind and explosion. The reproductive phenophase of trees and lianas occurred mostly during the dry period from January to June, which receives rainfall of less than 50 mm a month. However, shrubs showed a peak in flowering and fruiting in wet period. Detailed phenological observations of 22 woody species revealed a seasonal and unimodal pattern in flowering. Although some species were in flower round the year, flowering activity was skewed towards the dry season. The fruiting activity showed a bimodal pattern, one peak in dry season and another in wet season. Many species displayed a temporal aggregation in flowering and fruiting. The significant relation was obtained between reproductive traits and phenology of plants in the tropical dry evergreen forest.

AB We describe a method for surveying birds in river habitats that allows for rapid assessment across broad spatial scales and estimation of detection probabilities. Our river survey approach incorporates a double-survey technique, whereby observers in two canoes simultaneously survey birds along a river reach. Data are in the form of a two-sample mark-recapture history, and covariates suspected of influencing detection probabilities can be included in the modeling process and evaluated using information-theoretic approaches. We provide an example using the method along the Madison and upper Missouri rivers in Montana. Overall, detection probabilities for each observer ranged from 57% to 89%, and combined detection probabilities (the likelihood of at least one observer detecting an individual) were consistently high (88% across all species). Detection probabilities across species were positively correlated with body mass. Detection probabilities for some species were influenced by observer, river conditions, and whether species were in groups or alone; groups were more detectable, and individuals in slow-flowing and wide sections of river were more detectable. Boat-based double surveys are a viable method for estimating detection probabilities of birds in river habitats, and double surveys should be considered in other aquatic systems.

AB In this study, we extend a model of daily dryland dynamics by parameterizing a modified version of a minimalistic annual model to examine how the statistical structure of annual rainfall and grazing intensity interact to influence dryland vegetation. With a Monte Carlo approach, an ensemble outcome provides a statistical description of likely dryland vegetation dynamics responding to variations in rainfall structure and grazing intensity. Results suggest that increased rainfall variability decreases the average and increases the variability of grass cover leading to more frequent degradation of the grass resource. Vegetation of drier regions is found to be more sensitive to interannual variability in rainfall. Concentrating this variability into an organized periodic mode further decreases the mean and increases the variability of grass cover. Hence, a shift toward lower, more variable, or more inter-annually correlated annual rainfall will likely lead to a general decrease in the grass resource and increased dryland vulnerability to degradation.
   Higher grazing intensity or lower annual rainfall both lead to more frequent and longer duration degradation of the grass condition. We note an interesting interaction in the response of grass biomass to grazing intensity and rainfall variability, where increased rainfall variability leads to longer duration degradation for low grazing, but shorter periods of degradation for high grazing. Once grass reaches a degraded condition, we find that woody vegetation strongly suppresses recovery even if successive rainfall is high. Overall, these findings suggest that the projected increase in interannual rainfall variability will likely decrease grass cover and potentially lead to more frequent, longer lasting degradation of dryland vegetation, particularly if enhanced rainfall variability is concentrated in long period (e.g. decadal) modes.

AB We investigated relationships between rainfall (and landscape, zonation and nearby grazing disturbance) and the death rates of four perennial grass species in a highly functional semi-arid wooded grassland in eastern Australia. Two grasses were palatable C-3 species (Monachather paradoxa Steud. and Thyridolepis mitchelliana (Nees) S. T. Blake) and two were unpalatable C-4 species (Aristida jerichoensis (Domin) Henr. var. subspinulifera Henr. and Eragrostis eriopoda Benth.). During the 10-year study the grasses were protected from large herbivore grazing within paddocks continuously grazed by sheep. Death occurred only during droughts and rates of death were species-dependent. When plotted against several water availability indices, rainfall and rainfall/evaporation during the preceding 3 months provided best predictions of death. Longer preceding periods gave inferior predictions. A 3-month rainfall total of 75 mm and a 3-month rainfall/evaporation ratio of 0.15 were survival critical thresholds below which deaths began. The 3- month rainfall totals, rainfall/evaporation and estimated water status of plants were equally reasonable predictors of deaths, but were inconsistent in their effectiveness. Rainfall was adopted for the grass death model; death begins when 3- month rainfall total declines below a threshold of 75 mm and the death rate rises with lower rainfall. Position of plants in the gently undulating landscapes influenced water status and, hence, death rates. Water status of grasses on the two water-shedding zones and the 'flat' zone were similar at each assessment, but higher on 'ridge run-on' and 'toe-of-slope' zones. Foliage height and diameter also influenced death rate but were species dependent. Basal diameter did not influence death rate. Survivorship of several perennial grass species at widely spaced sites in south-eastern Australia provided equivocal support for generality of the grass death model.

AB 1. The anostracan fairy shrimp Branchinecta gaini inhabits one of the most hostile environments on earth, living in pools and lakes in Antarctica. Between January 2002 and January 2003 temperatures in two pools where B. gaini are extremely abundant on Adelaide Island ranged from -18.6 to -15.7 degreesC in winter, to 19.4 to 17.1 degreesC in summer, whilst air temperatures ranged from -34 to 6.3 degreesC.
   2. Branchinecta gaini survives winter as cysts, but endures large summer temperature fluctuations as adults. Cysts froze between -24.4 and -25.7 degreesC. In experiments adults survived 0-10 degreesC with no mortality for 1 week, 25 degreesC for nearly 48 h with 50% mortality, and at 32 degreesC complete mortality occurred in <1 h.
   3. Oxygen consumption ((M) over dotO(2)) in B. gaini approximately doubled for every 10 degreesC temperature rise (Q(10) = 2.04) up to 20 degreesC where it reached a peak. Females had, on average 19% higher (M) over dotO(2) than males. Females also had greater metabolic scopes, (maximum-minimum (M) over dotO(2) across temperatures was x3.6 for females, x3.1 for males).
   4. Ventilation frequency increased linearly with temperature, and did not decline at 25 degreesC, indicating animals were 'trying' progressively harder to supply oxygen to tissues, and oxygen deficiency was the probable cause of death. Females had a higher ventilation frequency than males (8.6-17.1% higher) and they also exhibited greater scope to raise ventilation frequency (x2.4 for females versus x1.5 for males).
   5. Great metabolic flexibility allows B. gaini to exploit extreme, highly fluctuating environments, and larger ventilatory and respiratory scopes allow females to survive higher temperatures than males. Because of this flexibility their prospects for coping with physical environmental change are high.

AB Weed invasion can disrupt ecological processes and the structure of ecosystems. One process potentially affected by weed invasion is leaf litter decomposition, which is important for supplying nutrients and organic matter to the soil. Leaf litter decomposition of the environmental weed Chrysanthemoides mondifera spp. rotundata was compared to that of the native coastal shrubs Acacia longifolia var. longifolia, Banksia integrfolia and Leptosperintun laevigatum. This was undertaken in sand dunes heavily infested with C. monilifera and in native un-infested dunes. Coarse and fine mesh litterbags were used to determine the importance of soil microflora and litter invertebrates.
   C. monilifera decomposition was fitted to a double exponential decay model, whereas the native leaf decomposition was best explained by a single exponential decay model. The succulent C. monilifera leaves decomposed at a significantly higher rate than the sclerophyllous native leaf mix. Time to 99% leaf loss was estimated to be 0.9-1.3 years for C. monilifera and 3.1-4.4 years for the native species. This reflects the physical properties of the leaves and the lower leaf mass area of C. nionilifera.
   C. monilifera leaves decayed faster in the coarse mesh bags compared to the fine, indicating leaf litter invertebrates positively influenced their decomposition. Mesh size had little affect on the native leaf decomposition rate. C. monilifera leaves generally decomposed faster within the weed infestations, partly due to invasion creating a protected environment with an altered microclimate. Replacement of native species with C. monilifera will alter nutrient cycling through changes in litter quality and decomposition rates. This may have implications for ecosystem resilience and stability. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes the use of supervised methods for the classification of vegetation. The difference between supervised classification and clustering is outlined, with reference to their current use in vegetation science. In the paper we describe the classification of Danish grasslands according to the Habitats Directive of the European Union, and demonstrate how a supervised classification can be used to achieve a standardized and statistical interpretation within a local flora. We thereby offer a statistical solution to the legal problem of protection of certain selected habitat types. The Habitats Directive protects three types of Danish grassland habitats, whereas two remaining types fall outside protection. A classification model is developed, using available Danish grassland data, for the discrimination of these five types based on their species composition. This new Habitats Directive classification is compared to a previously published unsupervised classification of Danish grassland vegetation. An indicator species analysis is used to find significant indicator species for the three protected habitat types in Denmark, and these are compared to the characteristic species mentioned in the interpretation manual of the Habitats Directive. Eventually, we discuss the pros and cons of supervised and unsupervised classification and conclude that supervised methods deserve more attention in vegetation science.

AB The magnitudes and patterns of sediment resuspension are assessed in Cannonsville Reservoir, New York, to quantify and characterize this internal source of sediment. The assessment is based on analyses of sediment trap collections from 10 sites over the spring to fall interval of two years. Temporal and spatial patterns in sediment deposition are demonstrated to be driven by resuspension/redeposition processes. Sediment that had been resuspended and redeposited represented 80 to 96 percent, on average, of the depositing solids collected along the main axis of the lake. About 90 percent of the redeposited sediment was inorganic. Increased resuspension caused by drawdown of the reservoir surface and fall turnover resulted in 10 to 50-fold increases in deposition rates compared to levels observed when the reservoir was full and strongly thermally stratified. Elevated levels of redeposition from resuspension in the reservoir have been driven by both higher water column concentrations of suspended solids and settling velocities. Recurring longitudinal and lateral gradients in resuspension are delineated, establishing that resuspended solids are transported from the riverine to the lacustrine zone and from near-shore to pelagic areas. Resuspension is demonstrated to cause increases in inanimate particle (tripton) concentrations. Higher tripton levels have been observed in years with greater drawdown. Water quality impacts of the resuspension phenomenon are considered.

AB Eucalyptus cladocalyx F. Muell., is a tree with a restricted distribution in the Southern Flinders Ranges, South Australia. It was originally introduced into the urban bushland of Kings Park, Perth, Western Australia in 1932 as an ornamental. Since its planting, E. cladocalyx has become invasive, spreading into the bushland up to 70 m away from planting sites. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the E. cladocalyx population is increasing at a greater rate than the two principal native tree species, E. gomphocephala DC. and E. marginata Donn ex Smith, but little is known about the factors influencing its invasion, or its biology. This study describes the population structure of E. cladocalyx, E. gomphocephala and E. marginata in Kings Park and the role of fire in the recruitment process. The study indicated that the three species have characteristics common to temperate Eucalyptus species that mass recruit seedlings following fire, with high numbers of seedlings found in recently burnt areas and low numbers in unburnt areas. Seedling survival in E. cladocalyx was higher than either of the native species. Furthermore, E. cladocalyx adults showed higher rates of canopy recovery following fires. It is argued that although fire in Kings Park is providing opportunities for E. cladocalyx, E. gomphocephala and E. marginata recruitment, the E. cladocalyx population is more resilient in an environment frequently disturbed by fire compared with the native populations.

AB An objective, non-invasive technique was developed for identifying individual black rhino from their footprints (spoor). Digital images were taken of left hind spoor from tracks (spoor pathways) of 15 known black rhino in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Thirteen landmark points were manually placed on the spoor image and from them, using customized software, a total of 77 measurements (lengths and angles) were generated. These were subjected to discriminant and canonical analyses. Discriminant analysis of spoor measurements from all 15 known animals, employing the 30 measurements with the highest F-ratio values, gave very close agreement between assigned and predicted classification of spoor. For individual spoor, the accuracy of being assigned to the correct group varied from 87% to 95%. For individual tracks, the accuracy level was 88%. Canonical analyses were based on the centroid plot method, which does not require pre-assigned grouping of spoor or tracks. The first two canonical variables were used to generate a centroid plot with 95% confidence ellipses in the test space. The presence or absence of overlap between the ellipses of track pairs allowed the classification of the tracks. Using a new 'reference centroid value' technique, the level of accuracy was high (94%) when individual tracks were compared against whole sets (total number of spoor for each rhino) but low (35%) when tracks were compared against each other. Since tracks with fewer spoor were more likely to be misclassified, track sizes were then artificially increased by summing smaller tracks for the same rhino. The modified tracks in a pairwise comparison gave an accuracy of 93%. The advantages, limitations and practical applications of the spoor identification technique are discussed in relation to censusing and monitoring black rhino populations.

AB phenol oxidase activity in the hemolymph of male Streptocephalus dichotomus is only 1/3rd of that of females. About 70% of this activity resides in cell lysate and 30% in plasma. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that male plasma has a single fraction of tyrosine hydroxylase, evidenced by positivity towards tyrosine methylester-PMS-NBT. Female hemolymph has as many as three isozymes showing diphenoloxidase activity. The significance of these results is discussed with reference to sex-linked enzyme activity and its possible role in longevity.

AB The effects of high daily soil surface temperatures (50 degrees and 70 degrees C) of various durations (1, 2, 3, 4 weeks), and temperatures experienced in the soil during fires (100 degrees, 150 degrees, 200 degrees C) of various durations (1, 3, 5 minutes) on seed viability, germination and early seedling growth of Acacia karroo, A. tortilis and Chromolaena odorata were determined in laboratory 'simulations'. Seed viability declined with increasing duration of exposure at 50 degrees C in A. tortilis and C. odorata, but only slightly in A. karroo, which was stimulated to germinate. At 70 degrees C seed viability declined with length of exposure in all species. Seeds of C. odorata did not survive any exposure to temperatures of 100 degrees C or above. The acacias survived temperatures of 100 degrees and 150 degrees C, with a few A, karroo surviving 200 degrees C (< 20% survived after one minute of heating). The emergent seedlings exposed to any of the temperature treatments did not show any abnormal growth patterns, as indicated by visual appearance and tissue allocation patterns relative to unheated control seedlings. The tolerance of A. karroo to high soil temperatures experienced during and after the passage of fire may be a factor that contributes to its ability to encroach in disturbed areas. The sensitivity of C. odorata seeds to high temperatures may be useful in the control of this aggressive alien invasive plant.

AB We examined the effects of three allelochemicals found in tomato (chlorogenic acid, rutin, and tomatine) and two thermal regimes (21 degrees:10 degrees C and 26 degrees:15 degrees C, representing spring and summer, respectively) on the performance of a generalist insect predator (Podisus maculiventris: Pentatomidae) fed prey containing those allelochemicals. The prey were Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) caterpillars, Solanaceae specialists with a preference for tomato. Whether an allelochemical had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on developmental time or mass gained by the predators depended on thermal regime and the combination of allelochemicals in the prey's diet. The effects of multiple allelochemicals were not always additive. For the most part, the allelochemicals had greater negative effects at the warmer thermal regime. Effects of allelochemicals also depended on the stage of the predator. Individually, chlorogenic acid and rutin prolonged developmental time of second-instar nymphs. In contrast, only rutin and tomatine together affected developmental time of fourth-instar nymphs, and this combination of allelochemicals reduced developmental time. Tomatine substantially reduced mass gained by second-instar nymphs but had no effect on mass gained by fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together had no effect on second-instar nymphs but increased the mass of fourth-instar nymphs. There were no allelochemical by temperature interactions for second-instar nymphs, whereas allelochemical by temperature interactions influenced stadium duration, final dry mass, and relative growth rate of fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together eliminated the negative effect of chlorogenic acid on consumption of prey by the fourth-instar nymphs. Chlorogenic acid by itself and rutin and tomatine together increased the efficiency of conversion of ingested prey to nymphal biomass. Comparison with an earlier study revealed that the effects of these thermal and dietary conditions were distinctly different for prey and predators, which suggests that such conditions would promote developmental asynchrony between prey and predator populations.

AB Low water availability reduces the establishment of the invasive shrub Prosopis on some grasslands. Water deficit survival and traits that may contribute to the postponement or tolerance of plant dehydration were measured on seedlings of Fl glandulosa Torr. var. glandulosa (honey mesquite) grown at CO2 concentrations of 370 (ambient), 710, and 1050 mu mol mol(-1). Because elevated CO2 decreases stomatal conductance, the number of seedlings per container in the elevated CO2 treatments was increased to ensure that soil water content was depleted at similar rates in all treatments. Seedlings grown at elevated CO2 had a greater root biomass and a higher ratio of lateral root to total root biomass than those grown at ambient CO2 concentration; however, these seedlings also shed more leaves and retained smaller leaves. These changes, together with a reduced transpiration/leaf area ratio at elevated CO2, may have contributed to a slight increase in xylem pressure potentials of seedlings in the 1050 mu mol mol(-1) CO2 treatment during the first 37 days of growth (0.26 ro 0.40 MPa). Osmotic potential was not affected by CO2 treatment. Increasing the CO2 concentration to 710 and 1050 mu mol mol(-1) more than doubled the percentage survival of seedlings from which water was withheld for 65 days. Carbon dioxide enrichment significantly increased survival from 0% to about 40% among seedlings that experienced the lowest soil water content. By increasing seedling survival of drought, rising atmospheric CO2 concentration may increase abundance of P. glandulosa on grasslands where low water availability limits its establishment.

AB Mutualistic relations between plants and animals are well documented on land but have received less attention in marine systems. This study examined the relationship between the territorial intertidal limpet Patella longicosta and the crustose brown alga Ralfsia verrucosa. Adult Patella are found exclusively in association with Ralfsia, on which they feed, while Ralfsia occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in Patella territories. Ralfsia benefits directly from both the presence and the territorial behaviour of Patella. Algal productivity was assessed by measuring oxygen evolution and utilization in situ and deriving photosynthesis/irradiance curves. Productivity was increased by about 30% by the presence of Patella in both summer (P-max of grazed algae 0.0098; ungrazed algae 0.0063 mg C.cm(-2).h(-1)) and winter (P-max grazed algae 0.0081; ungrazed algae 0.0053 mg(-2).C.h(-1)). Algal growth rates were not significantly increased by the application of limpet mucus in the laboratory. We did not examine nutrient regeneration by the limpet, but the increase in photosynthetic rate may depend on the limpet's grazing pattern which creates secondary sites for growth. Ralfsia also benefited from the territorial behaviour of Patella. The effects of different grazing regimes were investigated in different seasons by removing territorial limpets and either excluding all limpets using copper-based antifouling paint, or allowing access to non-territorial limpets (mostly P. oculus) using partial paint barriers. Exclusion of all limpets resulted in rapid overgrowth of Ralfsia plants by the foliose green alga Ulva sp.. Where non-territorial limpets had access to the plants overgrowth was reduced but Ralfsia plants were entirely removed by destructive grazing. Non-territorial grazers removed 90% of Ralfsia plants within 4 weeks in summer and 60% in winter. In control treatments P. longicosta prevented overgrowth by Ulva and actively excluded vagrant grazers, preventing overgrazing. Based on these findings, the association between the limpet and alga can be regarded as a non-obligate mutualism.

AB This paper explores how suspended clays alter the trophic interactions that govern composition and density of the zooplankton community in a small eutrophic North Carolina (USA) lake. Enclosures (12 m3) were used in a complete, triplicated, cross-classified design. The four treatments were; BASS (1 piscivorous fish/enclosure), BASS + CLAY, SUNFISH (16 planktivorous fish/enclosure), SUNFISH + CLAY. The + CLAY treatments received 100 g.m-2.d-1 of montmorillonitic clay. It was anticipated that turbidity from clay would release crustacean zooplankton from visual planktivores. Contrary to this expectation, crustacean zooplankton populations in the SUNFISH + CLAY were fourfold less than in the SUNFISH treatment. The reduction was not linked to deleterious effects of clay, since zooplankton populations were higher in the BASS + CLAY than the BASS treatment. Instead, crustacean zooplankton appeared to be governed primarily by Chaoborus predation. Suspended clay weakened the link between visually predaceous fish and Chaoborus, which in turn strengthened the effect of Chaoborus predation on crustacean zooplankton. Since fish selectively cropped larger instars of Chaoborus, rotifers (primarily Keratella cochlearis), which are mostly eaten by smaller instars of Chaoborus, were unaffected by clay.

TI EVOLUTION OF OBLIGATE SIBLICIDE IN BOOBIES .2. FOOD LIMITATION AND
   PARENT OFFSPRING CONFLICT
SO EVOLUTION
LA English
DT Article
AB Proximate limitation on parental food delivery has long been invoked to explain the evolution of single-chick broods of pelagic seabirds such as masked boobies (Sula dactylatra). A second possible proximate limit on brood size is siblicide driven by genetic parent - offspring conflict (POC) over brood size, if siblicidal offspring can reduce brood size to one even if the parents' optimal brood size is greater than one. I tested these two hypotheses by experimentally suppressing obligate siblicide in masked booby broods and comparing breeding parameters of these broods with unmanipulated single-chick control broods. Per capita mortality rate of experimental nestlings was higher than that of controls, but this deficit was more than made up by larger brood size. Parents of experimental broods brought more food to offspring, had higher fledging success, and apparently incurred no additional major short-term cost of reproduction, relative to parents of control broods, thus refuting the food limitation hypothesis. Estimates of inclusive fitness of chicks in experimental broods were higher than were those of control nestlings, a result inconsistent with the POC hypothesis that the siblicidal offspring's optimal brood size is one while the parents' optimum is greater than one. This discrepancy between natural brood size and apparent brood size optima might be resolved in several ways: experimental artifacts may give misleading estimates of optimal brood size; experimental and control offspring may have different reproductive values at the time of fledging; nestling masked boobies may face a special frequency-dependent case of POC in which the high risk of sharing a nest with a siblicidal sibling makes invasion of other behavioral genotypes difficult even when offspring and parent inclusive fitnesses are higher from a nonsiblicidal brood of two than from a brood of one.

AB Although companies are decisive in contributing to urban resilience, unresolved questions remain about which practices they can implement. Considering that the concept of resilience is acknowledged both explicitly and implicitly in a range of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this research aims to fill the existing gap between theoretical considerations about the role of companies in fostering urban resilience and the practices they implement and disclose. First, we build a theoretical framework based on strategic and instrumental components that can support the contribution of companies to urban resilience. Subsequently, we analyze 138 sustainability reports from organizations operating in Italy and Japan to identify how the SDGs, in particular those targets concerning environmental and social resilience, are implemented in their activities and communicated in their nonfinancial reports. Because greater attention to disclosures on the impacts of companies on resilience is a starting point for action towards achieving the SDGs, this study provides new insights into the contribution of companies to the resilience of cities, thus advancing the literature on the link between business and urban resilience.

AB With the development of nanotechnology and increased nanomaterial application, TiO2 nanoparticles have been released into the aquatic environment, causing potential ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms. Ocean acidification caused by anthropogenic CO2 is one of the most common environmental stressors, occurring simultaneously with marine contaminants, e.g., nanoparticles. Marine bivalves can accumulate nanoparticles and their digestive functions may be affected. In this study, we investigated the potential influences of TiO(2 )nanoparticles on the digestive enzyme activities of marine mussels Mytilus coruscus under ocean acidification. Mussels were exposed to combined treatments with three concentrations of nano-TiO2 (0, 2.5, 10 mg/L) and two pH values (8.1, 7.3) for 14 days, and then recovered under ambient condition (pH 8.1 and no nanoparticle) for 7 days. Samples were taken on the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 14th, and 21st day, the digestive enzymes, including amylase, pepsin, trypsin, lipase, and lysozyme, were investigated. Our results showed that nano-TiO2 and low pH had negative effects on amylase, pepsin, trypsin, and lipase, while both of them led an increase in lysozyme activity. Nano-TiO2 showed greater effects on the digestive capacity of M. coruscus rather than low pH. Moreover, a recovery period of 7 days was not sufficient for these enzymes to fully recover.

AB Forest-grassland mosaics, with abrupt boundaries between the two vegetation types, occur across the globe. Fire and herbivory are widely considered primary drivers that maintain these mosaics by limiting tree establishment in grasslands, while edaphic factors and frosts are generally considered to be secondary factors that reinforce these effects. However, the relative importance of these drivers likely varies across systems. In particular, although frost is known to occur in many montane tropical mosaics, experimental evidence for its role as a driving factor is limited. We used replicated in situ transplant and warming experiments to examine the role of microclimate (frost and freezing temperatures) and soil in influencing germination and seedling survival of both native forest trees and alien invasive Acacia trees in grasslands of a tropical montane forest-grassland mosaic in the Western Ghats of southern India. Seed germination of both native and alien tree species was higher in grasslands regardless of soil type, indicating that germination was not the limiting stage to tree establishment. However, irrespective of soil type, native seedlings in grasslands incurred high mortality following winter frosts and freezing temperatures relative to native seedlings in adjoining forests where freezing temperatures did not occur. Seedling survival through the tropical winter was thus a primary limitation to native tree establishment in grasslands. In contrast, alien Acacia seedlings in grasslands incurred much lower levels of winter mortality. Experimental night-time warming in grasslands significantly enhanced over-winter survival of all tree seedlings, but increases were much greater for alien Acacia than for native tree seedlings. Synthesis. Our results provide evidence for a primary role for frost and freezing temperatures in limiting tree establishment in grasslands of this tropical montane forest-grassland mosaic. Future increases in temperature are likely to release trees from this limitation and favour tree expansion into grasslands, with rates of expansion of non-native Acacia likely to be much greater than that of native trees. We suggest that studies of frost limitation to plant establishment are needed across a range of tropical ecosystems to re-evaluate the general importance of frost as a driver of vegetation transitions in the tropics.

AB Niche diversity of pollinating insects plays a vital role in maintaining extant terrestrial ecosystems. A key dimension of pollination niches refers to the insect proboscis length that commonly matches the floral tube length. Here we describe new kalligrammatid lacewings (an iconic Mesozoic pollinating insect lineage) from late Cretaceous Burmese amber and Mesozoic sediments in China. Kalligrammatids display complex configurations of elongate mouthpart elements consisting of well-developed maxillae, labium and their palps. The mouthpart lengths vary among species, from 0.6 to 18.0 mm, suggesting corresponding variability in the floral tube lengths of Mesozoic plants. With the diversification of pollinating habits, the kalligrammatids presented highly divergent traits related to chemical communication and defence mechanisms. Together with other Mesozoic long-proboscid insects, these fossils not only reveal the high niche diversity of Mesozoic pollinating insects but also highlight the diversity of Mesozoic pollinator-dependent plants prior to the rise of angiosperms.

AB Grazing removes a plant's aboveground vegetative and reproductive tissues and can modify the soil seed bank, potentially impacting the restoration of preferred species. Knowledge about aboveground vegetation and species composition of soil seed bank and the processes that contribute to vegetation recovery on and surrounding watering points subjected to grazing is lacking. Successful restoration strategies hinge on addressing these knowledge gaps. We assessed the effects of livestock grazing on aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank characteristics along a river bank and surrounding areas subject to different grazing intensities and draw implications for restoration. Plots (50 x 50 m) were established along five transects representing differing levels of grazing intensity. Soil samples were taken from three layers within each plot to determine soil properties and species composition of soil seed bank using the seedling emergence method. Heavy grazing resulted in the disappearance of perennial grasses, a reduction in species diversity and a decrease in soil nutrients with increased soil depth. Overall, the similarity between the extant aboveground vegetation and flora within the soil seed bank was low. The soil seed bank was dominated by herbaceous species and two woody species, suggesting that many woody species are not accumulating in the soil. With increasing soil depth, the seed density and richness declined. Canonical correspondence analyses (CCAs) showed that emerged seedlings from the soil seed bank were significantly influenced by soil carbon, organic matter, total nitrogen, total potassium and soil cation exchange capacity. This finding suggests that current grazing practices have a negative impact on the vegetation surrounding watering points; hence there is a need for improved grazing management strategies and vegetation restoration in these areas. The soil seed bank alone cannot restore degraded river banks; active transfer of propagules from adjacent undisturbed forest areas is essential.

AB The southern Cape is a particularly dynamic region of South Africa in terms of climate change as it is influenced by both temperate and tropical circulation systems. This paper presents pollen and microcharcoal data generated from a sediment core extracted from the coastal lake Eilandvlei spanning the last approximate to 8900 years. With an average sample resolution of 57 years, this record represents the highest resolution record of Holocene vegetation change from the region. The data indicate that cool, seasonal and moderately dry conditions characterized the Wilderness Embayment from approximate to 8900 to 8000calaBP. Afrotemperate forests expanded from approximate to 8000calaBP until 4700calaBP. This humid period is followed by indications of more arid and seasonal conditions until 3500calaBP. A long-term increase in forest taxa suggests steadily increasing moisture availability across the late Holocene. Strong affinities are noted with records from more tropical regions of South Africa, suggesting that tropical systems are of importance in maintaining higher moisture availability in the region. An important mechanism of climate change is the Agulhas Current, which transmits what appears to be a localized signal of tropical variability to the southern Cape coast.

AB 1. With accelerating species introductions in an era of globalization, co-occurring alien species have become increasingly common. Understanding the combined ecological impacts of multiple invaders is not only crucial for wildlife managers attempting to ameliorate biodiversity loss, but also provides key insights into invasion success and species coexistence mechanisms in natural ecosystems. Compared with much attentions given to single-invader impacts, little is known about the impacts of multiple co-occurring invaders.
   2. The American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus = Rana catesbeiana) and the red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) are two aquatic invasive species in many different areas of the globe. They coexist with native anurans in a variety of permanent lentic waters, which provide an ideal model system to explore the combined effects of multiple invaders from different trophic levels on native species.
   3. Based on a global diet analysis covering 34 native and invasive bullfrog populations, and data from 10-year field surveys across 157 water bodies in the Zhoushan Archipelago, China, we observed a reduced impact of bullfrogs on native anurans at high crayfish densities when the two invaders co-occurred.
   4. The global diet analysis showed that crayfish occurrence reduced the number of native anuran prey consumed by bullfrogs in both native and invasive populations. After accounting for pseudoreplication of different observations among water bodies, islands, and survey time, model averaging analyses based on GLMMs showed a negative relationship between bullfrog density and native anuran densities for field observations of invasive bullfrogs alone and co-invaded observations with low crayfish density. However, this negative relationship disappeared when the two invaders co-occurred with high crayfish density. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses further validated that the impacts of bullfrogs on native frogs were mitigated by the negative interactions between crayfish and bullfrogs.
   5. Our results provide novel evidence of a density-dependent antagonistic effect of two sympatric invaders from different trophic levels on native species. This study highlights the importance of considering complex interactions among co-invaders and native species when prioritizing conservation and management actions and will facilitate the development of a more precise framework to predict invasion impacts.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of fish meal substitution by Chlorella vulgaris meal in the diet of Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. Experimental diets contained varying levels of fish meal (400, 300, 200, 100 and 0 g/kg) which was replaced by increasing levels of C.vulgaris (0, 97.2, 194.4, 291.6 and 388.8 g/kg). After 8weeks of feeding trial, shrimp fed diet with 97.2 g/kg C.vulgaris showed significantly improved growth compared to other treatments including control. Similarly, shrimp fed diet with 97.2 g/kg C.vulgaris showed significantly higher amount of trypsin and amylase activities compared to other treatments. The contents of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid were significantly higher in the whole body of L.vannamei fed with different levels of C.vulgaris compared to those of control group. After exposure to hypoxia, the survival rate of shrimp fed diets contained different levels of C.vulgaris was higher than that of control group, while no significant differences were observed in ammonia tolerance among treatments. In conclusion, this study indicated that fish meal can be completely replaced with C. vulgaris in the diet of juvenile L.vannamei with no adverse effects on the performance of shrimp.

TI Sugar landscapes and pollinator-mediated interactions in plant

AB Pollinator-mediated interactions between plants can play an important role for the dynamics of plant communities. Pollination services depend on the abundance and the foraging behaviour of pollinators, which in turn respond to the availability and distribution of floral resources (notably nectar sugar). However, it is still insufficiently understood how the 'sugar landscapes' provided by flowering plant communities shape pollinator-mediated interactions between multiple plant species and across different spatial scales. A better understanding of pollinator-mediated interactions requires an integrative approach that quantifies different aspects of sugar landscapes and investigates their relative importance for pollinator behaviour and plant reproductive success. In this study, we quantified such sugar landscapes from individual-based maps of Protea shrub communities in the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. The 27 study sites of 4 ha each jointly comprise 127 993 individuals of 19 species. We analysed how rates of visitation by key bird pollinators and the seed set of plants respond to different aspects of sugar landscapes: the distribution of nectar sugar amounts, as well as their quality, taxonomic purity and phenology. We found that pollinator visitation rates strongly depended on phenological variation of site-scale sugar amounts. The seed set of focal plants increased with nectar sugar amounts of conspecific neighbours and with site-scale sugar amounts. Seed set increased particularly strongly if site-scale sugar amounts were provided by plants that offer less sugar per inflorescence. These combined effects of the amount, quality, purity and phenological variation of nectar sugar show that nectar sugar is a common interaction currency that determines how multiple plant species interact via shared pollinators. The responses of pollinator-mediated interactions to different aspects of this interaction currency alter conditions for species coexistence in Protea communities and may cause community-level Allee effects that promote extinction cascades.

AB Grazing ecosystems ranging from the Arctic tundra to tropical savannas are often characterized by small-scale mosaics of herbivore-preferred and herbivore-avoided patches, promoting plant biodiversity and resilience. The three leading explanations for bistable patchiness in grazed ecosystems are (1) herbivore-driven nutrient cycling, (2) plant-growth-water-infiltration feedback under aridity, and (3) irreversible local herbivore-induced abiotic stress (topsoil erosion, salinity). However, these insufficiently explain the high temporal patch dynamics and wide-ranging distribution of grazing mosaics across productive habitats. Here we propose a fourth possibility where alternating patches are governed by the interplay of two important biotic processes: bioturbation by soil fauna that locally ameliorates soil conditions, promoting tall plant communities, alternating with biocompaction by large herbivores that locally impairs soil conditions, and promotes lawn communities. We review mechanisms that explain rapid conversions between bioturbation- and biocompaction-dominated patches, and provide a global map where this mechanism is possible. With a simple model we illustrate that this fourth mechanism expands the range of conditions under which grazing mosaics can persist. We conclude that the response of grazing systems to global change, as degradation or catastrophic droughts, will be contingent on the correct identification of the dominant process that drives their vegetation structural heterogeneity.

AB This study aimed at determining bacterial concentration and diversity in fresh tropical shrimps (Penaeus notialis) and their surrounding brackish waters and sediment. Freshly caught shrimp, water and sediment samples were collected in Lakes Nokoue and Aheme in Benin (West Africa) during two periods with different water salinity and temperature. We used complementary culture-dependent and culture-independent methods for microbiota analysis. During both sampling periods, total mesophilic aerobic counts in shrimp samples ranged between 4.4 and 5.9 log CFU/g and were significantly higher than in water or sediment samples. In contrast, bacterial diversity was higher in sediment or water than in shrimps. The dominant phyla were Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in shrimps, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in water, and Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi in sediment. At species level, distinct bacterial communities were associated with sediment, water and shrimps sampled at the same site the same day. The study suggests that the bacterial community of tropical brackish water shrimps cannot be predicted from the microbiota of their aquatic environment. Thus, monitoring of microbiological quality of aquatic environments might not reflect shrimp microbiological quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mangrove systems are one of the most complex and productive ecosystems on Earth, providing crucial livelihood support to coastal communities in developing countries. However, mangrove systems are being degraded and lost at an alarming rate globally. In Vietnam, the principal threat to mangrove systems is their conversion to aquaculture. Historically, mangrove system dependent communities (MSDC) have responded to change through their livelihoods and social networks, using social capital to self-organise and access crucial livelihood resources. However, little is known about the impact of different degrees of aquaculture on MSDC livelihoods and social networks, and what this means for the resilience of these communities and their ability to self-organise in response to change. Using a quantitative approach based on empirical household survey data, we assess the association between aquaculture and the livelihoods and social networks of three coastal communities of northern Vietnam. Results indicate that greater degrees of aquaculture are associated with: greater income inequality and lower livelihood diversity; and larger and less dense social networks. The increased influence of market-based relations associated with greater degrees of aquaculture has implications for resilience through the socio-economic differentiation and fragmentation of MSDC networks, which reduces social capital and the ability to self-organise in response to change. A diversity of network ties is required in order to connect various groups within MSDC. This can enable shared identification and understanding of the issues facing mangrove systems in order to facilitate self-organisation, and foster the resilience necessary for the sustainable governance of mangrove systems.

AB Large-mammal herbivore populations are subject to the interaction of internal density-dependent processes and external environmental stochasticity. We disentangle these processes by linking consumer population dynamics, in a highly stochastic environment, to the availability of their key forage resource via effects on body condition and subsequent fecundity and mortality rates. Body condition and demographic rate data were obtained by monitoring 500 tagged female goats in the Richtersveld National Park, South Africa, over a three-year period. Identifying the key resource and pathway to density dependence for a population allows environmental stochasticity to be partitioned into that which has strong feedbacks to population stability, and that which does not. Our data reveal a density-dependent seasonal decline in goat body condition in response to concomitant density-dependent depletion of the dry-season forage resource. The loss in body condition reduced density-dependent pregnancy rates, litter sizes, and pre-weaning survival. Survival was lowest following the most severe dry season and for juveniles. Adult survival in the late-dry season depended on body condition in the mid-dry season. Population growth was determined by the length of the dry season and the population size in the previous year. The RNP goat population is thereby dynamically coupled primarily to its dry-season forage resource. Extreme environmental variability thus does not decouple consumer resource dynamics, in contrast to the views of nonequilibrium protagonists.

AB Woody biomass dynamics are an expression of ecosystem function, yet biomass estimates do not provide information on the spatial distribution of woody vegetation within the vertical vegetation subcanopy. We demonstrate the ability of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to measure aboveground biomass and subcanopy structure, as an explanatory tool to unravel vegetation dynamics in structurally heterogeneous landscapes. We sampled three communal rangelands in Bushbuckridge, South Africa, utilised by rural communities for fuelwood harvesting. Woody biomass estimates ranged between 9 Mg ha(-1) on gabbro geology sites to 27 Mg ha(-1) on granitic geology sites. Despite predictions of woodland depletion due to unsustainable fuelwood extraction in previous studies, biomass in all the communal rangelands increased between 2008 and 2012. Annual biomass productivity estimates (10-14% p.a.) were higher than previous estimates of 4% and likely a significant contributor to the previous underestimations of modelled biomass supply. We show that biomass increases are attributable to growth of vegetation <5 m in height, and that, in the high wood extraction rangeland, 79% of the changes in the vertical vegetation subcanopy are gains in the 1-3m height class. The higher the wood extraction pressure on the rangelands, the greater the biomass increases in the low height classes within the subcanopy, likely a strong resprouting response to intensive harvesting. Yet, fuelwood shortages are still occurring, as evidenced by the losses in the tall tree height class in the high extraction rangeland. Loss of large trees and gain in subcanopy shrubs could result in a structurally simple landscape with reduced functional capacity. This research demonstrates that intensive harvesting can, paradoxically, increase biomass and this has implications for the sustainability of ecosystem service provision. The structural implications of biomass increases in communal rangelands could be misinterpreted as woodland recovery in the absence of three-dimensional, subcanopy information.

AB Purussaurus brasiliensis thrived in the northwestern portion of South America during the Late Miocene. Although substantial material has been recovered since its early discovery, this fossil crocodilian can still be considered as very poorly understood. In the present work, we used regression equations based on modern crocodilians to present novel details about the morphometry, bite-force and paleobiology of this species. According to our results, an adult Purussaurus brasiliensis was estimated to reach around 12.5 m in length, weighing around 8.4 metric tons, with a mean daily food intake of 40.6 kg. It was capable of generating sustained bite forces of 69,000 N (around 7 metric tons-force). The extreme size and strength reached by this animal seems to have allowed it to include a wide range of prey in its diet, making it a top predator in its ecosystem. As an adult, it would have preyed upon large to very large vertebrates, and, being unmatched by any other carnivore, it avoided competition. The evolution of a large body size granted P. brasiliensis many advantages, but it may also have led to its vulnerability. The constantly changing environment on a large geological scale may have reduced its long-term survival, favoring smaller species more resilient to ecological shifts.

AB Aim Invasiveness of an introduced species in one region is often used to predict risk and inform management of the same species elsewhere. This assumes that entities in both regions are equivalent in their ecology and response to management. However, intraspecific genetic variation can result in differences in performance between regions. We conducted population genetic and phylogeographic analyses of the widely introduced and intraspecifically diverse Australian tree species Acacia saligna, in order to improve our understanding of its worldwide invasion history.
   Location The native range of A. saligna in Western Australia and introduced ranges in eastern Australia, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and the USA.
   Methods We analysed microsatellite genotype data obtained from 447 individuals of A. saligna (including reference populations of known subspecies lineages) using Bayesian assignment analysis. We also reconstructed parsimony networks and a phylogeny using data from the nuclear external transcribed spacer (ETS) gene region for a subset of 120 individuals.
   Results There was no consistent genetic pattern in introduced populations in different parts of the world. All three subspecies lineages of A. saligna have been moved around the world, showing high levels of admixture in some introduced populations. A previously identified novel and cultivated South African lineage was also identified in Portugal and Italy.
   Main conclusions With different subspecies lineages present in different regions globally, it is unclear exactly how effective management approaches of invasions in one region will be in other regions. For example, the successful biological control agents against cultivated lineages of A. saligna in South Africa will probably be effective against similar genotypes in Portugal but not against dissimilar lineages present elsewhere. Further work is needed to conclusively link the relative extent of invasions to genetic differences, and to determine whether genetic novelty can explain the widespread invasions of A. saligna observed in South Africa and Portugal.

AB Spatial subsidies are resources transferred from one ecosystem to another and which can greatly affect recipient systems. Increased subsidy quantity is known to increase these effects, but subsidy quality is likely also important. We examined the effects of leaf litter quality (varying in nutrient and tannin content) in pond mesocosms on gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor) biomass export, as well as water quality and ecosystem processes. We used litter from three different tree species native to Missouri [white oak (Quercus alba), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum)], one non-native tree [white pine (Pinus strobus)], and a common aquatic grass [prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata)]. We found that leaf litter species affected almost every variable we measured. Gray treefrog biomass export was greatest in mesocosms with grass litter and lowest with white oak litter. Differences in biomass export were affected by high tannin concentrations (or possibly the correlated variable, dissolved oxygen) via their effects on survival, and by primary production, which altered mean body mass. Effects of litter species could often be traced back to the characteristics of the litter itself: leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, and tannin content, which highlights the importance of plant functional traits in affecting aquatic ecosystems. This work and others stress that changes in forest species composition could greatly influence aquatic systems and aquatic-terrestrial linkages.

AB We studied connectivity patterns from a small and isolated island in the Gulf of California (San Pedro Martir Island Biosphere Reserve), as a source of propagules to surrounding Marine Protected Areas and fishing sites. We used a particle-tracking scheme based on the outputs of a three-dimensional numerical hydrodynamic model to assess the spatial domain to which the island exports larvae as well as larvae retention. We modeled the release of passive particles from locations around the island during the four release dates (May 15 and 31, and June 14 and 30), matching the lunar phases and the peak of the reproductive season for several commercial invertebrates and fish, at the time when currents in the Gulf typically reverse. For each simulation we analyzed the data at 15,20 and 30 days after the release to represent different planktonic propagule durations. Particle dispersion was highly dynamic and spread over similar to 600 km along the coast over the study period. Overall, we observed potential ecological connectivity with a few key distant fishing sites that changed trough time, and potential genetic connectivity towards many near and distant sites, including all neighboring Marine Protected Areas, although not simultaneously. The percentages of particles remaining within the boundaries of the island tended to decline from May to June, and decreased with delayed planktonic propagule duration. The design of effective Marine Protected Areas should acknowledge the dynamic nature of connectivity patterns, for instance, by establishing adaptive network reserves to respond to changing ocean features that match reproductive patterns of target species and fisheries behavior.

AB Almost half of the 16,942 km(2) of South Africa's subtropical thicket with a substantial Portulacaria afra (spekboom) component has been heavily degraded by domestic herbivores. The subtropical thicket biome is a drought-prone and water-stressed area, and many of the region's watersheds comprise of eroded landscapes clothed in degraded spekboom thicket. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of degradation of spekboom thicket on hydrological processes. We hypothesised that degradation of spekboom thicket would reduce infiltration and, hence, reduce soil moisture retention and increase run-off and erosion. We tested this hypothesis by collecting data on rainfall, infiltration, soil moisture retention and run-off in degraded thicket, and - as a reference site - in an adjacent stand of relatively intact thicket. The results showed clear trends in the impacts of spekboom thicket degradation on hydrological processes. The more than hundred-fold lower infiltration in soils associated with degraded thicket relative to the soils beneath the intact, spekboom canopy, resulted in lower levels and less retention of soil moisture, almost double the amount of runoff, and an almost six-fold increase in sediment load. Thus, restoring degraded thicket will reduce erosion and likely improve baseflows, in addition to sequestering carbon. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Anthropogenic habitat modification often has a profound negative impact on the flora and fauna of an ecosystem. In parts of the Middle East, ephemeral rivers (wadis) are characterised by stands of acacia trees. Green, flourishing assemblages of these trees are in decline in several countries, most likely due to human-induced water stress and habitat changes. We examined the importance of healthy acacia stands for bats and their arthropod prey in comparison to other natural and artificial habitats available in the Arava desert of Israel. We assessed bat activity and species richness through acoustic monitoring for entire nights and concurrently collected arthropods using light and pit traps. Dense green stands of acacia trees were the most important natural desert habitat for insectivorous bats. Irrigated gardens and parks in villages and fields of date palms had high arthropod levels but only village sites rivalled acacia trees in bat activity level. We confirmed up to 13 bat species around a single patch of acacia trees; one of the richest sites in any natural desert habitat in Israel. Some bat species utilised artificial sites; others were found almost exclusively in natural habitats. Two rare species (Barbastella leucomelas and Nycteris the baica) were identified solely around acacia trees. We provide strong evidence that acacia trees are of unique importance to the community of insectivorous desert-dwelling bats, and that the health of the trees is crucial to their value as a foraging resource. Consequently, conservation efforts for acacia habitats, and in particular for the green more densely packed stands of trees, need to increase to protect this vital habitat for an entire community of protected bats.

AB Reclamation of land disturbed due to mining in arid and semiarid environments occurs across the globe. Large-scale surface mines provide unique opportunities to examine the reclamation process across a landscape. The objectives of this research were to (1) measure infiltration rates in reclaimed surface coal mines and (2) determine the effects of soil properties on ground cover on infiltration rates of surface coal mines. In this study, reclaimed land 10-15 and 20-25 years old, and native reference site (undisturbed) were investigated at two large surface coal mines in Wyoming, USA. Infiltration rates were measured using double-ring infiltrometer method. The soil properties including bulk density, pH, carbonate content, organic carbon content, aggregate stability, electrical conductivity, and soil texture were analyzed using standard methods. The ground cover was estimated visually. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine if any correlations between infiltration rate and soil properties and ground cover exist. Results suggest that at Mine 1, infiltration rates on reclaimed land were found to be significantly higher in the 20-25-year-old reclamation than the 10-15-year-old reclamation and the native site. At Mine 2, the native site had significantly higher infiltration than 20-25-year-old reclamation, which in turn had significantly higher infiltration rates than the 10-15-year-old reclaimed site. Along with infiltration, soil characteristics were examined. Overall, the findings of this study suggest soil texture and plant cover play an important role in controlling infiltration rates in reclaimed surface coal mines.

AB Reproductive cycles of marine invertebrates with complex life histories are considered to be synchronized by water temperature and feeding conditions, which vary with season and latitude. This study analyses seasonal variation in the occurrence of oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and mussel (Mytilus edulis/galloprovincialis) larvae across European coastal waters at a synoptic scale (1000s of km) using standardised methods for sampling and molecular analyses.
   We tested a series of hypotheses to explain the observed seasonal patterns of occurrence of bivalve larvae at 12 European stations (located between 37 degrees N and 60 degrees N and 27 degrees W and 18 degrees E). These hypotheses included a model that stated that there was no synchronisation in seasonality of larval presence at all between the locations (null hypothesis), a model that assumed that there was one common seasonality pattern for all stations within Europe, and various models that supposed that the variation in seasonality could be grouped according to specific spatial scales (i.e., latitude, large marine ecosystems and ecoregions), taxonomic groups, or several combinations of these factors.
   For oysters, the best models explaining the presence/absence of larvae in European coastal waters were (1) the model that assumed one common seasonal pattern, and (2) the one that, in addition to this common pattern, assumed an enhanced probability of occurrence from south to north. The third best model for oysters, with less empirical support than the first two, stated that oysters reproduced later in the south than in the north. For mussels, the best models explaining the seasonality in occurrence of larvae were (1) the model that assumed four underlying trends related to large marine ecosystems, and (2) the one that assumed one common seasonal pattern for larvae occurrence throughout Europe.
   Such synchronies in larval occurrences suggest that environmental conditions relevant to bivalve larval survival are more or less similar at large spatial scales from 100s to 1000s of km. To unravel the underlying mechanisms for this synchronisation is of particular interest in the light of changing environmental conditions as the result of global climate change and the possible consequences for marine food webs and ecosystem services.

AB Changes in vegetation and soils under heavy continuous grazing have been widely documented, but the effects of these on secondary production are debated. Sterkspruit is one of South Africa's most degraded districts, and soil erosion in the district increased substantially over the twentieth century. Despite this, records dating to the late-1800s show no decline in livestock numbers. This study explores how high stocking rates have been maintained despite an apparent deterioration in the natural resource base. Multiple regression analyses were used to determine the best predictors of stocking rates in 1974, the 1980s and 1997 to determine whether the relative importance of mean annual rainfall and winter temperature (indicative of primary production), the percentage of area on nutrient-poor sandstone-derived soils (representing a dry season nutritional bottleneck), the percentage of an area on steep slopes (which make areas less accessible to livestock) and human population density and availability of arable land (indicative of potential inputs) had changed over time. While mean annual rainfall was the best predictor of stocking rates in 1974, stocking rates in the 1980s and 1997 were best predicted by human population densities. This suggests that a qualitative shift in how livestock populations are maintained has taken place. Copyright (c) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The destruction of wetlands due to afforestation areas is a common activity in temperate and subtropical regions in Southern America. The expansion of pine in the Coastal Plain of Southern Brazil is out of control and its impacts on aquatic biodiversity are little known. We tested the following hypotheses: the pine occurrence diminishes the anuran richness and abundance in ponds and it changes the anuran composition; the beta-diversity between pine and native grassland matrix ponds (natural ponds) is determined mainly by nestedness. Sampling was carried out from 2007 to 2009 in five ponds in pine invasion matrix and five ponds in native grassland matrix. The natural ponds showed a greater richness of tadpoles (10 species) than pine ponds (5 species). The mean richness of adults was higher in natural ponds than pine ponds throughout the entire study. The species composition was different between natural and pine ponds, for both adults and tadpoles. Comparing natural ponds with each other and the pine ponds with each other, our results showed that neither nestedness nor turnover was determinant for beta-diversity. However, when natural ponds were compared with pine ones, we found that the contribution of nestedness was higher for the anurans beta-diversity than turnover. Increases in the nestedness mechanism indicated that the pine occurrence results in species loss in Southern Brazil ponds. Since 90% of its wetland has been already affected, the removal of Pinus in the conservation areas in southern Brazil is important to minimize their impacts on aquatic biodiversity.

   COMPOSITION
AB Rainfall variability remains a major challenge to sustainable grazing management in northern Australia with perennial grasses the key to the stability of the resources that maintain a sustainable grazing industry. This paper describes the dynamics of five perennial grasses - Bothriochloa ewartiana (Domin) C. E. Hubb., Chrysopogon fallax S. T. Blake, Aristida spp., Panicum effusum R. Br. and Heteropogon contortus (L.) P. Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult. in relation to three grazing strategies - moderate stocking at long-term carrying capacity, heavy stocking and rotational wet season spelling. The research was conducted in permanent quadrats on the predominant land type in an extensive grazing study in an Aristida-Bothriochloa pasture in north Australia between 1998 and 2010. Summer rainfall was above average for two periods 1998 2001 and 2008 2010 with drought and below-average rainfall from 2002 to 2007. Low rainfall affected the dynamics of all grasses by reducing survival and basal area through its effect on plant size; this impact was most noticeable for the shorter-lived Aristida spp., P. effusum and H. contortus. The impact of grazing was greatest on the long-lived B. ewartiana and C. fallax; this effect was accentuated by the 2002-07 drought. Heavy grazing during this period further reduced the survival and size of B. ewartiana in comparison with the moderate stocking and rotational spell treatments. In contrast, the survival of C. fallax was reduced in the moderate stocking and rotational spelling treatment during drought, relative to that under heavy grazing. The density of B. ewartiana declined even under moderate grazing and despite two sequences of above-average rainfall because seedling recruitment failed to offset mature plant death. Results from this study emphasised the importance of maintaining the existing populations of key long-lived species such as B. ewartiana through good management. These results also supported the overall findings from the grazing study indicating that stocking at the long-term carrying capacity is sustainable in managing for climate variability.

AB Invasive expansion of Robinia pseudoacacia is a worldwide problem. A method to control existing R. pseudoacacia populations is urgently needed. In addition to plants above the ground, seed banks should be targets for the management of R. pseudoacacia. We targeted an old plantation of R. pseudoacacia and its surroundings in a headwater basin to determine the spatial characteristics of the distribution. We established 49 square plots in which the number of buried seeds and seeds dispersed by wind, and several other related environmental factors were surveyed. The relationship between the spatial extent of seeds dispersed by wind and the distribution of the seed bank was analyzed. Environmental factors that potentially influenced the density of buried seeds were also analyzed. We found that barochory and anemochory were the main factors that contributed to R. pseudoacacia forming seed banks. The greatest factor controlling the density of buried seeds was slope angle; thus, transfer of seeds by rolling is important for the formation of seed banks in headwater basins. From these results, some guidelines for the management of seed banks in headwater basin are presented. First, unnecessary soil disturbance within about a 100-m buffer area around seeding trees should be avoided. Second, plantation soil from gentle slopes should not be applied for revegetation of other locations. In situations where R. pseudoacacia populations are planted on steep slopes near streams, there is a chance that seeds will be carried away and form seed banks at lower or downstream sites.

AB Factors that control variability in energy density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) populations, and the consequences of this variability for growth and fledging mass of Adelie penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) chicks, were investigated using an individual-based energetics model. Lipid content as a function of sex/maturity stage and season was used to calculate the energy density of krill ingested by chicks. Simulations tested the influence of variability in krill size-class distribution, sex-ratio, length-at-maturity, and the timing of spawning on krill population energy density and penguin chick fledging mass. Of the parameters included in simulations, variability in the timing of krill spawning had the greatest influence on predicted Adelie penguin fledging mass, with fledging mass decreasing from 3.30 to 2.92 kg when peak spawning was shifted from early December to early March. Adelie penguin chicks that fledge from colonies along the western Antarctic Peninsula (wAP) and survive to recruit into the breeding population are 0.117 kg heavier than those that do not survive to breed. Thus, it appears that small differences in fledging mass potentially have significant implications for Adelie penguin chick survivorship. Therefore, the timing of krill spawning may have important consequences for Adelie penguins, and other top-predator species, that may time critical activities to coincide with a period of dependable prey availability with maximum energy density.

AB Marine reserves are widely implemented worldwide to meet both conservation and fisheries management goals. This study examines the efficacy of Philippine marine reserves using meta-analysis by comparing variations in fish density (1) between reserves and adjacent fished reefs (spatial comparison), (2) within reserves before establishment relative to years following the establishment (temporal comparison), and (3) among reserves classified based on size, age, and enforcement capacity. A grand (total) mean of nineteen 22.3 ha coral reef reserves, protected for a mean duration of 8.2 years, were included in the meta-analyses. The overall density of fishes was higher in the reserves compared with the fished reefs and this difference was largely accounted for by exploited fishes. However, the overall density of fishes within the same reserves remained similar from the period before its establishment to several years following its establishment. Only the density of nonexploited fishes increased significantly during years subsequent to the establishment of the reserves. Neither age nor size of reserves correlated with pattern of change in fish density following the establishment of the reserves; however, fish density was consistently higher in larger and older reserves relative to smaller and younger reserves in the spatial comparison. Furthermore, well-enforced reserves had higher density of exploited fishes relative to less-enforced reserves in both spatial and temporal comparisons. In general, the magnitude and trajectory of change in fish density following the establishment of Philippine marine reserves are influenced by (1) functional groups of fishes under consideration, (2) size and age of the reserve, and (3) level of enforcement of the regulatory mechanisms necessary to sustain a marine reserve.

AB Terrigenous inorganic particles delivered during runoff events cause problems of high turbidity in many lakes and reservoirs. A turbidity model, composed of a two-dimensional hydrothermal/transport submodel and a turbidity submodel, is developed and tested for Ashokan Reservoir, New York, that experiences elevated turbidity levels following runoff events. A robotic monitoring network, rapid profiling instrumentation, and individual particle analyses are used to support the modeling, by specifying turbidity loads and in-reservoir patterns and features of the particles that guided representation of settling. The turbidity-causing particles are clay minerals, 1-10 mu m in diameter. The hydrothermal/transport submodel that serves as the physical framework for the overall model, was separately validated for a 13-year period. The turbidity submodel considered three particle-size/settling velocity classes of turbidity, consistent with the independent individual particle characterizations. Robust performance is demonstrated for the overall turbidity model, as it simulates well the wide range of patterns observed in the reservoir and withdrawal, associated with a number of major runoff events from the same 13-year period. The model will be used to support forecasting in the evaluation of management alternatives intended to abate the problem.

AB Life-history theory predicts a trade-off between current and future reproduction, such that long-lived species should not increase their reproductive effort (RE) at a cost to their own survival. In species with long-term pair bonds and biparental care, each parent must balance its reproductive investment against that of its partner. Although the effects of "handicapping" studies on the focal individual are sometimes difficult to interpret, they are a powerful approach for investigating compensatory responses of the partner. In the present experiment, we manipulated flying ability of one parent in long-lived Cape gannets (Morus capensis), thereby indirectly increasing the demands on RE of the unmanipulated partner. Handicapped birds doubled their foraging trip duration and reduced nest attendance. Their partners showed behavioral compensation via increased nest attendance for chicks younger than 30 days and increased foraging trip frequency for older chicks. The behavioral responses of partners did not fully compensate for the reduced care of handicapped adults. For manipulated nests, overall foraging trip frequency was 21% lower, chicks were left unattended at 5 days younger, and their growth and survival was reduced compared with control nests. Handicapped adults lost 10% of their body mass during the experiment, but their partners showed no decrease in body mass. Our results show that long-lived Cape gannets can increase current RE when needed, without negative effects on body condition or survival. The reduced care of one parent was partly compensated for by its partner, and remaining costs were borne by the chick.

AB A lake-wide bloom of the dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella, discovered in Albert Falls Dam in October 2006, exposed a significant ecological change indicative of reduced water quality in this historically mesotrophic reservoir. The spatial distribution of the bloom was examined synoptically in October 2006 and January 2007; these surveys revealed generally higher dinoflagellate densities in inshore reaches of the lake, and especially in the discharge plume of the inflowing Mgeni River. Ceratium totally dominated the phytoplankton assemblage, accounting almost completely for coincident chlorophyll levels, which generally increased with depth to generate a 'deep' chlorophyll maximum. Vertical oxygen profiles during the bloom differed substantially from corresponding profiles during non-bloom conditions historically typical in this reservoir. Direct count data and ordination analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling exposed marked changes in zooplankton community structure compared to seasonally congruent non-bloom conditions in other years. Changes included the effective replacement of Moina by Bosmina, substantial reductions in Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia, and smaller but definite increases in abundance especially of calanoid copepods, as well as cyclopoid copepods and of Chaoborus, although not all of these differences were apparent in both survey months. These compositional changes are attributable to intrinsic differences in feeding biology among taxa and their associated susceptibility to the altered food environment, which was commensurate with Ceratium's emergence. In addition, chydorid cladocerans appeared as a new (but spatially restricted) eutrophic bio-indicator component of the zooplankton, and the species diversity of cyclopoid copepods was enriched.
   The historical incidence of Ceratium in the lake since 1995 coincided with low NO3-N:TP values (used here as an N:P ratio proxy), particularly of inflow waters, and with broadly coincident values in the open lake. Ceratium was present but sparse in 1995, at average N:P ratios around 5.5. It disappeared in 1996 when the ratio increased radically to >10, and reappeared in 2004 after an erratic decline of the ratio to < 5 in the lake. The decline in N:P ratio of inflow waters since 1996 was clearly associated with a consistent rise in TP levels in inflows, most plausibly attributable to inputs of (Howick) wastewater treatment (WWT) plant origin. The appearance of Ceratium blooms is accordingly related to progressive elevations in mean annual P concentrations in inflows from similar to 40 mu g/l in 1995 to 120 mu g/l in 2007 (broadly mirrored in annual I'll loadings), suggesting that improved operational efficiency (and capacity) of the WWT plant offers a plausible prospect for mitigation and reversal.

AB Understanding changes in hydrological characteristics of rangeland ecosystems with degradation is essential when making rangeland management decisions in and and semi-arid areas to ensure sustainable animal production. The impact of rangeland degradation on root production, root/shoot ratio and water-use efficiency was therefore determined for a semi-arid rangeland, over a 7-year period (1999/00 to 2005/06 growing seasons).
   Water-use efficiency (WUE) is defined as the quantity of above- and/or belowground phytomass produced over a certain period of time per unit of water evapotranspired. Sampling was from rangeland artificially maintained in three different rangeland conditions, viz. good, moderate and poor.
   As much as 86, 89 and 94% of the roots for rangelands in good, moderate and poor conditions, respectively, occurred at a depth of less than 300 mm. Root mass was strongly seasonal with the most active growth taking place during March and April. Root mass appears to be greater than aboveground phytomass for this semi-arid area, with an increase in roots in relation to aboveground phytomass production with rangeland degradation. The mean monthly root/shoot ratios for rangelands in good, moderate and poor conditions were 1.16, 1.11 and 1.37, respectively. Rangeland degradation significantly lowered above- and belowground phytomass production as well as the water-use efficiency. The mean WUE (root production included) were 4.79, 3.54 and 2.47 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for rangelands in good, moderate and poor conditions, respectively. These water-use efficiency observations are among the few also including root production in its calculation. As a proportion of annual phytomass, litter fall of 7.17. 4.64 and 3.41% was obtained for rangelands in good, moderate and poor conditions, respectively. Increasing rangeland degradation increased the replacement of total root system by about 10 months and decomposition time of litter by 6 months.
   The importance of a well-established root system for sustainable production in the semi-arid rangelands cannot be overemphasized. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increases in woody plant densities in savanna grazing lands worldwide have resulted in a decline in the grazing, capacity of these rangelands. At present. the actual cause of the problem is unknown although a vast body of literature deals with various aspects relevant to the issue.
   It is generally assumed, however. that the changes in the tree : grass ratio are a response to changes in soil-water development brought about by rangeland utilization. These utilization patterns differ from those under which the savanna system evolved. While changes in physiognomy are very prominent. these are generally preceded by changes in grass species assemblage.
   The development of species composition has been used as an indicator of rangeland condition for many years; the increase or decrease of individual species is considered in this context. Thus far. however, the shift from perennial to annual grasses has not been evaluated for its effect on soil moisture development, and subsequent implications for woody plant establishment and growth.
   The review presented here consolidates the existing information in order to provide a basis for understanding the woody weed encroachment problem. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons. Ltd.

AB The territorial gardening limpet Scutellastra cochlear occurs along the south and southern west coasts of South Africa, whereas one of its primary food items, the encrusting coralline alga Spongites yendoi, extends much farther north along the West Coast. A combined analysis of geographic variation in limpet grazing frequency and a limpet-manipulation experiment was used to study the interaction between the limpet and its coralline food. The coralline comprised most (c. 85%) of the limpet's diet whereas fleshy algae from the limpet's garden comprised c. 7%. Grazing caused the thallus of the coralline to be thin and smooth; in the absence of herbivory, or under low grazing frequencies, the crust became thick and highly protuberant. Grazing weakened the coralline's interference (overgrowth) competitive ability and also reduced its fecundity. In spite of these two apparently negative impacts, the intimate herbivore coralline association between S. cochlear and S. yendoi showed characteristics of a facultative mutualism. Grazing by S. cochlear reduces the coralline's thallus thickness and consequently increased its lateral margin extension rate. Thinner forms of the coralline grew five times faster than thicker forms. An increased lateral growth results in the thinner form of the coralline being very abundant on the south and southern west coasts, occupying as much as 79% of the substratum in the lower eulittoral zone. Thinner forms of S. yendoi were also less burrowed by boring organisms and more strongly attached than thicker forms of the coralline. Grazing by S. cochlear has thus conferred the advantages of faster lateral growth (i.e. success at exploitation competition) and stronger attachment. The coralline and fleshy algae from the limpet's garden were equally high in organic content on a volume basis. This suggests that the crude food value per bite in the coralline and fleshy algae is comparable. This study has shown that incompletely overlapping distributions between strongly interacting species along a broad geographical gradient is not just a significant feature of the ecology of terrestrial, but also of marine ecosystems.

AB Setting aside forest land is practiced globally and is of vital importance to the preservation of forest biodiversity. As detailed species inventories rarely precede the establishment of set-asides, empirical studies on the species content of different set-aside types are needed, in order to evaluate their conservation relevance and to design efficient conservation strategies. Here, we compared the biodiversity value per unit area of three types of set-asides, common in boreal Europe: nature reserves, key habitats and retention groups on clear-cuts, and we also included old managed forests as reference sites. We surveyed bryophytes on all substrates and lichens growing on spruce in spruce-dominated forests in middle boreal Sweden and in total 252 bryophytes and 176 lichens were found. For bryophytes the number of species, as well as the number of red-listed species, per unit area was higher in key habitats than in retention groups and old managed forests, while intermediate in nature reserves. As the complementarity between areas was greatest in key habitats, the total number of bryophyte species found was by far the highest in this set-aside type. For lichens the patterns were similar but the differences much less pronounced. Site selection methods based on linear programming demonstrated that key habitats also played the most important role in representing the surveyed taxa effectively but that the value of nature reserves increased when multiple representations of each species were required. The study shows that the richness and composition of bryophytes and lichens differ between the three set-aside types and consequently, the outcome of large-scale conservation strategies based on anyone type would be different. At present, key habitats stand out as core areas of high diversity in the forest landscape but it is important also to acknowledge the temporal dynamics of the forest landscape and how the capacity of each set-aside type to host species can be expected to change over time.

AB Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), Tanzania, contains renowned wildlife, an expanding human population, and cultivation by Maasai agro-pastoralists and non-Maasai agriculturalists. We used integrated assessments to explore some effects of cultivation on livestock, resident wildlife, and people. Using a Landsat image from 2000, we mapped 3,967 ha [9,803 acres (ac)] of cultivation within NCA, or 39.7 km(2) of the 8,283 km(2) conservation area. Using integrative ecosystem (Savanna) and household (PHEWS) models, we assessed effects of: up to 50,000 ac (20,234 ha) of cultivation; cultivation concentrated into two blocks totaling 10,000 ac (4,047 ha) and 20,000 ac (8,094 ha) that may be more palatable to tourists; and human population growth. Simulations with from 10,000 to 50,000 ac in cultivation showed no large changes in ungulate populations relative to there being no cultivation. When cultivation was altered to be in two blocks, some wildlife populations changed (<= 15%) and ungulate biomass remained the same. When cultivation was increased linearly with human population, poor households needed 25% of their diets to come from relief as populations tripled, because livestock could not increase significantly. Our results indicate that having < 1% of NCA in cultivation, in its current distribution, is not overly detrimental to wildlife or livestock populations, and is important to Maasai well-being.

AB There has been much recent interest in the extent to which marine planktonic larvae connect local populations demographically and genetically. Uncertainties about the true extent of larval dispersal have impeded our understanding of the ecology and evolution of marine species as well as our attempts to effectively manage marine populations. Because direct measurements of larval movements are difficult, genetic markers have often been used for indirect measurements of gene flow among marine populations. Here we examine data from allozymes, mitochondrial DNA sequences, and microsatellite length polymorphisms to assess the extent of gene flow among populations of the burrowing crustacean Callichirus islagrande. All three types of markers revealed a genetic break between populations separated by the Louisiana Chenier Plain. The extent of mitochondrial sequence divergence across this break indicates that the nominal species, C. islagrande, consists of at least two lineages that have been reproductively isolated for about a million years. Within the eastern lineage microsatellite allele frequencies were significantly heterogeneous among populations as little as 10 km apart. Maximum likelihood estimates of gene flow and effective population size based on a coalescent model for the microsatellite data indicated that local populations are nearly closed. A model-based clustering method identified four or five groups from the microsatellite data, although individuals sampled from each location generally consisted of mixtures of these groups. This suggests a mechanism that would lead to genetic differentiation of open populations: gene flow from different source populations that are themselves genetically distinct.

AB 1. Ephemeral wetland habitats provide a useful model system for studying how life-history patterns enable populations to persist despite high environmental variation. One important life-history trait of both plants and crustaceans in such habitats involves hatching/germination of only some of the eggs/seeds at any time. This bet-hedging leads to the development of a bank composed of dormant propagules of many ages.
   2. The San Diego fairy shrimp, Branchinecta sandiegonensis (Crustacea: Anostraca), a dominant faunal element of ephemeral ponds in San Diego, California, is a suitable organism for studying the consequences of highly fluctuating environmental conditions. As a result of large-scale habitat loss, the species is also endangered, and this motivated our specific study towards understanding the hatching dynamics of its egg bank for planning conservation efforts such as pool restoration and re-creation.
   3. We formulated a matrix population model using egg age within the bank to study the relationship between adult survival and reproduction, and survival in and hatching from the egg bank. As vital rates for fairy shrimp are only poorly known, we generated 48 matrices with parameters encompassing ranges of likely values for the vital rates of B. sandiegonensis. We calculated population growth rates and eigenvalue elasticities both for a static model and a model with periodic reproductive failure.
   4. The model shows that in good filling events, population growth rate is very high and the egg bank is increased dramatically. While population growth rate is insensitive to long-term survival in the egg bank in our static deterministic model, it becomes sensitive to survival in the egg bank when a regime of periodically failed reproductive events is imposed.
   5. Under favourable conditions, it was best for shrimp to hatch from eggs as soon as possible. However, under a regime where failed reproductive events were common, it was best to hatch after several pool fillings. Because conditions change from favourable to unfavourable unpredictably, variation in age within the egg bank appears to be critical for the persistence of the population. This attribute needs to be carefully considered when restoring or creating new pools for conservation purposes.

AB Traits that promote rapid growth and seedling recruitment when water is plentiful may become a liability when seedlings encounter drought. We tested the hypothesis that CO2 enrichment reinforces any tradeoff between growth rate and drought tolerance by exaggerating interspecific differences in maximum relative growth rate (RGR) and survivorship of drought among seedlings of five woody legumes. We studied invasive species of grasslands that differ in distribution along a rainfall gradient. Survivorship of drought at ambient CO2 concentration ([CO2]) was negatively related to RGR in well-watered seedlings in one of two experiments, but the relationship was weak because interspecific differences in RGR were small. Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no significant relationship among well-watered seedlings between RGR at ambient [CO2] and either the relative or absolute increase in RGR at elevated [CO2]. As predicted, however, CO2 enrichment reinforced interspecific differences in survivorship of seedlings exposed to similar rates of soil water depletion. Doubling [CO2] improved seedling survivorship of the most drought-tolerant species throughout the period of soil water depletion, but did not consistently affect survivorship of more drought-sensitive species. Midday xylem pressure potentials of drought-treated seedlings were less negative at elevated [CO2] than at ambient [CO2], but no other measured trait was consistently correlated with improved survivorship at high [CO2]. Carbon dioxide enrichment may not reinforce species differences in RGR, but could exaggerate interspecific differences in drought tolerance. To the extent that seedling persistence in grasslands correlates with drought survivorship, our results indicate a Positive effect Of CO2 enrichment on recruitment of woody legumes that are currently tolerant of drought.

AB We investigated the effect of hatching date on chick body condition, chick survival, post-fledging survival and eventual breeding performance as an adult (laying date and clutch volume) of Great Skuas in Foula (Shetland). In 10 out of 16 years there was a seasonal decline in chick body condition. In the remaining years, there was no detectable effect of hatching date on chick condition. Differences among years were statistically significant. Chicks in early broods survived better than late-hatched chicks in four years, and no trend could be detected in one year. Annual variation in the seasonal pattern of chick growth and survival, and of adult territorial attendance, suggests that environmental conditions play a role in determining the seasonal decline in performance. Post-fledging survival in relation to hatching date was studied by analysis of ringing recoveries. Hatching date affected post-fledging survival, but only in the first year of life. Breeding parameters of birds of known hatching date were studied when they came back to breed in Foula. Hatching dale of an individual did not affect its laying date or volume of the clutches laid later in life. This suggests that laying dale has a low heritability, or none at all. Birds that laid early in the season produced more future recruits than later birds. After an early breeding attempt, skuas had a higher overwinter survival probability than after a late season. These results suggest that laying date is an indicator of individual quality in skuas, in the sense that early birds apparently are more competent at gathering resources for reproduction and survival.

AB The effects on zooplankton community structure of P loading and two different kinds of suspended sediments were tested in a small lake. Limnocorrals were used in a complete, triplicated, six-treatment-block design. Treatments were loading with P, kaolinitic clay (K), K + P, montmorillonitic clay (M), and M + P plus a control without additions. P fertilization caused blooms of blue-green bacteria and resulted in reductions of the dominant copepod (Diaptomus mississippiensis) and cladocerans (Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Bosmina longirostris, and Ceriodaphnia reticulata), while causing a 5-fold increase in rotifers (mostly Keratella cochlearis). Zooplankton in the K and K + P treatments were similar to the control, but cladoceran species other than Diaphanosoma were reduced. M was more detrimental to zooplankton than K, causing a 10-fold decrease for all crustaceans. We attribute this in part to lower algal densities in the M treatment. Simultaneous P loading mitigated the effects of M on Diaphanosoma, rotifers, and copepods and may involve a transfer loop in which dissolved organic C adsorbed on clay becomes available to filter-feeding zooplankton. The effects of mineral turbidity apparently cascaded up the food chain, with both kinds of clays reducing densities of Chaoborus larvae.

AB Post-embryonic durations of Tropodiaptomus spectabilis (Kiefer) and Metadiaptomus colonialis (van Douwe) were determined at 20-degrees-C in laboratory factorial experiments involving four algal food enrichment levels (0, 100, 500 and 2500-mu-g l-1 C of Selenastrum added to 20-mu-m filtered water from respective source-lakes) and three suspended sediment levels (filtered, natural, and 2- to 3-fold sediment-enriched lake water).  Food effects (30, 75, 225 and 600-mu-g l-1 C of Scenedesmus) were tested alone at 20-degrees-C for Metadiaptomus meridianus (van Douwe).  Total naupliar (D(n)) and total copepodid (D(c)) development times [summed to give total post-embryonic duration (D(t))] and metasome lengths at maturity were measured.  In all taxa, food supply maximally affected D(c) values 2- to 3-fold, whereas its maximal influence on D(n) values was relatively slight (generally approximately 25%).  The measured effect of food supply on D(t) was as strong as the predicted influence of temperature over an appropriate annual range.  Food supply influenced size at maturity, and probably thereby fecundity, thus exerting additional demographic influences.  Sediment effects were inconsistent, and quantitatively weaker than food effects.  Total development of T. spectabilis was approximately 20% faster, and that of M. colonialis approximately 15% slower in sediment-enriched than in natural sediment level treatments; contrasting baseline sediment levels (2-3 times higher for the latter species) and different enrichment procedures confound interpretation.  Unexpectedly, and inexplicably, development almost invariably failed in sediment-free water, implying an apparent dependency on inorganic particles in these taxa.  This contrasts with the generally adverse influences of high sediment concentrations upon zooplankton.  Minimal male and female D(t) values at 20-degrees-C were comparable and significantly longer in M. colonialis (15.5 and 17.7 days) and M. meridianus (16.5 and 21.5 days) than in T. spectabilis (11.7 and 12.2 days).  These differences in duration are ecologically incongruous in relation to expected r - K life history strategies of genera characteristic of temporary or semi-permanent waters and permanent waters respectively.

AB Microplastics are eaten by many invertebrates, particularly filter-feeding organisms like mussels. Since microplastics can be retained in the digestive system for extended periods, there is ample opportunity for them to interact with the functions of digestive enzymes. This study determined how the polymer type, size and concentration of ingested spherical microplastics affects the activities of seven key digestive enzymes in the digestive gland of Mytilus galloprovincialis, a common marine mussel. Polymer type significantly affected the activities of carbohydrase enzymes: polystyrene reduced amylase and xylanase activities, and increased cellulase activity. High concentrations of microplastics (5 x 10(4) microplastics L-1) caused a 2.5-fold increase in total protease activity. The activities of laminarinase, lipases and lipolytic esterases were unaffected by the polymer type, size or concentration of microplastics. Microplastics-induced changes to digestive enzyme activities can affect mussels' ability to acquire energy from food and reduce their energy reserves. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The effect of different feed rations on the productive performance and bacterial composition of the intestine of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) reared using biofloc technology (BFT), in addition to water quality and the bacterial composition of the biofloc, was evaluated. During a 4-month period, five feed rations were evaluated: B-100, complete feed ration; B-90, 10% reduction; B-80, 20% reduction; B-70, 30% reduction; and B-60, 40% reduction, and a control group (C) supplied with clean water and a full feed ration. Each treatment was evaluated in triplicate. Fish were stocked into 18 circular tanks (3.14 m(3)) at a density of 50 tilapia/m(3) per tank. At the end of the study, water samples and sections of fish intestine were taken. Colony-forming units (CFU) were counted on a plaque, and bacterial identification was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction, amplifying the 16S rRNA gene. All treatments exhibited good water quality throughout the study. Seventeen different species of bacteria were encountered in water and 15 species of bacteria were identified in the intestine of the tilapias. Treatments B-70 and B-60 were exhibited the highest number of bacteria recorded in water and intestine. The productive performance of Nile tilapia of treatment groups B-100, B-90, and B-80 was similar to C. The results indicate that during tilapia cultivation using BFT, it is possible to reduce the feed ration by 20% without apparent damage to the health and productive performance of Nile tilapia. The bacteria contribute to the maintenance of growth and survival of Nile tilapia by acting as a probiotic.

AB The transition from natural habitat to agricultural land use is widely regarded as one of the leading drivers of biodiversity loss. Despite this, most wildlife still lives outside protected areas on private agricultural land, particularly on rangeland used for livestock grazing. Understanding which species persist and which decline in agricultural landscapes is important for global biodiversity monitoring, management and conservation. In this study, we used hierarchical multi-species occupancy modelling to estimate terrestrial vertebrate (body mass > 0.5 kg) richness in the Karoo, a semi-arid region of South Africa. We evaluated species-specific responses to different anthropogenic and environmental variables in rangeland and a nearby protected area of similar size. We grouped mammal species according to trophic guild and body size and compared their occurrence between areas. In total we detected 42 species over 4035 6-day pooled trap nights across 322 sites. Community species richness was not significantly different between the two types of land use and decreased with increasing elevation in the protected area. Human disturbance did not affect individual species occupancy in either area. Carnivores, omnivores and medium-sized species occupancy probabilities were similar between the two areas but were higher for herbivores and large species in the protected area and for insectivores and small species in rangeland. Our results reveal that drylands in the South African Karoo region, including rangeland used for small-livestock fanning, support a diverse community of terrestrial vertebrates. Private landowners are thus important custodians of key components of indigenous biodiversity outside of protected areas, especially in low-lying areas.

AB From the 1980's, Indonesian shrimp production has continuously increased through a large expansion of cultured areas and an intensification of the production. As consequences of diseases and environmental degradations linked to this development, there are currently 250,000 ha of abandoned ponds in Indonesia. To implement effective procedure to undertake appropriate aquaculture ecosystem assessment and monitoring, an integrated indicator based on four criteria using very high spatial optical satellite images, has been developed to discriminate active from abandoned ponds. These criteria were: presence of water, aerator, feeding bridge and vegetation. This indicator has then been applied to the Perancak estuary, a production area in decline, to highlight the abandonment dynamic between 2001 and 2015. Two risk factors that could contribute to explain dynamics of abandonment were identified: climate conditions and pond locations within the estuary, suggesting that a spatial approach should be integrated in planning processes to operationalize pond rehabilitation.

AB Aim: Information about the importance of propagule pressure and habitat invasibility in invasion success of dispersal-limited species is scarce. We aimed to assess invasiveness of Quercus rubra within stands of 14 tree species, and the effects of distance from propagule source on invasion success, to highlight limiting factors for further application in nature conservation.
   Location: Siemianice Experimental Forest-a common garden forest experiment with 14 tree species, western Poland.
   Methods: We investigated aboveground biomass, leaf area index and density of Q. rubra natural regeneration within 53 experimental plots, as well as distance from the seed source. We also analysed light availability changes between 2005 and 2015 on plots of each tree species. We used multiple linear regression and variable importance to quantify the effect of each factor.
   Results: All factors tested influenced ecological success of Q. rubra. Invasion success decreased with increasing distance from the seed source and decreasing light availability and was higher within stands of pioneer tree species. Leaf area index depended mostly on tree stand species, density depended on distance from the propagule source and biomass depended on both. Light availability explained 7.2%-30.2% of the variance; tree species-from 36.1% to 57.4%; and distance from the propagule source-from 12.4% to 56.7%.
   Main conclusions: Tree stand species, light availability and distance from the propagule source influence ecological success of invasive Q. rubra, displaying their importance for spread of this species. These factors are controllable in forest/conservation management and may be used to prevent Q. rubra invasion. Planting late-successional tree species that cast dense shade, maintaining canopy closure and removing fruiting trees from surrounding more invasible stands may prevent Q. rubra invasion.

AB To reduce the negative impacts of invasive plants, management interventions such as control or eradication are usually necessary. It is often assumed that the impacts of invasive plants will diminish immediately after such interventions. However, in some cases the invader can have legacy effects in the soil that might persist for long periods, preventing the natural restoration of the areas managed. Therefore, to achieve the re-establishment of a functional native ecosystem it is important to understand for how long such legacies can persist in the soil. This paper explores this issue, using Acacia saligna in South Africa as case study. We collected soil samples in invaded, non-invaded and previously invaded sites (representing 2, 6 and 10years after clearing) and analysed the levels of pH, carbon, nitrogen, available phosphorus, ammonium, nitrate and electrical conductivity. We also analysed enzyme activities (-1,4-glucosidase, urease and acid phosphatase). Acacia saligna invasion alters overall soil characteristics but specifically raises pH by 0.6-1.8. Moreover, soil characteristics (e.g. pH) are not restored to natural conditions after control (soil legacy effects persist up to 10years after clearing). Furthermore, A.saligna control elevates soil NO3- levels and these can remain higher than in invaded (1.55-6.67mgkg(-1)) and non-invaded (2.16-4.35mgkg(-1)) sites up to 10years after clearing. Elevated NO3- often facilitates secondary invasion and/or weedy native species dominance which may hinder the restoration of functional native ecosystems. Therefore, strategies to manage areas previously invaded by A.saligna should take into account the removal of litter from the target invader, secondary invaders and weedy native species.

AB Plastic is ubiquitous in global oceans and constitutes a newly available habitat for surface-associated bacterial assemblages. Microplastics (plastic particles <5 mm) are especially susceptible to ingestion by marine organisms, as the size of these particles makes them available also to lower trophic levels. Because many marine invertebrates harbour potential pathogens in their guts, we investigated whether bacterial assemblages on polystyrene are selectively modified during their passage through the gut of the lugworm Arenicola marina and are subsequently able to develop pathogenic biofilms. We also examined whether polystyrene acts as a vector for gut biofilm assemblages after subsequent incubation of the egested particles in seawater. Our results showed that after passage through the digestive tract of A. marina, the bacterial assemblages on polystyrene particles and reference glass beads became more similar, harbouring common sediment bacteria. By contrast, only in the presence of polystyrene the potential symbiont Amphritea atiantica was enriched in the investigated biofilms, faeces, and water. Thus, especially in areas of high polystyrene contamination, this polymer may impact the bacterial composition of different habitats, with as yet unknown consequences for the respective ecosystems.

AB Long-term shifts in environmental conditions driven by climate change are predicted to persistently modify the distribution of a multitude of species. These range shifts can have significant effects on the functioning of ecological communities. Ocean warming along the southeast coast of Australia has seen a polewards shift in the distribution of the long-spined sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii. Barren areas formed by the destructive overgrazing of kelp beds by invading C. rodgersii are associated with a dramatic loss of habitat, species diversity and productivity. The ongoing range expansion of C. rodgersii will further increase sea urchin densities along the south eastern coast of Tasmania, where 'incipient' barrens have started to appear. As restoration of sea urchin barrens over a large-scale is costly and hard to achieve, effective management needs to focus on preventing further formation of extensive barrens. This study examines whether systematic culling of C. rodgersii in spatially discrete areas is effective to control their abundance. We show that systematic culling was highly effective in significantly reducing the mean density and aggregation of urchins in a discrete area which persisted for at least 12 months. Notably, there was no significant difference in the reduction of urchin density and aggregation when plots were culled twice rather than once. There was however an edge effect indicating a slow incursion of urchins back into the treatment plots. We also show that divers follow a classic prey-predator interaction with culling efficiency increasing with urchin density. Ultimately our results demonstrate that systematic culling is an effective method for controlling urchin abundance in discrete areas. The high cost and logistical constraints limit the application of a culling programme over large areas of reef. Culling, therefore, needs to be considered along with other management measures to control the effects of overgrazing by urchins over large scales.

AB Ammonia volatilized from penguin rookeries is a major nitrogen source in Antarctic coastal terrestrial ecosystems. However, the spatial extent of ammonia dispersion from rookeries and its impacts have not been quantified previously. We measured ammonia concentration in air and lichen ecophysiological response variables proximate to an AdSlie penguin rookery at Cape Hallett, northern Victoria Land. Ammonia emitted from the rookery was N-15-enriched (delta N-15 value +6.9) and concentrations in air ranged from 36-75 A mu g m(-3) at the rookery centre to 0.05 A mu g m(-3) at a distance of 15.3 km. delta N-15 values and rates of phosphomonoesterase (PME) activity in the lichens Usnea sphacelata and Umbilicaria decussata were strongly negatively related to distance from the rookery and PME activity was positively related to thallus N:P mass ratio. In contrast, the lichen Xanthomendoza borealis, which is largely restricted to within an area 0.5 km from the rookery perimeter, had high N, P and N-15 concentrations but low PME activity suggesting that nutrient scavenging capacity is suppressed in highly eutrophicated sites. An ammonia dispersion model indicates that ammonia concentrations sufficient to significantly elevate PME activity and delta N-15 values (a parts per thousand yen0.1 A mu g NH3 m(-3)) occurred over c. 40-300 km(2) surrounding the rookery suggesting that penguin rookeries potentially can generate large spatial impact zones. In a general linear model NH3 concentration and lichen species identity were found to account for 72 % of variation in the putative proportion of lichen thallus N originating from penguin derived NH3. The results provide evidence of large scale impact of N transfer from a marine to an N-limited terrestrial ecosystem.

AB Phylogenetic diversity (PD) is a measure of biodiversity based on the evolutionary history of species. Here, we discuss several optimization problems related to the use of PD, and the more general measure split diversity (SD), in conservation prioritization. Depending on the conservation goal and the information available about species, one can construct optimization routines that incorporate various conservation constraints. We demonstrate how this information can be used to select sets of species for conservation action. Specifically, we discuss the use of species' geographic distributions, the choice of candidates under economic pressure, and the use of predator-prey interactions between the species in a community to define viability constraints. Despite such optimization problems falling into the area of NP hard problems, it is possible to solve them in a reasonable amount of time using integer programming. We apply integer linear programming to a variety of models for conservation prioritization that incorporate the SD measure. We exemplarily show the results for two data sets: the Cape region of South Africa and a Caribbean coral reef community. Finally, we provide user-friendly software at .

AB We investigated dissolved methane distributions along a 6 km transect crossing active seep sites at 40 m water depth in the central North Sea. These investigations were done under conditions of thermal stratification in summer (July 2013) and homogenous water column in winter (January 2014). Dissolved methane accumulated below the seasonal thermocline in summer with a median concentration of 390 nM, whereas during winter, methane concentrations were typically much lower (median concentration of 22 nM). High-resolution methane analysis using an underwater mass-spectrometer confirmed our summer results and was used to document prevailing stratification over the tidal cycle. We contrast estimates of methane oxidation rates (from 0.1 to 4.0nM day(-1)) using the traditional approach scaled to methane concentrations with microbial turnover time values and suggest that the scaling to concentration may obscure the ecosystem microbial activity when comparing systems with different methane concentrations. Our measured and averaged rate constants (k') were on the order of 0.01 day(-1), equivalent to a turnover time of 100 days, even when summer stratification led to enhanced methane concentrations in the bottom water. Consistent with these observations, we could not detect known methanotrophs and pmoA genes in water samples collected during both seasons. Estimated methane fluxes indicate that horizontal transport is the dominant process dispersing the methane plume. During periods of high wind speed (winter), more methane is lost to the atmosphere than oxidized in the water. Microbial oxidation seems of minor importance throughout the year.

AB The king scallop (Pecten maximus) is one of the most important benthic species of the English Channel as it constitutes the first fishery in terms of landings in this area. To support strategies of spatial fishery management, we develop a high-resolution biophysical model to study scallop dispersal in two bays along the French coasts of the English Channel (i.e. the bay of Saint-Brieuc and the bay of Seine) and to quantify the relative roles of local hydrodynamic processes, temperature-dependent planktonic larval duration (PLD) and active swimming behaviour (SB). The two bays are chosen for three reasons: (1) the distribution of the scallop stocks in these areas is well known from annual scallop stock surveys, (2) these two bays harbour important fisheries and (3) scallops in these two areas present some differences in terms of reproductive cycle and spawning duration. The English Channel currents and temperature are simulated for 10 years (2000-2010) with the MARS-3D code and then used by the Lagrangian module of MARS-3D to model the transport. Results were analysed in terms of larval distribution at settlement and connectivity rates. While larval transport in the two bays depended both on the tidal residual circulation and the wind-induced currents, the relative role of these two hydrodynamic processes varied among bays. In the bay of Saint-Brieuc, the main patterns of larval dispersal were due to tides, the wind being only a source of variability in the extent of larval patch and the local retention rate. Conversely, in the bay of Seine, wind-induced currents altered both the direction and the extent of larval transport. The main effect of a variable PLD in relation to the thermal history of each larva was to reduce the spread of dispersal and consequently increase the local retention by about 10 % on average. Although swimming behaviour could influence larval dispersal during the first days of the PLD when larvae are mainly located in surface waters, it has a minor role on larval distribution at settlement and retention rates. The analysis of the connectivity between subpopulations within each bay allows identifying the main sources of larvae which depend on both the characteristics of local hydrodynamics and the spatial heterogeneity in the reproductive outputs.

AB The management of fisheries resources in the northwestern Mediterranean is traditionally centralized and developed within the framework of coastal states and European Union common policies. In general, it has not been sufficiently effective in reversing the declining situation of fisheries resources and fishers in this region. This paper discusses the feasibility of moving away from a top-down approach in fisheries management towards a more participative and convergent mode of governance in the region. More specifically, the study focuses on MPAs as a fisheries management tool and evaluates their current establishment and management system in the French Mediterranean as a case study for the region. A brief review of the experiences on fisheries and MPA management in the Philippines is also presented to obtain insights on bottom-up and collaborative management approaches. Finally, possible opportunities for adopting a more decentralized and coordinated approach in fisheries management within the French socio-political system, and possibly in the northwestern Mediterranean region, are discussed. These include the existence of fishing community organizations in the region, such as the prud'homies in France and cofradias in Spain, starting with management strategies that are simpler to enforce and more acceptable to direct users, e.g., fishery reserves, and exploring co-management arrangements to manage fisheries at ecologically meaningful but operationally manageable scales as has been proposed by some development organizations. However, effective changes in the system would require major national policy and institutional reforms, social preparation and organizational strengthening which would take time and resources.

AB Groundwater-dependent vegetation (GDV) must have access to groundwater to maintain their growth and function. GDV distribution patterns are an important issue in arid vegetation ecology. Using groundwater attributes to explore the distribution patterns of GDV have been very limited. In this article, we selected the Ejina Desert Oasis as an area to investigate GDV and groundwater attributes. Twenty plant species and 31 plant plots of data were collected. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) was performed to determine GDV types. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) were performed to analyse the relationships between GDV and groundwater attributes. The results indicated that (1) six plant community types were classified by TWINSPAN; (2) DCA ordination analyses showed that the groundwater depth (Dep) was the main factor restricting the distribution patterns of GDV, and the distribution of the dominant species and corresponding vegetation types had strong similarities; (3) in the DCCA diagram, the first axis represented variations of Dep, while the second axis was related to the pH values; (4) with increased Dep, the community types made the transition from I to VI; and (5) the DCCA diagram was similar to the DCA. However, the distribution patterns of GDV were more compact in the DCCA, while the DCA showed that each association group appeared within a limited range and had a clear border against other communities. This study shows that ordination methods can be used to explain the relationships between the distribution patterns of GDV and groundwater attributes. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Acacia saligna is a species complex that has become invasive in a number of countries worldwide where it has caused substantial environmental and economic impacts. Understanding genetic and other factors contributing to its success may allow managers to limit future invasions of closely related species. We used three molecular markers to compare the introduced range (South Africa) to the native range (Western Australia). Nuclear markers showed that invasive populations are divergent from native populations and most closely related to a cultivated population in Western Australia. We also found incongruence between nuclear and chloroplast data that, together with the long history of cultivation of the species, suggest that introgressive hybridization (coupled with chloroplast capture) may have occurred within A.similar to saligna. While we could not definitively prove introgression, the genetic distance between cultivated and native A.similar to saligna populations was comparable to known interspecific divergences among other Acacia species. Therefore, cultivation, multiple large-scale introductions and possibly introgressive hybridization have rapidly given rise to the divergent genetic entity present in South Africa. This may explain the known global variation in invasiveness and inaccuracy of native bioclimatic models in predicting potential distributions.

AB The Nkuhlu large-scale long-term exclusion experiment in Kruger National Park was designed to study the long-term effects of large herbivores on vegetation. One treatment excludes elephants, another excludes all herbivores larger than hares and another one comprises an open, control area. Vegetation monitoring was implemented in 2002 when a baseline survey was conducted prior to exclusion. Monitoring was repeated 5 years after exclusion. Data from the surveys were analysed to establish how structure and composition of woody vegetation had changed 5 years after herbivore exclusion. The analysis showed that neither plant assemblage nor mean vegetation height had changed significantly since exclusion. However, both species richness and density of woody plants increased 5 years after exclusion of all large herbivores, but not after the exclusion of elephants alone. One already common species, Dichrostachys cinerea, became more common after excluding all large herbivores compared with either no exclusion or elephant exclusion, possibly leading to competitive suppression of other species. Species other than D. cinerea tended to either increase or decrease in density, but the changes were insufficient to induce significant shifts in the overall assemblage of woody plants. The results indicate that after 5 years of exclusion, the combined assemblage of large herbivores, and not elephants alone, could induce changes in species richness and abundances of woody plants, but the effect was so far insufficient to induce measureable shifts in the assemblages of woody plants. It is possible that assemblages will change with time and increasing elephant numbers may amplify future changes.

AB We assessed by numerical modeling the coastal fish larval dispersion along the southern coast of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, NW Mediterranean) with the objective of determining the factors that contribute to successful recruitment. We assumed that fish larvae dispersal is mainly regulated by physical transport. Currents are mainly wind driven in this area; therefore, changes in wind forcing have a first-order impact on larval transport. The synoptic wind patterns were systematically analyzed based on self-organizing map analysis. The wind fields were clustered using a neural network pattern recognition approach into two modes, producing opposite along-shelf flow. The seasonal changes between spring and summer in the dominance of either mode modulate the along-shelf circulation, producing flow shifts under some circumstances. This variability in the wind regime was consistent throughout the 10 years analyzed (20002009). Using the Princeton Ocean Model (POM) and a particle-tracking algorithm, we analyzed the effect of wind-forced currents in the connectivity among near-shore habitats. We show that, at the spatial scale considered, the coastal morphology and stochastic wind forcing favor local recruitment (mean of 30% self-recruitment). Maximum transport distances of 2030 km were typically associated with particles left to drift for 21 days. The implications for the performance of the four marine protected areas near SW Mallorca Island are discussed. Our results suggest that, although wind episodes determine the fate of short-time spawning events, on a seasonal basis, regular larval supply to coastal zones is ensured by wind stochasticity.

AB Understanding animal abundances and population trends is a fundamental goal of ecology. The aim of this study was to examine local ecological knowledge (LEK) held by local people bordering the northern Gonarezhou National Park (GNP), Zimbabwe, concerning domestic and wild animal species abundances and perceived population trends, in order to evaluate the possible contribution of LEK to wildlife conservation and management. Data were collected through interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire from 236 local people in communities adjacent to the northern GNP from December 2010 to May 2011. The results show that perceptions of domestic animal population trends were mixed, with 44% of the respondents perceiving an increase, 36% perceiving a decline, and 20% perceiving that domestic animal populations had remained the same between 2000 and 2010. Furthermore, about 76% of the respondents perceived that wild animal abundances had increased, 15% perceived a decline, and 9% perceived that wild animal abundances had remained the same in GNP between 2000 and 2010. Responses on perceptions of animal population trends were to a great extent in line with recorded population trends from conventional scientific studies. The study results suggest that LEK may serve as a valuable source of ecological information and could compliment scientific information for wildlife conservation and management, particularly in community-based natural resources management programmes.

AB One potential means of promoting diversity in restoration is to use microtopographic features to increase habitat heterogeneity and concentrate resources. In this study, small mounds of sand or topsoil mix were constructed. We hypothesized that these features would improve the establishment and survival of seeded prairie plants. After the first growing season both seeded and total (seeded plus unseeded) plant density/m2 were greater on the mound features than other areas, although, in subsequent years, these differences were erased or reversed. Grass (seeded plus unseeded) density/m2, however, was always larger on the mounded features. Position within the mound also affected plant community development; the base, followed by the top, improved both seeded and total plant density. Mound aspect also interacted with year; the lee and windward sides had similar seeded species richness in the first and third field seasons, but during the second year the lee side had higher seeded species richness and seeded plant density. Grasses (seeded plus unseeded) were also denser on the lee side of the mound in the second year. Finally, the material of the mound created differences in the community response. Sand mounds supported a greater proportion of seeded to total plant density compared with the topsoil mounds. There was also a larger proportion of grasses to total plant density on the sand mounds. This topographic heterogeneity plays an important role in improving the development of both temporal and spatial vegetation variability in grassland restoration.

AB Conversion of natural habitats to human settlements creates an alternative habitat with different bio-physical characteristics such as micro-climatic conditions and resource availability. Deserts are especially sensitive to such effects due to generally low nutrient levels and water availability. Gardens in human settlements in the desert are often a main source of alien plant species that provide ample foraging resources year round. These changes in floral composition and availability may alter pollinator community composition and foraging behaviour, as well as pollination network characteristics. We investigated the effects of desert gardening on pollinator communities and pollination networks in the Jordan Rift Valley (Israel), an arid agro-natural landscape south of the Dead Sea. We studied seasonal diversity patterns of plants and wild bees in natural habitats and in gardens in settlements. Wild bees and blooming plants were sampled from February to July in 2007 and in 2008. We constructed plant pollinator networks and compared bee communities between the two habitat types along the season. We found that bee abundance was greater in the gardens, and that rarefied bee species richness was greater in the natural habitat. Bee species richness and abundance exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns between habitats. Bee community composition also differed greatly between habitats, and species in the gardens had a generally wider geographical range in comparison to species in the natural habitat. We also found a higher level of generalisation of the pollination network in the gardens compared to the natural habitat, which may indicate a response to a disturbed and unstable environment. We conclude that gardening in deserts although promoting overall bee abundance, negatively affects species richness and changes community composition and network characteristics, with possible implications on the composition of native flora in the natural habitat surrounding the gardens.

TI Declining Orangutan Encounter Rates from Wallace to the Present Suggest
   the Species Was Once More Abundant
SO PLOS ONE

   QUALITY
AB Background: Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) currently occur at low densities and seeing a wild one is a rare event. Compared to present low encounter rates of orangutans, it is striking how many orangutan each day historic collectors like Alfred Russel Wallace were able to shoot continuously over weeks or even months. Does that indicate that some 150 years ago encounter rates with orangutans, or their densities, were higher than now?
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We test this hypothesis by quantifying encounter rates obtained from hunting accounts, museum collections, and recent field studies, and analysing whether there is a declining trend over time. Logistic regression analyses of our data support such a decline on Borneo between the mid-19th century and the present. Even when controlled for variation in the size of survey and hunting teams and the durations of expeditions, mean daily encounter rates appear to have declined about 6-fold in areas with little or no forest disturbance.
   Conclusions/Significance: This finding has potential consequences for our understanding of orangutans, because it suggests that Bornean orangutans once occurred at higher densities. We explore potential explanations-habitat loss and degradation, hunting, and disease-and conclude that hunting fits the observed patterns best. This suggests that hunting has been underestimated as a key causal factor of orangutan density and distribution, and that species population declines have been more severe than previously estimated based on habitat loss only. Our findings may require us to rethink the biology of orangutans, with much of our ecological understanding possibly being based on field studies of animals living at lower densities than they did historically. Our approach of quantifying species encounter rates from historic data demonstrates that this method can yield valuable information about the ecology and population density of species in the past, providing new insight into species' conservation needs.

AB Our study presents experimentally based results on how large herbivore species affect savanna vegetation and thus murid rodents in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We permanently excluded groups of large herbivore guilds of various body sizes (ranging from white rhino to hares) from sixteen 40 x 40-m plots of vegetation by using different fence types. We determined grass species composition and vegetation height and collected capture-mark-recapture data on murid rodents. Nutrient concentrations of the dominant grass species and rodent diet compositions were analysed. We found that herbivore species of different body sizes had different effects on murid rodents. The exclusion of medium-sized herbivores, such as warthog, impala and nyala increased the abundance of high-quality grass species, especially Panicum maximum. However, the dominant rodent species Lemniscomys rosalia preferred the most abundant grass species, rather than high-quality grasses. The absence of large bulk feeders, such as zebra, buffalo and white rhino led to an increase in vegetation height. In response. tall vegetation promoted both rodent abundance and species diversity and altered rodent species composition. Ultimately, our results indicate that the greatest effect on murid rodents came from the reduction of vegetation cover by large bulk feeders, which likely increased rodent predation risk.

TI Spoor density as a measure of true density of a known population of
   free-ranging wild cheetah in Botswana
SO JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY

DT Article

ID COUNTS; IDENTIFICATION; INDEXES; PARK
AB Knowledge of the abundance of animal populations is essential for their management and conservation. Determining reliable measures of abundance is, however, difficult, especially with wide-ranging species such as cheetah Acinonyx jubatus. This study generated a correction factor to calculate true cheetah density from spoor survey data and subsequently tested its accuracy using the following season's data. Data were collected from October 2005 to December 2006 on a known population of wild, free-ranging cheetah in the Jwana Game Reserve, Botswana. The cheetahs in the area were captured, tagged and photographed. The reserve was divided into twelve 9 km transects covering all vegetation types and prey densities. The total sampling distance was 8226 km, with a spoor density of 2.32 individual cheetah spoor per 100 km(2). To determine a precise and accurate spoor density, it was necessary to sample for a longer period during the dry season (April-September) than during the wet season (October-March). This difference may be due to cheetah behavioural changes with seasonal variations in habitat and prey. The true density was 5.23 cheetahs per 100 km(2) ranging from 3.33 to 7.78 at the low and high points of the population, respectively. A positive linear correlation between spoor and true density was observed. This relationship differed in the wet and dry season and required refinement with the following season's data. Correction factors may be viable, but require further testing taking the behavioural responses to seasonal, habitat and prey variations into consideration.

AB A new frog species of the genus Cardioglossa, that is probably restricted to less than 10 km(2) of gallery forest near the summit of Mount Manengouba in the Republic of Cameroon, is described. Unlike all other Cardioglossa, in life the coloration of the new species is typically brownish red, with no dorsal markings, but with a pair of thin, golden white lines that extend posteriorly from the tip of the rostrum and terminate just above and behind the tympanum. This new species is morphologically similar to C. oreas, another high-altitude species endemic to the Cameroonian mountains: both have small tympana and lack the hypertrophied third manual digit typical of males of other Cardioglossa. The tadpole of the new species is similar to that of C. occidentalis, the only other Cardioglossa for which the tadpole is fully described, but differs in having a broad anterolaterally projecting supraoral labium, lacking ventral pigmentation, and having a relatively longer spiracular tube. Several features of tadpole morphology are convergent with the unusual fossorial tadpole of the microhylid Otophryne and suggest a similar convergence in ecology. Principal components analysis of morphometric data, followed by discriminant function analysis, was used to explore patterns of morphological similarity within Cardioglossa. These analyses provide support for five species groups: (1) C. aureoli (distinct from other Cardioglossa); (2) C. escalerae, C. gratiosa and C. nigromaculata; (3) C. gracilis, C. melanogaster and C. schioetzi; (4) C. sp. nov. and C. oreas; and (5) C. cyaneospila, C. pulchra, C. venusta and C. trifasciata. The inclusion of C. cyaneospila in the last group supports previous suggestions of past biotic connections between the Albertine Rift mountains and those of the Cameroon Volcanic Line. The description of this new species further emphasizes Mt Manengouba as a centre of anuran endemism within the Cameroonian mountains and reaffirms the importance of this ecoregion within sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Woody plant invasions, either of alien or indigenous species. are deemed to result in loss of ecosystem goods and services in many areas throughout the world, resulting in significant degradation and economic costs. Invasion of Euryops floribundus, a species indigenous to South Africa, is perceived to have reduced the grazing available for domestic livestock. Consequently, a programme of manual eradication has been implemented to improve I he grazing resource and provide jobs for poverty alleviation. However. there is potential for a conflict of interest as our study shows that almost all households rely on Euryops for fuel and at times fencing material, whereas only a minority of households own livestock. Moreover. comparison of invaded and non-invaded sites indicated that the invaded sites harbour greater plant species richness and higher grass culm density per unit area of grass cover, as well as higher forb and litter cover. While invaded sites had lower grass cover, overall plant cover was no different between invaded and non-invaded sites. Multivariate analysis indicated no obvious differentiation in community composition between invaded and non-invaded areas, suggesting stronger drivers of community composition other than Euryops invasion presumed to be facilitated by the effects of high livestock densities. Overall. Our study suggests that the clearing operation may well benefit from a better understanding of the social needs, perceptions of degradation by the various stakeholders and ecological dynamics of the area, especially local reliance on the resources, and the dynamics of the invasion, particularly its extent, rate of spread and Susceptibility for re-invasion in the cleared areas.

AB The effects of marine reserve protection on the density, size, biomass, sex-ratio and overall assemblage structure of reef fishes were investigated at Kingston Reef Sanctuary, Rottnest Island, Western Australia. Significant trends in response to reserve protection were found for two species of top predators and several serially protogynous labrid species. The relative density and biomass of the heavily targeted Glaucosoma hebraicum was 10 and five times greater within the sanctuary respectively. Similarly, the biomass of the serranid, Epinephelides armatus, was 3.2 times greater in the sanctuary, although this difference was owing to a greater mean length not relative density. The male : female sex ratio for the labrid, Ophthalmolepis lineolatus, was significantly different between sanctuary and non-sanctuary sites, with the density of male O. lineolatus significantly greater within the sanctuary. Rottnest Island waters are largely restricted to recreational fishing, therefore these results suggest that a range of fish species around Rottnest Island are affected by recreational fishing, and that these effects are found in taxa beyond the primary target species. The patterns in the effects on bycatch species suggest that fishing-related mortality may be exerting a greater control on these populations than that exerted by natural predation.

AB Many theories of consumer control of communities have come from studies conducted in relatively benign, temperate zone rocky intertidal systems. Here, we examine gastropod grazing and the maintenance of bare space on a dry, wind-swept rocky shore of Patagonia, Argentina. Two limpet species are the primary intertidal grazers. Siphonaria lessoni dominates mid and high intertidal zones, while Nacella magellanica dominates the lower zone. In all zones, limpet densities are positively correlated with bare space and the occurrence of cracks. Tethering experiments revealed that: (1) physical stress sets the upper distribution limit of both limpets, (2) predators, such as oyster catchers, regulate Nacella populations and may restrict them to cracks and vertical surfaces, and (3) desiccation stress appears to drive similar crack distribution patterns of Siphonaria in the upper intertidal. Experimental removal of limpets in each intertidal zone indicated that limpets have: (1) no detectable effect in the high intertidal where physical forces dominate community organization, (2) weak impacts at mid-elevations as grazing only limited the abundance of fleshy algae with physical forces again dominating community structure, and (3) relatively stronger, but still weak impacts in the low zone. These results suggest that grazing impacts on Argentine rocky shores are weak in comparison to the physical stresses (e.g. high winds, low humidity) that largely determine structure in this system. The dominance of physical forcing in this system occurs despite having similar grazer densities to other temperate, but comparatively wet, rocky shorelines (e.g. British Isles) where top-down control is strong.

AB Many mechanisms have been suggested to explain the coexistence of woody species and grasses in savannas, yet, evidence from field studies and simulation models has been mixed. Shrub encroachment is an ecological and economic problem in savannas worldwide which generally is attributed to overgrazing. Patch-dynamics is a new mechanism explaining tree-grass coexistence and the natural occurrence of shrub encroachment in savannas. A patch-dynamic savanna consists of patches in which cyclical succession between grassy and woody dominance proceeds spatially asynchronously. The spatially explicit, individual-based patch-scale simulation model SATCHMO was developed to investigate cyclical succession in the paradigm of patch-dynamics for and and semi-arid savannas. SATCHMO is designed to capture within-patch shrub population dynamics based on a grid of 51 In side length and a resolution of 10 cm. The model shrub characteristics were derived from Acacia mellifera, the main encroaching species in African savannas. The aim of SATCHMO is to give a detailed small-scale understanding of above- and belowground growth, competition, and mortality of savanna woody plants and the influence of precipitation and fire on patch transition frequencies, shrub growth rates, and shrub size frequencies. With SATCHMO, we want to identify the conditions leading to cyclical successions in general and shrub encroachment in particular. Soil moisture is the most important parameter in SATCHMO influencing growth, reproduction, and mortality of shrubs and grass tufts, and that mediates competition. To acknowledge the importance of belowground interactions in savannas, shrub root growth and competition are modelled spatially explicitly. The model output was successfully validated with morphometrical and spatial data from the field site in the South African Kalahari thornveld and with recent literature data on savanna woody species cover. Global sensitivity analysis with Latin hypercube sampling shows that soil moisture is the most important driver of shrub cover dynamics in semi-arid savannas. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB Early recognition of plant invaders has been widely identified as the key to their successful management and yet too often species are only noticed and receive adequate attention once they have become widespread and control has become difficult and costly. Slow growing species are at particular risk of being overlooked, despite their ability to cause significant ecological damage. One such species, Pinus radiata (Monterey pine), has spread from large commercial plantations into native vegetation across the southern hemisphere. Here we review the status of P. radiata invasion in Australia, a country where the species has successfully naturalized but remains an invader of only low-level concern. Patterns of spread in Australia mirror those in New Zealand and South Africa, two countries where invasive pines are considered major threats to biodiversity. While many areas adjacent to plantations remain free from invasion, dense infestations have occurred at several sites in areas of high conservation value demanding the implementation of adequate control measures. Expansion of Australia's plantation estate and increasing human disturbance of natural areas surrounding plantations will increase the likelihood and extent of invasion. Continued monitoring of wildling populations will determine the ability of pines to dominate native eucalypt forest and will provide insight into broader ideas of community invasibility.

SO AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL

DT Article
ID GROWTH; RATES
AB Leaf phenology in a population of the climbing fern Lvgodium venustum was observed during a 31-month period in Veracruz, Mexico. The study site is located 100-200 m from the Gulf coast in the understory of a semideciduous lowland forest dominated by trees of Enterolobium and Ficus. Four leaf parameters: leaf growth of main and secondary axes, number of living leaves, leaf production and leaf mortality were scored monthly and correlated with two climatic factors: monthly mean temperature and precipitation. Sixty percent of the 37 individuals were supported on lianas, dead wood or shrubs. Smaller, unsupported plants with a height of less than 2.5 m had a mean number of 1.9 +/- 0.27 leaves and produced 3.7 +/- 0.52 leaves per year and did not become fertile. Over 50% of the leaves died within the first 3 months, whereas over 10% lived for 12 to 30 months. resulting in a mean leaf life span of 5.6 +/- 0.7 months. All leaf parameters were seasonal with the exception of the gowth of the main axes. During the rainy season, leaf growth of secondary axes arid leaf mortality increased approximately threefold and leaf production rose twofold. Correlations between climatic factors and leaf parameters were strongest within a time lag of one month. The strongest correlation was found between precipitation arid the growth of secondary axes, indicating that water is the limiting factor. One to five dormant buds developed on 17.7% of the leaves contributing to 40.3% of the total leaf growth. The potentially life span of the climbing leaves and the outgrowing dormant buds make this species a successful pioneer in disturbed vegetation and a competitive weed in Mexican vanilla plantations.

AB Although sympatric character divergence between closely related species has been described in a wide variety of taxa, the evolutionary processes responsible for generating these patterns are difficult to identify. One hypothesis that can explain sympatric differences is ecological character displacement: the sympatric origin of morphologically divergent phenotypes in response to selection caused by interspecific competition. Alternatively, populations may adapt to different conditions in allopatry, with sympatric distributions evolving through selective colonization and proliferation of ecologically compatible phenotypes. In this study, I characterize geographic variation within two sibling species of rocky-shore gastropods that have partially overlapping distributions in central California. In sympatry, both Nucella emarginata and N. ostrina show significant differences in shell shape and shell ornamentation that together suggest that where the two species co-exist, divergent phenotypes arose as an evolutionary consequence of competition. To examine the evolutionary origins of divergent characters in. sympatry, I used a comparative method based on spatial autocorrelation to remove the portion of the phenotypic variance among populations that is explained by genetic distance (using mitochondrial DNA sequences and allozyme frequency data). Because the remaining portion of the phenotypic variance represents the independent divergence of individual populations, a significant sympatric difference in the corrected dataset provides evidence of true character displacement: significant sympatric character evolution that is independent of population history. After removal of genetic distance effects in Nucella, shell shape differences remain statistically significant in N. emarginata, providing evidence of significant sympatric character divergence. However, for external shell ornamentation in both species and shell shape in N. ostrina, the significance of sympatric differences is lost in the corrected dataset, indicating that colonization events and gene flow have played important roles in the evolutionary history of character divergence in sympatry. Although the absence of a widely dispersing planktonic larva in the life cycle of Nucella will promote local adaptation, the results here indicate that once advantageous traits arise, demographic processes, such as recurrent gene flow between established populations and extinction and recolonization, are important factors contributing to the geographic pattern of sympatric character divergence.

ID NITROGEN SATURATION
AB To evaluate the effects of avian-derived N deposition on forest C and N status, we investigated quantity and quality of litterfall, and chemical quality and N transformations in the forest floor from five sites that had been exposed to waterbird breeding colonies to differing degrees. The highest litterfall input of 2.6 t ha(-1) month(-1) was observed in the forest stand (Site 2) where intense bird breeding activity had been observed. Litterfall C/N was highest at the control site (no breeding activity) and decreased as the colonization stages advanced. Nitrogen concentration in litterfall and the forest floor was higher at those sites (Sites 3 and 4) where bird breeding had ceased and which represented the 'post-colony' situation, and consequently C/N and lignin/N of forest floor decreased. NH4-N pool size in the forest floor was higher at Site 2, probably due to ongoing input and mineralization of bird excreta. Nitrification rate and percent nitrification were highest at Sites 3 and 4. From these results we conclude that study sites exposed to bird colonies show signs of N excess even after colonies are abandoned.

AB White-crowned Pigeons (Columba leucocephala) varied their timing of breeding and nesting intensity in response to variation in production of the four most important fruit species in their breeding-season diet in the upper Florida Keys. From 1988 through 1990, we monitored fruit production year-round in five habitats in which pigeons foraged and monitored all pigeon nests along two transects on Middle Butternut Key. Annually, pigeon breeding was positively correlated with summer rains and with the peak in overall fruit production However, within the breeding season, only the availability of Metopium toxiferum was positively correlated with rainfall and the number of new clutches initiated. Bath the timing and magnitude of breeding varied annually. In 1988, when Metopium was more available, more pigeons nested, the nesting season started earlier and lasted longer, and a large peak in nesting occurred when Metopium fruit ripened. During 1989 and 1990, when the relative availability of Metopium was lower, fewer pigeons nested, the nesting season was shorter, and the seasonal peak in nesting associated with Metopium fruit was reduced or absent. Nesting patterns did not appear to vary with changes in the relative availability of other fruits. White-crowned Pigeons appear to prefer Metopium fruits to other species. Because pigeons do not supplement nestling diets with arthropods, but augment their diets with protein-rich crop milk, they may depend on lipid-rich fruits such as Metopium to provide the energy for breeding and crop-milk production. Metopium fruit production may be influenced by rainfall and climatic conditions, both of which may Vary spatially within the range of White-crowned Pigeons in Florida. Evidence that pigeons shift foraging sites when Metopium availability varies emphasizes the need to preserve large tracts of seasonal deciduous forest in the Keys and to protect Metopium trees in suburban areas where they are removed because they cause contact dermatitis in humans.

AB Over a 3 year period, selected sites in three categories of rangeland - good, moderate and poor - were subjected to varying levels of frequency and intensity of defoliation. Three watering regimes - normal, below-normal and above-normal - were applied. The effects of defoliation and levels of soil water were evaluated in terms of the production of above-ground phytomass and water-use efficiency (WUE) in relation to evapo-transpiration (Et). For all treatments, rangeland in good condition (RC1) produced significantly more phytomass (p less than or equal to 0.01) and used water more efficiently (p less than or equal to 0.01) than those in moderate and poor condition (RC2 and 3). High intensity/high frequency defoliation caused a significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) increase in phytomass production and WUE, under conditions of high soil water availability. Generally, rangeland condition in interaction with the soil water content are the main determinants of optimal production and WUE. Statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.01) linear relationships between phytomass production and Et were determined for all rangeland conditions and defoliation treatments. In degraded rangeland, water is used inefficiently regardless of the quantity of water received. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB The body weights of badgers were examined to look for density-dependent effects of the increase in group size at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire. The weight of badgers in 21 groups were studied from 1978-1993. A significant negative relationship was found between weight and group size in breeding adult females in autumn and winter, and adult males in summer, such that increase in group size caused a decrease in weight. However, these relationships were affected by year-to-year changes and random variation, and overall there was no downward trend in body weight. The existence of density-dependent effects on badger populations at high density was consistent with previous findings.

ID NATIONAL-PARK; AVAILABILITY; PREDATORS; LEOPARD; PEOPLE; FOOD
AB Ecological factors influencing prey selection and prey removal by tigers (Panthera tigris) during the dry season were investigated in the Karnali floodplain in the southwestern part of Royal Bardia National Park, Nepal, between 1990 and 1994. Densities of large herbivore prey were estimated by line transects. Density of tigers was estimated from individual track features. Tiger diet was determined by analyses of seats (feces). Selection of prey species was inferred by comparing observed counts of seats to hypothesized seat frequencies generated from prey density estimates. Prey removal by tigers was estimated from the estimated food requirement of the tigers in the study area and the estimated biomass of the different prey species. Three species (axis deer (Axis axis), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and hog deer (Axis porcinus) comprised more than 90 % of the biomass killed. Larger and reportedly more optimum sized prey species like nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and barasingha (Cervus duvauceli) were not preferentially eaten, probably due to their low densities. Contrary to the predictions that tiger predation would be non-selective on medium and smaller sized prey if availability of large prey was limited, the Kamali tigers showed significant selectivity among the medium sized prey species : wild boar was preferred, whereas barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak) was under-represented in the diet. Total removal of available ungulate prey biomass was low (3,1 %) compared to other studies, indicating that the relatively dense tiger population was regulated through social behaviour rather than by food. Predation by tiger did not appear to play a major role in regulating the densities of wild herbivores, except nilgai. In spite of high biomass and diversity of prey, leopard (Panthera pardus) was seemingly displaced to the periphery of the park, suggesting that interspecific predation rather than food competition excluded coexistence with tigers.

AB The feeding behaviour of Egyptian mongooses, Herpestes ichneumon, was studied in south-western Spain. Diet was analyzed from 428 faeces collected in three spatially independent areas of Donana National Park and frequency of occurrence of the most consumed prey (N = 12) was compared with available data on relative abundance in the field for each area and season (dry and wet). Independently for each area, these prey species were consumed by mongooses in the seasons when they were most abundant, except for two cases. In one of them the availability of the mongooses' prey was probably greater during the season of lower prey abundance. Comparing between areas, prey species were consumed more frequently in the area or areas where they were more abundant in all cases where analyses were possible. Results indicated that mongooses behave as opportunistic predators at Donana, consuming the most abundant prey in each area and season.

AB In the rocky intertidal of western North America species found on rocks also live on the shells of the mussel Mytilus californianus Conrad. Since at most sites the mid-intertidal zone contains both rocks and mussels, organisms face a choice of which substratum to live upon. Because the two substrata differ in physical characteristics, and biological interactions could differ on the two substrata, it may be better to live on one substratum than the other.
   Comparisons of population dynamics of three species common on both substrata revealed that while growth and reproductive status were not affected by the type of substratum, both survivorship and recruitment were higher on mussels. Therefore, this suggests that it is better to live on mussels. However, due to the spatial and temporal variability in the conditions which map have contributed to these results, species should retain the ability to live on both substrata.

AB We studied the effects of brood size and chick age on food provisioning rates to Pigeon Guillemot Cepphus columba nests, and differences in growth parameters between chicks in broods of one and broods of two. Provisioning rates increased with chick age in the first part of the nestling period, and then declined. This decline was steeper in 1985, when overall provisioning rates were higher. Per-chick provisioning rates were lower to broods of two, resulting in one of the chicks having a lower growth rate, and possibly a lower fiedging mass, than its sibling. Growth parameters of the faster growing chick in broods of two did not differ significantly from those of solo chicks. The decline in provisioning rate late in the nestling period is probably not due to reduced food availability. It may be due to reduced energetic demands of the chicks or to a deliberate strategy on the parents' behalf to induce fledging. At present we lack the information to distinguish between these two hypotheses.

AB Social-ecological system (SES) resilience involves the large information and complex relationships of nature, society and economy. To promote multi-disciplinary integration to jointly balance current well-being and long-term sustainability, it is necessary to sort resilience studies on different perspectives into a comprehensive framework to establish interdisciplinary consensus. Based on literature analysis and review, this paper presents an analytical framework for resilience in regional management, and gives a review of SES resilience studies in terms of mechanism, assessment, and management. We outline the current state of resilience research, identify the remaining challenges, and make key recommendations for future research. Our recommendations include promoting interdisciplinary consensus, emphasising dynamic adaptation processes, synthesizing multiple systems and scales, building comprehensive databases, and using mixed methods approach. The paper offers a framework for researchers, practitioners and policy makers to have a more comprehensive understanding of resilience as a whole, and thus helps navigate more fully the challenge of adapting complex resource and environmental problems.

AB Legalized trade in commercially farmed wildlife products is sometimes promoted as a conservation strategy. In theory, flooding the market with cheaper or better quality products will decrease the profitability of poaching. Bear bile is highly sought-after for use in traditional medicine and overhunting to supply the demand for bear parts has led to declining populations across South-east Asia. Bear bile farming was established to help supply the high demand for bear bile. In Viet Nam it is legal to keep registered bears, but illegal to extract or sell bear bile. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 66 bear bile farmers in Viet Nam to examine the conservation implications of bear bile farming. The results show that demand for wild bear bile was not satisfied by the widespread availability of farmed bear bile. Farmers report a strong consumer preference and willingness to pay more for wild-sourced products. The existence of bear bile farms presents considerable challenges to law enforcement. The results suggest that bear bile farming in Viet Nam relies on restocking from wild populations, and farmers openly admit to extracting and selling bear bile, in clear violation of national legislation. The case of bear bile farming in Viet Nam provides an example of wildlife farming failing to reduce pressure on a once widely distributed and relatively abundant species. Research into consumer values, attitudes and behaviours will help to improve understanding of market drivers and help inform the design of effective species conservation and management strategies.

AB Grasslands are among the most imperilled biomes of the world. Identifying the most appropriate framework for restoring grasslands is dependent on the objectives of restoration, which is inherently determined by human priorities. Debates over the appropriate conservation model for grasslands have often focused on which species of herbivores should be the focus of restoration efforts. Here we discuss three perspectives of herbivore-based conservation in North American grasslands. First, the Pleistocene rewilding perspective is based upon the idea that early humans contributed to the demise of megafauna that were important to the evolution and development of many of North America's grasslands; therefore, their aim of restoration is rewilding of landscapes to pre-human times. Second, the bison rewilding perspective considers American bison a keystone herbivore that is culturally and ecologically important to North American grasslands. A third perspective focuses on restoring the pattern and processes of herbivory on grasslands and is less concerned about which herbivore is introduced to the landscape. We evaluate each of these three conservation perspectives in terms of a framework that includes a human domain, an herbivore domain and a biophysical domain. While all conservation perspectives partly address the three domains, they all fall short in key areas. Specifically, they fail to recognize that past, current and future humans are intimately linked to grassland patterns and processes and will continue to play a role in structuring grasslands. Furthermore, these perspectives seem to only superficially consider the role of fragmentation and climate change in influencing grassland patterns and processes. As such, we argue that future grassland conservation efforts must depend on the development of a model that better integrates societal, economic and policy objectives and recognizes climate change, fragmentation and humans as an integral part of these ecosystems.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Trophic rewilding: consequences for ecosystems under global change'.

AB Grassland, woodland, and forest are three key vegetation types that co-occur across the central highlands of Madagascar, where the woodland has historically been considered as degraded forest. Here, we use grass functional traits to inform our understanding of the biogeography of Malagasy vegetation and the differentiation of vegetation types in the region. We sampled grass community composition at 56 sites across the central highlands of Madagascar spanning grassland, woodland, and forest. We selected seven functional traits known to correlate with different aspects of life history collated via GrassBase (habit, culm type, physiology, leaf consistency, plant height, leaf width, and leaf length) for the 71 constituent species. Via analyses of the beta diversity, rank abundance, functional dispersion, functional group richness, and community phylogenetic structure of grassland communities, we differentiate these vegetation types using plant functional traits. Grassland and woodland are highly similar in grass species composition and dominated by the same species (Loudetia simplex, Trachypogon spicatus, and Schizachyrium sanguineum). In contrast, forest grass species composition significantly differs from both grassland and woodland. Consistent with these species composition patterns, the vegetation types can be distinguished based on physiology, culm type, and leaf consistency. Forests harbor primarily C-3 grasses, which are almost invariably laterally spreading with herbaceous leaves. In contrast, both grassland and woodland species are predominantly tall, caespitose C-4 grasses with coriaceous leaves. Forest grasses are phylogenetically clustered and less diverse than the grassland and woodland communities. Further, we sampled bark thickness of the common woody species occurring in the woodland and forest of the region and found that the relative bark thickness of the woodland tree species was significantly greater than that of forest species from the same genus. We found that the functional traits and architecture of grasses diverge strongly between forest and the grassland-woodland mosaic. We conclude that the woodlands, primarily dominated by Uapaca bojeri Baill., are a form of savanna and not forest as has been previously suggested.

AB QuestionsRecently there have been vital discussions about the validity of the European patch-mosaic conceptual model of forest dynamics - the traditional concept of a shifting patch-mosaic of development stages and phases, also known as the forest cycle concept. Here we try to answer the fundamental questions of this debate: (1) how much do forest dynamics proceed along a predictable path (in a chronological sequence: growthoptimumbreakdown); or (2) vice versa, are the patches rather a result of disturbances and/or other stochastic growth and mortality patterns?
   LocationFive long-term research plots in four different study sites of Central European natural temperate forests.
   MethodsThe long-term evolution of forest development phases was analysed with a GIS-based, spatially explicit, fully reproducible method enabling accurate verification of the functionality of the model forest cycle. We analysed long-term transitions among forest development phases from the 1970s through the 1990s to 2000s. Observed phase-to-phase transitions were compared to a random transition model. We identified preferential pathways within the forest cycle model as well as the proportion of cyclic/acyclic transitions.
   ResultsIn total, across all sites and observation periods, about 65% of all observed phase-to-phase transitions were realized through preferential pathways, about 28% of observed transitions went along pathways of random frequency and only about 7% of observed transitions were realized through uncommon development pathways. On the other hand, less than 40% of all observed transitions might be classified as cyclic (following the model cycle), and thus more than 60% of the transitions were acyclic (moving across or backward in the model cycle). The overall pattern of all observed transitions resembled a complex web rather than a simple repeating cycle.
   ConclusionsAlthough in all sites we documented signs of the cyclic and predictable development anticipated by the forest cycle concept, the predominance and stochastic nature of multiple acyclic development pathways gave rise to reasonable doubts on the legitimacy and usability of the concept for descriptions of forest dynamics. On the other hand, the verification of the concept may contribute significantly to our understanding of the complexity of forest dynamics.

AB In recent decades, high-spatial resolution ocean radar and satellite imagery measurements have revealed a complex tangle of submesoscale filaments and eddies, in the surface velocity, temperature, and chlorophyll a fields. We use a suite of high-resolution data to characterize two counter-rotating, short-lived eddies formed at the front between the warm East Australian Current (EAC) and temperate coastal waters (308S, Eastern Australia). In this region, submesoscale filaments and short-lived eddies are dynamically generated and decay at time scales of hours to days. Dominant cyclonic filaments of O(1) Rossby number formed along frontal jets and eddy boundaries, generating localized ageostrophic circulations at the submesoscale. Measurements of over-ocean wind direction and surface currents from high-frequency radars reveal the influence of the short-term, small-scale wind forcing on the surface circulation, enhancement of the horizontal shear, frontal jet destabilization, and the generation and decay of the cyclonic eddy. By contrast, the anticyclonic eddy formation was most likely associated with EAC mesoscale instability and anticyclonic vorticity. Lagrangian tracks show that surface particles can be temporarily trapped in the eddies and frontal convergent zones, limiting their transport. Mixing between EAC-derived and coastal waters was increased along the frontal regions, and particles starting at the divergent regions around the eddies experienced significant dispersion at submesoscales. The cyclonic cold-core eddy entrained high chlorophyll a shelf waters on its convergent side, suggesting spiral eddy cyclogenesis.

AB This study investigated the autogenic recovery potential of native vegetation after clearing of dense stands of invasive alien trees in two critically endangered vegetation types in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region: Cape Flats Lowland Fynbos and Swartland Alluvium Fynbos. Sampling was done in areas previously occupied by the invasive tree Acacia saligna and plantations of Pinus radiata and in a fynbos reference site. Treatments varied in terms of the length of invasion and management histories.
   Plots previously under pines recovered well in terms of indigenous perennial species richness, but indigenous species cover decreased with increasing number of planting rotations. Areas cleared of acacia recovered poorly in terms of indigenous species cover (after one cycle of invasion), and indigenous species richness exhibited a declining trend with increasing cycles of invasion. Proteoid overstorey was lost in all previously invaded/planted plots and this element will need to be re-introduced to areas after one cycle of invasion regardless of the invasive species. Acacias changed some abiotic variables after two cycles of invasion.
   Follow-up clearing generally promoted better vegetation recovery in terms of overall species richness and structure but care should be taken not to damage indigenous ericoid shrubs. Overall, acacia invasion caused a greater change in biodiversity and vegetation structure than pine plantations. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of SAAB.

AB Invasive plants are hypothesized to have higher fitness in introduced areas due to their release from pathogens and herbivores and the relocation of resources to reproduction. However, few studies have tested this hypothesis in native and introduced regions. A biogeographical approach is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms involved in plant invasions and to detect rapid evolutionary changes in the introduced area. Reproduction was assessed in native and introduced ranges of two invasive Australian woody legumes, Acacia dealbata and A.longifolia. Seed production, pre-dispersal seed predation, seed and elaiosome size and seedling size were assessed in 7-10 populations from both ranges, taking into account the effect of differences in climate. There was a significantly higher percentage of fully developed seeds per pod, a lower proportion of aborted seeds and the absence of pre-dispersal predation in the introduced range for both Acacia species. Acacia longifolia produced more seeds per pod in the invaded range, whereas A.dealbata produced more seeds per tree in the invaded range. Seeds were bigger in the invaded range for both species, and elaiosome: seed ratio was smaller for A.longifolia in the invaded range. Seedlings were also larger in the invaded range, suggesting that the increase in seed size results into greater offspring growth. There were no differences in the climatic conditions of sites occupied by A.longifolia in both regions. Minimum temperature was higher in Portuguese A.dealbata populations, but this difference did not explain the increase in seed production and seed size in the introduced range. It did have, however, a positive effect on the number of pods per tree.Synthesis. Acacia dealbata and A.longifolia escape pre-dispersal predation in the introduced range and display a higher production of fully developed seeds per fruit and bigger seeds. These differences may explain the invasion of both species because they result in an increased seedling growth and the production of abundant soil seedbanks in the introduced area.

AB Pinus contorta, one of the most invasive tree species in the world, has been proposed as a model species for improving our understanding of invasion ecology. In this study, we assessed the impact of P. contorta invasions on the species richness, diversity and species traits of a resident treeless steppe community. In a Pinus contorta invasion gradient (Patagonia, Chile), we surveyed vegetation from high canopy closure pine invasion to treeless steppe, and computed species richness, diversity and Sorensen similarity indexes. For all species, we determined functional trait values from the literature, data bases, and personal observations. Species richness and diversity were related to canopy cover (a proxy for invasion intensity) using generalized linear mixed-effects models. Changes in species traits due to canopy cover were analyzed using RLQ ordination analysis and the fourth-corner analysis. We found that Pinus contorta canopy cover significantly reduced the number of native species by 70 %, implying a strong effect on species exclusion. A few native species, however, prevail in the novel conditions (e.g. Baccharis magellanica, Acaena integerrima). Species traits changed significantly with increasing pine canopy cover, where P. contorta promoted the existence of traits related to shade-tolerance and conservative reproductive strategies. We conclude that the negative impacts of Pinus contorta into the treeless steppe, including a reduction in the number of species and the shifting to traits adapted to tolerate shade and associated with conservative reproductive strategies, can have severe implications for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning where it invades.

AB Community-based management (CBM) could be an essential tool to prevent the depletion of marine resources in the Western Indian Ocean region. In Kenya, political pressure to strengthen local governance, has led to adoption of CBM as a way of reducing over-exploitation and managing the competing uses and impacts on the marine environment. Several communities in Kenya have embraced CBM and have set aside or closed previously fished areas to enhance recovery of fisheries and biodiversity. These community fisheries closures (locally called tengefu), despite being degraded, may recover to finfish abundances and biodiversity levels similar to established MPAs or above thresholds for maintaining some ecological services. Communities see their direct involvement and control of these tengefu as more likely to result in benefits flowing directly to them. Community closures are also important for articulating and resolving community values and strengthening their management capacity. Here, we describe the evolution of the tengefu movement in Kenya and combine information from focus group discussions, interviews, underwater surveys and boundary marking to evaluate the current status, opportunities and challenges facing these tengefu. We show that in some cases community closures suffer from slow and incomplete national and local legislative processes, challenges to compliance, and weak management.

AB A classic question in plant ecology is "why is the world green?" That is, if plants are food for animals why do not animals eat all the available food-changing a 'green world' into a 'brown world'. We first reviewed this question in 2009 and now revisit our arguments in the light of new data and new thinking. Here we argue that (1) the top-down bottom-up dichotomy is probably too simple for understanding a complex system-such as vegetation-rich in feedback processes. (2) Nevertheless it appears that bottom-up processes are generally more important for maintaining the presence of some sort of vegetation while top-down control process are generally more important in determining the type of vegetation at a site. (3) Although this review mainly takes a qualitative and experimental approach to the question, we also argue that simple well-known mathematical models from population ecology can be very informative in thinking about the types of explanations for the green world phenomenon, and demonstrating that it is rarely a simple choice between one form of control or another.

AB Tree species in seasonally dry tropical forests likely vary in their drought-survival mechanisms. Drought-deciduousness, which reduces water loss, and low wood density, which may permit dependence on stored water, are considered key traits. For saplings of six species at two distinct sites, we studied these and two associated traits: the seasonal amount of water released per stem volume ("water released") and the hydraulic capacitance of the stem (C). Two deciduous species with low stem density, Cavanillesia platanifolia and Bursera simaruba, had high C and high dry-season stem water potential (I (stem)), but differed in dry-season water released. C. platanifolia did not use stored water during the dry season whereas B. simaruba, in a drier forest, released stored water. In both, water released was highest while flushing leaves, suggesting that stored water supports leaf flushing. In contrast, two deciduous species with intermediate stem density, Annona hayesii and Genipa americana, had intermediate C, low dry-season I (stem), and high seasonal change in water released. Meanwhile, two evergreen species with intermediate stem density, Cojoba rufescens and Astronium graveolens, had relatively low C, low dry-season I (stem), and intermediate seasonal change in water released. Thus, at least three, distinct stored-water-use strategies were observed. Additionally, bark relative water content (RWC) decreased along with I (stem) during the dry season while xylem RWC did not change, suggesting that bark-stored water buffers I (stem) seasonally. Together these results suggest that seasonal use of stored water and change in I (stem) are associated with functional groups that are characterized by combinations of deciduousness and stem density.

AB Although the savanna biome of South Africa is a major resource for rangeland management, little is known about how differences in rangeland management systems affect soil properties in such biomes. Near to Kuruman, commercial farms have practiced rotational grazing for decades. In communal areas of former homeland Bophuthatswana, similar strategies were used prior to 1994. Nowadays, a continuous grazing system is common. We hypothesized that these changes in management affected soil properties. To test this, we sampled soils at communal and commercial land along a gradient with increasing distance to water points. The results revealed that communal systems with continuous grazing showed enlarged spatial gradients. The soils were depleted in most nutrients close to the water relative to those of commercial systems. In contrast, as the distance to the water increased, the nutrient stocks of these communal systems were higher. Changes in soil nutrient stocks were related to a zone of increased bush encroachment (up to 25%). Specific analyses (phosphorus fractions, particulate organic carbon, delta C-13) confirmed that the soils of the communal grazing systems benefited from the shift of grass-dominated to bush-dominated system with woody Acacia vegetation, while the rangeland degraded in the sense that it lost palatable grass species.

AB We monitored pasture biomass on 20 permanent plots over 35 years to gauge the reliability of rainfall and NDVI as proxy measures of forage shortfalls in a savannah ecosystem. Both proxies are reliable indicators of pasture biomass at the onset of dry periods but fail to predict shortfalls in prolonged dry spells. In contrast, grazing pressure predicts pasture deficits with a high degree of accuracy. Large herbivores play a primary role in determining the severity of pasture deficits and variation across habitats. Grazing pressure also explains oscillations in plant biomass unrelated to rainfall. Plant biomass has declined steadily and biomass per unit of rainfall has fallen by a third, corresponding to a doubling in grazing intensity over the study period. The rising probability of forage deficits fits local pastoral perceptions of an increasing frequency of extreme shortfalls. The decline in forage is linked to sedentarization, range loss and herbivore compression into drought refuges, rather than climate change. The results show that the decline in rangeland productivity and increasing frequency of pasture shortfalls can be ameliorated by better husbandry practices and reinforces the need for ground monitoring to complement remote sensing in forecasting pasture shortfalls.

AB Fine-scale vegetation cover is a common variable used to explain animal occurrence, but we know less about the effects of fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity. Theoretically, fine-scale vegetation heterogeneity is an important driver of biodiversity because it captures the range of resources available in a given area. In this study we investigated how bird species richness and birds grouped by various ecological traits responded to vegetation cover and heterogeneity. We found that both fine-scale vegetation cover (of tall trees, medium-sized trees and shrubs) and heterogeneity (of tall trees, and shrubs) were important predictors of bird richness, but the direction of the response of bird richness to shrub heterogeneity differed between sites with different proportions of tall tree cover. For example, bird richness increased with shrub heterogeneity in sites with high levels of tall tree cover, but declined in sites with low levels of tall tree cover. Our findings indicated that an increase in vegetation heterogeneity will not always result in an increase in resources and niches, and associated higher species richness. We also found birds grouped by traits responded in a predictable way to vegetation heterogeneity. For example, we found small birds benefited from increased shrub heterogeneity supporting the textual discontinuity hypothesis and non-arboreal (ground or shrub) nesting species were associated with high vegetation cover (low heterogeneity). Our results indicated that focusing solely on increasing vegetation cover (e.g. through restoration) may be detrimental to particular animal groups. Findings from this investigation can help guide habitat management for different functional groups of birds.

AB Invasive alien plants (IAPs) are regarded as the leading ecological threat to the recently established Garden Route National Park (GRNP) along the Cape south coast of South Africa. The extensive and long-standing presence of commercial forestry in the region has contributed substantially to the current load of IAPs in the area. The GRNP's fragmented, linear configuration and a multitude of anthropogenic and ecological disturbances in the landscape contribute to its susceptibility to alien plant invasion. In compiling a checklist of alien flora for the park, we recorded 244 species of alien plants in 77 families, of which 58% (141 species) have not been recorded for the region by the Southern African Plant Invaders Atlas. Of the GRNP alien plant species, 9% are casual aliens, 27% naturalised, 59% invasive, and 5% transformers. Among South African National Parks, the GRNP ranks second in terms of alien plant species richness and has the largest proportion of invasives and transformers for those parks where invasion status was recorded. Transformer species in the GRNP are almost exclusively tree species introduced from Australasia >100 years ago for forestry purposes or sand stabilisation. Natural habitat within the park that is most threatened by IAPs is fynbos shrublands and riparian habitat. Our analysis indicates that the pressure of IAPs in the GRNP is escalating. Substantial and sustained management actions will be required to mitigate impacts from alien plant invasions in the GRNP. We identified species posing emerging or escalating threats that require improved control or regulation. (C) 2014 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There is limited information about the effects of cattle grazing to longer-term plant community composition and herbage production following fire in sagebrush steppe. This study evaluated vegetation response to cattle grazing over 7 yr (2007-2013) on burned Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis [Beetle & Young] Welsh) steppe in eastern Oregon. Treatments, replicated four times and applied in a randomized complete block design, included no grazing on burned (nonuse) and unburned (control) sagebrush steppe; and cattle grazing at low (low), moderate (moderate), and high (high) stocking on burned sagebrush steppe. Vegetation dynamics were evaluated by quantifying herbaceous (canopy and basal cover, density, production, reproductive shoot weight) and shrub (canopy cover, density) response variables. Aside from basal cover, herbaceous canopy cover, production, and reproduction were not different among low, moderate, and nonuse treatments. Perennial bunchgrass basal cover was about 25% lower in the low and moderate treatments than the nonuse. Production, reproductive stem weight, and perennial grass basal cover were greater in the low, moderate, and nonuse treatments than the control. The high treatment had lower perennial bunchgrass cover (canopy and basal) and production than other grazed and nonuse treatments. Bunchgrass density remained unchanged in the high treatment, not differing from other treatments, and reproductive effort was comparable to the other treatments, indicating these areas are potentially recoverable by reducing stocking. Cover and production of Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass) did not differ among the grazed and nonuse treatments, though all were greater than the control. Cover and density of A.t. spp. wyomingensis did not differ among the burned grazed and nonuse treatments and were less than the control. We concluded that light to moderate stocking rates are compatible to sustainable grazing of burned sagebrush steppe rangelands.

AB 1. In small fragmented plant populations, reproductive failure due to pollen limitation is often attributed to spatial isolation of individuals. While flowering time has been shown to affect seed set, its role in pollen limited fragmented populations is less understood.
   2. In this study, we quantified near-neighbour distances, flowering phenology, and how they interact to affect seed set in individual plants. We followed the daily flowering phenology of over 2400 heads on over 500 Echinacea angustifolia individuals and quantified the resulting seed set during three consecutive flowering seasons. The study was conducted in an experimental plot where we randomized planting locations to eliminate spatial patterns of mate availability which are common in fragmented populations of Echinacea, a self-incompatible plant.
   3. We found that individual flowering time had a larger and more consistent effect on seed set than did spatial location. Seed set in the earliest flowering plants exceeded seed set in the latest by 46-70% in all three years. The role of spatial isolation, characterized both by individual distance to conspecific plants and by location in the plot, was less consistent and showed a weaker relationship with seed set than did flowering phenology. The most isolated plants set 20-27% less seed than the least isolated plants in 2005-2006 with no difference in 2007.
   4. In one year, we quantified seed set by floret position within a flowering head. We found significant positional effects; however, effects due to flowering time were much greater. These results were more consistent with the pollen limitation hypothesis than the resources limitation hypothesis.
   5. Synthesis. Our results illustrate that flowering time and distance to neighbouring conspecifics can cause reproductive failure in fragmented populations, even in the absence of mate limitation caused by mating incompatibility. These findings suggest that flowering time may be an underappreciated contributor to reproductive failure in small fragmented populations.

AB Plant species are shifting their ranges in response to global climate change, thus intensifying the need to predict such changes accurately. As the environmental requirements controlling plant distribution act differently at each developmental stage, there is a need to acquire a demographic-specific understanding of the factors which determine these distributions. Here we investigated the germination niche of two common savanna species Acacia nigrescens and Colophospermum mopane, with the aims to disentangle the direct and indirect effects of temperature on seed germination and establishment and to explore the impact of higher temperatures on the establishment success of savanna trees. Under laboratory conditions, we used thermal gradient plates to determine the thermal germination niche of both species, and a water stress experiment was conducted on C. mopane to account for water-temperature interactions. Using these data we parameterised a soil-moisture model to determine germination and establishment success under field conditions at current and future temperatures (+4 A degrees C). Based on this model, higher future temperatures will not limit germination directly, but they will reduce the number of germination events by reducing the time window of suitable available soil water. Conversely, warmer conditions will accelerate the rate of radicle extension and increase the frequency of seedling establishment events. An additional advantage of higher temperatures is that fewer seeds will germinate, resulting in slower seed bank depletion when successful seedling establishment events do occur.

AB Knowledge of historical factors associated with biological invasions in a region can help identify source regions, vectors and pathways more likely to originate potential invaders as well as prioritize resource allocation for selective prevention and early detection strategies. In Brazil, little is known about the introduction history of many invasive plant species, and analyses of historical factors associated with invasions are lacking. To fill this gap, I used a dataset of 117 invasive alien plants across 13 habitats in Brazil to identify potential patterns of continent of origin, reason for introduction, and to test the hypotheses that (i) more Eurasian species are invasive in Brazil than species native from other continents, that (ii) more horticultural species are invasive in Brazil than species introduced for other reasons, and that (iii) continent of origin and reason for introduction are associated. I found that significantly more invasive plant species in Brazil are native to Africa and Asia, were introduced for horticulture and forage, and are part of the families Poaceae, Fabaceae, and Pinaceae. I also found a significant association between continent of origin and reason for introduction, with more invasive species than average being African forage grasses and Asian agroforestry or ornamental plants. In conclusion, the results suggest that the current invasive alien flora of Brazil results from the combination of patterns of recent human migration waves and deliberate species introductions for technological and commercial reasons. These results can help prioritize invasive species and vectors in prevention, early detection, and control strategies.

AB Background: No studies have examined the invasion of exotic species used for forestry purposes in the savannas of the Brazilian Amazonia.
   Aims: We investigated the invasion process of Acacia mangium in savanna areas adjacent to large-scale forestry plantations in north-eastern Roraima State, Brazilian Amazonia.
   Methods: A tree inventory to record the presence of all A. mangium and native tree individuals was carried out in of 14 plots (each 50 m in width and 1500 m in length) established at five plantation sites. Biometric measurements were taken for all individuals to identify their structure and maturity. Distance categories were created for determining frequency of occurrence in 100 m sections along the plots for all individuals. Correlations and goodness-of-fit tests for discrete data ordered in categories were applied to verify the occurrence of A. mangium plants in relation to distance from the plantation.
   Results: Individuals of A. mangium were dispersed up to 900 m from the plantation edge 8-9 years after the plantation was established. Although most recorded individuals were in the juvenile stage, reproductive adults were found in two establishment patterns: non-nucleated and nucleated under native tree species. Crown cover of the savanna's most abundant native tree species facilitated the regeneration of A. mangium.
   Conclusions: Planting of A. mangium in Amazonian savannas provides a source of continuous dispersal, and invasion by the species is facilitated by environmental conditions.

AB The isolated uplands of the Australian arid zone are known to provide mesic refuges in an otherwise xeric landscape, and divergent lineages of largely arid zone taxa have persisted in these regions following the onset of Miocene aridification. Geckos of the genus Heteronotia are one such group, and have been the subject of many genetic studies, including H. spelea, a strongly banded form that occurs in the uplands of the Pilbara and Central Ranges regions of the Australian arid zone. Here we assess the systematics of these geckos based on detailed examination of morphological and genetic variation. The H. spelea species complex is a monophyletic lineage to the exclusion of the H. binoei and H. planiceps species complexes. Within the H. spelea complex, our previous studies based on mtDNA and nine nDNA loci found populations from the Central Ranges to be genetically divergent from Pilbara populations. Here we supplement our published molecular data with additional data gathered from central Australian samples. In the spirit of integrative species delimitation, we combine multi-locus, coalescent-based lineage delimitation with extensive morphological analyses to test species boundaries, and we describe the central populations as a new species, H. fasciolatus sp. nov. In addition, within the Pilbara there is strong genetic evidence for three lineages corresponding to northeastern (type), southern, and a large-bodied melanic population isolated in the northwest. Due to its genetic distinctiveness and extreme morphological divergence from all other Heteronotia, we describe the melanic form as a new species, H. atra sp. nov. The northeastern and southern Pilbara populations are morphologically indistinguishable with the exception of a morpho-type in the southeast that has a banding pattern resembling H. planiceps from the northern monsoonal tropics. Pending more extensive analyses, we therefore treat Pilbara H. spelea as a single species with phylogenetic structure and morphological heterogeneity.

AB We herein explore the potential larval dispersal and recruitment patterns of Ruditapes decussatus and Ruditapes philippinarum clams, influenced by larval behavior and hydrodynamics, by means of a particle-tracking model coupled to a hydrodynamic model. The main contribution of this study is that a habitat suitability-based (ENFA, Environmental Niche Factor Analysis) settlement-recruitment submodel was incorporated into the larval dispersal model to simulate settlement behavior and post-settlement mortality. For this purpose, a specific study was carried out in the Bay of Santander (Northern Spain), a well-mixed shallow water estuary where shellfishery of both species is carried out. The model was fed with observed winds, freshwater flows and astronomical tides to obtain predictions during the clams spawning period. Dispersion of larvae from seven spawning zones was tracked, subjected to three-dimensional advection, vertical turbulent diffusion and imposed vertical migration behavior parameterized from existing literature. Three simulation periods (Spring, Summer and Autumn) and two initial releases (spring/neap tide) were combined in six different modeling scenarios. The LARVAHS model proved to be a powerful approach to estimating recruitment success, highlighting the role of habitat suitability, larval swimming behavior, planktonic duration, season (i.e. predominating winds) and spawning ground location on recruitment success together with the effect of the tidal phase at spawning. Moreover, it has proven to be a valuable tool for determining major spawning and nursery grounds and to explore the connectivity between them, having important implications for restoration strategies and shellfisheries as well as aquaculture management.

AB Landscape ecological research about the cultural dimension of ecosystem services remains less developed as compared to other aspects of ecosystem services about landscapes. In this article, the cultural dimension of ecosystem services is defined as the psychological, cultural, and social relationships that influence people's connections to biodiversity and landscapes as well as to what benefits they consider useful and relevant. Yet to meet the challenge of understanding sustainability in different landscapes, such as urban ones, research about ecosystem services in landscape ecology will need to shift its emphasis towards the scale of people's experience of landscapes. As a means to improve this situation, cultivating deep care is proposed as a key concept to better integrate the cultural dimension of ecosystem services into landscape ecological research about urban landscapes. Cultivating deep care is defined as the adaptive process for deepening people's affinity of urban nature including enhancing people's appreciation, awareness, and actions for biodiversity, landscapes, and their own well-being that will ultimately benefit ecosystem services. The heart of this article is a conceptual framework that begins to outline the scope and boundaries of cultivating deep care as a key concept and connects it to its intellectual context that includes research such as landscape sustainability, landscape perception, resilience science, and ecosystem services. An important assumption is that cultivating deep care is a "work in progress," which will grow and evolve over time as new knowledge is contributed to it. In the conceptual framework, several principles explore and flesh important ideas and relationships about cultivating deep care as a key concept. Each principle is organized around three parts: (1) a brief description; (2) relevance to landscape ecological research; and (3) recommended research topics. Using these principles, I suggest potential avenues to advance landscape ecological research about biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human well-being.

Particularly in protected areas where such conflict of interest exists, the question is asked: what are the ecological thresholds within which fire should be managed? Location Montane proteoid fynbos shrublands, eastern coastal part of the Cape Floral Kingdom; coastal slopes of the Tsitsikamma and Outeniqua Mountains, South Africa. Methods Estimates of optimal fire frequencies are often based on the relationship between plant age and the rate of seed accumulation of the slowest-maturing species. We established juvenile periods and recruitment success (measured as the ratio of post-fire recruits to the pre-burn population) after fires at different intervals, of serotinous, reseeding shrubs in the Proteaceae. From this we estimated minimum fire return intervals (FRIs) that would allow for their persistence in eastern coastal fynbos shrublands. Results Juvenile periods ranged from 4 to 9 yr, which are comparable to ecologically similar proteoids elsewhere in fynbos and SE and SW Australian shrublands. There was large variability among sites and within species in the degree of flowering at given plant ages, some of which seemed related to the moisture regime. There were no consistent differences among species in their rate of maturation. Post-fire recruitment success was near zero following a fire in 5-yr-old vegetation, always above replacement levels following fires in =7-yr-old vegetation, and at a maximum in old (38 yr) fynbos. There was considerable variation in post-fire recruitment success for any particular FRI, species or site. The lack of a significant relationship between recruitment success and pre-fire vegetation age, suggests that once a critical post-fire age is attained, factors other than seed abundance affect recruitment success. Conclusions From an ecological perspective, our findings imply a minimum FRI of 9 yr for eastern coastal fynbos. This is not intended to prescribe rigid management of fire according to a fixed rotation and does not negate the need to consider site- or species-specific requirements. Instead it provides a lower threshold for a range of acceptable FRIs below which a significant decline of species populations is predicted.

AB We used the maximum entropy (MAXENT) technique to explore how anthropogenic and physical factors influence the habitat of elephants and buffalo in a Southern African savanna landscape. Results show that for both species the distance to agricultural fields is the most important factor determining the choice of habitat. Without having used the nature reserves' and conservancy's boundary as an input in the maximum entropy model, the model was mapping out the high probability of buffalo and elephant presence to coincide within their boundaries. The analysis of the habitat condition show that higher presence of wildlife in the nature reserves compared with cultivated areas is not dependent on the abundance of green biomass, proximity to surface water, or terrain slope, since these do not significantly differ between nature reserves and communal lands. We conclude that the presence of agricultural fields contributes more in shaping the habitats of both buffalo and elephant than other environmental variables. In the communal lands where the agricultural fields are concentrated along the rivers elephants and buffalo are pushed away from the rivers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A key aspect of savannah vegetation heterogeneity is mosaics formed by two functional grassland types, bunch grasslands, and grazing lawns. We investigated the role of termites, important ecosystem engineers, in creating high-nutrient patches in the form of grazing lawns. Some of the ways termites can contribute to grazing lawn development is through erosion of soil from aboveground mounds to the surrounding soil surface. This may alter the nutrient status of the surrounding soils. We hypothesize that the importance of this erosion varies with termite genera, depending on feeding strategy and mound type. To test this, we simulated erosion by applying mound soil from three termite genera (Macrotermes, Odontotermes, and Trinervitermes) in both a field experiment and a greenhouse experiment. In the greenhouse experiment, we found soils with the highest macro nutrient levels (formed by Trinervitermes) promoted the quality and biomass of both a lawn (Digitaria longiflora) and a bunch (Sporobolus pyramidalis) grass species. In the field we found that soils with the highest micro nutrient levels (formed by Macrotermes) showed the largest increase in cover of grazing lawn species. By linking the different nutrient availability of the mounds to the development of different grassland states, we conclude that the presence of termite mounds influences grassland mosaics, but that the type of mound plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the effects.

AB We used morphometric data from 151 Crocodylus acutus captured in the Coastal Zone of Belize to develop predictive models for deducing body size (total length [TL] and snout-vent length [SVL]) from measurements of single attributes (dorsal cranial length [DCL], cranial width [CW], snout length [SL] and width [SW], body mass [BM], and rear foot length [RFL]), quantify sexual size dimorphism, examine ontogenetic changes in cranial morphology, and estimate standing crop biomass of crocodiles on an offshore atoll. Strong positive allometric relationships were found between measurements of body length and other morphometric attributes, and provide a reliable means to estimate body length from tracks, skulls, and body parts. The maximum DCL:CW ratio of 2.4 was attained at a body size that coincided with a dietary shift from invertebrates to larger vertebrate prey. The SL:SW ratio of C. acutus partially overlapped that of C. moreletii, and consequently this attribute was not useful for distinguishing these two morphologically similar, sympatric species. The mean DCL:TL ratio was 0.15 and remained constant across body sizes ranging from hatchlings to large adults. Both overall and adult sex ratio (female:male) were not significantly different from parity. The mean SVL of males (111.3 +/- 20.7 cm) was significantly greater than that of females (101.0 +/- 6.2 cm). A compressed sexual size dimorphism index (SDI) of 2.10 was calculated for C. acutus in coastal Belize. Crocodylus acutus in coastal Belize appear to attain a smaller body size than reported for other populations. Standing crop biomass of C. acutus in the Turneffe Atoll was estimated to be 0.92 kg/ha.

AB Although long-term monitoring is viewed as an essential part of conserving wildlife populations, it is currently carried out in surprisingly few protected areas in Africa. Here, data from a 16-year vehicle transect monitoring programme in Katavi National Park, western Tanzania, are presented. These data provide information on large mammal densities, identify declines in populations of several large mammal species as based on encounter rates, support worrying trends observed in aerial census data and shed light on the effectiveness of recent changes in legal protection. Ground and aerial surveys confirmed that waterbuck, topi, warthog, lion and spotted hyaena populations are all in decline and that this should be a cause for concern. Counting animals by driving vehicle transects is relatively easy and inexpensive to carry out, and data here show that such counts have several pay-offs for conservation managers especially in identifying population declines; counts should be employed more often in East Africa and elsewhere.

AB P>1. Natural area managers use fire and grazing to achieve nature conservation/production goals and to prevent the loss of life and property. Yet, little is known of the effects of post-fire grazing on fuel load and the proportion of days on which fire can be sustained (fire potential). This knowledge could help managers in planning interventions to achieve their goals.
   2. At seven sites in Tasmania, Australia, including sedgeland, heathy forest and grassland, fire potential and fuel load were measured before, and for 2 years after fire. Measurements were made in burning, fencing and burning plus fencing treatments, and in control quadrats.
   3. Burning followed by grazing, largely by native vertebrates, resulted in lower fuel loads than either grazing by itself or burning by itself. A new steady state was established in two grasslands. Fire potential at the oligotrophic sites was largely a function of time elapsed since the last fire, while at grassy sites was increased by grazing without fire, but depressed or slightly increased by grazing after burning.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Effects of grazing after burning on flammability are not predictable from the single or additive effects of grazing and burning, varying between vegetation type and environment. In highland grassy ecosystems fire potential can be reduced by excluding grazing animals after fire, while in scleromorphic ecosystems grazing after fire does not affect fuel or fire potential. Intense grazing after fire can cause an, often desirable, shift from tussock to lawn grassland. Burning and subsequent grazing of tussock grassland vegetation in the lowlands may reduce the chance of wildfire damaging property and conservation/production values, while in highland tussock grassland burning followed by grazing will be largely ineffective in reducing the already low chance of such damaging fire.

AB The South African government, as part of its efforts to mitigate the effects of the ongoing energy crisis, has proposed that biofuels should form an important part of the country's energy supply. The contribution of liquid biofuels to the national fuel supply is expected to be at least 2% by 2013. The Biofuels Industrial Strategy of the Republic of South Africa of 2007 outlines key incentives for reaching this target and promoting the development of a sustainable biofuels industry. This paper discusses issues relating to this strategy as well as key drivers in biofuel processing with reference to potential impacts on South Africa's rich biological heritage.
   Our understanding of many of the broader aspects of biofuels needs to be enhanced. We identify key areas where challenges exist, such as the link between technology, conversion processes and feedstock selection. The available and proposed processing technologies have important implications for land use and the use of different non-native plant species as desired feedstocks. South Africa has a long history of planting non-native plant species for commercial purposes, notably for commercial forestry. Valuable lessons can be drawn from this experience on mitigation against potential impacts by considering plausible scenarios and the appropriate management framework and policies. We conceptualise key issues embodied in the biofuels strategy, adapting a framework developed for assessing and quantifying impacts of invasive alien species. In so doing, we provide guidelines for minimising the potential impacts of biofuel projects on biodiversity.

AB Question
   Woody plant and grass interactions in savannas have frequently been studied from the perspective of the response of one growth form on the other but seldom evaluated as two-way interactions. What causes woody plant encroachment in semi-arid savannas and what are the competitive responses of tree seedlings and grasses on rocky and sandy substrates?
   Methods
   In this greenhouse study, we investigated the influence of substrate and grazing on responses to interspecific competition by tree seedlings and grasses. We measured competitive/facilitative responses on biomass and nutrient status of tree seedlings and grasses grown together.
   Results
   Interspecific competition suppressed growth of trees and grasses. Tree seedlings and uncut grass accumulated double the biomass when grown without competition relative to when they competed. Competitive responses varied on different substrates. Grass biomass on rocky substrate showed no response to tree competition, but appeared to be facilitated by trees on sandy substrate. Grass clipping resulted in higher tree seedling biomass on rocky substrate, but not on sandy substrate. There was a positive response of grass nutrient status to competition from tree seedlings.
   Conclusion
   Selective grass herbivory in the absence of browsing or suppression of shade-intolerant grasses by trees are commonly cited reasons behind bush encroachment in savannas. We show that grazing may confer a competitive advantage to tree seedlings and promote bush encroachment more readily on rocky substrates. This may be due to the imposed sharing of the soil depth niche on rocky substrates, whereas possible niche separation on sandy substrates minimizes the advantage conferred by reduced competition.

AB As key 'ecosystem engineers', earthworms improve mineralization of organic matter, plant growth, soil quality, and are an important component of many terrestrial food webs. Under appropriate conditions, they are therefore likely to accelerate the restoration of soil ecosystem function after mining.
   Conserving naturally occurring populations and facilitating their recolonisation appears as the most efficient way to increase earthworms' overall effect. The impact of mining activities and restoration measures on New Zealand endemic earthworm communities was tested. Earthworm biomass and diversity were compared in four different habitat types.
   Mining activities, not surprisingly, are shown here to have a detrimental impact on earthworm communities. Soil stockpiling induces anaerobic conditions at and below a depth of 1 m, where earthworms do not survive. The use of stockpiled soil for vegetation replanting therefore leads to low diversity and low abundance of earthworms. An alternative restoration technique consisting in transferring vegetation, and soil units (the vegetation direct transfer) was efficient in preserving earthworm populations with earthworm biomass and diversity not significantly different from those observed in undisturbed areas. Based on these results, we recommend vegetation direct transfer (VDT) to be prioritised whenever it is logistically and economically feasible. When VDT is not applicable, low stockpiles should be prioritised as they will comprise a higher proportion of good quality soil (at the surface) and a lower proportion of anaerobic and compacted soil (below 1 m depth at the studied site).

AB Willows of the Salix alba-Salix fragilis complex, native to western Eurasia, represent typical invaders of floodplain ecosystems worldwide. Introduced to South America by European settlers probably at the end of the nineteenth century, their distribution has increased significantly along the rivers in Northern Patagonia. This case study carried out mainly in the area around Lake Nahuel Huapi aims to analyze clonal structures and their spatial distribution using molecular markers as well as to relate the observed patterns to settlement history and life history traits of this species complex. Leaf material from 171 trees was collected along selected river floodplains in Northern Patagonia and genotypes were determined at six microsatellite loci. Including 62 reference samples of the S. alba-S. fragilis complex from German rivers, Probability of Identity (P (ID)) was calculated and a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) conducted. From the altogether thirteen different genotypes detected, one dominant genotype (female) formed monoclonal stands along most of the studied river stretches. The maximum linear distance between the most remote ramets of this clone was 790 km. Evidence arose that the colonizing process so far is exclusively based on vegetative propagation in the focal study area and is obviously attributable to the pronounced brittleness of the hybrid parent S. fragilis. However, outside this area the occurrence of male trees and a diversity of genotypes indicate that evolutionary processes by recombination are involved within the willow complex. Therefore, an increase in genotypes can be assumed when male individuals and therefore sexual reproduction would appear in the area around Lake Nuhuel Huapi. This could be a crucial point for the long-term invasion success of the taxa when climatic and other environmental conditions will change in Southern Argentina.

AB In this paper, the genus Nezara Amyot & Serville is reviewed and a hypothesis of relationships among its species is proposed. Also, diagnoses for the genus and the 12 included species are provided. A key to separate the species is also provided. Of the seven other species assigned to Nezara in the literature, four of them are considered incertae sedis, two are transferred to different genera, and one is considered a junior synonym. The cladistic analysis include 15 taxa and 34 characters. The cladogram was rooted with Carpocoris purpureipennis (DeGeer); outgroup comparison also include species of the sister-groups Aethemenes chloris (Dallas), and Pseudoacrosternum cachani Day. The results showed Nezara as a monophyletic taxon. Biogeographical scenarios of the evolution of Nezara were discussed.

AB Successful recruitment of marine fishes depends on survival during early life-history stages, which is influenced by oceanic advection due to its impact on coastal trophodynamics and transport processes. Here we evaluate the influence of ocean circulation on the dispersal of rockfish (Sebastes spp.) larvae along the central California coast using an implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System, driven at the surface by output from the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System. Thousands of floats simulating rockfish larval propagules, constrained to follow fixed depths, were released over a broad coastal area at 2-day intervals, and transported by simulated ocean currents at depths of 1, 7, 20, 40, and 70 m. Trajectory statistics are averaged across the 4-yr period from January 2000 through December 2003 to reveal mean trajectory direction, net displacement, fractional cross-shore loss, and duration of retention for different seasons. On average, near-surface propagules originating nearshore are transported offshore during the upwelling season, whereas deeper propagules move alongshore to the north. This vertical shear vanishes during winter, with most floats moving alongshore to the north, regardless of depth. After 35 days in the water column, typical transport distances were similar to 50 km for floats remaining nearshore and similar to 150 km for floats over the midshelf and slope. Implications for performance of marine reserves for rockfish conservation are discussed. Our results also provide evidence for a strong semiannual pattern of coastal retention rates, with high export of near-surface drifters during the upwelling season. In contrast, high rates of shelf retention occurred for releases at 20 m and deeper during summer, and at all depths during winter.

AB Game reserves (GR) in Tanzania have been found to support similar or lower densities of large mammals compared with National parks (NP). But as these areas usually differ considerably not only in regard to management but also to environmental factors, we assessed the relative importance of vegetation cover, species-specific habitat preferences and legal (trophy hunting) and illegal off-take for observed differences in species-specific densities. In the Katavi ecosystem, open habitats were characteristic elements of Katavi NP, while Rukwa GR was dominated by miombo forest. In an inter-specific comparison, density differences were moderately correlated with preferences for open habitats, and with estimates of combined legal and illegal off-take but not with one of these separately. In a multiple linear regression, open habitat preference was found to explain 39.6% of the density differences between the two protected areas. This analysis suggests that the broad-scale pattern of most species' distributions is governed by differing vegetation cover but that several species are overexploited by illegal (elephant, giraffe, buffalo, bush pig, warthog) or combined off-take (hippopotamus, eland, waterbuck), thus emphasizing the need for quota readjustments and a more efficient anti-poaching control.

AB Seabirds are an important link between their marine feeding areas and their terrestrial breeding environments, transporting both marine-derived nutrients and contaminants and then depositing them on land in their guano. In this study, the impact of a large northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis) colony on the water chemistry of 26 nearby ponds spanning a gradient of seabird influence was investigated at Cape Vera, Devon Island, in the Canadian High Arctic. The presence of the fulmar colony has led to nutrient and trace element enrichment in the ponds, as evidenced by the close association among As, Cd, Co, Cu, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sb, and Sr and the ornithogenic gradient. The ponds most affected by the fulmar colony were characterized by increased primary production, high organic carbon concentrations, and elevated pH - conditions favorable for the in situ removal of metals from the water column. Despite this, the highest trace element concentrations were observed in the seabird-influenced ponds, suggesting that these elements have undergone biotransport.

AB Small scale disturbances could act as patches that provide sites for the colonization of competitively inferior species, promoting the establishment of non-native species in some cases. We analyzed the vegetation associated with feral horse dung piles in montane pampas grasslands in Mid-East Argentina and described the changes following their abandonment, evaluating whether dung piles act as invasion windows, allowing the entrance of alien plant species. We estimated the portion of the study area directly covered by horse manure and dung height was used to estimate the time elapsed after the abandonment of each pile. Vegetation replacement on dung piles of different ages was assessed and compared with grassland controls using discriminant analysis. We used regression analysis to look for changes in vegetation cover, species richness, species diversity and evenness in response to height (age) of the dung piles, and principal component analyses (PCA) to identify groups of plants associated with different successional stages. We compared cover of alien plant species on dung piles with grassland controls using one-way ANOVA. On average, 2.5% of the study area was covered by horse dung. Total vegetation cover, species richness, diversity and evenness increased after the piles were abandoned. Characteristic plant groups were associated with initial, middle and last phases of the studied succession. Vegetation on the dung piles significantly differed from that in grassland controls and two species were consistently associated with dung piles: the invasive Red Star Thistle, Centaurea calcitrapa, and a native grazing-intolerant grass, Nassella clarazii. Non-native species cover was also higher in dung piles than in control plots. Dung piles cover a significant portion of grassland area in our study site, produce significant changes in the vegetation and are associated with some invasive alien plants that could eventually colonize more pristine areas in the vicinity. On the other hand, they might represent refuges for palatable species, since horses seem to avoid them for grazing.

AB Herbivory may be an important factor affecting seedling survival of exotic species invading new habitats. We evaluated the effect of vertebrate herbivory on the seedling survival of two widely planted and invasive tree species (Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus), in a Mediterranean-type ecosystem of central Chile. An important role of herbivory on seedling survival of these two species in their introduced ranges has previously been documented. However, this has mainly been evaluated in forest plantations where habitat and vegetation conditions differ from wild habitats in which invasion occurs. We planted seedlings with and without protection against vertebrate herbivores in different aspects (a mesic south-facing slope and a xeric north-facing slope) and vegetation cover (open sites and sites with patchy tree cover). We found that regardless of aspect or vegetation cover, herbivory, in this case mainly caused by exotic vertebrates, significantly and negatively affected seedling survival of both species. However, while the effect of herbivory on P. radiata was significant in every vegetation and habitat condition, for E. globulus, the effect of herbivory was significant only for open sites in the mesic habitat. These results suggest that, as observed in forestry plantations, vertebrate herbivory may constrain seedling establishment of these two exotic trees and potentially impede the invasion. However, the importance of herbivory in controlling exotic species may vary depending on the vegetation and habitat conditions in some species such as E. globulus. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Surface models are developed for simulating the food provision capacities of cropland, grassland, woodland, and aquatic ecosystems. Based on these models, it appears that China's current agricultural structure is responsible for the shortage of food. if the agricultural production structure was improved so as to result in balanced nutritional value, the human carrying capacity would be 2029, 1914, and 1794 million individuals, living under the standards of the primary well-to-do life, full well-to-do life, and well-off life, respectively, taking into account the threshold of the human carrying capacity and an 11% production drop caused by natural disasters. If 57 billion m(3) of water were transferred from southern to northern China by a south-to-north water diversion project and 17.3 billion m(3) of water were diverted into agriculture, the human carrying capacity would be 2058, 1940, and 1817 million individuals, respectively, under the three living standards.

AB The ability to thermoregulate in reptilians is often through behavioural modification. We investigated body temperature (T-b) patterns during winter in the amphibious Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and its relationship to basking behaviour at the St. Lucia Crocodile Centre, St. Lucia, South Africa. It was found that crocodiles had no daily plateaus in T-b but rather continuous oscillations in T-b within a range of mean minimum T-b 18.8-19.6 degrees C to mean maximum T-b 26.9-29.2 degrees C. Crocodile T-b increased during the day, usually after 10:00 irrespective of body size. Behavioural data showed that the crocodiles usually left the water to bask around 10:00. It is suggested that basking behaviour is important for elevating T-b rather than attaining a preferred T-b. The increased T-b may allow them to perform optimally when they return to water. The basking occurrence has management implications as it suggests that the best time to conduct aerial censuses of the St. Lucia crocodiles is during winter after 10:00 when most of the individuals are basking and hence most easily seen.

AB Only few estimates of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are available from Antarctic tundra ecosystems. During the summer of 2005/2006, for the first time field measurements of N2O emissions were conducted by a static chamber technique in two coastal marshes (Wolong Marsh and Tuanjie Marsh) of eastern Antarctica. In Wolong Marsh, the N2O fluxes ranged from -20.6 to 85.6 mu g N2O-N m(-2)h(-1), -5.3 to 50.8 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 6.4 to 27.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) at the wet, mesic and dry sites, respectively. In Tuanjie Marsh, the fluxes ranged from -5.9 to 12.6 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), -3.6 to 12.1 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) and 12.8 to 59.8 mu g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1) at the ponds, shallow fens and dry tundra sites, respectively. The seasonal pattern of N2O fluxes followed the warming of the sediment/soil, indicating that the variation of ground temperatures had an important effect. on N2O emissions. The freezing-thawing cycle seemed to increase the N2O emissions from the wetlands, and water table was the major parameter for spatial variations of controlling N2O fluxes. There was a consistent diurnal pattern in the N2O emission rates from two wetlands and a good correlation with ground temperatures. The sparse data in this study hint at the potential importance of coastal tundra wetlands in the total local atmospheric NO load in eastern Antarctica. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Pit-building antlion Euroleon nostras constructs efficient traps in sand to catch its prey. The predator is known to react to substrate vibrations produced by movements of its prey outside the pit with sand-tossing behaviour but it has not yet been ascertained if this reaction is directed towards the prey. The accuracy of the sand-tossing response in the presence of four prey species was measured using a video recording method. The sand-tossing angle was highly positively correlated with the prey angle. Sand tossing was most frequently elicited when prey was on the posterior sand surface. Covering the larval photoreceptors did not influence the antlion's localizing behaviour. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Counts of tracks that passively accumulate on a suitable substrate are commonly used to derive indices of large carnivore abundance. In this study we evaluate the suitability of a similar survey using multiple 3-km long transect-lines to detect changes in population size for Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in central Norway. We used GIS methods to simulate the crossing of transect lines by lynx using real telemetry data from the study area. We compared the effect of transect-line placement (deliberate vs random), transect-line density, and the number of nights over which tracks can accumulate in the snow. For each scenario we evaluated both the probability of detecting lynx that are present in the survey area, and the power of the index to detect changes between consecutive surveys. Deliberately placed lines performed significantly better than randomly placed lines, and as expected, increases in line density and the period of track accumulation improved the outcome. Using three nights of track accumulation and the highest density of deliberately placed lines that we simulated (1/38 km(2)) indicated that both the probability of detecting individual lynx present within the survey area, and the power to detect a 33% change in population size between two surveys, were > 80%.

AB A national-level land degradation risk monitoring system identified an important grazing area in central northern Namibia as an area at risk of environmental change. A time series analysis of primary indicators used for this monitoring system for the period 1971-2001 shows that increase in livestock pressure and high rainfall variability are potential threats. The study presented here compares these national-level results with those obtained by interviewing local farmers about their perceptions of past and present states of the environment in the grazing area. A majority of interviewees claim that grazing resources have decreased and deforestation has taken place since they first arrived. Increased livestock numbers and decreasing rainfall were thought to be major factors leading to perceived environmental changes. These perceptions support conclusions from national monitoring. The interviews reveal a more complex picture indicating that decreasing availability of grazing outside the study area, improved road access to the area, provision of permanent access to water, fencing of large areas of the commons, and prolonged dryness, in combination with non-adaptive land management, are major factors causing environmental changes. It is suggested that local knowledge contributes a sound basis for development and assessment of national monitoring initiatives. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We used sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes from bacteria that are associated with the esophagus/pharynx, stomach and intestine of two marine sympatric invertebrates but with different feeding mechanisms, namely the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus (grazer) and the ascidian Microcosmus sp. (suspension feeder). Amplifiable DNA was retrieved from all sections except the pharynx of the ascidian. Based on the inferred phylogeny of the retrieved sequences, the sea urchin's esophagus is mainly characterized mostly by bacteria belonging to alpha-, gamma-Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes, most probably originating from the surrounding environment. The stomach revealed phylotypes that belonged to gamma- and delta-Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and Fusobacteria. Since the majority of their closest relatives are anaerobic species and they could be putative symbionts of the P lividus stomach, in which anaerobic conditions also prevail. Seven out of eight phylotypes found in the sea urchin's intestine belonged to sulfate reducing delta-Proteobacteria, and one to gamma-Proteobacteria, with possible nutritional activities, i.e. degradation of complex organic compounds which is beneficial for the animal. The bacterial phylotypes of the ascidian digestive tract belonged only to the phyla of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. The stomach phylotypes of the ascidian were related to pathogenic bacteria possibly originating from the water column, while the intestine seemed to harbour putative symbiotic bacteria that are involved in the degradation of nitrogenous and other organic compounds, thus assisting ascidian nutrition.

AB Due to the long tradition of the Braun-Blanquet approach, many releves using this approach have been made. Recent developments in vegetation-plot databases provide an opportunity to effectively use these releves to study ecological problems as well. Opinions differ, however, concerning the applicability of these datasets, often with their use being restricted to exploration and hypothesis generation only.
   We assert that preferential sampling, which is characteristic of the Braun-Blanquet approach, means using a special definition of statistical population rather than non-random sampling. We present a case study, where consequences of using a preferential and non-preferential definition of statistical population are studied. Although the traits of stands that are preferred or avoided by the phytosociologist during preferential sampling can be identified, there are no general rules that could predict the difference between the preferential and non-preferential datasets obtained for the same object.

AB Kalk Bay, South Africa, has a typical south coast zonation pattern with a band of seaweed dominating the mid-eulittoral and between two molluscan-herbivore dominated upper and lower eulittoral zones. Encrusting coralline algae were very obvious features of these zones. The most abundant herbivores in the upper eulittoral were the limpet, Cymbula oculus (10.4 +/- 1.6 individuals m(-2); 201.65 +/- 32.68 g.m(-2)) and the false limpet, Siphonaria capensis (97.07 +/- 19.92 individuals m(-2); 77.93 16.02 g.m(-2)). The territorial gardening limpet, Scutellastra cochlear, dominated the lower eulittoral zone, achieving very high densities (545.27 +/- 84.35 m(-2)) and biomass (4630.17 +/- 556.13 g.m(-2)), and excluded all other herbivores and most seaweeds, except for its garden alga and the encrusting coralline alga, Spongites yendoi (35.93 +/- 2.26% cover). In the upper eulittoral zone, encrusting coralline algae were only present in the guts of the chiton Acanthochiton garnoti (30.5 +/- 1.33%) and the limpet C. oculus (2.9 +/- 0.34%). The lower eulittoral zone limpet, Scutellastra cochlear also had a large percentage of encrusting coralline algae in its gut with limpets lacking gardens having higher (45.1 +/- 1.68%) proportions of coralline algae in their guts than those with gardens (25.6 +/- 0.8%). Encrusting coralline algae had high organic contents, similar to those of other encrusting and turf-forming algae, but higher organic contents than foliose algae. Radula structure, grazing frequencies as a percentage of the area grazed (upper eulittoral 73.25 +/- 3.60% d(-1); lower eulittoral 46.0 +/- 3.29% d(-1)), and algal organic content provided evidence to support the dietary habits of the above herbivores. The data show that many intertidal molluscs are actively consuming encrusting coralline algae and that these seaweeds should be seen as an important food source.

AB The ability of plant communities to recover after non-native species invasion will depend upon the nature of their soil seed bank and seed rain characteristics. This study assessed changes in the soil seed bank and seed rain associated with the invasion of the non-native shrub Cytisus scoparius in subalpine vegetation. Soil seed bank and seed rain composition, density and richness were investigated at three areas of different stages of invasion: (i) recent (8-10 years), (ii) mature (15-16 years) and (iii) long-term (25 years). There were few changes in seed bank composition or richness regardless of invasion stage. By contrast, the seed rain composition, richness and density was substantially different within long-invaded areas. Very few seeds were able to colonise the dense barrier characteristic of larger, more mature C. scoparius stands. Some prominent herbs from the native vegetation were under-represented or absent from the seed bank, both in invaded and uninvaded areas. Laboratory germination experiments demonstrated that most native species germinate easily, which may imply a transient seed bank, rather than a persistent one. The majority of herbaceous and shrub species were capable of resprouting vegetatively. Therefore, regeneration appeared more reliant on the bud and tuber bank than a persistent soil seed bank. The dominance of graminoid species and C. scoparius rather than other herbaceous, shrub or tree species suggests that the regenerating vegetation will be dominated by grass species and/or C. scoparius. Hence, in areas where long-invaded C. scoparius stands are present the recovery of native subalpine vegetation maybe difficult. Recovery may only be possible through wind dispersal from the surrounding intact vegetation or through actively reseeding the area. This study highlights the importance of early intervention in invasive species management.

AB It has been suggested that switching from the widely used Biological Species Concept to a Phylogenetic Species Concept, would result in the appearance of hitherto neglected patterns of endemism. The problem has mainly been analyzed with respect to endemic taxa and for rather limited geographical regions, but will here be analysed for the entire resident avifauna of sub-Saharan Africa. A database of African bird distributions was re-edited to create two new datasets representing 1572 biological species and 2098 phylogenetic species. Species richness patterns were virtually identical with the two taxonomies, and only subtle changes were found in the geographical variation in range-size rarity sum. However, there were some differences in the most range-restricted species, with increased complexity of long-recognized centres of endemism. Overall, then, the large-scale biogeographic patterns are robust to changes in species concepts. This reflects the aggregated nature of endemism, with certain areas acting as "species pumps" and large intervening areas being characterised by a predominance of widespread species which distribute themselves in accordance with contemporary environmental conditions. The percentages of phylogenetic and threatened species captured in a BSC near-minimum set of 64 grid-cells and a PSC near-maximum set, with the same number of grid-cells, are very similar.

AB A huge number of phytosociological relevEs, which have been collected in Europe during the last century, seems to be a useful point of reference for analyses of temporal changes in vegetation. The high degree of subjectivity during data collection, however, makes difficult the comparison between data sets collected at different time by different authors. Being aware of this we attempted to reveal 30-year changes in strictly protected old-growth mountain forests. We compared two sets of releves: a subjective phytosociological sample collected in the 60s and a systematic random one from the 90s of the XX century.
   Standard phytosociological data gave distinct vegetation units with transitional patches poorly represented. This was observed both in the gradient between beech and coniferous forests in the montane belt and in the altitudinal gradient including two forests belts. On the contrary, the random sample did not indicate discontinuity in any of these gradients. We suggest that in spite of better representation of rare plant communities, in the subjective sample a considerable part of vegetation variability was omitted to emphasize differences between associations.
   Most species positively distinguishing syntaxa were more frequent in the subjective sample because of preferential sampling in patches with a high number of such species. There were few diagnostic species with higher frequency in the random sample or with similar frequencies in both samples. Such results were interpreted as an evidence of spreading of these species. Comparisons between samples revealed ' the expansion of heliophilous specles typical for communities of Betulo-Adenostyletea and dramatic regeneration decline of Abies alba, Acer pseudoplatanus and Picea abies.

AB Vegetative and reproductive phenology of 42 tree species of tropical forests at Kodayar in the Western Ghats, Tamil Nadu, India was monitored through fortnightly visits for two years. A considerable variation was found in leaf flushing, leaf fall, flowering and fruiting behaviour that could be partly attributed to abiotic factors. Peak activity of leaf fall and leaf emergence that occurred in the early dry period, could be to take full advantage of the first rainy season for vegetative growth and reproduction. Peak flowering activity coincided with leaf fall/leaf flushing, possibly to attract pollinators. The activity of fruit ripening and fruit fall was at its peak in the first rainy season in order to utilize the available soil moisture for seed germination and seedling establishment. Phenological behaviour displayed by the trees is an adaptation to the surrounding abiotic and biotic environment.

AB 1. Two in situ experiments investigated the responses to artificially increased sediment loads of the gastropod and fish communities, and of the whole benthos, of the rocky shores of Lake Tanganyika. Sediments were emptied once onto randomly selected quadrats using SCUBA, with control quadrats receiving no addition of sediment. Quadrats were monitored up to 6 months after sediment addition.
   2. While the abundance of Lavigeria grandis (Mollusca; Gastropoda) was reduced greatly by the addition of sediment, low abundance and biomass of the whole gastropod community on sediment-impacted quadrats 6 months after sediment addition suggests more general impacts of inundation in the longer term.
   3. Benthic invertebrate communities inundated by sediment had significantly fewer individuals and numbers of taxa than control communities. No significant community recovery was recorded on sediment-impacted quadrats within the timescale of the experiment. A short-term period of high turbidity brought about by the emptying of sediments onto sediment-impacted quadrats also caused severe decreases in benthic invertebrate abundance on controls 10 days after sediment addition. This suggests that even short-term pulses of sediment may have significant detrimental effects on littoral communities.
   4. Although significant impacts of sediment on fish community dynamics were found, and a significant reduction in the number of benthic algivorous species was recorded immediately after sediment addition, littoral fish communities showed strong resistance overall to the addition of sediments. This apparent resistance, however, may be a consequence of the small scale at which the experiment took place. Littoral fish communities were also shown to be more dynamic than indicated previously.

AB With its very broad latitudinal extension (from 5degrees to 30degrees S), Brazil's Atlantic Rain Forest includes sites that would not be classified as tropical by commonly used climatic classification systems. This situation particularly holds for the sites near the southern limits of this ecosystem. The goal of this study was to assess forest floristic composition, physiognomic aspects (deciduous species, leaf types, leaf area index) and reproductive biology (monoecious/dioecious species, pollination syndromes and dispersal syndromes) of the Atlantic forest in the Volta Velha Reserve, southern Brazil (26degrees04' S, 48degrees38' W Gr). The research focuses on the affinities of this site, which lies outside generally accepted boundaries for tropical forest. The results demonstrate that Volta Velha has a typically tropical floristic composition, apparently maintained by local climatic conditions. The differences between the characteristics of the Volta Velha forest and those of other tropical stands are within the range of differences observed among classically defined tropical sites.

AB The influence of rearing conditions on cyst production and hatching in the fairy shrimp Chirocephalus ruffoi was evaluated by rearing freshly hatched nauplii under two different conditions: in indoor culture at constant temperature and photoperiod, and in outdoor culture under naturally fluctuating temperature and varying photoperiod. Comparison of the quantitative reproductive characteristics of all the females tested revealed significant differences between the two groups, as to frequency of deposition (P < 0.01), clutch size (P < 0.001), and life span (P < 0.01).
   After dehydration, the cysts produced under natural culture conditions hatched, whereas those produced under constantly controlled conditions did not. The latter required a thermal shock for hatching as a further stimulus. The hatching pattern was more or less similar in the two cyst samples (first nauplii after 4 days of incubation, peak within 3 days), and the percentage of nauplii hatched did not significantly differ (P > 0.05).
   Submitting undehydrated, freshly laid cysts to three different subsequent stimuli (dilution, thermal shock, dehydration) gave very different results depending on the conditions under which cysts were produced. Whereas hatching was minimal for those laid under outdoor fluctuating conditions (2%), cysts produced at constant conditions showed a much higher hatching percentage (46.7%). Furthermore, in the latter, both quiescent and diapausing "eggs" were observed within the same clutch, though in different proportions.
   Irrespective of the culturing conditions, the phenomenon of hatching was characterized by a very erratic pattern. An extremely high variation was observed within the clutches of a single female, as well as among different females. Such a variation was independent of female age, clutch order, and clutch size.

AB Intertidal cirripedes are readily available on rocky shores. They are found in large numbers and, in most cases, are easily accessible. They have, therefore, been widely used in marine ecological studies. in their intertidal habitat, during their lifetime, they face physical and biotic pressures which may impede their growth or sometimes destroy them completely The protective measures developed by barnacles to counteract physical factors such as ice scour and exposure to waves have been reviewed. The removal of cyprids and newly settled barnacles by algal whiplash or bulldozing by grazing organisms has been considered. The smothering of juveniles and adults by overgrowing competitors is a biological interaction that cannot be regarded as predation but is still important in the cirripede habitat. Predation. in the true sense of the word, has been dealt with systematically from hydrozoans through fish and birds to man. Community studies that probably started on European shores have been extended worldwide.

AB Evidence is presented that bacteria in the stomach of live Antarctic krill Euphausia superba participate in the digestion of host dietary components. Total (AODC: Acridine Orange Direct Count) and culturable (CFU: Colony Forming Units) bacteria in this organ in fresh adult krill were compared in numerical and physiological terms with those in contemporaneously collected seawater samples in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, South Shetland Islands. On a per unit volume basis, AODC and CFU numbers in the stomach were greater than in the seawater, and higher than could be accounted for through selective prey filtration alone. CFU in the stomach and seawater averaged similar to 4% and <0.01% of the respective AODC, and in the stomach similar to 6% of AODC were dividing, compared to less than 1% in seawater, observations suggesting that bacterial growth occurs in the stomach. Biovolume of cells in the stomach exceeded that of cells in seawater (t(2854) = -6.262, P < 0.001), but the former were too small to have been selectively filtered. Maltose and gluconate assimilation, and lipase (C-14), 'trypsin'-like, and acid phosphatase activities were significantly more prominent in culturable bacteria from the stomach than seawater, further indicating selection. Conversely, a-fucosidase production appears host derived. Yeasts isolated from the stomach were identified as Leucosporidium antarcticum and Metschnikowia australis.

ID SEABIRD GUANO; PH; TEMPERATURE; ENVIRONMENT; SEAWATER; WATERS
AB Summertime ammonia (including ammonia and ammonium) concentrations in infrequently flushed coastal rockpools located near gull rookeries (Appledore Island, Maine, USA) were found to change by several orders of magnitude over temporal scales of hours to days. Concentration increases were brought about by transport of rain-washed gull guano into the pools (rain-event changes: from near zero to 1600 mu M) and nighttime ammonia release by pool biota (daily changes: from near zero to 60 mu M). Fresh gull guano was found to release ammonia and phosphate rapidly in water, resulting in a molar ratio (N:P) of about 3.0 to 3.2, values similar to those observed in pools after a rainfall event. The rapid daytime losses occurred due to both assumed metabolic nutrient uptake, and ammonia gas volatilization during midday periods of high pH associated with photosynthetic oxygen production. Diel pH ranged from nighttime lows of 6.6-7.0 to daytime highs of 10.2-10.5. Daytime ammonia loss rates ranged from 130 to 250 mu mol . l(-1). h(-1) which is equivalent to a volatilization flux of 1-2 mu mol . cm(-2). h(-1) depending on the area and depth of the pool. Wind-aided gaseous flux across the pool surface is estimated to comprise approximate to 80% of observed ammonia loss, the remainder being lost through either direct metabolic uptake or infrequent flushing with seawater. Like most marine systems, these pools may become nitrogen limited despite the abundance of nitrogen at times. Because of the rapid ammonia volatilization rates, it appears that some of the nitrogen deposited in gull rookeries may be widely dispersed downwind of the rookery site. Volatilized ammonia may be further scrubbed from the air by precipitation, thus contributing to the eutrophication of adjacent and remote marine coastal and terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Large carnivores can exert top-down effects in ecosystems, but the size of these effects are largely unknown. Empirical investigation on the importance of large carnivores for ecosystem structure and functioning presents a number of challenges due to the large spatio-temporal scale and the complexity of such dynamics. Here, we applied a mechanistic global ecosystem model to investigate the influence of large-carnivore removal from undisturbed ecosystems. First, we simulated large-carnivore removal on the global scale to inspect the geographic pattern of top-down control and to disentangle the functional role of large carnivores in top-down control in different environmental contexts. Second, we conducted four small-scale ecosystem simulation experiments to understand direct and indirect changes in food-web structure under different environmental conditions. We found that the removal of top-down control exerted by large carnivores (> 21 kg) can trigger large trophic cascades, leading to an overall decrease in autotroph biomass globally. Furthermore, the loss of large carnivores resulted in an increase of mesopredators. The magnitude of these changes was positively related to primary productivity (NPP), in line with the 'exploitation ecosystem hypothesis'. In addition, we found that seasonality in NPP dampened the magnitude of change following the removal of large carnivores. Our results reinforce the idea that large carnivores play a fundamental role in shaping ecosystems, and further declines and extinctions can trigger substantial ecosystem responses. Our findings also support previous studies suggesting that natural ecosystem dynamics have been severely modified and are still changing as a result of the widespread decline and extinction of large carnivores.

AB Humans are placing more strain on the world's oceans than ever before. Furthermore, marine ecosystems are seldom subjected to single stressors, rather they are frequently exposed to multiple, concurrent stressors. When the combined effect of these stressors is calculated and mapped through cumulative impact assessments, it is often assumed that the effects are additive. However, there is increasing evidence that different combinations of stressors can have non-additive impacts, potentially leading to synergistic and unpredictable impacts on ecosystems. Accurately predicting how stressors interact is important in conservation, as removal of certain stressors could provide a greater benefit, or be more detrimental than would be predicted by an additive model. Here, we conduct a meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of additive, synergistic, and antagonistic stressor interaction effects using seagrasses as case study ecosystems. We found that additive interactions were the most commonly reported in seagrass studies. Synergistic and antagonistic interactions were also common, but there was no clear way of predicting where these non-additive interactions occurred. More studies which synthesise the results of stressor interactions are needed to be able to generalise interactions across ecosystem types, which can then be used to improve models for assessing cumulative impacts.

AB Background Pollen transfer via animals is necessary for reproduction by similar to 80 % of flowering plants, and most of these plants live in multispecies communities where they can share pollinators. While diffuse plant-pollinator interactions are increasingly recognized as the rule rather than the exception, their fitness consequences cannot be deduced from flower visitation alone, so other proxies, functionally closer to seed production and amenable for use in a broad variety of diverse communities, are necessary.
   Scope We conceptually summarize how the study of pollen on stigmas of spent flowers can reflect key drivers and functional aspects of the plant-pollinator interaction (e.g. competition, facilitation or commensalism). We critically evaluate how variable visitation rates and other factors (pollinator pool and floral avoidance) can give rise to different relationships between heterospecific pollen and (1) conspecific pollen on the stigma and (2) conspecific tubes/grain in the style, revealing the complexity of potential interpretations. We advise on best practices for using these proxies, noting the assumptions and caveats involved in their use, and explicate what additional data are required to verify interpretation of given patterns.
   Conclusions We conclude that characterizing pollen on stigmas of spent flowers provides an attainable indirect measure of pollination interactions, but given the complex processes of pollen transfer that generate patterns of conspecific-heterospecific pollen on stigmas these cannot alone determine whether competition or facilitation are the underlying drivers. Thus, functional tests are also needed to validate these hypotheses.

AB Microbial communities within the gut can markedly impact host health and fitness. To what extent environmental influences affect the differential distribution of these microbial populations may therefore significantly impact the successful farming of the host. Using a sea-based container culture (SBCC) system for the on-growing of European lobster (Homarus gammarus), we tracked the bacterial gut microbiota over a 1-year period. We compared these communities with lobsters of the same cohort, retained in a land-based culture (LBC) system to assess the effects of the culture environment on gut bacterial assemblage and describe the phylogenetic structure of the microbiota to compare deterministic and stochastic assembly across both environments. Bacterial gut communities from SBCCs were generally more phylogenetically clustered, and therefore deterministically assembled, compared to those reared in land-based systems. Lobsters in SBCCs displayed significantly more species-rich and species-diverse gut microbiota compared to those retained in LBC. A reduction in the bacterial diversity of the gut was also associated with higher infection prevalence of the enteric viral pathogen Homarus gammarus nudivirus (HgNV). SBCCs may therefore benefit the overall health of the host by promoting the assembly of a more diverse gut bacterial community and reducing the susceptibility to disease.

ID CONSERVATION; TRADE; EXTINCTION; PRODUCTS
AB The global trade in wildlife is a threat to species conservation and animal welfare. A key driver is demand for traditional medicines (TMs). We present an initial experimental survey of demand reduction and demand redirection interventions aimed at changing the behaviour of TM consumers in China and Vietnam. Treatment respondents (n = 1600) were shown TM products, with messages outlining their conservation, welfare or human health impacts, and asked their intention to buy these products in the future. Control respondents (n = 400) were shown nothing. All respondents were then shown a 'herbal' (plant-based) substitute, and asked how likely they would be to buy it. Respondents were finally shown a list of TMs and asked to select those they would buy.
   Of treatment respondents 62.7% stated they would stop buying TMs, but when later offered a list of TMs, 52.2% selected at least one to buy. Frequent buyers exhibited a smaller treatment response than occasional buyers (56.4% versus 67.1%, said they would stop buying), and a larger gap between this and their later decision to buy TMs (a 32.8% versus 14.0% difference). With respect to herbal substitutes, 88.9% of regular buyers selected high purchase likelihoods, compared with 73.5% of occasional purchasers, proportions unaffected by experimental group.
   Information campaigns may have a limited effect in reducing demand, particularly among frequent users of TMs. Frequent purchasers, however, exhibited the greatest enthusiasm for herbal substitutes. Future approaches to protect wildlife should test the effectiveness of working with TM practitioners to redirect demand onto alternative, non-animal TM ingredients.

AB Oceanic dispersal characterizes the early juvenile life-stages of numerous marine species of conservation concern. This early stage may be a 'critical period' for many species, playing an overriding role in population dynamics. Often, relatively little information is available on their distribution during this period, limiting the effectiveness of efforts to understand environmental and anthropogenic impacts on these species. Here we present a simple model to predict annual variation in the distribution and abundance of oceanic-stage juvenile sea turtles based on species' reproductive output, movement and mortality. We simulated dispersal of 25 cohorts (1993-2017) of oceanic-stage juveniles by tracking the movements of virtual hatchling sea turtles released in a hindcast ocean circulation model. We then used estimates of annual hatchling production from Kemp's ridley Lepidochelys kempii (n = 3), green Chelonia mydas (n = 8) and loggerhead Caretta caretta (n = 5) nesting areas in the northwestern Atlantic (inclusive of the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and eastern seaboard of the U.S.) and their stage-specific mortality rates to weight dispersal predictions. The model's predictions indicate spatial heterogeneity in turtle distribution across their marine range, identify locations of increasing turtle abundance (notably along the U.S. coast), and provide valuable context for temporal variation in the stranding of young sea turtles across the Gulf of Mexico. Further effort to collect demographic, distribution and behavioral data that refine, complement and extend the utility of this modeling approach for sea turtles and other dispersive marine taxa is warranted. Finally, generating these spatially-explicit predictions of turtle abundance required extensive international collaboration among scientists; our findings indicate that continued conservation of these sea turtle populations and the management of the numerous anthropogenic activities that operate in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean will require similar international coordination.

AB Fire is a key driver in savannah systems and widely used as a land management tool. Intensifying human land uses are leading to rapid changes in the fire regimes, with consequences for ecosystem functioning and composition. We undertake a novel analysis describing spatial patterns in the fire regime of the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, document multidecadal temporal changes and investigate the factors underlying these patterns. We used MODIS active fire and burned area products from 2001 to 2014 to identify individual fires; summarizing four characteristics for each detected fire: size, ignition date, time since last fire and radiative power. Using satellite imagery, we estimated the rate of change in the density of livestock bomas as a proxy for livestock density. We used these metrics to model drivers of variation in the four fire characteristics, as well as total number of fires and total area burned. Fires in the Serengeti-Mara show high spatial variability-with number of fires and ignition date mirroring mean annual precipitation. The short-term effect of rainfall decreases fire size and intensity but cumulative rainfall over several years leads to increased standing grass biomass and fuel loads, and, therefore, in larger and hotter fires. Our study reveals dramatic changes over time, with a reduction in total number of fires and total area burned, to the point where some areas now experience virtually no fire. We suggest that increasing livestock numbers are driving this decline, presumably by inhibiting fire spread. These temporal patterns are part of a global decline in total area burned, especially in savannahs, and we caution that ecosystem functioning may have been compromised. Land managers and policy formulators need to factor in rapid fire regime modifications to achieve management objectives and maintain the ecological function of savannah ecosystems.

AB The need to reconnect agriculture, environment, food, and health when addressing agrifood system transitions is widely acknowledged. However, most analytical frameworks, especially in the expanding literature about "system approaches", rely on impact-based approaches and, thus, tend to overlook ecological processes as well as social ones. This article aims at demonstrating that a territorial approach to agrifood system transitions is more appropriate to tackle the reconnection between agriculture, food, environment, and health than the larger scales (global or national food systems) or the smaller ones (such as those of alternative food systems) usually addressed in the literature. Co-elaborated by a sociologist, an ecologist, and a nutritionist, this article is based on a focused analysis of the literature that has addressed agrifood system transitions in the food and health sciences and in the social sciences and on the reflexive analysis of two past projects dealing with such transitions. It shows that a territorial approach allows including in the analysis the diverse agrifood systems' components as well the ecological and social processes that may create functionalities for improving agrifood systems' sustainability. This territorial approach is based on systemic and processual thinking and on a transdisciplinary perspective combining an objectification stance and a pragmatist constructivist one. It should allow actors and researchers to build a shared understanding of the transition processes within their shared territorial agrifood system, despite possibly different and diverging views.

AB Marine plant communities such as kelp forests produce significant amounts of detritus, most of which is exported to areas where it can constitute an important trophic subsidy or potentially be sequestered in marine sediments. Knowing the vertical transport speed of detrital particles is critical to understanding the potential magnitude and spatial extent of these linkages. We measured sinking speeds for Laminaria hyperborea detritus ranging from whole plants to small fragments and sea urchin faecal pellets, capturing the entire range of particulate organic matter produced by kelp forests. Under typical current conditions, we determined that this organic material can be transported 10 s of m to 10 s of km. We show how the conversion of kelp fragments to sea urchin faeces, one of the most pervasive processes in kelp forests globally, increases the dispersal potential of detritus by lto 2 orders of magnitude. Kelp detritus sinking speeds were also faster than equivalent phytoplankton, highlighting its potential for rapid delivery of carbon to deep areas. Our findings support arguments for a significant contribution from kelp forests to subsidizing deep sea communities and the global carbon sink.

AB Rainfall variability is a major determinant of soil moisture, but its influence on vegetation structure has been challenging to generalize. This presents a major source of uncertainty in predicting vegetation responses to potentially widespread shifts in rainfall frequen(c)y and intensity. In savannas, where trees and grasses coexist, conflicting lines of evidence have suggested, variously, that tree cover can either increase or decrease in response to less frequent, more intense rainfall. Here, we use remote sensing products and continent-wide soil maps for sub-Saharan Africa to analyze how soil texture and fire mediate the response of savanna tree cover to rainfall climatology. Tree cover increased with mean wet-season rainfall and decreased with fire frequency, consistent with previous analyses. However, responses to rainfall intensity varied: tree cover dramatically decreased with rainfall intensity on clayey soils, at high rainfall, and with rainfall spread over longer wet seasons; conversely, on sandy soils, at low rainfall, and with shorter wet seasons, tree cover instead increased with rainfall intensity. Tree cover responses to rainfall climatology depend on soil texture, accounting for substantial variation in tree cover across African savannas. Differences in underlying soils may lead to divergent responses of savannas to global change.

AB On rangelands worldwide, cattle interact with many forms of biodiversity, most obviously with vegetation and other large herbivores Since 1995, we have been manipulating the presence of cattle, mesoherbivores, and megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes) in a series of eighteen 4-ha (10-acre) plots at the Kenya Long-term Exclosure Experiment We recently (2013) crossed these treatments with small-scale controlled bums These replicated experimental treatments simulate different land management practices We seek to disentangle the complex relationships between livestock and biodiversity in a biome where worldwide, uneasy coexistence is the norm Here, we synthesize more than 20 yr of data to address three central questions about the potentially unique role of cattle in savanna ecology 1) To what extent do cattle and wild herbivores compete with or facilitate each other? 2) Are the effects of cattle on vegetation similar to those of wildlife, or do cattle have unique effects? 3) What effects do cattle and commercial cattle management have on other savanna organisms? We found that 1) Cattle compete at least as strongly with browsers as grazers, and wildlife compete with cattle, although these negative effects ai are mitigated by cryptic herbivores (rodents), rainfall, hie, and elephants 2) Cattle effects on herbaceous vegetation (composition, productivity) are similar to those of the rich mixture of ungulates they replace, differing mainly due to the greater densities of cattle In contrast, cattle, wild mesoherbivores, and megaherbivores have strongly guild-specific effects on woody vegetation 3) Both cattle and wild ungulates i regulate cascades to other consumers, notably ter mites, rodents, and disease vectors (ticks and fleas) and pathogens Over all, cattle management, at model ate stocking densities, can be compatible with the maintenance of considerable native biodiversity, although reducing livestock to these densities in African rangelands is a major challenge.

AB Plantations of alien tree species may pose environmental risks associated to their spontaneous spread in areas of introduction. Eucalyptus globulus Labill. is one of the most used species in forestry and has been reported as invasive in many areas around the world. Fire has been suggested to enhance E. globulus recruitment but no study to date has compared burnt vs. unbumt sites for seedling emergence and survival, and little is known about the mechanisms that could favour recruitment after fire. A better understanding of the effect of fire on the invasive potential of E. globulus is essential for improved management of this species in the areas of introduction. In this study, we analyse the effect of fire on the emergence and establishment of E. globulus seedlings in the field, in the most common habitats adjacent to plantations in NW Spain, and explore the underlying mechanisms that could explain the patterns observed by means of greenhouse experiments. Fire enhanced seedling recruitment in the forested habitats studied, due to a positive effect on both seedling emergence and survival. Seedling emergence was 42.5 and 7.0 times higher in burnt vs. unburnt sites in native forests and pine plantations, respectively. Final seedling establishment was 2% in burnt vs. nil in unbumt native forests, and 2.5 times higher in burnt vs. unburnt pine plantations. In shrublands, however, final seedling establishment was similar in burnt and unburnt sites. The positive effect in forested habitats seems to be mainly related to the destruction of litter, which played an important role as a physical barrier to seedling emergence, and to the increase in light availability, which has a positive effect on seedling survival and can result from litter consumption or the burning/scorching of the canopies. Our results demonstrate that fire can increase the invasion risk posed by E. globulus to the native vegetation next to plantations, especially in native oak forests, which had been shown to be rather resistant to E. globulus seedling establishment in the absence of fire. This increased seedling recruitment in burnt areas together with the high fire-proneness of eucalypts could lead to positive feedbacks that may favour eucalypt expansion, further increasing the vulnerability of the native vegetation to colonization by this alien tree.

AB Geodiversity plays an important role in species establishment during spontaneous succession. At post mining sites in the Czech Republic in 2003, we established plots in which the surface of the heaped overburden was either kept wave-like or leveled. Based on surveys conducted from 2006 to 2015, leveled plots were increasingly dominated by grasses and herbs (and especially by the grass Calamagrostis epigejos) while the wave-like plots were increasingly dominated by the trees Salix caprea and Betula pendula.
   In 2015, a detailed survey was conducted of the dominant species. Both S. caprea and B. pendula occurred more often in wave-like plots than in leveled plots; this was particularly true for trees taller than 1 m, which were absent in leveled plots. In wave-like plots, leaf and root biomasses of both woody species were higher on the wave slopes than on the wave depressions. Nitrogen content was higher but content stress indicating proline in leaves of S. caprea was lower in wave-like plots than in leveled plots. In wave-like plots, both woody species occurred mainly on wave slopes but C epigejos occurred mainly in the depressions. We speculate that trees were more abundant in wave-like plots than in leveled plots because the waves trapped tree seeds and snow and because the soil porosity was greater in wave-like than in leveled plots. Grasses may have preferred the leveled plots because soil porosity was lower and clay content was higher in leveled than in wave-like plots. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Contrasting evidence in the degree of post-fire conifer invasion reported for different regions of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) raises questions about the role of fire as a presumed driver of invasion. We studied the influence of fire on invasion responses (assessing 'serotiny' and 'time' as key factors to determine invasion) based on a review of case studies performed in natural habitats of the SH. Our work showed that burned environments have no lag time with respect to invasion and are more susceptible to serotinous pine invasion than are unburned environments. Also, serotinous pines reached extremely high densities in burned habitats, exceeding records for the same species in unburned habitats, as well as for non-serotinous pines in any habitat condition. Therefore, burned environments are impacted by conifer invasion earlier and more intensively than unburned ones. Overall, our work indicates that fire is a leading driver of invasion, but only for serotinous pines. This highlights the importance of considering life history traits of introduced species to determine the probability and extent of invasion in relation to disturbance. We discuss the implications of introducing serotinous species in regions of the SH where serotiny is absent from native flora. Lastly, we provide suggestions for prioritizing management and further study.

AB In this study, we reconstruct the first time-calibrated phylogeny of the iconic antlion family, the Myrmeleontidae (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontiformia). We use maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference to analyse a molecular dataset based on seven mitochondrial and nuclear gene markers. The dataset encompasses 106 species of Neuroptera, including 94 antlion species. The resulting phylogenetic framework provides support for a myrmeleontid classification distinguishing four subfamilies: Acanthaclisinae, Myrmeleontinae, Palparinae, and Stilbopteryginae. Within Myrmeleontinae, Myrmecaelurini and Nemoleontini are recovered as monophyletic clades; Gepini also appears as a valid tribe, distinct from Myrmecaelurini whereas Myrmecaelurini and Nesoleontini on one hand and Brachynemurini and Dendroleontini on the other hand, appear closely related. Some preliminary information related to generic and specific levels are also implied from our results, such as the paraphyly of several genera. Dating analyses based on thoroughly evaluated fossil calibrations indicate that the antlion family likely originated in the Cretaceous, between 135 and 138 million years ago (depending on the set of fossil calibrations), and that all higher-level lineages appeared during the Early Cretaceous. This first phylogenetic hypothesis will provide a valuable basis to further expand the taxonomic coverage and molecular sampling, and to lay the foundations of future systematic revisions.

AB With ecosystems increasingly having co-occurring invasive species, it is becoming more important to understand invasive species interactions. At the southern end of the Americas, American beavers (Castor canadensis), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), and American mink (Neovison vison), were independently introduced. We used generalized linear models to investigate how muskrat presence related to beaver-modified habitats on Navarino Island, Chile. We also investigated the trophic interactions of the mink with muskrats and beavers by studying mink diet. Additionally, we proposed a conceptual species interaction framework involving these invasive species on the new terrestrial community. Our results indicated a positive association between muskrat presence and beaver-modified habitats. Model average coefficients indicated that muskrats preferred beaver-modified freshwater ecosystems, compared to not dammed naturally flowing streams. In addition, mammals and fish represented the main prey items for mink. Although fish were mink's dominant prey in marine coastal habitats, muskrats represented >50 % of the biomass of mink diet in inland environments. We propose that beavers affect river flow and native vegetation, changing forests into wetlands with abundant grasses and rush vegetation. Thus, beavers facilitate the existence of muskrats, which in turn sustain inland mink populations. The latter have major impacts on the native biota, especially on native birds and small rodents. The facilitative interactions among beavers, muskrats, and mink that we explored in this study, together with other non-native species, suggest that an invasive meltdown process may exist; however further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis. Finally, we propose a community-level management to conserve the biological integrity of native ecosystems.

AB Trophic cascades caused by a reduction in predators of sea urchins have been reported in Indian Ocean and Caribbean coral reefs. Previous studies have been constrained by their site-specific nature and limited spatial replication, which has produced site and species-specific understanding that can potentially preclude larger community-organization nuances and generalizations. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the extent and variability of the cascade community in response to fishing across similar to 23 degrees of latitude and longitude in coral reefs in the southwestern Indian Ocean. The taxonomic composition of predators of sea urchins, the sea urchin community itself, and potential effects of changing grazer abundance on the calcifying benthic organisms were studied in 171 unique coral reef sites. We found that geography and habitat were less important than the predator-prey relationships. There were seven sea urchin community clusters that aligned with a gradient of declining fishable biomass and the abundance of a key predator, the orange-lined triggerfish (Balistapus undulatus). The orange-lined triggerfish dominated where sea urchin numbers and diversity were low but the relative abundance of wrasses and emperors increased where sea urchin numbers were high. Two-thirds of the study sites had high sea urchin biomass (>2,300 kg/ ha) and could be dominated by four different sea urchin species, Echinothrix diadema, Diadema savignyi, D. setosum, and Echinometra mathaei, depending on the community of sea urchin predators, geographic location, and water depth. One-third of the sites had low sea urchin biomass and diversity and were typified by high fish biomass, predators of sea urchins, and herbivore abundance, representing lightly fished communities with generally higher cover of calcifying algae. Calcifying algal cover was associated with low urchin abundance where as noncalcifying fleshy algal cover was not clearly associated with herbivore abundance. Fishing of the orange-lined triggerfish, an uncommon, slow-growing by-catch species with little monetary value drives the cascade and other predators appear unable to replace its ecological role in the presence of fishing. This suggests that restrictions on the catch of this species could increase the calcification service of coral reefs on a broad scale.

AB The Northern Mediterranean Current is the return branch of the cyclonic circulation of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Because of geostrophic constraints, this warm and oligotrophic current is forced to flow westward along the continental slope of the Gulf of Lion. But, occasionally, it penetrates on the shelf and strongly impacts the local biogeochemistry and in turn the primary production. By combining in situ observations and high-resolution modelling, it is shown that intrusions on the eastern part of the gulf are mainly forced by easterly or northwesterly wind events, through physical mechanisms that are very different in nature. Easterlies induce a piling of water along the Gulf of Lion coast that drives, through geostrophy, an alongshore shelf-intruding current. This intrusive current occurs independently of the stratification and is concomitant with the wind forcing. On the other hand, intrusions due to northwesterlies only occur during stratified conditions and are related to the development of upwellings along the Gulf of Lion coasts. When the upwelling develops, a northwestward alongshore pressure force balances the Coriolis force associated with the onshore flow at depth. When the winds drop, the upwelling relaxes and the onshore flow weakens. Consequently, the Coriolis force no longer counterbalances the pressure force that ultimately dominates the momentum balance, causing the displacement of the Northern Current on the Gulf of Lion shelf approximately 1 day after the wind relaxation. This time lag between the northwesterlies decrease and the intrusions permits to anticipate possible changes in the biogeochemistry of the Gulf of Lion.

AB The causes and consequences of plant flammability are a contested issue. In fire-prone ecosystems, high flammability is invoked as a trait (in combination with fire-survival traits) that enhances reproductive success and reduces competition in the post-fire environment. On the other hand, flammability may be a consequence of other selective forces, for example, deterring herbivores. Here, we use a standardised method for estimating the flammabilities of 99 species distributed across five biomes in a small area of the southwestern Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. The fire-prone Fynbos and Grassland biomes included many highly flammable species, notably among graminoids and small-leaved shrubs with densely packed, fine twigs. However, Fynbos included many weakly flammable species. In the fire-free biomes (Forest, Nama-Karoo and Thicket), most species had low flammability, especially succulents. However, flammable species also occurred in all three biomes, including species with traits normally attributed to non-flammable species (e.g. large leaves sparsely arranged on coarse twigs). Since these biomes are fire-free, flammability in these species cannot be attributed to a fire-related selective regime. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pathogen contamination of drinking water lakes and reservoirs is a severe threat to human health worldwide. A major source of pathogens in surface sources of drinking waters is from body-contact recreation in the water body. However, dispersion pathways of human waterborne pathogens from recreational beaches, where body-contact recreation is known to occur to drinking water intakes, and the associated risk of pathogens entering the drinking water supply remain largely undocumented. A high spatial resolution, three-dimensional hydrodynamic and particle tracking modeling approach has been developed to analyze the risk and mechanisms presented by pathogen dispersion. The pathogen model represents the processes of particle release, transport and survival. Here survival is a function of both water temperature and cumulative exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Pathogen transport is simulated using a novel and computationally efficient technique of tracking particle trajectories backwards, from a drinking water intake toward their source areas. The model has been applied to a large, alpine lake - Lake Tahoe, CA-NV (USA), The dispersion model results reveal that for this particular lake (1) the risk of human waterborne pathogens to enter drinking water intakes is low, but significant; (2) this risk is strongly related to the depth of the thermocline in relation to the depth of the intake; (3) the risk increases with the seasonal deepening of the surface mixed layer; and (4) the risk increases at night when the surface mixed layer deepens through convective mixing and inactivation by UV radiation is eliminated. While these risk factors will quantitatively vary in different lakes, these same mechanisms will govern the process of transport of pathogens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In French Guiana, the leaf and cambium phenologies should not be considered only as exogenous-driven processes, as the dry season, but also as endogenous-driven, as tree development stage.
   Studies of the periodicity of wood formation provide essential data on tree age and on factors that control tree growth. The aim of this work was to investigate cambial phenology and its relation with leaf phenology and climatic seasonality in two briefly deciduous tropical rainforest species belonging to the genus Parkia. Wood microcores were collected every 15 days from April 2009 to February 2012 from five trees of each species. The microcores were stained with cresyl violet acetate to facilitate counting the number of cells in the cambial zone, in the radial enlargement zone and wall-thickening zone. At the same time, we observed leaf shedding pattern in the crown of the same trees. In both species, cambial activity was significantly reduced during the leafless period. In P. nitida, these two concomitant events were observed during the dry season whereas in P. velutina they can occur anytime in the year with no apparent link with seasonality. In conclusion, the period of reduced cambial activity in some tropical rainforest trees may be independent of rainfall seasonality and not necessarily follow an annual cycle. It appears that leaf phenology is a good proxy to estimate cambial activity.

AB 1. Savannas are highly heterogeneous tree-grass mixtures, and the structural variation imposed by a discontinuous canopy cover results in spatial variation in soil properties such as plant-available nutrients, temperature and soil moisture. Many savannas are also dominated by large vertebrate herbivores, which impose a different suite of effects on soil properties related to consumption, excretion and physical disturbance.
   2. In nutrient-poor, water-limited systems, variation in soil resource availability may play a fundamental role in structuring plant communities, but the relative and interactive effects of key drivers of heterogeneity have received little attention in savanna ecosystems.
   3. We investigated the independent and interactive effects of herbivores and tree canopy cover on multiple soil properties up to a depth of 10 cm, including bulk density, soil C pools, total and plant-available nutrients, moisture dynamics and temperature at two contrasting sites in Kruger National Park, South Africa. We analysed samples from locations under and between adult tree canopies and inside and outside long-term herbivore exclosures using a nested design.
   4. We found strong positive effects of tree canopies on total and labile pools of soil C and N and negative effects on plant-available P and soil temperature. Tree canopy effects on soil moisture availability were small but clearly detectable. During precipitation events, trees increased moisture inputs on granite soils but decreased moisture inputs on basalt soils compared to open sites.
   5. Conversely, we found mixed evidence for herbivore effects on soil chemistry and temperature, but a clearer effect on soil moisture, with areas outside exclosures experiencing higher soil moisture retention, particularly immediately following precipitation events. Soil bulk density, a driver of both nutrient and soil moisture dynamics, was lower under trees and when herbivores were excluded.
   6. Synthesis. Our results suggest that variation in tree cover is the dominant biotic driver of C, N and P dynamics in these savanna systems in the top 10 cm of soil, that herbivores primarily affect soil moisture content, and that canopy and herbivore effects tend to be additive rather than synergistic.

AB Question
   Pollinators are often implicated in the origin of plant species, but their role during the assembly of diverse plant communities has only rarely been investigated. Intra-specific competition for pollinators can theoretically facilitate plant species co-occurrence by limiting the density of any one species, while inter-specific competition can potentially structure communities through the exclusion of inferior competitors. We analyse plant community composition and use field experiments to test whether intra- and inter-specific competition for pollinators structures communities of co-occurring Erica species.
   Location
   Cape Floral Region, southwestern South Africa (ca. 34 degrees S, 18 degrees E).
   Methods and Results
   In the study area, the genus Erica has diversified into ca. 680 species that differ primarily in their floral morphologies, reflecting insect, bird and wind pollination syndromes. Vegetation plot data from nine regions throughout the Fynbos Biome were used to test whether the frequency of co-occurrence of species with the same pollination syndrome differs from a null model of random community assembly. We found that Erica communities were assembled randomly with respect to pollination in six regions, but that pollination syndrome co-occurrence was significantly lower than expected in three regions. This over-dispersion of syndromes across communities is consistent with communities being structured by inter-specific competition for pollinators. To better understand the processes generating these patterns, we conducted competition experiments with six Erica species that share the Orange-breasted sunbird (Anthobaphes violacea) as pollinator. We transplanted inflorescences of a focal Erica species into communities containing another resident Orange-breasted sunbird bird-pollinated Erica species and recorded pollination and nectar robbing rates in both the resident and the transplanted species in relation to the floral density of the resident species. Consistent with the observed community structure, pollination rate in both the resident and the introduced species declined with increasing density of the resident species, but the effect was not consistent among all populations. Nectar robbing rates of the resident species were negatively related to its own density.
   Conclusion
   Our analyses concur that both intra- and inter-specific competition for pollination can contribute to structuring plant communities, but it is not the dominant factor structuring Erica communities.

AB Large grazers have played a fundamental role in grassland and savannah ecosystems since these vegetation types formed in the late Miocene, but the feedback loops between vegetation and large grazers are still not well understood. Modern dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) lack the explicit impact of herbivoly, but are calibrated to benchmarks including herbivory. We coupled a generalized model for the population dynamics of large mammalian grazers, based on animal physiology, with a plant-physiological model for vegetation dynamics and ecosystem processes, applicable at local to global scales (LPJ-GUESS). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine process-based grazer population and vegetation modelling in a single generalized modelling framework, applicable at regional to continental scales. The capability of the coupled model to reproduce real-world grazer densities was tested by comparing modelled biomass densities with empirical data from African game parks, where semi-natural grazer populations still exist. The model reproduced inter-park differences in long-term average grazer biomass densities and yielded similar dependencies between major environmental drivers (e.g. precipitation, annual net primary productivity (NPP), dry season length) and grazer population densities as found in other more empirical studies. Amongst the potential environmental drivers, modelled NPP and dry season length were most strongly correlated with empirical and modelled biomass densities. Major discrepancies between modelled and empirical densities occurred for individual parks, but this was expected because the model did not include all factors that influence grazer populations (e.g. nutrient dynamics and poaching). The generalized flexible framework of the coupled model makes it possible to apply the model to other regions, to include further processes (if data for parameterizing them is available) and to parameterize other types of grazers. It could become a useful tool for investigating interactions between grazers and vegetation in a process-based framework. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The conservation of wide-ranging, territorial carnivores presents many challenges, not least the inadequacy of many protected areas in providing sufficient space to allow such species to maintain viable populations. As a result populations occurring outside protected areas may be of considerable importance for the conservation of some species, although the significance of these areas is poorly understood. Brown hyaenas Parahyaena brunnea are categorized as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List and recent research suggests the species may be particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and the conversion of land to agriculture. Here we report on the population density and abundance of brown hyaenas in an area of commercial farmland in western Botswana. Mean brown hyaena density estimated from camera-trap surveys was 2.3 per 100 km(2) and from spoor surveys 2.88 per 100 km(2), which are comparable to estimates reported for protected areas. Estimated densities were higher on farms used for livestock production than on those used for game farming, suggesting that the species can tolerate land-use change where reliable alternative food resources exist. Our results indicate that populations of brown hyaenas in non-protected areas comprise a significant proportion of the global population and that such areas may be of critical importance for their conservation.

AB We present a test involving a large number of data-analytical techniques to identify a rigorous numerical classification method optimising on statistically identified faithful species. The test follows a stepwise filtering process involving various numerical-classification tools. Five steps were involved in the testing: (1) evaluation of 322 classification tools using OptimClass 1; (2) comparison of 20 best performing methods by standardising the various performances across a range of fidelity values using OptimClass 1 and OptimClass 2, to assess the effectiveness of the agglomerative clustering and one divisive technique; (3) calculation and comparison of Uniqueness values and ISAMIC (Indicator Species Analysis Minimising Intermediate Constancies) scores of the resulting classifications; (4) comparison of different classifications by analysing the similarities of the resulting synoptic tables using faithful species, assuming that clusters with similar faithful species represent corresponding vegetation types, and (5) final selection of the single best method based on an expert review of non-geometric internal evaluators, NMDS ordinations and mapped classification solutions. A complex data set, representing many forest vegetation types and consisting of 506 releves of 20 m x 20 m sampled in the indigenous forests of Mpumalanga Province (South Africa), was tested. Analysis of Uniqueness provided insight into which methods produced classifications that did not share faithful species. The analysis of synoptic table similarity showed that the classification results were at most 88% similar, while in the most divergent case similarity of only 50% was achieved. OptimClass eliminated poorly performing numerical-classification combinations and highlighted the best performing methods. Yet it was unable to reveal the single best performing method unequivocally across the range of fidelity values used. In such cases, we suggest the solution can be sought in relying on involving external data through expert opinion. Ordinal Clustering and TWINSPAN produced the most outlying classification results. Flexible beta clustering (beta = -0.25) in combination with Bray-Curtis coefficient, standardised by sample unit totals, produced the most informative result for our data set when using informal expert-defined ecological and biogeographical judgement criteria. We recommend that the performance of a set of methods be tested prior to selecting the final classification approach.

TI Estimation of Total Length from Head Length of Saltwater Crocodiles

AB Populations of Saltwater Crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) have been monitored in the Northern Territory since the species' protection. This monitoring relies on standardized spotlight surveys in which crocodiles are counted and classified by estimated total length (TL). Although the accurate estimation of TL is important for analyses, often crocodiles are submerged and their TL is estimated from their heads, which may be visible above the water surface. With some variation, it is generally thought that TL of a crocodile is seven times the length of the animal's head. This study examined the ratio of TL to head length (HL) from morphological measurements of 2,755 Saltwater Crocodiles caught in various locations in the Northern Territory. The results showed that the generic ratio for crocodiles ranging from 38 to 503 cm was 7.01. The ratio increased logistically from 6.7 to 7.1 for crocodiles in the 120-420-cm size range in TL in 30-cm intervals. We suggest that TL can be reliably estimated from HL at least for crocodiles in 120-420 cm in the wild, with the use of the generic and size-specific ratios calculated for the various size classes at every 30 cm. The size-specific estimation for animals <120 cm or >420 cm was not possible because of limited sample sizes in these crocodile size ranges, although a few reliable records suggest that a ratio increasingly becomes larger and 1:8 should be used for crocodiles >510 cm in TL.

AB The present study implemented a regional phenological model that was derived through the growing season index and adapted to a widespread Mediterranean species, the olive (Olea europaea L.). This model considers not only individual phenological events, but also the main vegetative and reproductive phenological phases of the species, in an integrated biological approach. The regional model generally does not need to include specific meteorological variables calculated as weekly or monthly averages which could limit the extrapolation over large areas. The main climatic limitations of the olive cultivation areas in the south Mediterranean at latitudes around 10A degrees (practically speaking, the geographical limits of the olive) are estimated here. This analysis uses information relating to local climatic changes over the last two decades (1990-1999, 2000-2009) to provide interpretations of the temperature, solar radiation rate, and evapotranspiration trends. This has allowed creation of a Mediterranean phenological model adapted to the olive, which presents the contemporary climate requirements during winter and the warm summer season. The climate analysis and comparisons of these two decades has allowed us to reveal a reduction in the index according to the minimum temperature, which has particular consequences in the northern monitoring areas. This phenomenon appears to present new positive scenarios for the future regarding a northward shift of olive cultivation areas, due to the potential enlargement of the growing season in winter. However, negative scenarios can also be foreseen in consideration of the failure to satisfy the minimum chilling requirements in the traditional southern cultivation areas of the olive.

AB Altruistic behavior, in which one individual provides aid to another at some cost to itself, is well documented. However, some species engage in a form of altruism, called rescue, that places the altruist in immediate danger. Here we investigate one such example, namely rescuing victims captured by predators. In a field experiment with two North American ant species, Tetramorium sp. E and Prenolepis imparis, individuals were held in artificial snares simulating capture. T. sp. E, but not P. imparis, exhibited digging, pulling, and snare biting, the latter precisely targeted to the object binding the victim. These results are the first to document precision rescue in a North American ant species; moreover, unlike rescue in other ants, T. sp. E rescues conspecifics from different colonies, mirroring their atypical social behavior, namely the lack of aggression between non-nestmate (heterocolonial) conspecifics. In a second, observational study designed to demonstrate rescue from an actual predator, T. sp. E victims were dropped into an antlion's pit and the behavior of a single rescuer was observed. Results showed that T. sp. E not only attempted to release the victim, but also risked attacking the predator, suggesting that precision rescue may play an important role in this species' antipredator behavior.

AB The Mongolian plateau in East Asia is part of a new hotspot of land cover change. Recent human activity and natural forces have degraded grasslands in northern China with the southern Mongolia steppe similarly vulnerable. Investigating vegetation patterns at piospheres (the area around water points) can identify herder influence on pasture conditions. Through fieldwork and remote sensing this paper examines plant density and species richness at water sources to establish land cover patterns in two Mongolian provinces where overgrazing is thought to be the major cause of degradation. In contrast to standard piosphere patterns, vegetation was greater near water points and decreased with distance. This suggests that livestock are not concentrated at water points in Mongolia and that piosphere dynamics are more influenced by precipitation, edaphic factors and potential distinctive processes in cold drylands. It implies that pastoralism, with mobile livestock management, is a suitable adaptive strategy to the low forage capacity of steppe grasslands.

AB Aim Our aims were (1) to compare observed, estimated and predicted patterns of species richness using the Australian native Asteraceae as an example, (2) to identify candidates for hotspots of diversity for the study group, and (3) to examine the distortion of our perception of the spatial distribution of species richness through uneven or misdirected sampling efforts. Location Australia. Methods Based on data from Australias Virtual Herbarium, we calculated and visualized observed species richness, the Chao1 estimate of richness, the C index of collecting completeness, and an estimate of richness derived from environmental niche modelling for grid cells at a resolution of 1 degrees. The 20 cells with the highest diversity values were used to define hotspots of diversity. Results Uneven collecting activity results in misleading diversity patterns for the family Asteraceae. While observed species richness is much higher in central Australia than in other parts of the arid interior, this is an artefact resulting from the area being a hotspot of collecting activity. The mountain ranges of south-eastern Australia and Tasmania are candidates for unbiased hotspots of species richness. Main conclusions Vast areas of the Australian interior are insufficiently sampled on a local scale, although most of them can be expected to be relatively species poor. Some areas in the south-east and south-west of the continent remain undersampled relative to their high species richness. Observed species numbers, estimators and environmental niche-modelling all have their unique advantages and disadvantages for the inference of patterns of diversity.

AB Nectar-feeding birds are important pollinators in fire-prone regions of the world, but the impact of fires on these bird communities has seldom been studied. Nectar-feeding bird communities were censused during peak flowering, before and after fire in the Cape fynbos of South Africa. The abundance and species richness of nectar-feeding birds decreased at all sites. In a controlled experiment, two common bird-pollinated plants, which flower profusely after a fire, were presented in floral arrays in burnt and unburnt vegetation. Birds visited flowers only in the unburnt areas. The results are surprising given the large number of bird-pollinated plants that have fire-stimulated flowering.

AB No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are commonly applied in community-based management schemes to sustain and enhance coral-reef fisheries. However, many MPAs in Fiji and the South Pacific are relatively small (<= 1 km(2)), and few data exist regarding the effects of these MPAs on populations of exploited species. We used hook-and-line fishing surveys to assess whether 4 relatively small (<1 km(2)) community-based MPAs in Fiji (3 current, 1 former) were providing any commonly sought benefits to exploited reef-fish stocks. All of the MPAs had maintained no-take status for over 4 yr, although the former MPA was opened to fishing 4 mo before this study. The current MPAs exhibited significantly greater catch and biomass per unit effort, individual fish biomass, and/or percentage of reproductive-size fish than paired, adjacent fished areas, while this was not the case with the former MPA. Sites with intact MPAs also exhibited greater catch diversity than the former MPA site. Additionally, tag and recapture data from the 17 recaptured of 2650 tagged fish suggest site fidelity of these fishes, although fishes initially captured in the MPA at all 4 sites were later caught in fished areas, indicating that there is movement of fishes from the MPAs to fished areas. While the combination of these findings supports the utility of even relatively small MPAs as effective tools for the conservation of certain target species, it also suggests that MPA benefits may be quickly depleted and that even closures of extended duration may be insufficient for long-term fisheries management if the MPAs are not maintained.

AB Understanding the role that protected areas play in the livelihood security of local communities is essential to ensure that local people are not left shouldering the costs of what is a public good, and to help maintain robust local and national constituencies for biodiversity conservation. To provide baseline data for a longitudinal study on the effects of newly established national parks on human livelihoods in Gabon we conducted a cross-sectional study that compared livelihood indicators between communities that do, and do not, use natural resources within protected areas. We interviewed 2,035 households in 117 villages at four sites, recording income, consumption, education, health indicators and social capital, and village characteristics such as distance to markets, distance to park boundaries, and land cover within a 5-km radius. Our results indicated that closed rainforest coverage was greater around park than control villages and that this difference was associated with a greater reliance of park households on forest resources. However, we found no systematic differences in most livelihood measures between park and control households. Instead, the relationship between household livelihood measures and proximity to parks varied in idiosyncratic ways between sites, suggesting that determinants of human welfare are highly localized and cannot be generalized to larger spatial scales.

AB Prey preferences of large carnivores (tiger (Panthera tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus) and dhole (Cuon alpinus)) in the tropical forest of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) were evaluated. This was the first study in ATR to estimate the density of prey and the food habits of these large carnivores. The 958-km(2) intensive study area was found to have a high mammalian prey density (72.1 animals per square kilometre) with wild boar (20.61 animals per square kilometre) and chital (20.54 animals per square kilometre) being the most common species, followed by nilgiri tahr (13.6 animals per square kilometre). When the density figures were multiplied by the average weight of each prey species, a high biomass density of 14,204 kg km(-2) was obtained for the intensive study area. Scat analysis and incidental kill observation were used to determine the dietary composition of these predators. During the study from the period of March 2001 to April 2004, 1,145 tiger scats, 595 leopard scats and 2,074 dhole scats were collected and analysed. Kill data were based on direct observation of 66 tiger kills and 39 leopard kills. Sambar, with a density of 6.54 kg km(-2) was the preferred prey for these carnivores. Sambar constitutes 35% of the overall diet of tiger, whereas it constitutes 17% and 25% in leopard and dhole diets, respectively. Chital was utilized less than sambar in the range of about 7%, 11% and 15% by tiger, leopard and dhole, respectively. Predator diet was estimated more accurately by scat analysis, which reveals 30% of smaller prey species in leopard's diet, which was not observed by kill data. This study reveals that ATR harbours high prey density, and these large carnivores seem mostly dependent on the wild prey rather than on domestic livestock as in some other areas in the subcontinent. These factors make ATR a potential area for long-term conservation of these endangered carnivores.

AB We explored the role of group living and cooperation in resource use in a spider community where 4 congeneric species of similar body size, but with behaviors ranging from near-solitary to fully social, co-occur. We found that the range of insect sizes captured by each species reflected their nest and colony size so that species with larger colonies and prey capture webs captured larger insects than less social species. Yet, among those species whose webs did not differ significantly in size-the 2 with the largest and the 2 with the smallest webs-one captured significantly larger insects than the other. This pattern was apparently due to differences in the extent to which nest mates cooperated in the capture of prey, as in only one of the species in each pair did the size of the insects captured increase with colony size. The 4 species were thus packed along the spectrum of available insect sizes from least to most social, with limited overlap between contiguous species. The pattern of resource use was thus more overdispersed than expected by chance, as would be expected if the species had been assembled or differentiated to avoid extensive dietary overlap. We consider alternative hypotheses to explain these patterns and suggest that group size and level of cooperation may play an important role in the dietary segregation of sympatric organisms. Key words: Anelosimus, community assemblage, cooperation, group foraging, prey size, resource partitioning, species coexistence. [Behav Ecol 22: 630-638 (2011)]

AB Analyses of richness and endemism of Cyatheales (tree ferns) in tropical America were performed and evidence of a diversity gradient is presented. For this, the occurrence ranges of 239 species were plotted into a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid-cell map and then analyzed using species richness and endemism indices. Here we show that species richness and endemism are not distributed randomly over the landscape, but do aggregate into defined regions of high diversity in tropical America: the northern Andes, lower Central America, upper Central America and Mexico, the Guyana Highlands, southeastern Brazil, and the Antilles. These distributional patterns are congruent with the geographical distribution of cloud forest, which in turn is determined by topography, high humidity, and persistent cloud immersion. The mountain regions of tropical America, especially the cloud forests, harbour most of the species of American Cyatheales and have high levels of habitat loss and climatic fragility. Conservation policies for Cyatheales are centred on the local use and trade of many tree fern species, but none such policies focus on cloud forest habitat loss. This makes tree ferns a critically endangered group of plants. In the face of the current environmental crisis and global climate change, the presence of Cyatheales in these regions sounds the alarm on their conservation priorities.

AB Documenting the basic patterns of biodiversity and accurately determining the priority areas are the first steps for conservation studies. Threatened species and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red Lists are among the widely used tools to identify protected areas. Turkey is one of the most important biodiversity centres in the world. The plant diversity of Turkey with over 30% endemic species of approximately 12000 natural vascular plant taxa is well documented through use of a Grid System. However, Turkey has suffered heavy anthropogenic effects having been a settlement for many civilisations throughout the history of humankind. Therefore, Turkey needs a quantitative evaluation of the importance of different grid squares for conserving plant diversity. This paper offers a quantitative approach for aiding the identification of priority areas for biodiversity conservation by analysing the threatened plants in each grid square in terms of endemism, risk categories and distribution characteristics. The grid squares (nearly 220 x 170 km(2)) were then classified within four different groups in terms of their conservation importance. This national-level information can be used for further research and decision-making processes for conservation planning. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Soil particle-size distribution (PSD) is one of the most fundamental physical attributes of soil due to its strong influence on other soil properties related to water movement, productivity, and soil erosion. Characterizing variation of PSD in soils is an important issue in environmental research. Using ordination methods to characterize particle size distributions (PSDs) on a small-scale is very limited. In this paper, we selected the Cele River Basin on the north slope of the Middle Kunlun Mountains as a study area and investigated vegetation and soil conditions from 1960 to 4070 m a.s.l. Soil particle-size distributions obtained by laser diffractometry were used as a source data matrix. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) ordination was applied to analyse the variation characteristics of PSDs and the relationships between PSDs and environmental factors. Moreover, single fractal dimensions were calculated to support the interpretation of the ordination results. Our results indicate that a differentiation of 16 particle fractions can sufficiently characterize the PSDs in CCA biplots. Elevation has the greatest effect on PSDs: the soil fine fractions increase gradually with increasing elevation. In addition, soil pH, water and total salt content are significantly correlated with PSDs. CCA ordination biplots show that soil and vegetation patterns correspond with one another, indicating a tight link between soil PSDs and plant communities on a small scale in arid regions. The results of fractal dimensions analysis were rather similar to CCA ordination results, but they yielded less detailed information about PSDs. Our study shows that ordination methods can be beneficially used in research into PSDs and, combined with fractal measures, can provide comprehensive information about PSDs.

AB Many carnivores are difficult and labour-intensive to detect, often leading to prohibitively high effort and cost in large-scale surveys. However, such studies provide information that is important for effective management and conservation. Here, we evaluate the suitability of three survey methods for landscape-scale multi-species monitoring. We compare sign surveys, spotlighting, and audio playbacks in terms of detection efficiency, precision, effort, and cost. Sign surveys out-performed the other methods in all comparison criteria, although supplementary methods were needed for some species and sites. We found that using established analysis techniques, robust landscape-scale abundance estimates would require unrealistically high effort and cost. Occupancy estimation required considerably lower sample sizes and was therefore more economical. We conclude that sign-based occupancy estimates constitute a versatile and efficient option for future large-scale, multi-species carnivore surveys.

AB Competitive coexistence depends on dynamic interactions between competitor and resource populations, including mutualism between the resource and each competitor. We add mutualism to a well-known model of resource competition and show that it can powerfully stabilize competitive coexistence in the absence or presence of resource heterogeneity. We use a transition matrix approach to describe lottery competition, while allowing each of two competitors to affect the population dynamics of their shared resource. For example, two plant-defending ant species may compete for nesting space within ant-adapted (myrmecophytic) plants. We show that mutualism between consumers and a resource species can stabilize competitive coexistence of the consumers by allowing each competitor to influence resource dynamics in a way that benefits the other. The effect of this novel coexistence mechanism depends on a mutualism's biological details: for example, altering myrmecophyte fecundity affects competing ant species differently than does altering plant survival. Finally, we consider a heterogeneous resource (e.g., two types of nest site) and show how niche partitioning can stabilize coexistence in the absence of resource dynamics. When resource heterogeneity is dynamic (e.g., small and large plants of the same species), niche partitioning also provides new routes for additional stabilization via mutualism.

AB Water points provide excellent sites for studying overgrazing effects on plant communities in dry areas. Distance from water can be considered like a surrogate of grazing pressure being high near the water and low away from it. The main aim of this study is to investigate overgrazing effects on acceptability of fodder plants along a grazing gradient around three natural watering points. To achieve this goal, we classified spontaneous plants according to their acceptability degree and we followed their cover, richness and density as well as the grazing value along a grazing gradient around these wells, using phyto-ecological studies during the spring 2004 and 2006. Main results show that very palatable plants (mainly constituted by annuals) are more dominant in both the closed and the more disturbed transect areas around wells. The unpalatable plants dominate sites with moderate disturbance around wells. Ligneous palatable species obviously have a lower degree of disturbance. During the studied seasons the grazing gradient around wells 1 and 2, the oldest ones, seemed to exert a feedback upon the grazing intensity. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB While there are numerous studies of impacts by individual invader species, there are few syntheses of invader impacts on plant community structure and composition. We sought to identify native plant functional groups (PFGs) which are under-represented in post-invaded compared with non-invaded environments to determine whether different invader morphologies consistently suppressed native species richness within particular PFGs.
   We conducted a meta-analysis of 20 international studies to analyse the effects of graminoid (grass and grass-like species) and woody (shrub or tree species) invaders on species richness within growth form, longevity and seed mass native PFGs.
   Graminoid and woody invaders could not be distinguished by their effects on native PFGs: in most cases, native PFGs were negatively affected by both graminoid and woody invaders. However, within the growth form classification, we found that negative invader effects were greater for native graminoid than tree species. Perennial rather than short-lived species appeared more affected by invasion (particularly graminoid invasion). Species with small seed masses appeared more negatively affected than those with large seed masses, particularly by graminoid invaders.
   Synthesis and applications. Despite different morphologies of graminoid and woody invaders, they had similar negative effects on species richness within a range of native plant functional groups (PFGs). Further, the response of many PFGs to graminoid invaders in particular was highly variable. In consequence, managers cannot rely on invader morphology to distinguish impacts and prioritize control efforts. While graminoid and woody invaders had similar impacts, they had particularly adverse effects on small herbaceous (especially graminoid) and perennial species. Managers should focus monitoring activities on these potentially under-represented PFGs following control of both woody and graminoid invaders. Native species belonging to herbaceous and perennial PFGs may require focused reintroduction following control efforts.

AB The red sea urchin Loxechinus albus, in economically important species occurring along the Chilean littoral benthic systems, has been heavily exploited by artisanal fisheries in recent decades. However, basic knowledge of its trophic biology is still scarce. Studies of this kind are critical to the successful development of farming techniques as an alternative to the harvest of natural populations. The aims of this study were to quantify the composition of L. albus' natural diet, to determine the assimilation efficiency of the most important dietary components, and to experimentally examine the species' trophic selectivity. Adult and juvenile specimens were sampled in spring 1993 and summer, fall and winter 1994 from the shallow subtidal zone of Iquique, northern Chile. Neither juveniles nor adults showed significant seasonal differences in dietary composition. The main items in the diet were the green alga Ulva sp. for juveniles and the kelp Lessonia sp. for adults. In adults, assimilation efficiency (as percentage of the total organic matter ingested) was not significantly different among individuals that consumed Lessonia sp. (48.7%), U/va sp. (44.6%) and Macrocystis (38.1%), whereas in juveniles assimilation efficiency was significantly higher for individuals fed on the chlorophyte Ulva sp. (55.4%), followed by Lessonia sp. (35.0%) and Macrocystis (25.5%). These results suggest that L. albus undergoes an ontogenetic shift in the diet, consisting of a differential foraging strategy between juveniles and adults.

AB Fluctuating hydrochemistry, as a result of extreme hydrological regimes, imposes major physiological constraints on the biota of ephemeral saline lakes. While the inverse relationship between salinity and zooplankton species richness is well-known across salinity gradients, few studies have documented closely the response of zooplankton to seasonal changes in salinity. Weekly sampling during two flood seasons at Sua Pan, an intermittent saline lake in central Botswana demonstrated the importance of spatial and temporal salinity gradients for crustacean community composition, associated with a decline in species richness, from 11 to three species. Conductivity ranged between 320 and 125,800 mu S cm(-1) during seasonal flooding; changing from dominance by HCO3- and CO3-, Ca2+ and Mg2+, at the beginning of the floods, to NaCl dominated waters as the lake dried out and salinities increased. pH estimates generally ranged between 8.6 and 10, with maximum values recorded during initial flooding. Crustaceans comprised mainly Branchinella spinosa, Moina belli, Lovenula africana and Limnocythere tudoranceai, all of which occurred across a wide range of salinities, while halotolerant freshwater species (Metadiaptomus transvaalensis, Leptestheria striatochonca and the ostracods Plesiocypridopsis aldabrae, Cypridopsis newtoni and a newly identified Potamocypris species) disappeared above conductivities of 1,500 mu S cm(-1). A unique crustacean composition in southern Africa was attributed to Sua Pans' rare chemical composition among southern African saline lakes; flood waters on Sua Pan contained a higher proportion of Na+ and HCO3-, and less K+, Mg2+ and SO42+ than over 80% of records from salt pans elsewhere in southern African. The freshwater species of crustaceans in Sua Pan were similar to those found in other southern Africa lakes, and these similarities decreased in lakes with higher pH and proportions of Na, and less SO4 and Mg in their chemical composition. The predominant saline tolerant species on Sua Pan, however, showed a greater similarity to those in saline lakes in southern and East Africa with higher proportions of HCO3- and, particularly, Mg2+ in their chemical composition.

AB Parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) was used to analyse the distributional patterns of 124 species of Mexican gymnosperms, using two different sample units: grid-cells and biogeographical provinces. PAE analyses were based on distributional data from herbarium specimens and specialized literature. Two data matrices were constructed for 60 grid-cells of 2 degrees and 14 biogeographical provinces. The analysis of the 2 degrees grid-cell matrix led to 7084 cladograms. The strict consensus cladogram showed several clades equivalent to the results obtained with the biogeographical provinces. Three clades agree with some principal regions of distribution of Mexican pines, previously identified by several authors, located at the northern portion of the Baja California peninsula, the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the Sierra Madre Oriental. These areas represent important centres of species diversity and endemism for Mexican gymnosperms. The analysis of the province matrix led to two most parsimonious cladograms, which only differed in the position of the Sierra Madre Occidental province. The iterative procedure PAE with progressive character elimination was applied to identify generalized tracks, where clades of provinces were considered equivalent to generalized tracks, and each time a cladogram was obtained, species defining its clades were deleted and a new run was undertaken. We found five generalized tracks, mainly located in montane provinces. The distribution patterns of gymnosperms agree with the existence of several Mexican biogeographical provinces, and a different historical biogeography of the Mexican peninsulas from the rest of the country is evident.

AB In this paper we present a simple diffusion model for sterile male codling moth dispersal, to investigate the effect of orchard boundaries on the pattern of spread of released sterile male codling moths. The codling moth is an important pest for apple and pear growers, with uncontrolled infestations causing significant damage to these crops. The model results are used to determine a possible control strategy. Analysis of the model reveals that release of sterile moths is most efficient if it can be done downwind of the orchard, and that control of moth damage might be enhanced by surrounding individual orchards with a row or two of non-pome fruit trees.

AB Lingcod, Ophiodon elongatus Girard, have a 3-month pelagic larval stage and are an important recreational and commercial species on the west coast of North America. Cytochrome-c oxidase I sequences from tissue samples were used to characterize population structure and infer patterns of gene flow from California to Alaska. No significant genetic structure was found when estimates of Wright's F-ST (i.e., Phi(ST)) were generated among all populations sampled. Nesting populations within regions, however, indicated that the inner coast of Washington State is distinct, a result corroborating previous allozyme work. Coalescent-based estimates of gene flow indicate that although migration can be high from an evolutionary perspective, nearly half of all comparisons among populations showed no gene flow in at least one direction. From an ecological perspective, moderate migration rates (Nm < 10) among most populations provide surprisingly limited connectivity at large (similar to 1,000 km) and small (similar to 100 km) spatial scales. Coalescent-based estimates also show that gene flow between the inner and the outer coasts is asymmetric, a result consistent with prevailing surface currents. Because the expected inter-locus variances for coalescent-based estimates of gene flow are likely large, future work will benefit from analyses of nuclear DNA markers. However, limited demographic connectivity on large spatial scales may help explain why stock recovery has been uneven, with greater recovery in the northern (87% rebuilt) than in the southern (24% rebuilt) fishery region, supporting a regional management strategy. These results suggest that despite a 3-month pelagic larval stage, some areas may be effectively closed with respect to both population dynamics and fishery management issues.

AB Scat analysis was used to determine the prey of leopards and lions in the moist savanna habitat of Comoe and Marahoue National Parks, Ivory Coast in 1983, 1990-1993 and 1995-1998. Scat contents were analysed in terms of both the relative frequency of occurrence and the relative prey biomass consumed. Selectivity for prey species was inferred by comparing observed scat counts to expected scat frequencies generated from prey density estimates. Leopards in the Comoe National Park preyed predominately upon small to medium-sized ungulates, preferring species from the forest/savanna ecotone (duikers, bushbuck), whereas species from the savanna (kob, oribi) were hunted below their relative abundance. Several different primate species (colobus monkeys, guenons) from forested habitats and large rodents (cane rats, giant pouched rats) constituted additional prey. After ungulate and primate populations dwindled due to heavy poaching, leopard predation upon large rodents and various types of minor prey items (birds, reptiles) increased significantly, while predation upon the most frequently taken ungulate prey species (kob, bushbuck) became non-selective at the same time. Similar to leopards, the lions in Comoe National Park preyed predominantly upon small to medium-sized ungulates, while large ungulates (hartebeest, buffalo and warthog) made up a surprisingly small proportion of their diet and were not preferentially killed as recorded for eastern and southern Africa. In Marahoue National Park, leopard prey did not show a clear preponderance of ungulates, but large rodents and minor prey items made up a very large proportion of its diet.

AB We analysed growth models for a population of Australian freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni). Competing growth models were tested with two data sets: individuals of known-age, and growth interval data from capture-recapture records. A von Bertalanffy function provided the best empirical fit of several growth models. The estimated asymptotic lengths (snout-vent length of males = 125.3 cm; females = 97.4 cm) agreed well with average lengths of the ten largest males and females in the population. Sexual size dimorphism in this species resulted from a combination of smaller mean length at maturity for females and a subsequent decline in female growth rate. Size dimorphism may result from individual trade-offs in age v. length at maturity as a consequence of sexual selection.

AB Inorganic particles in the upper waters of the 11 Finger Lakes of New York are morphometrically and elementally characterized by individual particle analysis conducted with scanning electron microscopy interfaced with automated image and X-ray analyses (IPA/SAX). Coupled measurements of Secchi disk transparency (SD), the attenuation coefficient for downwelling irradiance (K-d), the beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm, and turbidity (T-n) were made to support evaluation of the importance of non-living, inorganic particles (inorganic tripton) in regulating these optical features of water quality. Wide differences in levels of inorganic tripton, represented in terms of particle projected area per unit volume (PAV(in)), and the optical measures are reported for these lakes. However, generally similar size distributions are observed for the inorganic tripton for the lakes. Terrigenous suspensoids, in the form of clay minerals, dominated the inorganic tripton particle assemblage of nine lakes, while CaCO3, formed autochthonously, dominated in the other two and was a noteworthy contributor in four others. PAV(in) is demonstrated to be an important regulator of the optical properties of these lakes, performing substantially better than chlorophyll in predicting SD, and T-n and interlake differences in these optical measures.

AB Food web management is a frequently used lake restoration method, which aims to reduce phytoplankton biomass by strengthening herbivorous zooplankton through reduction of planktivorous fish. However, in clay-turbid lakes several factors may reduce the effectivity of food web management. Increasing turbidity reduces the effectivity of fish predation and weakens the link between zooplankton and phytoplankton. Therefore, the effects of fish stock manipulations may not cascade to lower trophic levels as expected. Additionally, in clay-turbid conditions invertebrate predators may coexist in high densities with planktivorous fish and negate the effects of fish reductions. For instance, in the stratifying regions of the clay-turbid Lake Hiidenvesi, Chaoborus flavicans is the main regulator of cladocerans and occupies the water column throughout the day, although planktivorous Osmerus eperlanus is very abundant. The coexistence of chaoborids and fish is facilitated by a metalimnetic turbidity peak, which prevents efficient predation by fish. In the shallow parts of the lake, chaoborids are absent despite high water turbidity. We suggest that, generally, the importance of invertebrate predators in relation to vertebrate predators may change along turbidity and depth gradients. The importance of fish predation is highest in shallow waters with low turbidity. When water depth increases, the importance of fish in the top-down regulation of zooplankton declines, whereas that of chaoborids increases, the change along the depth gradient being moderate in clear-water lakes and steep in highly turbid lakes. Thus, especially deep clay-turbid lakes may be problematic for implementing food web management as a restoration tool.

AB Seedling emergence and survival was monitored over 3 years in a holly woodland and the surrounding habitats, located in Central Spain. Ten random quadrats were established in each of the following microhabitats: inside the closed holly woodland, in small canopy gaps of this woodland, at the woodland edge, in the adjacent open grassland, under isolated fleshy-fruited shrubs in the grassland and in an adjacent oak woodland.
   Seedling emergence was maximum in closed holly woodland, from 7 to 51 seedlings m(-2) and in the gaps, from 3 to 10 seedlings m(-2). At the edge and under the shrubs emergence was lower than in the holly woodland (between 1 and 4 seedlings m(-2)), while no germination was detected in the grassland rnicrohabitat. Under the oak-woodland canopy seedling emergence was approx. 4 seedlings m(-2). Survival after the first year following germination was low inside the holly woodland, from 0 to 2% under the closed holly canopy and from 0 to 8% in the canopy gap. Survival was higher at the edge (between 25 and 54%) and under the oak woodland (27%), while under the shrubs the mortality showed a high interannual variability (from 9 to 80%). Mortality inside the holly woodland was due to the combination of a very low light availability and a high soil disturbance, the establishment in the gaps being slightly better than under the closed canopy. The oak woodland presents better conditions for survival, due to higher light levels, and lower disturbance episodes. At the edge and under the shrubs greater high levels, a higher incidence of invertebrate herbivory and lower edaphic humidity were present.
   These holly populations show patchy regeneration dynamics, with an apparent propagule-seedling conflict, due to the uncoupling of emergence and survival, resulting in a low net annual incorporation. Regeneration within the holly woodland is very limited and vegetative self-maintenance is the most viable alternative means. However, holly appears to exploit the forest ecotones and shrub invasion through sexual propagation of a young population away from parental influence.
   This work deepens the knowledge of the recruitment probabilities of these singular patchy woods, helping to develop good land management policies. This managernent should be based on the combination of the increase in self-maintenance probabilities of the previously established woodlands, and the promotion of those natural processes of population propagation documented here.

AB Although aerial surveys are an effective and commonly used method of monitoring wildlife populations, variable detection probability may result in unreliable indices or biased estimates of absolute abundance. Detection probability can vary between sites, sampling periods, species, group sizes, vegetation types and observers. These variables were examined in helicopter surveys of a suite of medium-sized mammals in a hilly environment in central eastern New South Wales. Maximum-likelihood methods were used to investigate the effects of these variables on detection probability, which was derived using the double-count technique. Significant differences were evident between species in the overall analysis, and group size, vegetation, observer pair and sampling period for various individual species when analysed separately. The implications for monitoring wildlife populations between sites and across time are discussed. This paper emphasises that aerial survey indices may be effective in detecting large differences in population size but can be improved by quantifying detection probabilities for a range of variables.

AB Recent studies suggest that nutrient variation influences rocky intertidal community structure, however empirical evidence is rare. In the Gulf of Maine, tidepools that occur on seagull feeding roosts are potentially subjected to regular nutrient loading from seagull guano. The results of a survey conducted on Swan's Island, ME show that roost tidepools have very low macroinvertebrate and macroalgal diversity as well as very high phytoplankton biomass compared to non-roost tidepools. An experiment presented here tested basic food chain hypotheses in tidepool communities. These basic food chain models predict that in a tidepool with one trophic level (phytoplankton only), phytoplankton biomass will increase when nutrients are enriched. In contrast, these models predict that in two trophic level tidepools (phytoplankton and mussels) herbivory will prevent an increase in phytoplankton biomass when nutrients are enriched. A short term 2 x 2 factorially designed field experiment was used to test this basic conceptual model using herbivory by mussels and enrichment with nitrogen as the main effects. The results of this investigation are consistent with the predictions of basic food chain models, and indicate that over the short time interval of a few days, herbivory by mussels is sufficient to maintain low phytoplankton levels following enrichment with nitrogen. Experimental enrichment with phosphorus in this study had no effect on phytoplankton biomass. The results of this study suggest that periodic pulses of nitrogen into tidepools will have little effect on phytoplankton biomass when mussels are present and that longer-term chronic nitrogen influxes may be driving the patterns of community structure in tidepools occurring on roosts.

AB Aggregations of intertidal barnacles can affect the space available for settlement of other intertidal organisms. Of particular importance is the protection such aggregations can provide for small invertebrates and fishes settling within the tests, in the parietal channels in the shells and in the small spaces between groups of shells. Protection from adverse environmental conditions such as exposure to waves, excessive heat (particularly on tropical shores), and predation is essential for many species settling as lanae or for small invertebrates which eventually may become adults too big for the barnacle tests.
   A large variety of organisms can be found in and on barnacle shells including algae that grow on and within barnacle wall plates. The numerous organisms associated with barnacles range from protozoans through to vertebrates and each group is described in detail. Of the lower invertebrates, turbellarians and polychaetes are the most common followed by isopods, arachnids. and molluscs. In the case of fishes it seems that the empty barnacle tests are used mainly as refuges, nesting sites, and for mating.
   In conclusion, the importance to intertidal communities of the structures provided by barnacles, both alive and dead, in making available additional settling sites and protection for organisms is stressed.

AB To capture their prey, larval antlions invest energy in building and maintaining conical pit traps in fine-particulate substrate. The resident antlions (Myrmeleon immaculatus) at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Michigan, USA, seldom relocated their pits, and we wondered whether this site fidelity could be understood as an optimal (or near-optimal) response to observed spatial and temporal variation in prey availability. To determine this, we considered a large number of compound foraging strategies, each composed of the number of days over which the antlion evaluates foraging success at a site; the weighted-average foraging success during this interval, below which threshold the antlion moves to a new site; and the length of the random walk taken by the antlion to a new pit location. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we determined the expected net energy gain from each of these strategies by antlions rewarded according to the field data set. The overall highest gain strategy generally agreed with our a priori expectations for the observed pattern of patchiness in prey availability over space and time. Moreover, the corresponding optimal frequency of pit relocation, 1.65 moves over the observation period of similar to 8 wk, is in rough agreement with field observations. However, the gain surface was relatively flat: 60% of the investigated strategies yielded within 8% of the maximum gain. When costs of pit relocation were reduced, maximal gain strategies shifted to generate frequent movement, suggesting that the magnitude of such sampling costs may control the foraging strategy in environments with high spatiotemporal variability.

AB The impact of turbulence and turbidity on Brachionus calyciflorus grazing rate was determined in short feeding periods (10 min), using labelled Chlorella pyrenoidosa. The response to water motion of B. calyciflorus depends on it physiological state: the grazing rate of recently fed amictic females stomach green (with one or two eggs) is significantly reduced in agitated environments compared with non-agitated environments. In contrast, the grazing rate of starved amictic females is not reduced by water motion, whatever its velocity ( V-1=0.18 m s(-1) and V-2=0.22 m s(-1)). In the presence of suspended particles (3-6-mu m silica beads), a larger reduction in grazing rate is observed in agitated water at any water velocity (V-1=0.18 m s(-1) or V-2=0.22 m s(-1)), than in stagnant water. A synergy between turbulence and turbidity is unfavourable to feeding of rotifers.

AB The life cycle of Chirocephalus kerkyrensis, a typical species of the Mediterranean plain forest, was studied in the field during 1990/91 and 1991/92.
   Temperature, and its variation, was the major factor affecting life history. Marked, sudden temperature fluctuations resulted in depressed growth add longevity. Fertility was positively correlated (P<0.001) with female body length. No decline in egg production was observed at the end of life, in contrast to other species. Hatching was observed after a long drought followed by alternating wet and dry phases. Laboratory tests on hatching gave contrasting results and showed that drying is not obligatory. Cysts stored in 100% relative humidity gave higher numbers of nauplii after a shorter time than dried ones, at all temperatures tested.

AB In tropical deciduous forest in Mexico, Jacaratia mexicana (Caricaceae) and Spondias purpurea (Anacardiaceae) are dioecious, deciduous canopy trees that flower and mature fruits while leafless. The concentration of total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) in the lower trunk is not notably reduced by reproduction in either species, and is depleted by growth only in Jacaratia. Branch TNC in Jacaratia does not differ by season, sex, age, or activity, except that fruiting branches show higher concentrations. In Spondias, at leaf senescence the branches reach TNC concentrations similar to the trunk, and branch TNC depletion is similar between the sexes but greater for reproduction than growth.

AB 1. Herbivory is a key process structuring vegetation in savannas, especially in Africa where large mammal herbivore communities remain intact. Exclusion experiments consistently show that herbivores impact savanna vegetation, but effect size variation has resisted explanation, limiting our understanding of the past, present and future roles of herbivory in savanna ecosystems.
   2. Synthesis of vegetation responses to herbivore exclusion shows that herbivory decreased grass abundance by 57.0% and tree abundance by 30.6% across African savannas.
   3. The magnitude of herbivore exclusion effects scaled with herbivore abundance: more grazing herbivores resulted in larger grass responses and more browsing herbivores in larger tree responses. However, existing experiments are concentrated in semi-arid savannas (400-800-mm rainfall) and soils data are mostly lacking, which makes disentangling environmental constraints a challenge and priority for future research.
   4. Observed herbivore impacts were similar to 2.1x larger than existing estimates modelled based on consumption. Wildlife metabolic rates may be higher than are usually used for estimating consumption, which offers one clear avenue for reconciling estimated herbivore consumption with observed herbivore impacts. Plant-soil feedbacks, plant community composition, and the phenological or demographic timing of herbivory may also influence vegetation productivity, thereby magnifying herbivore impacts.
   5. Because herbivore abundance so closely predicts vegetation impact, changes in herbivore abundance through time are likely predictive of the past and future of their impacts. Grazer diversity in Africa has declined from its peak 1 million years ago and wild grazer abundance has declined historically, suggesting that grazing likely had larger impacts in the past than it does today.
   6. Current wildlife impacts are dominated by small-bodied mixed feeders, which will likely continue into the future, but the magnitude of top-down control may also depend on changing climate, fire and atmospheric CO2.
   7. Synthesis. Herbivore biomass determines the magnitude of their impacts on savanna vegetation, with effect sizes based on direct observation that outstrip existing modelled estimates across African savannas. Findings suggest substantial ecosystem impacts of herbivory and allow us to generate evidence-based hypotheses of the past and future impacts of herbivores on savanna vegetation.

AB The shock of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disrupted food systems worldwide. Such disruption, affecting multiple systems interfaces in smallholder agriculture, is unprecedented and needs to be understood from multi-stakeholder perspectives. The multiple loops of causality in the pathways of impact renders the system outcomes unpredictable. Understanding the nature of such unpredictable pathways is critical to identify present and future systems intervention strategies. Our study aims to explore the multiple pathways of present and future impact created by the pandemic and ?Amphan? cyclonic storm on smallholder agricultural systems. Also, we anticipate the behaviour of the systems elements under different realistic scenarios of intervention. We explored the severity and multi-faceted impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable smallholder agricultural production systems through in-depth interactions with key players at the micro-level. It provided contextual information, and revealed critical insights to understand the cascading effect of the pandemic and the cyclone on farm households. We employed thematic analysis of in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders in Sundarbans areas in eastern India, to identify the present and future systems outcomes caused by the pandemic, and later compounded by ?Amphan?. The immediate adaptation strategies of the farmers were engaging family labors, exchanging labors with neighbouring farmers, borrowing money from relatives, accessing free food rations, replacing dead livestock, early harvesting, and reclamation of waterbodies. The thematic analysis identified several systems elements, such as harvesting, marketing, labor accessibility, among others, through which the impacts of the pandemic were expressed. Drawing on these outputs, we employed Mental Modeler, a Fuzzy-Logic Cognitive Mapping tool, to develop multi-stakeholder mental models for the smallholder agricultural systems of the region. Analysis of the mental models indicated the centrality of ?Kharif? (monsoon) rice production, current farm income, and investment for the next crop cycle to determine the pathways and degree of the dual impact on farm households. Current household expenditure, livestock, and soil fertility were other central elements in the shared mental model. Scenario analysis with multiple stakeholders suggested enhanced market access and current household income, sustained investment in farming, rapid improvement in affected soil, irrigation water and livestock as the most effective strategies to enhance the resilience of farm families during and after the pandemic. This study may help in formulating short and long-term intervention strategies in the post-pandemic communities, and the methodological approach can be used elsewhere to understand perturbed socioecological systems to formulate anticipatory intervention strategies based on collective wisdom of stakeholders.

AB Pollinators are key agents for ecosystems and humankind concerning biodiversity, agriculture, climate change adaptation, and all other ecosystem services. Particularly in industrialized countries pollinator diversity is in decline. The bulk of research is on entomological or plant-pollinator network related topics, but the broad range of impacts of pollinator loss on coupled human and natural systems is not yet studied. As 87% of all flowering plants depend on pollinators, they are basic for all ecosystem services to some extent. Therefore, pollinator loss might cause simultaneous degradation of ecosystem services inducing counterproductive human responses and interlinked poverty spirals. The interaction of climate change, a main risk factor for pollinators, and unadvised human responses to pollinator decline are rarely studied. Tipping points of pollinator loss are not yet identified. Can counterproductive human responses to pollinator deficiency upscale pollinator decline toward a pollinator-loss syndrome in the course of climate change? The article argues for research on the impacts of pollinator loss on other ecosystem services, useful and counterproductive human strategies on pollinator-loss induced degradation, and the integration of pollinator protection into all terrestrial restoration efforts.

AB In the first part of a taxonomic revision of the tribe Barlerieae (Acanthaceae) in Angola and Namibia, two of the four major clades of the genus Barleria L. are studied in detail, namely subg. Barleria and subg. Prionitis sect. Prionitis. Using standard morphology-based taxonomic methods, a total of 32 species and 39 taxa are delimited, of which 12 are endemic to Namibia, nine are endemic to Angola, a further four are restricted to the two countries combined and four are largely confined to the region. Hence, nearly 70% of the taxa are endemic or near-endemic to Angola and Namibia. Full descriptions, citations of types and representative specimens, and notes on their habitat(s), ecology and biogeography are provided for each taxon. Seven new species (Barleria calole, B. crabbeoides, B. craveniae, B. deserticola, B. fernandae, B. namba and B. rupicola), two new subspecies (B. lanceolata subsp. tristis and B. prionitoides subsp. strigulosa) and one new variety (B. rigida var. spinissima) are described. In addition, Barleria namutonensis Oberm. is treated as a subspecies of B. prionitoides, and B. dinteri Oberm. is treated as a subspecies of B. coriacea Oberm. and the necessary new combinations are made, whilst B. schenckii Schinz is resurrected as a good species. Eleven names in Barleria are lectotypified. A preliminary assessment of the conservation status and extinction risk is provided for each taxon. Of the 39 taxa enumerated, the majority are assessed to be of Least Concern, but one is assessed as Endangered, four as Vulnerable, one as Near Threatened and six are currently considered to be Data Deficient.

AB Pollinators may influence plant community assembly through biotic filtering and/or plant-plant competition and facilitation. The relative importance of each process, however, vary according to the scale and how strongly plants share their pollinators, and possibly in relation to the pollinator groups considered. We here investigated the assembly of three Atlantic forest hummingbird-pollinated plant communities across space (among all species in the communities) and time, i.e. yearly flowering phenology (between pairs of co-flowering species), based on the pairwise distances of multiple floral traits (corolla length, anther and stigma height, colour and nectar). Because tropical hummingbird-pollinated plants are often subdivided in two pollination niches (hermits versus non-hermits), we also analyzed these groups separately. We found that trait structure across space was clustered for some floral traits, suggesting biotic filtering and facilitation. All floral traits had weak phylogenetic signal, indicating that closely related species were not more similar than distantly related species. Moreover, floral traits were randomly structured along the phenology when analyzing all plants together. On the other hand, we found similar corolla length but divergent anther height in co-flowering pairs within the same pollination niche. Thus, plants may benefit from flowering together and avoid competition through fine adjustments in reproductive traits. The results also suggest that clear signals of competition and facilitation among plants are only apparent when species strongly share their pollinators and depending on the traits that are considered. Our study illustrates a complex interplay of biotic filtering, facilitation and competition as processes structuring guilds of plants sharing the same functional group of pollinators.

AB Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is a devastating condition impacting marine shrimp production worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of four probiotic formulations on Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) infected with pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus causing AHPND. In addition, bacterial community composition analyses of shrimp gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and aquaculture water before and after infection were conducted by sequencing variable region 4 of the 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Treatments included: (1) Lactobacillus casei (P1), (2) L. casei and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (P2), (3) L casei, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and R. palustris (P3), and (4) a commercial probiotic EM (R) (EM), which showed shrimp survival of 11.7%, 26.7%, 36.7% and 73.3% respectively. Treatments causing lower survival showed greater relative abundance (>60%) of family Vibrionaceae in the GIT compared to treatments with higher survival. Diversity indices from GIT samples revealed that treatments showing higher survival had higher Shannon index values (4.69 +/- 0.133), compared with those of treatments with lower survival (0.17 +/- 0.004). Diversity indices from water samples did not show significant differences after infection (Shannon index 4.64 +/- 0.53). The results showed that probiotics could effectively mitigate AHPND while maintaining diverse microbial composition in shrimp GIT, thus maintaining sustainability in the shrimp aquaculture industry.

AB 1. This study reports the discovery of sympatric populations of antlions (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) and wormlions (Diptera: Vermileonidae) in a unique system of sandy microhabitats in the lowland rainforest of Borneo. The two species convergently evolved sit-and-wait predatory larvae, which construct pitfall traps to hunt insects. Despite similar specialised foraging strategies, the two species coexist in the competitive environment of small, isolated sandy patches in the rainforest, which begs the question: what biological characteristics allow their coexistence? 2. Based on larval morphology alone, it was predicted that antlions would build larger traps, which would allow them to efficiently hunt larger prey. Addressing this hypothesis, this study compared the volumes of traps constructed by the two species under field and laboratory conditions. A laboratory experiment compared their efficiency of capture of three ant species that differed in body size. 3. The results show that antlions constructed larger traps and captured prey more efficiently. The difference between the species could not be explained by trap size alone. The findings demonstrate that the overlap in resource use in these two species was low, and it is suggested that there is a separation in prey utility between them, allowing their coexistence in the space-limited habitat of the tropical rainforest.

AB The Intermittent Upwelling Hypothesis (IUH) posits that subsidies of larvae and phytoplankton to intertidal communities should vary unimodally along a gradient of upwelling from persistent upwelling to persistent downwelling with most subsidies occurring where upwelling is of intermediate strength and intermittent. Furthermore, the hypothesis states that larvae and phytoplankton are transported far offshore by strong, persistent upwelling and fail to subsidize nearshore communities, whereas weak upwelling or downwelling reduces nutrients for phytoplankton production limiting food for larvae and nearshore communities. We review studies conducted at sea and onshore and reanalyze published data to test the IUH and evaluate alternative hypotheses. To test the hypothesis, we examine five predictions that must hold if the IUH is true. (1) Larvae should inhabit the surface Ekman layer where they are transported offshore during upwelling. Larvae of many intertidal taxa occur deeper in the water column where currents flow shoreward during upwelling. (2) Larvae of nearshore species should occur farther offshore during upwelling than during relaxation or downwelling. Larvae of many nearshore species remain within several kilometers of shore during both conditions. (3) Larval settlement in intertidal communities should be lower during upwelling than relaxation or downwelling. Daily larval settlement has not observed to be higher during relaxation or downwelling events; settlement has most often been seen to vary with the fortnightly tidal cycle likely due to onshore larval transport by internal tides. (4) Larval settlement and recruitment in intertidal communities should be lower in areas of strong, persistent upwelling than where upwelling is weaker and less persistent. Recruitment of mussels and barnacles to artificial and natural substrates did not vary with the strength of upwelling, but did vary inversely with two measures of desiccation potential, and directly with indicators of surf zone hydrodynamics; larval recruitment was higher where surf zones were more dissipative with rip currents. (5) Phytoplankton subsidies to nearshore communities should be highest where upwelling is moderate and intermittent. Like larval subsidies, phytoplankton subsidies varied spatially with surf zone hydrodynamics rather than upwelling. This reconsideration of the evidence for the IUH finds the hypothesis unsupported.

AB Megaherbivores fulfilled a number of important ecological functions in terrestrial ecosystems and behaved as ecological engineers since 300 million years until around 12,000 years ago. These essential ecological functions include opening vegetation cover, selective seed dispersal and nutrient recycling and spreading. Thanks to these effects, megaherbivores change the vegetation structure where they live, with cascading effects on smaller herbivores and also on climate. The late Pleistocene extinction strongly impacted the megaherbivores almost all over the world and led to the loss of these important ecological functions in terrestrial ecosystems. These functions were partially restored by agriculturist humans through an ecological replacement that occurred through an ecological shift within the species Homo sapiens. A better understanding of the differences and similarities between the ecological impacts of megaherbivores and those of agricultural humans should help to predict the future of terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Chronic anthropogenic disturbances on coral reefs in the form of overfishing and pollution can shift benthic community composition away from stony corals and toward macroalgae. The use of reefs for recreational snorkeling and diving potentially can lead to similar ecological impacts if not well-managed, but impacts of snorkeling on benthic organisms are not well understood. We quantified variation in benthic community structure along a gradient of snorkeling frequency in an intensively-visited portion of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef. We determined rates of snorkeling in 6 water sections and rates of beach visitation in 4 adjacent land sections at Akumal Bay, Mexico. For each in-water section at 1-3 m depth, we also assessed the percent cover of benthic organisms including taxa of stony corals and macroalgae. Rates of recreational snorkeling varied from low in the southwestern to very high (> 1000 snorkelers d(-1))in the northeastern sections of the bay. Stony coral cover decreased and macroalgal cover increased significantly with levels of snorkeling, while trends varied among taxa for other organisms such as gorgonians, fire corals, and sea urchins. We conclude that benthic organisms appear to exhibit taxon-specific variation with levels of recreational snorkeling. To prevent further degradation, we recommend limitation of snorkeler visitation rates, coupled with visitor education and in-water guides to reduce reef-damaging behaviors by snorkelers in high-use areas. These types of management activities, integrated with reef monitoring and subsequent readjustment of management, have the potential to reverse the damage potentially inflicted on coral reefs by the expansion of reef-based recreational snorkeling.

AB At a broad (regional to global) spatial scale, tropical vegetation is controlled by climate; at the local scale, it is believed to be determined by interactions between disturbance, vegetation and local conditions (soil and topography) through feedback processes. It has recently been suggested that strong fire-vegetation feedback processes may not be needed to explain tree-cover patterns in tropical ecosystems and that climate-fire determinism is an alternative possibility. This conclusion was based on the fact that it is possible to reproduce observed patterns in tropical regions (e. g. a trimodal frequency distribution of tree cover) using a simple model that does not explicitly incorporate fire-vegetation feedback processes. We argue that these two mechanisms (feedbacks versus fire-climate control) operate at different spatial and temporal scales; it is not possible to evaluate the role of a process acting at fine scales (e. g. fire-vegetation feedbacks) using a model designed to reproduce regional-scale pattern (scale mismatch). While the distributions of forest and savannas are partially determined by climate, many studies are providing evidence that the most parsimonious explanation for their environmental overlaps is the existence of feedback processes. Climate is unlikely to be an alternative to feedback processes; rather, climate and fire-vegetation feedbacks are complementary processes at different spatial and temporal scales.

AB Abalone is a popular seafood in South Korea; however, because it contains various microorganisms, its ingestion can cause food poisoning. Therefore, analysis of the microbiota on abalone can improve understanding of outbreaks and causes of food poisoning and help to better manage seafood products. In this study, we collected a total of 40 abalones from four different regions in March and July, which are known as the maximum abalone production areas in Korea. The microbiota were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing, and bacterial loads on abalone were quantified by real-time PCR. Over 2700 species were detected in the samples, and Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria were the predominant classes. The differences in microbiota among regions and at each sampling time were also investigated. Although Psychrobacter was the dominant genus detected on abalone in both March and July, the species compositions were different between the two sampling times. Five potential pathogens (Lactococcus garvieae, Yersinia kristensenii, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were detected among the abalone microbiota. In addition, we analyzed the influence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection on shifts in abalone microbiota during storage at different temperatures. Although the proportion of Vibrio increased over time in infected and non-infected abalone, the shifts of microbiota were more dynamic in infected abalone. These results can be used to better understand the potential of food poisoning caused by abalone consumption and manage abalone products according to the microbiota composition.

AB Understanding the relative influence of factors that influence faunal community structure, such as habitat and landscape arrangement, has been a long-standing goal of ecologists. This is complicated in marine environments by the high importance of physico-chemical water factors in determining species distributions relative to their physiological or behavioural limits. In this study, we rank the relative importance of 17 seascape, habitat and physico-chemical water factors for structuring the composition of fish communities on the inshore coral reefs of Moreton Bay, eastern Australia. Fish were surveyed at 12 reef sites along the ambient estuarine water gradient in the bay during summer and winter using a baited underwater video approach. Multivariate random forest analyses showed that reef fish community composition correlated most strongly with the local abundance of piscivorous fish and the seascape context of individual reefs (especially distance to nearest seagrass and mangroves), while water quality factors ranked much lower in importance. However, fish communities from sites nearer to rivers were more spatiotemporally variable than those from sites nearer to oceanic waters, indicating that water quality can drive variations in community structure along short-term temporal scales. In turn, piscivore abundance was greatest on reefs near large areas of seagrass, and with low sand cover, high coral cover and high water clarity. Our findings demonstrate that a reef's location within the broader seascape can be more important for fish communities than factors relating to the reef habitat itself and exposure to reduced water quality. To improve the spatial conservation of marine ecosystems, we encourage a more intimate understanding of how these factors contribute to structuring the use of habitats across seascapes by mobile species.

AB Background: How floral traits and community composition influence plant specialization is poorly understood and the existing evidence is restricted to regions where plant diversity is low. Here, we assessed whether plant specialization varied among four species-rich subalpine/alpine communities on the Yulong Mountain, SW China (elevation from 2725 to 3910 m). We analyzed two factors (floral traits and pollen vector community composition: richness and density) to determine the degree of plant specialization across 101 plant species in all four communities. Floral visitors were collected and pollen load analyses were conducted to identify and define pollen vectors. Plant specialization of each species was described by using both pollen vector diversity (Shannon's diversity index) and plant selectiveness (d' index), which reflected how selective a given species was relative to available pollen vectors.
   Results: Pollen vector diversity tended to be higher in communities at lower elevations, while plant selectiveness was significantly lower in a community with the highest proportion of unspecialized flowers (open flowers and clusters of flowers in open inflorescences). In particular, we found that plant species with large and unspecialized flowers attracted a greater diversity of pollen vectors and showed higher selectiveness in their use of pollen vectors. Plant species with large floral displays and high flower abundance were more selective in their exploitation of pollen vectors. Moreover, there was a negative relationship between plant selectiveness and pollen vector density.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that flower shape and flower size can increase pollen vector diversity but they also increased plant selectiveness. This indicated that those floral traits that were more attractive to insects increased the diversity of pollen vectors to plants while decreasing overlap among co-blooming plant species for the same pollen vectors. Furthermore, floral traits had a more important impact on the diversity of pollen vectors than the composition of anthophilous insect communities. Plant selectiveness of pollen vectors was strongly influenced by both floral traits and insect community composition. These findings provide a basis for a better understanding of how floral traits and community context shape interactions between flowers and their pollen vectors in species-rich communities.

AB In this study, we assessed the suitable level of replacement of fishmeal with a blue green microalga, Arthrospira platensis in feed for the post larvae (PL) of the freshwater prawn, Macro brachium rosenbergii by evaluating the growth performance, prawn proximate composition, feed utilization parameters and the activity of digestive enzymes. The prawns were fed 5 different diets: a control diet and 4 different diets containing A. platensis at various levels such as 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. These diets were fed to the PL for 90 days in triplicates. The growth performance in terms of weight gain, specific growth rate and feed efficiency ratio were found significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the prawns fed with the 50% of A. platensis feed fed group. At this level of 50% replacement, the prawn proximate composition, such as total protein, amino acids, carbohydrates and lipid contents were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the control. Similarly, feed utilization parameters, such as feeding rate, absorption rate and conversion rate were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the control. Added to that, the activity of the digestive enzymes such as protease, amylase and lipase showed the same trend at the level of 50% replacement. The hierarchy of the growth performance in prawns corresponds to 50 > 25 > 75 > 100% replacement of fishmeal with A. platensis. These results concluded that a partial replacement of the fishmeal with A. platensis at the level of 50% is beneficial for the growth of prawn M. rosenbergii. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Nutrient deficiency is commonly a limiting factor in reconstructing ecosystems on disturbed areas such as mines, quarries, and construction sites. An open-cut coal mine in southeastern Australia is being used as a model to explore strategies for reconstructing a sustainable forest ecosystem on a spoil substrate. This study aimed to identify the nutrients limiting forest establishment and ways of ameliorating these. A pot trial, using two endemic Myrtaceae tree species, found that nitrogen was the most growth-limiting nutrient followed by phosphorus. To overcome these spoil nutrient deficiencies, a field trial compared the application of forest topsoil to the addition of two rates of inorganic fertilizer, gypsum, or biosolids on the response of a range of native forest plant species directly seeded into the substrate. Only biosolids significantly increased total nitrogen levels in the spoil. However, all treatments significantly decreased spoil pH, thereby increasing nutrient availability. Topsoil produced the highest plant density of native species due to contributions from its seed bank. Biosolids increased growth of Corymbia maculata. The higher rate of fertilizer addition improved seedling establishment of Mimosaceae and the survival of Myrtaceae species. High nutrient treatments increased weed and grass densities, which may have reduced the nutrient benefit for native species. In conclusion, biosolids and the high rate of fertilizer application ameliorated the nitrogen and phosphorus deficiency of spoil to support growth and survival of reintroduced native species. However, potential benefits were attenuated by competition from accompanying weed growth that could be managed by implementing a control program.

AB Upland grasslands in South Africa occur in climates warm enough and wet enough for forests yet, unlike savannas, trees are absent. We hypothesize that the lack of trees in grasslands is due to the scarcity of gaps suitable for tree seedling establishment in the grass root layer. We assessed which demographic bottlenecks, seedling recruitment or sapling release, were limiting large tree populations of Acacia species in 229 sites on a gradient from lowland savannas to upland grasslands in eastern South Africa. We explored the frequency of 'root gaps' by quantifying grass root biomass in grids of 18 points at six sites distributed from lowland savannas to upland grasslands. Across the altitudinal gradient, sapling release was the most common bottleneck at low elevation sites switching to seedling recruitment in upland savannas and adjacent grasslands. Root studies showed grass root biomass at upland sites to be double than that of lowland sites. When grass root biomass of all 108 sample points was ranked, lowland savanna sites had the most frequent 'gaps' defined as the lowest percentiles of values (5, 15, 25, 35, 45). The number of 'gaps' decreased along the elevation gradient with none in the grassland site. Dense grass roots may prevent seedling establishment and 'root gaps' may be safe sites with reduced competition where seedlings can establish. We suggest that a lack of root gaps could explain the treeless nature of many upland grasslands. (C) 2014 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Models of the dynamics of large herbivore populations represent density feedbacks on the population growth rate either directly or indirectly through interactions with vegetation resources. Neither approach incorporates the spatial heterogeneity that is an essential feature of most natural environments, and modifies the population dynamics generated. This is especially true for large herbivores exploiting food resources that are rooted in space but temporally variable in quantity and quality both seasonally and annually. In this review I explore how environmental variation at different spatiotemporal scales influences the abundance of herbivore populations controlled via resources, predators or social mechanisms. Changes in abundance can be spatially disparate and dependent on different resource components at different stages of the seasonal cycle, including buffer resources restricting population crashes in extremely adverse years. GPS telemetry enables movement responses generating spatial patterns to be documented in fine spatiotemporal detail, including migration and dispersal. Models incorporating spatial heterogeneity either implicitly or explicitly are outlined, exemplifying how herbivores cope with temporal variability by exploiting spatial variability in resources and conditions. Global human dominance is generating widened climatic variation while opportunities for herbivore movements are becoming constricted. Theoretical population ecologists need to shift their focus from the workings of demographic structure towards effects of changing environmental contexts, in order to project the likely trajectories of large herbivore populations through the Anthropocene.

AB Although pollinators can play a central role in determining the structure and stability of plant communities, little is known about how their adaptive foraging behaviours at the individual level, e. g. flower constancy, structure these interactions. Here, we construct a mathematical model that integrates individual adaptive foraging behaviour and population dynamics of a community consisting of two plant species and a pollinator species. We find that adaptive foraging at the individual level, as a complementary mechanism to adaptive foraging at the species level, can further enhance the coexistence of plant species through niche partitioning between conspecific pollinators. The stabilizing effect is stronger than that of unbiased generalists when there is also strong competition between plant species over other resources, but less so than that of multiple specialist species. This suggests that adaptive foraging in mutualistic interactions can have a very different impact on the plant community structure from that in predator-prey interactions. In addition, the adaptive behaviour of individual pollinators may cause a sharp regime shift for invading plant species. These results indicate the importance of integrating individual adaptive behaviour and population dynamics for the conservation of native plant communities.

AB Spatial variation in absolute climatic conditions (means, maxima or minima) is widely acknowledged to play a fundamental role in controlling species diversity patterns. In contrast, while evidence is accumulating that variability around mean climatic conditions may also influence species coexistence and persistence, the importance of spatial variation in temporal climatic variability for species diversity is still largely unknown. We used a unique dataset capturing fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in temperature variability across 2490 plots in southeast Australia to examine the comparative strength of absolute temperature and temperature variability in explaining spatial variation in plant diversity. Across all plots combined and in three of five forest types, temperature variability emerged as the better predictor of diversity. In all but one forest type, diversity also exhibited either a significant unimodal or positive linear correlation with temperature variability. This relationship is consistent with theory that predicts diversity will initially increase along a climate variability gradient due to temporal niche partitioning, but at an intermediary point, may decline as the risk of stochastic extinction exceeds competitive stabilization. These findings provide critical empirical evidence of a linkage between spatial variation in temporal climate variability and plant species diversity, and in light of changing climate variability regimes, highlight the need for ecologists to expand their purview beyond absolutes and averages.

AB The St Lucia estuarine lake is the largest in Africa and has recently experienced a freshwater-deprivation crisis, partly because its connection with the large Mfolozi catchment has been discontinued. This is due to the extremely high silt load carried by the Mfolozi waters. A study was undertaken during 2012 with the aim of determining the effect of high silt loads on the mortality and feeding rates of Acartiella natalensis, a key copepod species in the St Lucia Estuary. Two different types of experiments were conducted: one using natural organic silt to determine the effect of turbidity on mortality rate; and the other with inorganic silt to determine feeding rates. For the mortality experiments, the copepods were subjected to six different turbidity levels, ranging from ambient to 2500 NTU, with survival monitored at 0, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hour time intervals. For the feeding experiments, copepods were incubated in the same turbidity levels for a 24 hour period. Results revealed a significant effect of turbidity on both feeding and mortality, with lowest ingestion rates and survival recorded in the high turbidity treatments. These findings indicate that overall, this copepod species is negatively affected by high turbidities, but an unexpectedly high mortality rate was recorded under control conditions (6-38 NTU). The lowest mortality rate occurred at 500 NTU, suggesting that while very high silt loads (>1000 NTU) clearly interfere with the physiological functioning of A. natalensis, some sediment may be advantageous, perhaps as a supplementary source of nutrition.

AB 'Crocodylus' pigotti is a relatively small crocodylid from the Miocene of Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria, Kenya. Known only from one relatively complete skull and limited, fragmentary, referred material, 'Crocodylus' pigotti lacks a detailed description. Moreover, recent analyses have shown 'Crocodylus' pigotti to be an osteolaemine crocodylid, more closely related to the extant dwarf crocodiles (Osteolaemus) than to true Crocodylus. Here, we describe numerous new remains of 'Crocodylus' pigotti recovered from localities within the Fossil Bed Member of the Hiwegi Formation at Kaswanga Point, Rusinga Island. We recovered parts of several individuals and report on previously unknown parts of the anatomy, provide an updated phylogenetic analysis, and reallocate the species 'Crocodylus' pigotti to a new genus, Brochuchus.

AB Grassland and savanna are globally important ecosystems, both ecologically and economically. These grass-dominated systems are at risk from current and future climate change and increasing anthropogenic impact. Key questions for understanding the resilience and variability of grass-dominated ecosystems under current and future environmental conditions include: How have these systems responded to climate change and disturbance in the past? What are the principal driving agents responsible for their present-day composition and distribution? Do the palaeoecological data provide evidence for feedbacks between climate, fire and anthropogenic activities? In this study, the temporal dynamics of grassland, savanna and forest in the summer rainfall region of northern South Africa were reconstructed for the last similar to 6500 years. Palaeoecological techniques used include analyses of fossil pollen, charcoal and stable isotopes. Data from two sites located at the present-day grassland-savanna ecotone in Mpumalanga province of South Africa are reported. Results indicate that a mosaic of grassland, savanna and Podocarpus forest occupied the landscape throughout the late Holocene, with grassland and forest dominating higher altitudes, and savanna and forest lower altitudes. Podocarpus forest retreated and grass-dominated vegetation expanded its range around 1800 cal. yr BP at the lower altitude site (Lowveld) and 600 cal. yr BP at the higher altitude site (Highveld), representing a change from a stable state forest savanna/grassland mosaic to an increasingly grass-dominated system. Climatic stress, changes in fire regime and anthropogenic impact led to the vegetation transitions recorded, and resulted in changes in water and nutrient cycles. In an increasingly warm world, with fluctuating water availability and heightened anthropogenic use of natural resources, the future of grass-dominated ecosystems appears far from stable.

AB Colonies of seabirds have been shown to influence nutrient cycling and primary production of coastal areas, but knowledge is still limited above all for smaller colonies. This study evaluates the influence of a small resident seagull colony (Lams michahellis Naumann, 1840) on a Mediterranean coastal system (Marinello ponds, Sicily, Italy). The presence of ornithogenic organic matter from seagull guano was first assessed at increasing distances from the colony using delta N-15 to indicate the effects of guano on the trophic status and primary production. The pond directly affected by guano deposition showed an anomalous water and sediment chemistry, especially regarding physico-chemical variables (pH), nitrogen isotopic signature, nutrient balance and phytoplankton biomass. These effects were not observed in the adjacent ponds, highlighting pronounced, small spatial-scale variability. Given the worldwide presence of seabird colonies and the scarcity of research on their effect on coastal marine areas, the study shows that seabird-mediated input may be important in influencing ecosystem dynamics of coastal areas, even where both the system in question and the colony are small.

AB No-take marine reserves directly promote the recovery of predatory species, which can have negative indirect effects on prey populations in reserves. When harvesting also occurs on prey species there is potential conflict between the direct and indirect effects of protection, and reserves may not have conservation benefits for prey species. For example, sea urchins are fished in many regions, but may decline in reserves due to increased predation rates. To investigate this potential conflict, this paper compares density, size, biomass and reproductive potential of both a harvested and an unharvested urchin species between a long-term reserve and unprotected sites in California. Consistent with density-mediated indirect interactions, densities of the unharvested species were 3.4-times higher at unprotected sites compared to reserve sites. However, for the harvested species, densities were comparable between reserve and unprotected sites. Both species were consistently larger at reserve sites, and the biomass and reproductive potential of the harvested species was 4.8- and 7.0-times higher, respectively, than at unprotected sites. This is likely due to differences in size-selectivity between harvesting and predators, and potential compensatory effects of predators. While the generality of these effects needs to be tested, these results suggest mechanisms whereby reserves can benefit both predator and prey species.

TI Circulation and behavior controls on dispersal of eastern oyster

AB The relative contributions of the spring-neap tides, river discharge and vertical behavior to the dispersal of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) larvae in Delaware Bay is investigated with a coupled circulation-individual-based larvae model. The coupled model simulates larval growth and behavior along particle trajectories using temperature and salinity conditions obtained from an implementation of the Regional Ocean Model System (ROMS) for Delaware Bay. Particles, representing oyster larvae, are released at five-day intervals during the spawning seasons (mid-June to mid-September) of 1984, 1985, 1986, 2000 and 2001 from areas that correspond to natural oyster reefs in Delaware Bay. Successful larvae are those that reach a settlement size of 330 mu m within the planktonic larval duration of 30 days, as calculated from the growth model. The fortnightly variability of the along-estuary flow associated with the spring-neap tides is the primary factor affecting larval dispersion. Larvae released during neap tides are transported mostly up-estuary into areas with reduced salinity, which decreases growth rates and reduces the chance of reaching settlement size within 30 days. Fewer than 20% of the larvae released from upper bay reefs reach settlement size. However, connectivity to mid-bay oyster reefs by the up-estuary transport provides a potential source of larvae to maintain the upper bay oyster reefs. Larvae released during spring tides are often transported down-estuary into regions of higher salinity, which provide the majority of the potential recruits for down-estuary oyster reefs. Low salinity caused by periods of high river discharge overwhelms the up-down estuary transport associated with the spring-neap tides and reduces the ability of the oyster larvae to reach settlement size. Simulated larval trajectories show that vertical behavior makes a small contribution to larval dispersion and that turbulent mixing can overwhelm this process. Thus, for average river discharge conditions, the intra-seasonal dispersion of eastern oyster larvae in Delaware Bay is mostly controlled by the spring-neap tides and the timing of spawning relative to the occurrence of these tides may determine patterns of transport and movement eastern oyster larvae among oyster reefs in Delaware Bay.

AB This paper examines the feasibility of applying self-thinning concepts to savannas and how competition with herbaceous vegetation may modify self-thinning patterns among woody plants in these ecosystems. Competition among woody plants has seldom been invoked as a major explanation for the persistence of herbaceous vegetation in mixed treegrass ecosystems. On the contrary, the primary resource-based explanations for treegrass coexistence are based on treegrass competition (niche-separation) that assumes that trees are inferior competitors unless deeper rooting depths provide them exclusive access to water. Alternative nonresource-based hypotheses postulate that trees are the better competitors, but that tree populations are suppressed by mortality related to fire, herbivores, and other disturbances. If self-thinning of woody plants can be detected in savannas, stronger evidence for resource-limitation and competitive interactions among woody plants would suggest that the primary models of savannas need to be adjusted. We present data from savanna sites in South Africa to suggest that self-thinning among woody plants can be detected in low-disturbance situations, while also showing signs that juvenile trees, more so than adults, are suppressed when growing with herbaceous vegetation in these ecosystems. This finding we suggest is evidence for size-asymmetric competition in savannas.

AB Questions: What are the relative effects of burning and herbivory on regrowth and physical and chemical defences in Acacia seedlings? Are effects of herbivory consistent with predictions of the resource availability hypothesis? Do plants growing with adequate resources regrow lost material while those with low resource availability defend themselves tominimize effects of herbivory? Location: Arboretum, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Methods: We performed a two- factor, completely randomized experiment on seven indigenous African Acacia ( Acacia erioloba, A. haematoxylon, A. karroo, A. nilotica, A. robusta, A. sieberiana and A. xanthophloea) with simulated burning using a blowtorch and simulated herbivory by cutting at the first node. We measured seedling regrowth, thorn length and number, and tannin content. Results: New stems were produced for all species. In all seven species, the control ( no fire, no herbivory) produced longer stems than other treatments. Simulated herbivory increased thorn abundance among Acacia species, while burning often led to decreased overall thorn length. Tannin analysis revealed positive and negative responses of individual species to burning and herbivory. Conclusions: We demonstrate that Acacia seedlings are tolerant of disturbance events such as herbivory and burning but these effects cannot be assumed to be substitutable. Importantly, there was a positive response to simulated herbivory and a negative response to fire in most species. The mechanisms behind these changes appear to be mediated by induction of defence responses ( resulting in a positive response to herbivory) and a cost for root storage ( resulting in reduced defences after fire). Only A. robusta displayed regrowth and defence responses consistent with predictions of the resource availability hypothesis. In contrast, the two arid- adapted species invested heavily in regrowth but not in defence, while four of the fivemesic species invested in increased defence.

AB Two important processes determining the dynamics of spatially structured populations are dispersal and the spatial covariance of demographic fluctuations. Spatially explicit approaches to conservation, such as reserve networks, must consider the tension between these two processes and reach a balance between distances near enough to maintain connectivity, but far enough to benefit from risk spreading. Here, we model this trade-off. We show how two measures of metapopulation persistence depend on the shape of the dispersal kernel and the shape of the distance decay in demographic covariance, and we consider the implications of this trade-off for reserve spacing. The relative rates of distance decay in dispersal and demographic covariance determine whether the long-run metapopulation growth rate, and quasi-extinction risk, peak for adjacent patches or intermediately spaced patches; two local maxima in metapopulation. persistence are also possible. When dispersal itself fluctuates over time, the trade-off changes. Temporal variation in mean distance that propagules are dispersed (i.e., propagule advection) decreases metapopulation persistence and decreases the likelihood that persistence will peak for adjacent patches. Conversely, variation in diffusion (the extent of random spread around mean dispersal) increases metapopulation persistence overall and causes it to peak at shorter inter-patch distances. Thus, failure to consider temporal variation in dispersal processes increases the risk that reserve spacings will fail to meet the objective of ensuring metapopulation persistence. This study identifies two phenomena that receive relatively little attention in empirical work on reserve spacing, but that can qualitatively change the effectiveness of reserve spacing strategies: (1) the functional form of the distance decay in covariance among patch-specific demographic rates and (2) temporal variation in the shape of the dispersal kernel. The sensitivity of metapopulation recovery and persistence to how covariance of vital rates decreases with distance suggests that estimating the shape of this function is likely to be as important for effective reserve design as estimating connectivity. Similarly, because temporal variation in dispersal dynamics influences the effect of reserve spacing, approaches to reserve design that ignore such variation, and rely instead on long-term average dispersal patterns, are likely to lead to lower metapopulation viability than is actually achievable.

AB The literature on coral reefs and human resource use or fishing is reviewed less from the perspective of summarizing findings but more from the sociological perspective of what scientists chose to study, publish, and cite in journal articles. The motivation was to determine if coral reef science is generating information needed to solve the coral reef climate and fisheries crisis that has been publicized in many of the highest visibility and cited publications. The social-ecological system of coral reefs involves the environment, the ecosystem, human harvesting and social organization and the policies that arise from their interaction. Regardless of the focus and findings of any science investigation on this system, recommendations for management are limited, and include restrictions on space, time of use, effort, gear, species, size, and gender. Evaluating the scientific journal literature in the Scopus database on these restrictions indicates a disparity in focus for both publications and citations. The greatest number of scientists and citations are focused on spatial closures and fishing effort, effort seen as the problem and closures the solution. The other restrictions, that represent less extreme forms of management and have lower short-term social costs and trade offs, are not well studied and, when studied, investigated by either a small group of associated colleagues or transient one-publication investigators. When the values, selectivity, and incentives of scientists conflict with resource users desires for knowledge, incentives, and profits the resulting divide can weaken the social relevance and applicability of science and delay real-world problem solving. Societal engagement, acceptance, objectivity, and finding solutions are likely to increase if scientific effort is spread more evenly across this full spectrum of management restrictions and more components of the social-ecological system.

AB The Ngovayang Massif of southern Cameroon is a range of small hills near the Atlantic coast, in the Lower Guinea floristic region. This region is known to harbor forests with high levels of biodiversity and endemism, but this Massif is botanically poorly known. We assessed tree species diversity, floristic composition and level of endemism of the Ngovayang forest, comparing it with other sites in Central Africa. Five 1-ha permanent plots within old-growth lowland forests of the Ngovayang Massif were censused. A total of 2,658 individuals with dbh >= 10 cm were recorded, belonging to 293 species, 170 genera and 60 families. The mean number of stems was 532 +/- 75 stems ha (1). Taking into account other data available, the list of vascular plants known in the Massif reaches a total of 450 species. We found 47 species of high conservation value, including Cameroon endemics and other rare and threatened species. Species richness and endemism are comparable to those of the richest known sites in Central African forests. The forests of Ngovayang were found to be particularly rich in Fabaceae-Caesalpinioideae. Topographic heterogeneity, high precipitation and atmospheric humidity owing to the proximity of the ocean, and permanence of a forest cover during past geological times probably all contribute to explaining the Massif's high tree diversity and endemism. This study highlights the botanical importance of the poorly studied Ngovayang forest within the Lower Guinea region, justifying efforts for improved assessment of this value and for the development of suitable national conservation strategies.

AB In an effort to further our understanding of ecosystem structure on multiple temporal and biogeographic scales, the influence of competitive interactions in an invasive setting was explored in the fossil record. Using brachiopod morphology as a proxy for niche space occupation, the external shapes of three pairs of potentially competing brachiopod species were analyzed via three-dimensional baseline shape co-ordinates. Morphology of incumbents was compared before and after the Richmondian Invasion (Late Ordovician, Illinois Basin), and for each incumbent-invader pair: it was possible to differentiate the incumbents pre- and post-invasion; the incumbent became more morphologically different from the invader; and landmarks driving the morphological differences of two of the incumbents shift away from the invader in multidimensional morphospace. These results are consistent with character displacement, which supports the hypothesis that competition played a discernable role in the brachiopod community. This suggests that the use of morphometrics and morphospace occupation could provide a valuable tool for the exploration of ecological interactions in the geologic record, potentially providing novel interpretations of the effects of competition on community structure and evolution.

AB Aim Our aim was to evaluate the extent to which we can predict and map tree alpha diversity across broad spatial scales either by using climate and remote sensing data or by exploiting spatial autocorrelation patterns.
   Location Tropical rain forest, West Africa and Atlantic Central Africa.
   Methods Alpha diversity estimates were compiled for trees with diameter at breast height >= 10 cm in 573 inventory plots. Linear regression (ordinary least squares, OLS) and random forest (RF) statistical techniques were used to project alpha diversity estimates at unsampled locations using climate data and remote sensing data [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Quick Scatterometer (QSCAT), tree cover, elevation]. The prediction reliabilities of OLS and RF models were evaluated using a novel approach and compared to that of a kriging model based on geographic location alone.
   Results The predictive power of the kriging model was comparable to that of OLS and RF models based on climatic and remote sensing data. The three models provided congruent predictions of alpha diversity in well-sampled areas but not in poorly inventoried locations. The reliability of the predictions of all three models declined markedly with distance from points with inventory data, becoming very low at distances > 50 km. According to inventory data, Atlantic Central African forests display a higher mean alpha diversity than do West African forests.
   Main conclusions The lower tree alpha diversity in West Africa than in Atlantic Central Africa may reflect a richer regional species pool in the latter. Our results emphasize and illustrate the need to test model predictions in a spatially explicit manner. Good OLS or RF model predictions from inventory data at short distance largely result from the strong spatial autocorrelation displayed by both the alpha diversity and the predictive variables rather than necessarily from causal relationships. Our results suggest that alpha diversity is driven by history rather than by the contemporary environment. Given the low predictive power of models, we call for a major effort to broaden the geographical extent and intensity of forest assessments to expand our knowledge of African rain forest diversity.

AB The longitudinal spread of temperate organisms into refugial populations in Southern Europe is generally assumed to predate the last interglacial. However, few studies have attempted to quantify this process in nonmodel organisms using explicit models and multilocus data. We used sequence data for 20 intron-spanning loci (12 kb per individual) to resolve the history of refugial populations of a widespread western Palaearctic oak gall parasitoid Cecidostiba fungosa (Pteromalidae). Using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods we assess alternative population tree topologies and estimate divergence times and ancestral population sizes under a model of divergence between three refugia (Middle East, Balkans and Iberia). Both methods support an "Out of the East" history for C. fungosa, matching the pattern previously inferred for their gallwasp hosts. However, coalescent-based estimates of the ages of population divides are much more recent (coinciding with the Eemian interglacial) than nodal ages of single gene trees for C. fungosa and other species. We also find that increasing the sample size from one haploid sequence per refugial population to three only marginally improves parameter estimates. Our results suggest that there is significant information in the minimal samples currently analyzable with maximum likelihood methods, and that similar methods could be applied to multiple species to test alternative models of assemblage evolution.

AB Metapopulation models have historically treated a landscape as a collection of habitat patches separated by a matrix of uniformly unsuitable habitat. This perspective is still apparent in many studies of marine metapopulations, in which recruitment variation is generally assumed to be primarily the result of variability in ocean currents and interactions with disperser behavior, with little consideration of spatial structure that can affect disperser viability. We use a simple model of dispersal of marine larvae to demonstrate how heterogeneity in dispersal habitat (i.e., the matrix) can generate substantial spatial variation in recruitment. Furthermore, we show how this heterogeneity can interact with larval life-history variation to create alternative patterns of source-sink dynamics. Finally, we place our results in the context of spatially structured matrix population models, and we propose the damping ratio of the connectivity matrix as a general and novel measure of landscape connectivity that may provide conceptual unification to the fields of metapopulation biology and landscape ecology.

AB The distribution of cacti species that inhabit the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO) was analysed. Grid-cells were analysed using parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) and endemism indices. Areas characterized by their diagnostic species were determined, aiming to propose areas for the conservation of threatened cacti. Distributional data were obtained from 1936 herbarium specimens, electronic information, and from field collections. Eight areas of endemism and three main clades were obtained from the grid-cell analysis. Areas obtained from the endemism indices are very similar to those obtained with the PAE, but differ in the association of grid-cells. PAE showed endemism patterns indicating that southern and central sections of the SMO province are the areas richest in geographically-restricted species. The results obtained with different endemism indices detected more or less the same areas, although the importance level is different. The corrected weighted endemism index can be considered as a reliable measure of endemism because it is unrelated to species richness. A regionalization of the SMO in three subprovinces is suggested, supported by characteristic cacti taxa and the existence of natural barriers.

AB Aim We investigated whether the biogeographical patterns expected if the East African fauna was affected by cycles of contraction to refugia and expansion of ranges, as has been previously hypothesized, can be found in the land snail fauna of rain forests in Uganda.
   Location The Albertine Rift region and the Lake Victoria forest belt in Uganda.
   Methods Snails and slugs were sampled in 60 plots in 13 rain forests, and small species were extracted from 5-L leaf litter samples. Relative species richness was calculated by rarefaction. The influence of putative determinants of species richness was examined by bivariate correlation and multiple regression. Clustering and nestedness were tested by Monte Carlo simulations with a null model that considers the range size distribution, the species richness distribution of the forests, and the spatial autocorrelation of the occurrences of each species. Biotic elements were determined by model-based Gaussian clustering.
   Results A total of 169 land snail species were recorded from 13 Ugandan rain forests. Relative species richness increases with rainfall and altitude, and decreases with evaporation and distance from the putative East Congolian refugia. Mean annual rainfall and distance from the putative East Congolian refugia were included in the best multiple regression model. The distribution areas of the Ugandan land snails are significantly clustered. Two montane, two lowland and a northern biotic element were found. The mean range extension increases with increasing distance from the putative East Congolian refugia. Moreover, the ranges of the Ugandan land snails are significantly nested. The centre of the sets of nested subsets is in the Virunga Mountains, close to the putative East Congolian refugia.
   Main conclusions The decrease of diversity with increasing distance from the putative East Congolian refugia, the clustering and nestedness of ranges, and the range size increase with increasing distance from the refugia indicate that the East African land snail fauna was affected by cycles of contraction to refugia and expansion of ranges. The significant clustering and nestedness cannot be explained by current environmental conditions. Given the environmental history, it can be supposed that the lowland elements expanded post-glacially, whereas the ranges of the montane species are probably currently contracting.

AB Question: Releves in large phytosociological databases used for analysing long-term changes in plant communities are biased towards easily accessible places and species-rich stands. How does this bias influence trend analysis of floristic composition within a priori determined vegetation types and how can this bias be reduced by resampling methods?
   Location: The Netherlands.
   Methods: Basis for the analysis was the Dutch national phytosociological database, consisting of more than 460 000 releves. For the Cirsio dissecti-Molinietum, Genisto anglicae-Callunetum and the Stellario-Carpinetum betuli, we analysed differences in floristic composition ( species frequencies) before and after 1970, using chi(2)- statistics. We resampled the original dataset, using different types of stratification. The results of the trend analysis with the resampled datasets were compared with the results using the original dataset.
   Results: In the resampled datasets a much smaller number of plant species showed a significant trend over both periods, compared to the results form the original dataset. Differences could be related to the smaller size of datasets after resampling, but also to avoiding over-representation of certain geographical localities in the datasets. The influence of stratification was different for the three plant communities, due to the different distribution of releves in time and space.
   Conclusions: Analysis of long-term changes in plant communities is strongly affected by the uneven spatio-temporal distribution of releves in different research periods. These effects are reduced by geographical stratified resampling. The results of the trend analysis after stratified resampling are expected to give a more reliable representation of true changes, than the results after using the original data. The scale of stratification is dependent on the structure of the data.

AB Previous work from the Plains of Serengeti National Park ( SNP) suggested that plant species composition ( i. e. the composite measure of species' identities and abundances) is unchanged on the temporal scale of decades ( Belsky 1985), raising the possibility that African grazing ecosystems may be resistant to climate change. In this study, grassland plant composition was measured three times between 2000 and 2007 at eight permanent sites spanning the SNP environmental gradient. Confirming previous work, plots in the Serengeti Plains were relatively stable with respect to plant composition through time. In contrast, sites in all other regions of the ecosystem showed greater change in plant species composition during the study. Three factors, annual rainfall, dry season rainfall, and fire frequency, were linearly correlated ( all r > 0.73) with the amount of composition change at the sites. A path model, which accounted for the strong correlation between annual and dry season rainfall and for the known effect of annual rainfall on fire frequency, was used to elucidate which factors were associated with composition change and which were spuriously correlated. The path model demonstrated that change in plant composition was positively related to annual rainfall, but not dry season rainfall or fire frequency. However, dry season rainfall was positively associated with changes in plant species identity, one component of compositional change, across sites over time. Because climate models predict both increased wet season and decreased dry season rainfall in East Africa, these findings raise uncertainty about how these grasslands will respond to future changes. This study and others ( Belsky 1985) suggests that plant assemblages adapted to low rainfall in Serengeti may exhibit compositionally stability, while the same may not be true in regions of higher average rainfall and larger species pools.
