AB Coral reef fish generally have relatively sedentary juvenile and adult phases and a presumed highly dispersive pelagic larval phase, yet previous studies that have tried to relate pelagic larval duration (PLD) to population structure have given inconsistent results. In the present study, the population structures of two damselfishes, Stegastes fasciolatus and Dascyllus albisella, were examined using mitochondrial control region sequences. The two species have similar PLDs (similar to 25 and 27 days respectively), but consistently differ in their settlement preferences, habitat, and densities in populations throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago, from Hawaii north to Kure Atoll, and south to Johnston Atoll. Information on habitat preferences and population densities were collected between September 2000 and October 2002, and tissue samples for the genetic studies were collected between January and April 2004. Based on the differences in habitat and abundance of the two species, the expectation was that S. fasciolatus would have high genetic variability but little population structure compared to D. albisella, and this was largely confirmed. Stegastes fasciolatus had little population structure in most of the Hawaiian Islands, and D. albisella showed evidence of strong population structure throughout its range. An exception to this pattern was the large difference between the Kure Atoll population of S. fasciolatus and all others. These results suggest that the interaction of several biological factors (e.g. species-specific spawning habitat and season) with environmental factors (e.g. seasonal wind and current patterns) may have more influence on population structure than single life history characteristics, such as the PLD.

AB 1. As the ephippia (chitinous shells enclosing diapausing eggs) of pelagic crustaceans of the genus Daphnia have been occasionally reported to float at the water surface, we considered that this might be an adaptation promoting their passive dispersal. We investigated the mechanisms by which ephippia appear at the water surface.
   2. While field surveys revealed that floating Daphnia ephippia are often numerous in various freshwater habitats, laboratory tests showed that newly formed ephippia are not buoyant initially. Once transferred to the surface by whatever means, however, they may remain there due either to surface tension or gas absorption.
   3. Video recordings showed that all ephippia at the water surface in laboratory vessels were shed there by ephippial females when moulting (despite the attendant risk of exposure to UV radiation). This implies that the moulting behaviour of female Daphnia may determine the fate of their dormant offspring, predetermining whether they remain in the natal environment (when the ephippium is released into the water column) or disperse (when it is deposited at the water surface).
   4. Our findings reveal a potential mechanism underlying the high dispersal capacity of freshwater cladocerans inhabiting island-like aquatic habitats.

AB The objective of this study was to determine the condition and grazing capacity of commonly grazed rangeland of pastoralists living in the Kereyu-Fantale and Awash-Fantale districts of Ethiopia. In each of the districts, data on grass species composition, basal cover, bare ground, soil erosion and dry matter (DM) yield were collected. The most dominant grass species in the study districts was Chrysopogon plumulosus, followed by different species of Sporobolus. The percentage bare ground varied from 0.3% to 10.8%, with a mean value of 5.3%. The basal cover in both districts was low, averaging 3.4%. The DM yield of the grass ranged between 168.5 and 832 kg ha(-1). The grazing capacity varied from as low as 54.1 to Lis high as 7.1 ha LSU-1. The general conclusion that can be made is that the condition of the rangeland in the Middle Awash Valley of Ethiopia is poor, requiring careful and participatory management. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB DNA from remotely-collected samples of hair or feces provides a means of assessing attributes of populations of wild animals, including genetic diversity, spatial distribution, patterns of habitat use, dispersal distances, population fragmentation, and population size. This technique has been called noninvasive genetic sampling, a term in common usage especially in the bear literature. It has taken on the connotation of being more humane than techniques such as radiotelemetry that require capture of animals. The term noninvasive, however, is misapplied: in the biological-genetic sense, it refers only to the invasion of the body (through the skin or an orifice), not to capture or general intrusiveness. If it is construed to mean nonintrusive in a more general sense, then other methods of collecting population data that do not require animal capture, such as camera trapping, sign surveys, sightings, and interviews, should be called noninvasive as well. Moreover, once an animal is radiocollared, the process of collecting telemetry data is also noninvasive. I recommend the use of a more neutral and also more informative and technically correct term, "remote," to describe genetic and other forms of sampling that do not involve human handling of animals. Remote sampling aids investigators in reducing their effects on the study subjects and also may provide larger samples than can be obtained by trapping. However, many of the important biological questions that can be (and for > 30 years have been) studied by capturing animals and tracking them telemetrically cannot be addressed with genetic or other remote sampling techniques.

AB In generalized, multispecies mutualisms, competition among members of one guild can influence the net benefits that each species in the other guild receives. Hence seasonal factors that affect the dynamics of competition can also affect net benefits, especially if the benefit or cost of mutualism also varies seasonally. In the Sonoran Desert, two common species of generalist ants compete for access to extrafloral nectaries on the fishhook barrel cactus Ferocactus wislizeni, but their relative abundances vary seasonally; one ant dominates more cacti in winter/spring, and the other in summer/autumn. Recently, a third ant species, which also varies in abundance seasonally, has appeared at our study sites and is competing With resident ants for access to cactus nectaries. This empirical system motivated us to examine a metapopulation model of competition for patches in an open system with periodic forcing. We use the model to: (1) illustrate three ways in which competing species may differ in their sensitivities to environmental conditions that are consistent with seasonally displaced patterns of abundance; (2) ask under what conditions the invasion of a third competitor into a two-species system could alter the sensitivity of the system to environmental forcing at low vs. high frequency; and (3) show how differences among competitors in the pattern of seasonal forcing alone can dramatically alter the outcome of a competitor invasion. We discuss implications of these results for the ways in which seasonal variation among competing mutualists, and the benefits and costs of mutualism, may affect the functioning of generalized, facultative mutualisms.

AB Understanding density dependent processes in abalone is important for sustainable management of fisheries, and optimum aquaculture production. Density and food were manipulated to test their interacting effects on the growth and survival of hatchery produced postlarval Haliotis rubra. Feeding and dispersive behavior was also examined. Initial densities ranged between the densities used in aquaculture and those reported in the natural environment. Higher initial density increased the mortality rates of postlarvae in two experiments. Simultaneous manipulation of diatom food supply and density showed that the effect of density on mortality was mostly independent of food. Growth was strongly related to food supply, but also significantly reduced by high initial density, and these effects were additive. When diatom density was low, postlarvae did not increase rasping rates so the effect was that food was consumed more slowly. This explains the strong effect of food supply on growth. No aggressive interactions between feeding postlarvae were observed, but they graze intensively, leaving small distinct patches that have been cleared of algal food. Postlarvae encountering patches without food move rapidly and apparently randomly in search of food. The dispersal rate of postlarvae increased with density, presumably because post larvae spent more time searching for food. This searching is likely to be energetically expensive. and would increase at high densities because more cleared patches are created. This may explain why high initial densities of postlarvae had persistent reduced growth even when food was abundant, but does not explain the increased mortality at high density irrespective of food supply. We hypothesize that this effect may be attributable to other factors, such as the increased transmission of a pathogen at high density.

AB The very low water temperatures existing in polar oceans that experience seasonal advance and retreat of pack ice do not inhibit the presence of large bacterial populations. Bacteria may contribute significantly to the energy transfers within the Southern Ocean. In the last decades, notable progress has been made in the knowledge of the role of marine bacteria in the Southern Ocean. A short overview of the abundance and function of Antarctic marine bacteria is given, with respect to metabolic activity. The importance of spatial and temporal variability is described. The ecological function of Antarctic marine bacterioplankton is discussed. Depending on food web structure, bacteria may be either a link in food webs supporting metazoan production, or a sink where bacterial production is metabolised by microorganisms. In the more oligotrophic areas and during certain periods of the year bacterial biomass dominates phytoplankton. The microbial food web is therefore the dominant pathway for carbon and energy flow in Antarctic seawater.

AB The influence of seabird colonies on a remote insular flora was investigated through the analysis of plant community patterns at the boundaries of three colonies of king peguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) on the subantarctic Ile de la Possession. This study revealed that the physical and chemical impacts of these seabirds greatly influence plant assemblages (community composition, alien and native species abundance and richness). Plant richness appears to be maximum for a moderate disturbance intensity, on areas slightly influenced by penguin activities. The abundance of alien species near penguin rookeries may be due to their ability to withstand animal-induced disturbances and to efficiently colonise the stripped areas. In addition, the diversity and abundance of alien species recorded in study plots depend on the location of the colony. The closer the colony is to the permanent scientific station, the higher the number and abundance of aliens recorded.

AB Population dynamics and the effects of intraspecific competition on limpet growth and maintenance of bare patches were investigated for the intertidal limpet Cellana ornata (Dillwyn) at a boulder-dominated site and on a rocky platform near Kaikoura (South Island), New Zealand. Distribution and abundance patterns of C ornata were described in relation to other biota and tidal height. C ornata occurred almost exclusively in patches devoid of macroalgae, particularly in the mid-tidal zone. Both adult and juvenile limpets were most abundant on the tops of boulders, where their numbers were positively correlated with barnacle cover, which averaged 77%. The size structure and growth patterns of C ornata were different between populations. Mark-recapture studies showed that the slopes of annual growth increments regressed on initial sizes were similar at both sites but that the annual increments on the platform were about 6 mm greater than on boulders. Growth virtually ceased at 27 mm for limpets at the barnacle-dominated boulder site and at 40 mm at the platform site. Recruiting cohorts had 20% survival on boulders and 37% on the platform during their first year. The largest size classes at both sites had around 57% annual survival. To test the effects of varying limpet densities on the growth and mortality of limpets and the maintenance of bare patches, densities of C ornata were experimentally increased at both sites. Beyond a density of 4 per 0.25 m(2) sizes and survival of limpets were reduced at both sites, but the effect was more pronounced at the boulder site. Limpets at the boulder site were more effective at maintaining bare space than those on the reef platform. Enclosing limpets in plots with and without barnacles showed that C ornata and a co-occurring species (Cellana denticulata (Martyn)) grazed more effectively and had greater growth in cleared plots. Overall, there was considerable variation in the demographics of C. ornata between populations driven by site-specific characteristics. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In temperate mangrove forests in New South Wales, Australia, the limpet Patelloida mimula Iredale lives on the oyster Saccostrea commercialis Iredale and Roughley, which, along with mangrove trees, provide the only hard substrata in a habitat otherwise dominated by soft-sediment. The objective of this study was to ascertain the degree of association between the limpet and the oyster by examining their patterns of co-occurrence in the forest and the relationship between individual pairs of limpets and oysters. Sampling of the distribution and abundance of limpets and oysters throughout the mangrove forest revealed that limpets were rarely present on substrata other than oysters. Patterns of abundance of limpets were, however, not directly related to the amount of habitat provided by the oysters. For example, there was a dramatic decline in the abundance of oysters from seaward to landward in the mangrove forest which was not reflected in the densities of limpets. Consequently, oysters appear to set the limits of distribution of limpets, but other factors modify their broad-scale patterns of distribution and abundance within these bounds. Limpers leave scars on oysters which might be home sites. About 98% of oysters with limpets had only one limpet per surface of oyster, and the distribution of limpets was overdispersed or repulsed. Moreover, in some areas of the forest, the lengths of limpets were directly related to lengths of oysters. Tracking of individual limpets for 13 days revealed that > 70% remained on the same scar of an oyster. This evidence suggests that for some limpets there is a strong association with particular oysters. Factors determining the distribution, abundance, and sizes of oysters are likely to be important sources of variation to the structure of populations of P. mimula in temperate mangrove forests.

AB Australasian abalone such as the greenlip abalone, Haliotis laevigata, prefer a diet of red algae (Rhodophyta); whereas, abalone from elsewhere more commonly prefer brown algae (Phaeophyta). Because of this feeding preference, thr structure of the digestive tract of H. laevigata was investigated using histological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM?) techniques. The digestive tract of both starved and fed adult H. laevigata revealed the presence of ciliated, mucus, and secretory cells throughout the digestive tract. The esophagus contained secretory, ciliated, and large mucous cells, with fragmentation spherules also present. The crop extended from the esophagus to the stomach. It was surrounded by thin muscularis and consisted mainly of secretory cells, although some phagocytes were present. The stomach possessed mainly secretory cells, although some ciliated cells, mucous cells, and phagocytes were present. The style sac differed from the stomach, having more ciliated cells. In intestinal regions I to In, the epithelium was shorter than in previous regions. Few cilia were present on the ridges, although many were observed in the gutters. Intestinal regions IV to V contained more mucous cells than intestine III, and more bacteria were observed associated with the fecal string than in other regions. The low incidence of bacterial association with the put epithelium was attributed to the occurrence and number of mucous cells, common throughout the digestive tract. Spherical bodies present in the lumen are believed to be fragmentation spherules involved in waste removal and enzyme release. Starved abalone contained fewer mucous cells in the esophagus, had less pronounced staining reactions in the stomach, contained large amounts of granular inclusions in the style sac, and had fewer phagocytes in the intestines.

AB Population dynamics, mortality factors, growth and dry weight changes in Quercus floribunda seedlings were studied to determine the implication of sun and shade microsites and the role of mast years on regeneration and maintenance of oak forests in Kumaun Himalaya. The number of seedlings was significantly greater at the sun microsites, but seedling survival was not, as ground herbage clearance at sun microsites accounted for 53.5 % mortality. Insect herbivores (e.g. acorn worm) were also one of the major mortality factors. At both microsites, most mortality was encountered between June and August. The initial seedling height at sun microsites was significantly lower compared to shade microsites. Seedlings at sun microsites were superior in terms of number of leaves and peak dry weight. Dry mass allocation in seedling components and root:shoot ratio was similar at both microsites. The study shows the importance of sun microsites and of masting in the potential for regeneration and expansion of Q. floribunda forests.

TI EFFECTS OF THE 1990/91 DROUGHT ON RANGELAND IN THE STEYTLERVILLE KAROO
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID SOUTH-AFRICA; RAINFALL
AB During 1990/91, rainfall was 70% below the long-term annual mean of 271 mm in the Steytlerville Karoo, a semiarid, small-stock ranching district of the south-eastern Cape. A drought severity index, that incorporated monthly rainfall and monthly averages of maximum daily temperature, showed that the deficit in plant-available moisture increased between January 1990 and September 1991, when drought was broken by 99 mm of rain. Following this unusual (P < 0.015) drought, perennial vegetation cover decreased from 45% to 21%. Mortality was greater among Karoo bushes (65%) than succulents (42%). Post-drought vegetation was dominated by grasses, forbs and the alien biennial Atriplex lindleyi, all of which emerged from soil-stored seed. Surviving shrub populations recovered slowly by post-drought seeding or rooting from branches. A change from Pentzia incana shrubland to grass and succulent dominance occurred within 30 months. Currently acceptable methods of estimating carrying capacity indicated that 30 months after the drought the capacity of the rangeland to carry domestic livestock was still 60% below pre-drought levels for the region. Rodents, inconspicuous when the drought ended, were very numerous in 1994 following summer rain. Carrying capacity of ecotonal Karoo shrublands for herbivores and granivores appears to be dynamic. Quantifying and tracking such variability is a challenge for pastoralists and scientists alike.

AB Temporal and spatial variations in the density, size composition and growth of exploited and non-exploited populations of the intertidal limpet Cellana capensis from the Transkei coast of southern Africa, between 1989 and 1991, are described. The timing and intensity of recruitment varied between shores and amongst sites within shores. Recruitment success was relatively poor and, in fact, at some of the protected sites no recruitment was recorded until July 1991. Juvenile and adult limpets were both significantly more abundant at the exploited than at the protected sites. The gradual decline in density of limpets observed at the latter sites reflected poor recruitment as well as senescence of older individuals. The extent of variations in density amongst shores was also found to vary from census to census. Limpets at the exploited sites tended to be much smaller than those found at the protected sites. Although there were initially no differences in the size of limpets amongst sites within shores marked differences became apparent during the course of the study. This finding, together with the observation of marked annual differences in population size composition at several of the study sites highlighted the temporal instability of these populations. Such results have profound implications for comparative studies of population size composition.
   The absence of significant differences in growth rate amongst shores suggests that differences in the intensity of competitive interactions may have been offset by the higher microalgal production at the exploited shore. It is also suggested that upshore migration f larger individuals may counter the intense competition experienced at mid-tidal levels on the exploited shore. Differences in the rate of recruitment could also account for some of the observed differences in population characteristics. Both of these explanations are viable alternatives to an earlier proposal which attributed differences solely to the effects of size-selective predation by man.

AB Aim Historically, biomes have been defined based on their structurally and functionally similar vegetation, but there is debate about whether these similarities are superficial, and about how biomes are defined and mapped. We propose that combined assessment of evolutionary convergence of plant functional traits and phylogenetic biome conservatism provides a useful approach for characterizing biomes. We focus on the little-known succulent biome, a trans-continentally distributed assemblage of succulent-rich, drought-deciduous, fire-free forest, thicket and scrub vegetation as a useful exemplar biome to gain insights into these questions.
   Location Global lowland (sub)tropics.
   Time period Present.
   Major taxa studied Angiosperms.
   Methods We use a model ensemble approach to model the distribution of 884 species of stem succulents, a plant functional group representing a striking example of evolutionary convergence. Using this model, phylogenies, and species occurrence data, we quantify phylogenetic succulent biome conservatism for 10 non-succulent trans-continental plant clades including prominent elements of the succulent biome, representing over 800 species.
   Results The geographical and climatic distributions of stem succulents provide an objective and quantitative proxy for mapping the distribution of the succulent biome. High fractions of succulent biome occupancy across continents suggest all 10 non-succulent study clades are phylogenetically conserved within the succulent biome.
   Main conclusions The trans-continental succulent and savanna biomes both show evolutionary convergence in key biome-related plant functional traits. However, in contrast to the savanna biome, which was apparently assembled via repeated local recruitment of lineages via biome shifts from adjacent biomes within continents, the succulent biome forms a coherent trans-continental evolutionary arena for drought-adapted tropical biome conserved lineages. Recognizing the important functional differences between the succulent-rich, grass-poor, fire-free succulent biome and the grass-dominated, succulent-poor, fire-prone savanna biome, and defining them as distinct seasonally dry tropical biomes, occupying essentially non-overlapping distributions, provides critical insights into tropical biodiversity and the extent of biome stasis versus biome shifting.

AB Aims Floral traits are frequently studied in population biology and evolutionary ecology but are rarely considered in functional trait-based studies focusing on the assembly of communities. We address this gap in trait-based community assembly by synthesizing the existing literature on processes driving floral and pollination-related trait patterns at community scales. We highlight limitations of the field due to lack of data and suggest potential directions of future research.
   Methods We conducted a systematic literature search collating studies that investigated floral traits in the context of plant community assembly, which allowed us to synthesize the current state of the art and point out important gaps in our knowledge.
   Conclusions The literature review shows that including pollination-related traits in community assembly studies can shed new light on species coexistence patterns not accounted for by other types of traits. The synthesis presented here shows the diversity of approaches and existing techniques which can generate a step forward in this open field of research. What currently seems to hinder comprehensive analyses of floral traits at community levels is the lack of data, particularly in existing large repositories for traits worldwide, as well as a gap in linking modern coexistence theory with floral traits.

AB Aims Phylogenetic endemism describes the extent to which unique phylogenetic lineages are constrained to restricted geographic areas. Previous studies indicate that species endemism is related to both past and modern climate, but studies of phylogenetic endemism are relatively rare and mainly focused on smaller regions. Here, we provide the first assessment of the patterns of species and phylogenetic endemism in angiosperm trees across the Northern Hemisphere as well as the relative importance of modern climate and glacial-interglacial climate change as drivers of these patterns. Location Northern Hemisphere. Major taxa Angiosperm trees. Methods Using tree assemblages at the scale of 100 km x 100 km grid cells and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models, we assessed the relationships between species endemism, phylogenetic endemism and modern climate variables, Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to present temperature velocity. Results Species and phylogenetic endemism were associated with both modern climate and glacial-interglacial climate change, with higher values in areas with stable historical climate and warmer and wetter modern conditions. Notably, the multivariate SAR analyses showed that the combinations of variables with highest Akaike's information criterion (AIC) weight always included both LGM-present climate instability and modern climate, that is, modern precipitation and temperature. Main conclusions Our results show that high phylogenetic endemism is partially dependent on long-term climate stability, highlighting the threat posed by future climate changes to the preservation of rare, phylogenetically distinct lineages of trees.

AB The range-wide decline of lions has led to their conservation becoming a top priority. Protection of free-ranging lion populations is dependent on securing space for lions but also on the ability and desire of local communities to coexist with lions. Our investigation takes a comparative and case study approach to explore the individual and societal desire to maintain current lion populations alongside communities in, or surrounding, Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, Tanzania's Ruaha National Park, and Kenya's southern Maasailand. Using data from attitudinal questionnaire surveys, we compare the desire to maintain current lion populations as well as the prevalence and success of conservation interventions aimed at increasing human-lion coexistence. In Maasailand, 88% of the respondents expressed a desire to see current lion populations maintained, while only 42% of the respondents in Ruaha and only 5% of the respondents in Hwange expressed this desire. More respondents reported predation by lions (lion predation) on livestock in Maasailand than in Hwange; personal benefits from conservation were greatest in Maasailand; and exposure to conservation education was highest in Ruaha. The Hwange findings were confounded by Zimbabwe's political and economic climate. In Ruaha and Maasailand, communal and individual conservation benefits influenced desired changes to lion population. Once variation between sites was controlled for, twinning personal benefits and conservation education together was most likely to increase an individual's desire to see current lion populations maintained.

   analysis; Habitats directive; EO-based indicators
ID FOREST BIODIVERSITY; SPECIES-DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; PLANT
AB Habitat quality - referring to the structure of a habitat - is crucial for the habitat functions and biodiversity-related ecosystem services. Its effective assessment and monitoring is important to meet not only scientific interest, but also practical conservation regulations. We herein present the approach of using a composite indicator of riparian forest quality, both quantitatively (habitat quality index HQI [0 vertical bar 1]) and categorically (quality types QT(1 ... 4)), integrating a set of spatio-structural indicators derived from earth observation data. We apply the geon concept to aggregate multiple sets of statistically profound and conceptually meaningful indicators to the well-established patch concept. The main difference is that instead of using a priori units (e.g. existing patch delineations), new patches (geons) are derived that directly represent the phenomenon of habitat quality. Patch boundaries correspond to the gradients imposed by the multivariate behavior of the underlying indicators. The approach provides a truly spatially explicit assessment, while at the same time retaining the potential for decomposability on the level of individual indicators. The example of a riparian forest is chosen, as riparian zones are complex ecosystems with a high biodiversity that are highly threatened. In our case, riparian forest habitat quality was assessed using four indicators: (I) tree species composition, (II) horizontal forest structure, (III) vertical forest structure, and (IV) water regime. The distribution of habitat quality (HQI) highlights hot- and cold-spots, where conservation measures may be needed. Cluster analysis reveals four types of patches that are characterized by a specific behavior of the aggregated indicators (QT(1) = fair composition, QT(2) = (old growth) forest plantations, QT(3) = characteristic tree species, QT(4) = forest gaps). This categorization enables the prevailing or lacking aspects of quality to be determined based on the decomposability of the index. In addition, the resulting patches were evaluated using landscape metrics. The findings achieved on a statistically significant level show that patches with high HQI scores are better connected and form large patches with a characteristic tree species composition. In contrast, areas with low HQI values are characterized by a non-favorable tree species composition and the existence of clear-cut areas or access roads. A comparison with an assessment using a traditional composite indicator approach reveals the sensitivity of the different sets of indicators and assessment methods. The presented habitat quality index can be considered as suitable for the assessment and monitoring of riparian forest quality, supporting spatially explicit conservation measures and the evaluation of applied measures.

AB This study aims to explore the use of the social-ecological system (SES) in tourism of a mountain area. Authors examined residents' perceptions of tourism impacts on four SES aspects: ecosystems, local knowledge, people and technology and property rights institutions. The aim is to find area that will be a "common ground" for community and area that can be a source of conflict and will require additional work to solve the differences. Second objective was to examine residents' perception towards future local development tourism policies (winter tourism, seasonality and environment and culture) and how those policies can affect natural, socio-economic and cultural aspects of mountain area. Residents' perceptions of sustainable tourism development potential, perceived tourism impacts, analysis of community attachment and employment sector of stakeholder were involved in this study. The authors applied the Q-methodology, as one SES-allied approach, in a small mountain community of Kopaonik, the Republic of Serbia. The results revealed that residents' agreement/disagreement is connected with two aspects: ecosystem and property rights and that ecosystem can be significantly influenced by all three development policies. Findings suggest that development of future natural conservation plans and new cultural attractions can have positive effects on all parts of social-ecological system. Some practical implications of those findings for tourism planning and development are also discussed.

AB To successfully integrate and engage the general public into marine conservation decisions it is important that individuals are well informed. This study surveyed two sample groups, marine environmental professionals working in the UK, is = 61, and members of the public surveyed in Truro, Cornwall, UK, n = 71. Public awareness of marine environmental threats and conservation efforts was assessed through comparison with the, assumed well informed, professional sample. Findings suggest that the public are generally well informed of threats to the marine environment, but are significantly less well informed about marine conservation and management strategies. Furthermore, despite indicating concern for the marine environment, members of the public display significantly fewer pro-environmental behaviours than marine conservation professionals. Public knowledge (and action) gaps are discussed as well as how these may be minimised, including a more interdisciplinary and active approach to science communication and public engagement.

AB Surface drifters and virtual particles are used to investigate transport between seven coastal regions in the central and southern Adriatic Sea to estimate the degree to which these regions function as a network. Alongshore coastal currents and cyclonic gyres are the primary circulation features that connected regions in the Adriatic Sea. The historical drifter observations span 25 years and, thus, provide estimates of transport between regions realized by the mean surface circulation. The virtual particle trajectories and a dedicated drifter experiment show that southeasterly Sirocco winds can drive eastward cross-Adriatic transport from the Italian coast near the Gargano Promontory to the Dalmatian Islands in Croatia. Southeasterly winds disrupt alongshore transport on the west coast. Northwesterly Mistral winds enhanced east-to-west transport and resulted in stronger southeastward coastal currents in the western Adriatic current (WAC) and export to the northern Ionian Sea. The central Italian regions showed strong connections from north to south, likely realized by alongshore transport in the WAC. Alongshore, downstream transport was weaker on the east coast, likely due to the more complex topography introduced by the Dalmatian Islands of Croatia. Cross-Adriatic connection percentages were higher for east-to-west transport. Cross-Adriatic transport, in general, occurred via the cyclonic sub-gyres, with westward (eastward) transport observed in the northern (southern) arms of the central and southern gyres.

   PROVISION
AB Creating methods to achieve sustainable development is a global challenge faced by civilization in the 21st century. As an operational element of sustainability science, landscape sustainability science (LSS) plays an important role in the development of methods for sustainable development. Landscape services (LS) is a newly emerging concept associated with ecosystem services (ES) that exhibits great potential for promoting landscape sustainability research despite its nascent stage of development. In this article, the historical development of the LS concept is reviewed, and the special implications and advantages of LS relative to ES for landscape practices are further expanded. Furthermore, a sustainability-oriented LS conceptual framework specifically developed for the integration of LS and landscape sustainability research is proposed. We refer to this framework as the landscape service capability-flow-demand (LSCFD) framework. Finally, the prospects for the application of the new framework in landscape sustainability assessments are explored. By using LSCFD, we suggest that a distinction be made between landscape service capacity (LSC), landscape service flow (LSF), and landscape service demand (LSD). LSC refers to the long-term potential of a landscape for producing various types of materials, energy, information, conditions, and effectiveness that are valued by people. LSF refers to the transmission process for material, energy, information, conditions and effectiveness from a landscape to benefit people that occur either within or across the landscape. LSD is the societal dimension of LS and refers to the types and volume of material, energy, information, conditions, and effectiveness that a landscape's inhabitants need to satisfy their existence, livelihood, and development. Based on the LSCFD framework, landscape sustainability assessments can be performed by considering the following four areas: LSC sustainability, LSF sustainability, LSD sustainability, and the dynamic equilibrium relationships among the other three areas. Thus, various types of LS capabilities, integrated services capabilities, and the diversity and balance of LS demands should be evaluated. Additionally, analyzing the supplying regions of LS flow, spatial orientation of the population that benefits, transmission media, transmission mechanism, and transmission limiting factors is essential to explore the dynamic equilibrium relationships between LS capability, flow, and demand. The LSCFD concept framework of LS provides a method for implementing LSS into actual practice. In the context of global environmental changes and sustainable development, the LSCFD framework of LS will definitely contribute to future research.

AB It is still far from clear whether and to what extent trees and grasses partition soil moisture in tropical savannas. A major reason for this is that we don't know how snapshot data on rooting differences translate into ecologically relevant patterns of water use at seasonal scales. We used stable isotopes in soil and stem water to quantify functional rooting profiles in grasses and two tree species in a South African savanna. Concurrently, we measured tree sap-flow velocity, grass canopy temperature (a transpiration correlate), and soil moisture content at multiple depths over the course of a growing season. We used lasso regression to identify the dominant soil moisture layers driving daily variation in tree and grass water-use metrics while controlling for weather variables. We found clear rooting depth differences between grasses (shallow) and trees (deep) from the isotopic data, and these patterns were strongly supported by the water-use data, which showed that grasses and trees predominantly responded to soil moisture availability at 5 and 40 cm depth, respectively. Our results provide a rare example of mechanistic support for the resource partitioning hypothesis in savannas, with important implications for our understanding of tree-grass dynamics under altered precipitation regimes.

AB The increasing rate of woody plant encroachment in grasslands or savannas remains a challenge to livestock farmers. The causes and control measures of woody plant encroachment are of common interest, especially where it negatively affects the objectives of an agricultural enterprise. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of gut passage (goats, cattle), dung (nutrients), fire, grass competition and trampling on establishment of A. nilotica and D. cinerea seedlings. Germination trials were subjected to the following treatments: 1) seed passage through the gut of cattle and goats and unpassed/untreated seeds (i.e. not ingested), 2) dung and control (no dung), 3) grass and control (mowed grass), 4) fire and control (no fire), 5) trampling and control (no trampling). The interaction of animal species, grass and fire had an effect on seedling recruitment (P < 0.0052). Seeds retrieved from goats and planted with no grass and with fire (6.81% +/- 0.33) had a significant effect on seedling recruitment than seeds retrieved from goats and planted with grass and no fire (2.98% +/- 0.33). Significantly more D. cinerea and A. nilotica seeds germinated following seed ingestion by goats (3.59% +/- 0.16) than cattle (1.93% +/- 0.09) and control or untreated seeds (1.69% +/- 0.11). Less dense grass cover, which resulted in reduced grass competition with tree seedlings for light, space and water, and improved seed scarification due to gut passage were vital for emergence and recruitment of Acacia seedlings. These results will contribute considerably to the understanding of the recruitment phase of woody plant encroachment.

AB New Caledonia (NC) is a biodiversity hotspot sheltering terrestrial ecosystems of high ecological and conservation value including tropical dry forests, rainforests, and maquis. However, uncontrolled bushfires threaten this exceptional biodiversity. A science-based fire management policy could reduce the impact of unwanted fires and help facing climate change. However, to date, data on the location, extent, causal factors and spatial patterns of fires had not been collected. We compiled a 13-year-long (1999-2011) spatially-explicit fire database for NC using MODIS and Landsat data. Using boosted regression trees we disentangled the role of anthropogenic factors, physiography, weather and vegetation on fire activity. We also characterized the location of fires and the vegetation composition at the fire edges, in order to determine which ecosystems were especially vulnerable. Fire size distribution was typically asymmetric with many small fires (<10 ha) and very few large fires (>500 ha). Ignitions were preferentially located close to villages, cities or roads, at low elevation and linked to high values of fire weather index. Fires were larger at the end of the dry season and during El Nino events. Most fires were bushfires burning in savannas, thickets and maquis, while rainforests were rather 'avoided' by fire. However, bushfires generally propagated towards forests of high-conservation value, thus increasing the potential for forest edge erosion. As savanna-forest and maquis-forest mosaics are dominant in the landscape, we discuss the extent to which NC could become a 'fire trap' where fire cannot be easily extirpated. Based on our spatially-explicit information on fire activity, we make recommendations for a sustainable forest and fire management policy which would balance the traditional use of fire and the conservation of the most valuable ecosystems. In particular, it may help by reducing the damages of large and destructive bushfires ignited during drought peaks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fledging mass of penguin chicks can be an indicator of food availability and environmental conditions at a penguin colony. For the period 1989 to 2011, we analyzed predictor variables of environmental and food resource factors acting on multiple spatial scales near Palmer Station, Antarctica, that may influence the interannual variability in Adelie penguin chick fledging mass (CFM). To understand the influence of parental Adelie penguin diet on CFM, we modeled the energy density and krill demographics of penguin diet samples. We found a weak but significant positive relationship between the proportion of immature krill in adult penguin diets and CFM, which may indicate that krill recruitment and prey availability to adults influences CFM. However, the impact of large-scale climate and local weather outweighed the impact of parental diet characteristics on CFM. CFM was negatively associated with a positive Antarctic Oscillation (or Southern Annular Mode) and increased westerly winds and was positively associated with increased air temperature. The mechanistic relationship between climate, local weather, and CFM could include direct and indirect impacts, such as increased thermo-regulative costs for unattended chicks, decreased chick feeding frequency, and smaller meal mass for chicks driven by the geophysical transport of krill by climate and wind events.

AB Limited resources in conservation dictate the need for efficient means of assessing wildlife abundance. Body mass-day range scaling rules and empirical track counts were applied to an established formula to estimate a wide range of wildlife densities. Using the southern Kalahari ecosystem of Botswana as an example, I provide the first comprehensive density estimates for the mammalian wildlife community (>0.2 kg), including densities for several species previously unattainable by other methods. Among a subset of species, empirical day ranges from this area were consistently greater than those predicted using scaling rules modeled with species from diverse ecosystems. I applied a correction factor based on this discrepancy, which generated values congruent with independent density estimates from the area. Although accurate measures of day range are a practical constraint to estimating densities from track counts, the results suggest that modest efforts to obtain location-specific day range estimates for a subset of species can improve density estimates for others derived from general allometric relationships. Given the strength of track surveys to accumulate unbiased observations quickly, in environments where animal tracks are readily visible, this approach shows potential for the rapid assessment of wildlife abundance.

AB Landscape conversion by humans may have detrimental effects on animal populations inhabiting managed ecosystems, but human-altered areas may also provide suitable environments for tolerant species. We investigated the spatial ecology of a highly mobile nocturnal avian species-the red-necked nightjar (Caprimulgus ruficollis)-in two contrastingly managed areas in Southwestern Spain to provide management recommendations for species having multiple habitat requirements. Based on habitat use by radiotagged nightjars, we created maps of functional heterogeneity in both areas so that the movements of breeding individuals could be modeled using least-cost path analyses. In both the natural and the managed area, nightjars used remnants of native shrublands as nesting sites, while pinewood patches (either newly planted or natural mature) and roads were selected as roosting and foraging habitats, respectively. Although the fraction of functional habitat was held relatively constant (60.9% vs. 74.1% in the natural and the managed area, respectively), landscape configuration changed noticeably. As a result, least-cost routes (summed linear distances) from nest locations to the nearest roost and foraging sites were three times larger in the natural than in the managed area (mean +/- SE: 1356 +/- 76 m vs. 439 +/- 32 m). It seems likely that the increased proximity of functional habitats in the managed area relative to the natural one is underlying the significantly higher abundances of nightjars observed therein, where breeders should travel shorter distances to link together essential resources, thus likely reducing their energy expenditure and mortality risks. Our results suggest that landscape configuration, but not habitat availability, is responsible for the observed differences between the natural and the managed area in the abundance and movements of breeding nightjars, although no effect on body condition was detected. Agricultural landscapes could be moderately managed to preserve small native remnants and to favor the juxtaposition of functional habitats to benefit those farm species relying on patchy resources.

AB Timber production is the most pervasive human impact on tropical forests, but studies of logging impacts have largely focused on timber species and vertebrates. This review focuses on the risk from invasive alien plant species, which has been frequently neglected in production forest management in the tropics. Our literature search resulted in 114 publications with relevant information, including books, book chapters, reports and papers. Examples of both invasions by aliens into tropical production forests and plantation forests as sources of invasions are presented. We discuss species traits and processes affecting spread and invasion, and silvicultural practices that favor invasions. We also highlight potential impacts of invasive plant species and discuss options for managing them in production forests. We suggest that future forestry practices need to reduce the risks of plant invasions by conducting surveillance for invasive species; minimizing canopy opening during harvesting; encouraging rapid canopy closure in plantations; minimizing the width of access roads; and ensuring that vehicles and other equipment are not transporting seeds of invasive species. Potential invasive species should not be planted within dispersal range of production forests. In invasive species management, forewarned is forearmed.

AB This study aimed to determine the functional seasonal attributes for herbivores of the major habitats and landscapes of the Savuti-Mababe-Linyanti ecosystem (SMLE) of northern Botswana and how various herbivore species responded to this heterogeneity. Floodplain grasslands and dambo grasslands provided the only significant green forage and biomass during the late dry season, whereas short grasslands of the Mababe Depression provided the highest forage quality of all habitats during the wet season. The ability to provide reliable forage and drinking water in floodplain, swampand dambo grasslands attracted large concentrations of zebra and buffalo during the dry season, which was mediated by fire. Large concentrations of zebra were observed in mineral-rich grasslands of the Mababe Depression during the wet season, whereas buffalo were not observed in these open grassland landscapes in this season. Other herbivore species appeared to use the same landscapes year-round where lechwe were observed mainly in floodplain and swamp landscapes on the western edge of the Linyanti Swamps, while wildebeest and impala were observed in floodplains and adjacent woodlands near permanent water suggesting that these species had access to sufficient resources at a landscape scale. Thus various herbivore species responded differently to functional heterogeneity across seasons and scales.

AB Globally, pressure from the illegal harvesting of wildlife is a recurrent issue for protected area management. In order to ensure the effective conservation of wildlife resources, law enforcement has been identified as one of the most important components of protected area management. Our study aimed at addressing the following two research questions: (1) what are the perceptions of law enforcement staff in Gonarezhou National Park (GNP), Zimbabwe, about illegal hunting practices, illegal hunter's characteristics, wild animals commonly targeted and trends of poaching in the park; and, (2) what are the suggestions for reducing illegal hunting and enhancing wildlife conservation in GNP ecosystem? Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire administered through interviews from 42 law enforcement staff representing 47 % of the total law enforcement staff in GNP from February to May 2011. Our results showed that 76 % (n = 32) of the patrol rangers perceived that most illegal hunters were between 21 and 30 years. Nearly all respondents (95;% n = 40) reported that most poachers were residents of villages situated within 20 km from the boundary of GNP. Medium to large wild herbivores were reportedly the most illegally animal hunted species whilst large carnivores were the least illegally hunted animals. Most of the respondents (79 %, n = 33) perceived that poaching activities had declined in GNP ecosystem between 2005 and 2010 due to an increase in arrests. Increasing conservation awareness and education in adjacent communal areas would help to further reduce illegal hunting and promote wildlife conservation.

AB Most studies on greenhouse gas emissions from animals concentrated on domestic animals, with limited data available from wild animals. The number of marine animals is potentially large in coastal Antarctica. In this paper, N2O and CH4 emissions were investigated from a penguin colony, a seal colony, a skua colony, the adjacent animal-lacking tundra, and background tundra sites to test the effects of marine animals on their fluxes in maritime Antarctica. Extremely high N2O emissions occurred in the penguin puddles (mean 392 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)) and seal wallows (mean 579 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)). The N2O emissions from animal colony tundra (13-57 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)) are much higher than those from the animal-lacking tundra, whereas the background tundra showed negligible N2O fluxes. Penguin puddles and seal wallows were stronger CH4 emitters than animal colony tundra soils, while animal-lacking tundra soils were strong CH4 sinks. Overall high N2O and CH4 emissions were modulated by soil physical and chemical processes associated with marine animal activities: sufficient supply of the nutrients NH4+-N and NO3--N, total nitrogen, and total organic carbon from marine animal excreta, animal tramp, and high soil water-filled pore space. Laboratory incubation experiments further confirmed that penguin and seal colony soils produced much higher N2O and CH4 emissions than animal-lacking tundra soils. Our results indicate that marine animal colonies are the hot spots for N2O and CH4 emissions in maritime Antarctica, and even at the global scale, and current climate warming will further increase their emissions.

AB Many studies have examined positive feedbacks between invasive plant traits and nutrient cycling, but few have investigated whether feedbacks arise from introduction of pre-adapted species or from eco-evolutionary feedback that develops after introduction. Eco-evolutionary feedback could occur between an invader's leaf tissue C:N ratio and its response to litter accumulation. Previous modeling predicts that occurrence of this feedback would be reflected by: (1) field data showing higher litter:biomass ratios in the invasive range; (2) high C:N genotypes benefiting more from experimental litter additions than low C:N genotypes; (3) this beneficial effect on high C:N genotypes inducing a critical transition toward invader dominance when a critical amount of litter is added to a native species-dominated community experiencing low nutrient conditions. Here, we empirically tested these predictions for the invasive grass Phalaris arundinacea, which has undergone post-introduction evolutionary change toward attaining higher C:N ratios under high nutrient conditions. We performed a biogeographical comparison of litter:biomass ratios in the native (Europe) and invasive (USA) range, and an experiment with mesocosms from the invasive range under low nutrient conditions. Low and high C:N Phalaris genotypes were introduced into native-dominated and bare mesocosms, to which varying litter amounts were added. The biogeographical comparison revealed that litter:biomass ratios were higher in the invasive range. The mesocosm experiment showed that when grown in isolation, only high C:N genotypes responded positively to litter. This effect, however, was not strong enough to stimulate Phalaris when exposed to competition with native species. Our results suggest that eco-evolutionary feedback between Photons' C:N ratio and litter accumulation could occur, but only under high nutrient conditions. Our experiments suggest that eco-evolutionary feedback may select for specialist rather than superior genotypes. Hence, genotypic variation induced by post-introduction admixture may be subject to context-dependent selection due to eco-evolutionary feedback, increasing trait variation within invasive populations.

AB Coexistence of N-2-fixing legumes and non-legume trees with grasses in African savannas results in intense competition between these life-forms. We hypothesised that belowground competition might induce different nutritional constraints in N-2- versus non-N-2-fixing species. A field (Hluhluwe-imFolozi nature reserve, South Africa) competition experiment with two N-2-fixing legume species (Acacia burkei and Acacia karroo) and two non-N-2-fixing species (Schotia brachypetala and Spirostachys africana) both with clipped grass and without grass was established. Plants were supplied with no fertilizer, or generous amounts of fertilizer (200 kg N ha(-1), 100 kg P2O5 ha(-1), 7.1 kg K2O ha(-1)) supplied as either 28-10 (N-K), P or a combination of these fertilizers (NPK). Regularly clipped grass suppressed growth (by more than 90 %) of both N-2- and non-N-2-fixing seedlings equally. Biomass accumulation of seedlings grown with grass and the grasses themselves responded positively to NK and/or NPK, but not P, although P-fertilization did have effects on foliar [N] and delta N-15 values of trees and grasses showing that plants accessed the fertilizer. Tree delta N-15 values and foliar [N] were also modified by NPK, demonstrating access to fertilizer. However, the ameliorative effects of NPK on grass competition-induced biomass suppression were only partial. This may be due to 'non-resource competition' (i.e. root gaps) imposed by dense grass roots. The fact that nutrients were able to partially ameliorate the effects of grass competition, however, indicates that such 'non-resource competition' may be partially overcome by even more generous supply of fertilizers.

AB Tree species composition can change as a result of succession, climate change, fire suppression, and invasive species. These changes clearly affect forests, but they can also affect aquatic ecosystems based on differences in the input quality of leaf litter, such as plant secondary compounds. These compounds vary in type and concentration depending on species and can be toxic to aquatic organisms. To examine toxic effects on Pseudacris maculata and Pseudacris crucifer tadpoles, we conducted 60-d laboratory experiments to compare leaf litter leachate from a dominant canopy species (red oak) and nonnative species (white pine) with an aquatic grass (prairie cordgrass) and plain water control. An additional experiment examined the effects of white pine on Bufo americanus, Hyla versicolor, and tannin concentrations in natural ponds. Compared with the control and grass, tree leaf extracts resulted in reduced tadpole survival. Leached compounds from pine reduced tadpole survival to 3?d or less. Tadpoles were able to metamorphose in significant numbers only from the two controls. The lowered survival with the red oak treatment might have been caused by lowered dissolved oxygen or high tannin concentrations. However, pine is known to have high concentrations of toxic monoterpenes, which should be investigated further. We found that tannin concentrations in natural ponds were much lower than the test concentrations, indicating that these results may represent worst-case scenarios or unrealistic concentrations.

AB Environmental pressures, such as physical factors, diet and contaminants may affect interactions between microbial symbionts and their multicellular hosts. Despite obvious relevance, effects of antimicrobial contaminants on host-symbiont relations in non-target aquatic organisms are largely unknown. We show that exposure to antibiotics had negative effects on survival and juvenile development of the copepod Nitocra spinipes and caused significant alterations in copepod-associated bacterial communities. The significant positive correlations between indices of copepod development and bacterial diversity indicate that disruption of the microflora was likely to be an important factor behind retarded juvenile development in the experimental animals. Moreover, as evidenced by ribotype distribution in the bacterial clone libraries, the exposure to antibiotics caused a shift in dominance from Betaproteobacteria to Cardinium bacteria; the latter have been shown to cause reproductive manipulations in various terrestrial arthropods. Thus, in addition to providing evidence that the antibiotic-induced perturbation of the microbial community associates with reductions in fitness-related traits of the host, this study is the first record of a copepod serving as a host for endosymbiotic Cardinium. Taken together, our results suggest that (1) antimicrobial substances and possibly other stressors can affect micobiome and symbiont-mediated interactions in copepods and other hosts, and (2) Cardinium endosymbionts may occur in other copepods and affect reproduction of their hosts.

AB This study aimed to detect the presence and the daily activity patterns of large mammals in a mixed forest in north-western Turkey. Field studies were carried out at 21 camera trap stations with a total sampling effort of 1046 camera trap days, covering an area of approximately 70 km(2) between June 2009 and January 2010. Brown bear (Ursus arctos), wolf (Canis lupus), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), red deer (Cervus elaphus), wild boar (Sus scrofa), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European badger (Meles meles) and European hare (Lepus europaeus) were not known to be present in the area. European hare was the most captured species among the others and Eurasian lynx was the most captured carnivore. There was a positive relationship between spatial distributions and daily activity patterns of European hare and Eurasian lynx. European hare, Eurasian lynx and red fox were found to have nocturnal activity in the study area. The number of records between the activity classes (nocturnal and diurnal) did not differ for red deer and wolf. This study revealed the ecological importance of the area by determining both the species present in this area and their activity patterns.

AB 1. The spatial arrangement of individuals and populations may have deep influences on all the biotic interactions within a community.
   2. The spatial distribution of nests of the ant Crematogaster scutellaris Olivier was analysed in an olive orchard in central Italy. As this species nests inside tree trunks, the regular structure of this simplified ecosystem may help to reduce the confounding effect of habitat heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of nests. In total, 531 trees were mapped and their shape (size and structure of the trunk) recorded. The presence of C. scutellaris nests in each tree was assessed in spring-summer and autumn 2006 and 2007.
   3. The number of occupied trees changed in time, from a maximum of 129 (summer 2006) to a minimum of 60 (autumn 2007). Occupancy of tree was related to its shape, with larger trees being more frequently and more steadily occupied than smaller ones.
   4. Nests were spatially aggregated, forming well-defined clusters, but aggregation was not explained by a corresponding clumping of larger trees. Nests belonging to the same cluster were usually not aggressive to each other, whereas aggression was more common between nests belonging to different clusters. The dynamic nature of the system coupled with the clustered distribution of nests, is consistent with a hypothesis of seasonal polydomy, and suggest that whereas some trees are steadily occupied (core) others are opportunistically colonised when new resources are discovered (satellites).
   5. Clusters size distribution was shown to follow a truncated power-law, a finding consistent with the idea that clusters are self-organised structures dependent on local interactions. These results suggest that spatial self-organisation in ant colonies may in principle be more common than previously thought, although the mechanisms generating these patterns still need to be clarified.

AB 1. Scaling theory predicts that organisms respond to different scales of resource patchiness in relation to their own size. We tested the hypothesis that the scale of nutrient patchiness mediates resource partitioning between large trees and small grasses in a semi-arid savanna.
   2. In a factorial field experiment, Colophospermum mopane trees and associated grasses were fertilized at either a fine or coarse scale of patchiness with nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or N + P. The growth of marked tree shoots, herbaceous biomass and leaf N and P concentrations were monitored for 2 years following fertilization.
   3. Responses of trees were partly scale dependent. Tree leaf N concentration and shoot length relatively increased with fertilization at a coarse scale. Tree leaf mass decreased when P was supplied at a fine scale of patchiness, suggesting intensified grass competition.
   4. Phosphorus fertilization increased leaf P concentrations more in grasses than trees, whereas N fertilization increased leaf N concentration moderately in both trees and grasses. Herbaceous above-ground biomass around focal trees was negatively correlated with tree size when fertilized with N, suggesting intensified tree competition.
   5. Synthesis. Our results support the hypothesis that trees benefit more from nutrients supplied at a relatively coarse scale of patchiness. No direct responses of grasses to scale were detected. In trees, the scale effect was surpassed by the effect of sample year, when rainfall varied.

AB We analyzed the flowering phenodynamics of 43 Asteraceae species co-occurring in natural populations of Chaco Serrano forests in central Argentina. We explored the potential influence of factors such as photoperiod and climate (variations in temperature, rainfall, and frost), animal-plant interactions (richness of floral visitors, frequency of visits), some plant attributes (plant growth form, seed dispersal mechanism), and evolutionary relationships among species on flowering phenodynamics. Cluster Analysis (CA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were the multivariate statistical methods used to analyze emerging patterns associated with these co-occurring species. Null-model analyses were used to evaluate whether flowering times are aggregated, segregated, or random. Results showed that flowering phenology was significantly correlated with the seasonal variation in temperature, photoperiod, rainfall, and frost. The multivariate statistical methods separated all the species in three groups: 1) species with short flowering time, large plant floral display, high frequency of visits by a large number of species of floral visitors, anemochorous fruits, and shrubby growth form, with a tendency to a segregated flowering pattern; 2) species with long flowering time, small plant floral display, low frequency of visits by few insect species, anemochorous fruits, and herbaceous growth form; and 3) species with long flowering time, small plant floral display, intermediate values for frequency of visits and number of species of floral visitors, seed dispersal mechanisms other than anemochory, and herbaceous growth form. In addition, all but one species belonging to early-branching tribes (tribes phylogenetically close to the root of the Asteraceae tree) were grouped together and clustered in the same region of the two-dimensional PCA ordination. All species belonging to the late-branching tribes (Asteroideae subfamily tribes) included in group 1 were separated from the other Asteroideae species in the PCA. In conclusion, it seems that climatic factors restrict the phenological period of most species, and that plant attributes and taxonomic membership are strongly related to flowering phenodynamics in this group of Asteraceae studied.

AB Conservation status and updated census of Patella ferruginea (Gastropoda, Patellidae) in Ceuta: distribution patterns and new evidence of the effects of environmental parameters on population structure.-The Strait of Gibraltar has important populations of the highly endangered patellid limpet Patella ferruginea. Between 2006 and 2010, an exhaustive census was carried out in Ceuta. The total coastline was divided into 17 sectors. The coast of each sector was examined by using 10 m transects. For the case of those sectors composed of breakwaters, jetties or islets, no transects were used, and instead, the total number of individuals was recorded. Each individual was measured to the nearest millimetre using a calliper. Moreover, the complete rocky shore length where the species could potentially be present was calculated, and an estimation of the total number of individuals that each sector could host was made. Results indicate that Ceuta could be home to around 44,000 individuals. The species found in Point Benzu, its westernmost limit of distribution on the North African coasts. The largest populations were recorded on the South Bay, with higher Mediterranean influence. Our results indicate that substrate roughness (topographic heterogeneity) and the area's accessibility highly influence the abundance and population structure. Those populations located on high topographic heterogeneity substrates show higher recruitment rates and lower percentages of larger individuals, while medium to low rugosity surfaces presented the opposite pattern. Additionally, easily accessible areas (and frequented by humans) presented smaller average shell sizes. Implications of the results for conservation purposes are discussed.

AB Ocean currents, prevailing winds, and the hierarchical structures of river networks are known to create asymmetries in re-colonization between habitat patches. The impacts of such asymmetries on metapopulation persistence are seldom considered, especially rarely in theoretical studies. Considering three classical models (the island, the stepping stone and the distance-dependent model), we explore how metapopulation persistence is affected by (i) asymmetry in dispersal strength, in which the colonization rate between two patches differs in direction, and (ii) asymmetry in connectivity, in which the overall colonization pattern displays asymmetry (circulating or dendritic networks). Viability can be drastically reduced when directional bias in dispersal strength is higher than 25%. Re-colonization patterns that allow for strong local connectivity provide the highest persistence compared to systems that allow circulation. Finally, asymmetry has relatively weak effects when metapopulations maintain strong general connectivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Orchid pollinators have highly varied life histories with complex biotic resource requirements, about which we have limited knowledge. Among the specialist orchid pollinators are insect predators and parasitoids with specific prey types such as aphids and subterranean scarab larvae; oligolectic bees that collect pollen from limited sources such as bellflowers; euglossine bees and butterflies that collect particular plant chemicals for reproduction and self defense; oil-collecting bees that provision their brood cells with floral oils from a few plants; bees that collect rare floral resins to construct their nest and brood cells; moths and butterflies that require specific larval host plants; mosquitos and horse flies that need blood; and fungus gnats and carrion flies tied to fungi and dead animals. Loss of critical biotic resources and relationships can reduce the abundance of orchid pollinators and/or their effectiveness. Protection of large, plant rich, pesticide-free orchid habitats is key to conserving essential pollinator resources.

AB The biomass and composition of the phytoplankton was studied at seven sampling stations located at different water bodies (open water, inner pond and canal) of a large, shallow turbid lake (Lake Ferto, Neusiedlersee). The open water was characterized by picocyanobacteria and meroplanktonic diatoms, the artificial canal by epiphytic diatoms, cryptophytes and chlorophytes. The inner ponds, based on the phytoplankton composition, were positioned between these water bodies. High picoplankton abundance (> 10(6) cells.mL(-1)) and predominance (up to 80% contribution to the total phytoplankton biomass) were detected in the open water and the inner ponds, which was hypothesized to be the result of the turbid environment by the suppression of the top down control and by light-limitation. Information on the diversity of the picoplankton in the open water of the lake has been presented first time in this study. Based on molecular analysis (16S rRNA gene and cpcBA-IGS region) the dominant group of picocyanobacteria belonged to the Cyanobium gracile cluster (group A) of the picophytoplankton clade in April. Members of two other picocyanobacterial groups (group B and C) were also detected.

AB Recent studies have revealed that the vermilion rockfish Sebastes miniatus is a cryptic species pair. The splitting of this species impacts stock size estimates and draws attention to the unintended consequences of current management policies. Differences in exploitation level between the species necessitated an evaluation of population structure and connectivity among regional management segments of the fishery. Analysis of gene flow and calculations of larval dispersal values were accomplished using 782 bp of DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of 684 vermilion rockfish sampled from 16 sites between Kyuquot Sound, Canada, and San Quintin, Mexico. Significant genetic heterogeneity was found among sample sites (Phi(ST) = 0.0742, p < 0.001 and F-ST = 0.0899, p < 0.001). Isolation by distance analysis produced a significant correlation, suggesting low average larval dispersal distance. Analysis of molecular variance showed significant partitioning of genetic variance across the biogeographic boundary at Point Conception (Phi(CT) = 0.0923, p < 0.001 and F-CT = 0.0135, p < 0.001) with additional genetic barriers found at Cape Mendocino, Punta Colnett, Santa Monica Bay, and along the coast of Washington. These genetic barriers conform to oceanographic compartments previously proposed for the California Current Ecological Province and suggest natural management units for this species.

AB We summarise the main issues related to Community-Based Natural Resource Management which were discussed at an International Workshop organized in Niamey, Niger, in March 2008. The objective of the workshop was to compare and contrast different development-oriented biodiversity conservation and natural resource management approaches as they exist across Africa. These approaches were explored following (1) the fundamentals of natural resource management in relation to local development and livelihoods and (2) the multi-functional nature of land use. The major topics subject to debate were the dichotomy between strictly protected areas and conservation areas including human activities; the importance of legitimate, people-centred conservation, as opposed to legal (drawn from the law) conservation; the key role of market instruments, participatory approaches, interdisciplinarity and local governance; and finally the strong relationships between agriculture and biodiversity conservation, especially at landscape level. We then provide a short summary of the 12 papers addressing the above topics and selected for the Special Issue of Biodiversity and Conservation on "Natural Resource Management and Local Development'' (Vol xx, No xx, 2009).

AB A restoration field trial was designed to investigate herbaceous weed control and Sand Fynbos plant establishment on a fallow field at Riverlands Provincial Nature Reserve located on the West Coast forelands. The objectives were to investigate optimal treatments for reducing weed cover and the interaction between weed cover and shrub establishment. Herbaceous weeds were controlled using tilling, herbicide and carbon-rich mulch in a split-plot replicated design. Seedlings of two bioassay fynbos species were planted and survival monitored. Tilling in April reduced weed cover for four months, but thereafter had no overall effect. Herbicide applied twice, in May and early July, reduced weed cover significantly for a longer period, whereas mulch had no effect. Soil nitrogen levels were slightly higher than those of untransformed Sand Fynbos soils but no effects of the treatments on nitrogen mineralization rates or total available nitrogen were found. Bioassay plant establishment was highest in the herbicide plus mulch treatment and was negatively related to herbaceous weed cover. Molerat activity, which was positively related to weed cover, was noted to reduce the establishment success of shrub seedlings. There was no overall effect of tilling and mulch on plant establishment in the field, although mulch influenced growth rates in the pot experiment. In terms of cost-effectiveness, it is recommended that herbicide treatment be used to control herbaceous weeds prior to the re-introduction of fynbos species. Other factors to consider in planning a Sand Fynbos restoration, that may impact on native seedling establishment, include whether to: burn the site to remove standing alien biomass and litter; reduce soil N levels; control molerat and gerbil colonies; control browsers; and control of regenerating invasive alien plants.

AB The two-dimensional motion behaviour of the common intertidal gastropod Littorina littorea is investigated as a function of the immersion time from three sampling sites on an exposed rocky shore. A total of 90 individuals have been individually marked and tracked over 14 consecutive daylight low tide. Successive displacements show very intermittent behaviour, with a few localised large displacements over a wide range of small displacements. We show that successive displacements are described by flight length 1,1 heavy-tailed distributions with P(l(d))-l(d)(-mu). The very low values of the exponent mu (mu approximate to 2.22, 2.43 and 2.67) indicate that L. littorea flights fall into the category of super-diffusive processes. These exponents were significantly higher than the special value p 2 analytically and theoretically predicted to be the most advantageous in optimising long-term encounter statistics, especially for low-prey-density scenario. As natural selection should favour flexible behaviour, leading to different optimum searching statistics, under different conditions, our results support the idea that the differences in food concentration and distribution encountered at the different sites by L. littorea led to different heavy-tailed distributions observed for the most extreme displacements.

AB Question: To establish a habitat classification based on functional group co-occurrence that may help the drawing up of conservation plans.
   Location: Riverine forest fragments in the Grand-duche de Luxembourg, Europe.
   Methods: Forest fragments were surveyed for their abundance of vascular plants. These were clustered into emergent groups according to 14 life-traits related to plant dispersal, establishment and persistence. Forest fragments were classified according to similar distribution of the identified emergent groups. Environmental factors were related to the emergent group richness in each forest type using generalized linear models.
   Results: Contrary to former species centred classifications, only two groups of forests, each with clearly different emergent group composition and conservation requirements, were detected: (1) swamp forests characterized by anemogamous perennials, annuals and hydrochorous perennials and (2) moist forests characterized by barochorous perennials, small geophytes and zoochorous phanerophytes. From a conservation point of view, priority should be given to large swamp forest with intact flooding regimes. This is in accordance with the high wind and water dispersal capacities of their typical emergent groups. For the moist forests, conservation priorities should be high forest connectivity and historical continuity since dispersal and establishment of their characteristic emergent groups are highly limited.
   Conclusions: The described methodology, situated at an intermediate integration level between the individual species and whole community descriptors, takes advantage of both conservation plans built for single species and the synthetic power of broad ecological measures.

AB Elephants living in dense woodlands are difficult to count. Many elephant populations in Africa occur in such conditions. Estimates of these populations based on total counts, aerial counts and dung counts often lack information on precision and accuracy. We use standard mark-recapture field methods to obtain estimates of population size with associated confidence limits. We apply this approach to a closed elephant population in the Tembe Elephant Park (300 km(2)), South Africa. A registration count completed in 4 months gives a known population size. We evaluate mark-recapture models against the known population size. Individual identification profiles obtained for elephants during the registration count and mark-recapture events indicate that at least 167 elephants live in the park. We consider this value as an estimate of the minimum number alive. We include 189 sightings of bulls and 37 sightings of breeding herds in the mark-recapture modelling. Of the models we test (Petersen, Schnabel, Schumacher, Jolly-Seber, Bowden's, Poisson and negative binomial), Bowden's gives an estimate closest to the registration count. Assumptions of the model are not violated. For all models except one (negative binomial), our estimates improve with increased sampling intensity. Confidence intervals do not improve with increased effort except for the Schnabel model. Mark-recapture methods should be considered as reliable estimators of population size for elephants occurring in dense woodlands and forests when other methods cannot be relied on.

AB Colour-infrared (CIR) imagery was evaluated for its usefulness to test hypotheses about grazing in the intertidal gastropods Nerita atramentosa (Reeve) and Benibicium nanum (Lamarck). Tiles of natural sandstone were placed onto the shore to accumulate micro-algae for a period of 6 weeks. Then, in the laboratory, three replicate tiles were assigned into each of 6 treatments (Nerita and Bembicum at densities of 3 or 6 animals, plus a control and a control for artifacts due to cages). CIR images were acquired before and three times after the animals were placed on the tiles. NIR/red ratio images, which are used to estimate micro-algal biomass, were generated from calibrated CIR data. Nerita at the greater density were more effective at removing microalgae than at the smaller density. The latter were more effective than Bembicium at either density, which did not significantly decrease algal biomass from that in controls. These data are consistent with previous field observations and indicate that CIR imagery is an effective method for testing hypotheses about grazing by intertidal gastropods. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB African Acacia species are often major contributors to the progressive increase in the woody component of savannas, a phenomenon commonly referred to as bush encroachment. In Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, the numbers of adult Acacia nilotica (L.) Willd. Ex Del. subsp. kraussiana (Benth.) Brenan trees per hectare far exceed those of A. karroo Hayne adults. The relative dominance is reversed in the juvenile stage with A. karroo outnumbering A. nilotica threefold outside closed woodlands. We experimentally investigated the effects of location, structural habitat type, species, predator type and rodent presence on the level of post-dispersal seed predation in an attempt to explain species dominance in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park. Post-dispersal predation of A. karroo seeds (21.8%) was higher than that of A. nilotica (12.7%). Predation levels depended on site, structural habitat type, level of protection from different predator types and rodent presence/absence. There was more rodent predation in tall grass areas (26.0%) than grazing lawn (10.7%) or canopy areas (15.2%), and most seeds (19.7%) were lost from unprotected control groups. Rodent presence was a significant factor in a model aiming to determine reasons for unexplained seed disappearance. Post-dispersal predation of seeds could not account for the differences in success between A. karroo and A. nilotica in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park.

AB To investigate their distribution and total numbers, resting eggs of the anostracan Chirocephalus ruffoi were collected from the bed of a temporary pool in southern Italy. Samples were taken at 0.5 in intervals along six transects oriented at 30degrees from each other, by means of a cylindrical core sampler. The horizontal distribution of intact resting eggs was extremely patchy, with cyst number per core ranging from 191 to 1,400 (CV = 32.7%), corresponding to a mean of between 0.8 and 4.3 cysts cm(-3). Differences observed were related to core position and transect orientation, total cyst numbers being markedly higher in the leeward area of the pool compared to the windward area. Marked variation was also evident in vertical distribution, a significant, though weak correlation was recorded between egg density and sediment depth. Cyst-bank size (+/-95% confidence limits) of the pool bed, estimated from the mean cyst number cm(-3) obtained for the 6 transects, ranged between 1.0 x 10(8) and 1.3 x 10(8) cysts.
   Hatching in the laboratory was very erratic. Despite significant differences in hatching, the observed variation was unrelated to most of the variables considered (position within sections, cores and transects, pre-incubation treatment) and was explained only by initial sediment conditions (moist/dry). In none of the experimental conditions tested was synchronous hatching obtained.
   Possible causal factors (mixing of the bottom sediments by cattle, egg age, storage conditions, differential exposure to environmental cues as well as variability in hatching response even at clutch level) are discussed.

AB Flowering activity and sex expression of Bischofia javanica Blume were investigated for 3 years. B. javanica is an invasive dioecious tree of subtropical forests on the Bonin Islands in the western Pacific of Japan. The sex ratio showed a significant male bias (1.25-2.33). Smaller trees were significantly male biased, whereas larger trees showed no significant difference in sex expression, suggesting that males tend to be more precocious in sexual reproduction. We found evidence for sex changes in B. javanica; these have not been reported previously. Most of the 1653 census trees remained non-flowering (59.1%); 3.7% of them showed sex changes, and the percentage of trees repeatedly flowering as males and females was 10.5 and 3.4%, respectively. Sex changes were observed in both directions but a larger percentage of male trees became female. Flowering frequency and sex expression were significantly related to tree size (i.e. diameter at breast height). Over the 3 years, trees that were consistent females were the largest; inconsistent trees (switching sex between years) were intermediate in size, whereas consistent males were the smallest. There were no significant differences in relative growth rate (RGR) among trees of different sex or flowering frequencies. These results suggest that the maintenance of female reproduction is not related to changes in RGR of diameter but to flowering frequency or the reversal to the male form, dependent upon the internal resource status of individual trees.

AB Four structural types of cerrado vegetation were examined to test the following hypotheses: (1) there are predictable changes in woody plant density, species richness and life-history strategies from one structural type to another; and (2) plant species composition in the less-rich structural types represent particular and impoverished subsets of those found in the richer ones. The study was conducted at Fazenda Palmares (5degrees33'S, 42degrees37'W) Piaui State, Brazil. A 47% decrease in woody plant density between cerradao (forest) and the least-dense type of cerrado sensu stricto (scrub) was associated with a 40% decrease in species richness. The percentage of lower-layer species was reduced by 29% in the least dense type of cerrado sensu stricto compared to cerradao. The proportion of species that flower and fruit during the rainy season was also reduced by one third. Species were not distributed as impoverished subsets along the cerradao-cerrado sensu stricto gradient. It is argued that the reduction in woody plant density and richness is partly due to factors limiting the occurrence of species with particular life-history strategies. The species composition of structural types is affected by the 'mass effect' and also by surrounding biotas, which provide species that colonize particular types of cerrado vegetation. Both these processes reduce the likelihood that the species composition in the poorer structural types are simple subsets of those present in the richer types.

AB 1. Renewed batch cultures of three algivorous and one bacterivorous ciliate showed that ciliate reproductive rates increase with increasing food concentration up to an asymptote. Maximum r(m) values for Strobilidium gyrans, Bursaridium difficile and Euplotes eurystomus feeding on the cryptomonad alga Rhodomonas minuta were 0.87, 0.86 and 0.45 day-1, respectively, while Paramecium aurelia feeding on the bacterium Enterobactor aerogenes had an r(m) of 0.40 day-1. B. difficile had a food threshold (r(m) = 0) of 0.38 mug C ml-1 and P. aurelia had a threshold of 1.6 mug C ml-1.
   2. The presence of suspended fine (particle size <1 mum) and coarse (particle size 1-2 mum) clay suppressed the half maximum reproductive rate of the ciliate Strobilidium gyrans by up to 69% but had no effect on B. difficile, E. eurystomus or P. aurelia. Populations of ciliates unaffected by clay may be released in situations where suspended particles negatively affect their metazooplankton predators and competitors.

AB Although seasonality in the tropics is often less pronounced than in temperate areas, tropical ecosystems show seasonal dynamics as well. Nevertheless, individual tropical insects' phenological patterns are still poorly understood, especially in the Afrotropics. To fill this gap, we investigated biodiversity patterns of Lepidoptera communities at three rainforest localities in the foothills of Mount Cameroon, West Africa, one of the wettest places in the world. Our multitaxa approach covered six lepidopteran groups (fruit-feeding butterflies and moths, the families Sphingidae, Saturniidae, and Eupterotidae, and the subfamily Arctiinae of Erebidae) with diverse life strategies. We sampled adults of the focal groups in three distinct seasons. Our sampling included standardized bait trapping (80 traps exposed for 10 days per locality and season) and attraction by light (six full nights per locality and season). Altogether, our dataset comprised 20,576 specimens belonging to 559 (morpho)species of the focal groups. The biodiversity of Lepidoptera generally increased in the high-dry season, and either increased (fruit-feeding moths, Arctiinae, Saturniidae) or decreased (butterflies, Sphingidae) in the transition to the wet season in particular groups. Simultaneously, we revealed a strong species turnover of fruit-feeding Lepidoptera and Arctiinae among the seasons, indicating relatively high specialization of these communities for particular seasons. Such temporal specialization can make the local communities of butterflies and moths especially sensitive to the expected seasonal perturbations caused by the global change. Because of the key role of Lepidoptera across trophic levels, such changes in their communities could strengthen this impact on entire tropical ecosystems.

AB Here we characterize the digestive gland microbiome from wild and cultured (hatchery-reared) Alabama rainbows (Villosa nebulosa) using 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing in order to understand the effects of propagation on microbial community structure in freshwater mussels. Digestive glands from nine Alabama rainbows were analysed, five from the wild and four from a hatchery. Pyrosequencing yielded a total of 32,962 bacterial sequences and 387 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Tenericutes was the dominant phylum in all samples (>87%), followed by Proteobacteria (4.6%), Fusobacteria (4.5%) and Bacteroidetes (1.4%). Digestive gland microbiomes were overwhelmingly dominated by OTUs related to the genus Mycoplasma. These Mycoplasma-like sequences could not be ascribed unequivocally to the genus Mycoplasma (less than 90% sequence identity) and probably represent new lineages within the class Mollicutes. We identified a core microbiome in the digestive gland of V. nebulosa, with all individual mussels sharing 9 OTUs. However, the microbiome from mussels collected from the wild was significantly different from that of hatchery-reared mussels. Our results show that novel microbial communities exist within the digestive gland of freshwater mussels.

AB Trophic interactions play critical roles in structuring biotic communities. Understanding variation in trophic interactions among systems provides important insights into biodiversity maintenance and conservation. However, the relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down trophic processes for broad-scale patterns in biodiversity is poorly understood. Here, we used global datasets on species richness of vascular plants, mammals and breeding birds to evaluate the role of trophic interactions in shaping large-scale diversity patterns. Specifically, we used non-recursive structural equation models to test for top-down and bottom-up forcing of global species diversity patterns among plants and trophic guilds of mammals and birds (carnivores, invertivores and herbivores), while accounting for extrinsic environmental drivers. The results show that trophic linkages emerged as being more important to explaining species richness than extrinsic environmental drivers. In particular, there were strong, positive top-down interactions between mammal herbivores and plants, and moderate to strong bottom-up and/or top-down interactions between herbivores/invertivores and carnivores. Estimated trophic interactions for separate biogeographical regions were consistent with global patterns. Our findings demonstrate that, after accounting for environmental drivers, large-scale species richness patterns in plant and vertebrate taxa consistently support trophic interactions playing a major role in shaping global patterns in biodiversity. Furthermore, these results suggest that top-down forces often play strong complementary roles relative to bottom-up drivers in structuring biodiversity patterns across trophic levels. These findings underscore the importance of integrating trophic forcing mechanisms into studies of biodiversity patterns.

AB Community assembly may not follow predictable successional stages, with a large fraction of the species pool constituted by potential pioneering species and successful founders defined through lottery. In such systems, priority effects may be relevant in the determination of trajectories of developing communities and hence diversity and assemblage structure at later advanced states. In order to assess how different founder species may trigger variable community trajectories and structures, we conducted an experimental study using subtidal sessile assemblages as model. We manipulated the identity of functionally different founders and initial colony size (a proxy of the time lag before the arrival of later species), and followed trajectories. We did not observe any effects of colony size on response variables, suggesting that priority effects take place even when the time lag between the establishment of pioneering species and late colonizers is very short. Late community structure at experimental panels that started either with the colonial ascidian Botrylloides nigrum, or the arborescent bryozoan Bugula neritina, was similar to control panels allowed natural assembling. In spite of high potential for fast space domination, and hence negative priority effects, B.nigrum suffered high mortality and did not persist throughout succession. Bugula neritina provided complex physical microhabitats through conspecific clustering that have enhanced larval settlement of late species arrivals, but no apparent facilitation was observed. Differently, panels founded by the encrusting bryozoan Schizoporella errata led to different and less diverse communities compared to naturally assembled panels, evidencing strong negative priority effects through higher persistence and space preemption. Schizoporella errata founder colonies inhibited further conspecific settlement, which may greatly relax intraspecific competition, allowing resource allocation to colony growth and space domination, thus reducing the chances for the establishment of other species.

AB Habitat loss is a major driver of bee declines worldwide, and is of key relevance in the tropics given high deforestation rates, but we continue to have a poor understanding of the impact of land-cover change on tropical bee communities. Orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) are critical long-distance pollinators and may be highly susceptible to forest fragmentation given their reliance on forest habitat. Previous studies on the impact of forest fragmentation on euglossines have been geographically limited, have largely ignored beta-diversity, and have not compared fragments with continuous forest. To contribute to addressing these gaps, we sampled male euglossine bees in 18 forest fragments (area range: 2.5-33 ha) and at eight locations within a large (3500 ha) continuous forest in the Choc biodiversity hotspot of Ecuador during the dry season in 2014. We assessed how euglossine abundance, richness, and evenness related to fragment area, isolation, and edge:area ratio. We also compared fragments to continuous forest, in terms of alpha- and beta-diversity. In fragments, a single species (Euglossa tridentata) comprised 78% of captures, and we found no significant effect of fragment area, isolation, or edge on abundance, richness, or evenness among fragments. Forest fragments and continuous forest differed in both community composition and evenness, but not in abundance or species richness. Spatial turnover (beta-diversity) showed a non-significant trend toward changing more rapidly in continuous forest relative to fragments. These results underscore the conservation value of continuous forest for orchid bee diversity.

AB We investigated the connectivity of walleye pollock in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and linkages to the Bering Sea (BS) and Aleutian Island (AL) regions. We used a spatially-explicit Individual-based model (IBM) coupled to 6 years of a hydrodynamic model that simulates the early life history of walleye pollock in the GOA (eggs to age-0 juveniles). The processes modeled included growth, movement, mortality, feeding and the bioenergetics component for larvae and juveniles. Simulations were set to release particles on the 1st of the month (February to May) in fourteen historical spawning areas in the GOA up to the 1st of September each year. Model results reproduced the link between the Shelikof Strait spawning area and the Shumagin nursery region for March and April spawners, besides other Potential Nursery Areas (PNAs) found in the GOA. A prominent finding of this study was the appearance of the BS as important PNAs for several GOA spawning grounds, which is supported by a consistent flow into the BS through Unimak Pass. The simulations showed the highest density of simulated surviving pollock in the western Bering Sea (WBS) region with the lowest coefficients of variation of the whole domain. Three spawning sectors were defined, which aggregate multiple spawning areas, in the eastern (EGOA), central (CGOA) and western Gulf of Alaska (WGOA). A connectivity matrix showed strong retention within the CGOA (25.9%) and EGOA (23.8%), but not in the WGOA (7.2%). Within the GOA, the highest connectivity is observed from EGOA to CGOA (57.8%) followed by the connection from CGOA to WGOA (24.3%). Overall, one of the most prominent connections was from WGOA to WBS (62.8%), followed by a connection from CGOA to WBS (29.2%). In addition, scenarios of shifting spawning locations and nursery sectors,of GOA, BS and AL are explored and implications for walleye pollock stock structure hypotheses are discussed.

AB Considering climate change, the discussion intensifies whether and to what extent exotic tree species should be taken into account for forest cultivation, especially when indigenous species are no longer able to fulfill essential forest functions. In this study, for the first time growth potential of Cedrus libani was evaluated under climatic conditions in Central Europe (Bayreuth, Germany). The sampled trees exhibited extraordinary growth with tree ring widths averaging 4.9 mm year(-1) during the past 23 years. A continuously available soil water supply enhanced radial stem growth. Thus, growth declined during the dry year of 2003, but recovered to average values the following year. Our results confirm that C. libani is a light-demanding species which is sensitive to competition and which shows a typical age trend. In a second study, we compared cambial growth in Bayreuth with a natural stand in Elmali (Turkey) in 2009. Cambial growing season in Bayreuth was 45 days longer, and radial growth rates in Bayreuth were four times higher than in Elmali. Interestingly, C. libani maintained a slow but continuous radial growth at Elmali even during the dry summer period, confirming its exceptional drought tolerance. Our results indicate a high adaption of C. libani to current and future climate conditions in Central Europe. It tolerates extreme cold in winter and prolonged droughts during summer. Thus, its promising potential for establishing stable and productive forest stands in Central Europe under a changing climate should be confirmed in further studies.

ID NULL MODEL ANALYSIS; NESTEDNESS; ARCHITECTURE
AB 1. Despite substantial recent progress, ecologists continue to search for methods of measuring the structure of ecological networks. Several studies have focused on nestedness, a pattern reflecting the tendency of network nodes to share interaction partners. Here, we introduce a new statistical procedure to measure both this kind of structure and the opposite one (i.e. species' tendency against sharing interacting partners) that we call node segregation'. In addition, our procedure provides also a straightforward measure of modularity, that is, the tendency of a network to be compartmented into separated clusters of interacting nodes.
   2. This new analytical measure of network structure assesses the average deviation between the observed number of neighbours shared by any pair of nodes (species), and the expected number, that is computed using a probabilistic approach based on simple combinatorics. The measure can be applied to both bipartite networks (such as plant-pollinators) and unimode networks (such as food webs). We tested our approach on several sets of hypothetical and real-world networks.
   3. We demonstrate that our approach makes it possible to identify different kinds of non-random network configurations (nestedness, node segregation and modularity). In addition, we show that nestedness in ecological networks is less common than previously thought, and that most ecological networks (including the majority of mutualistic ones) tend towards patterns of segregated associations.
   4.Our analyses show that the new measure of node overlap and segregation can efficiently identify different structural patterns. The results of our analyses conducted on real networks highlight the need to carefully reconsider the assumption that ecological networks are stable due to their inherent nestedness.

AB The bird pollination syndrome is characterized by red, unscented flowers with dilute nectar in long nectar tubes. However, the extent to which plants with such traits actually depend on birds for seed production is seldom determined experimentally, and traits such as colour and scent production are often assessed only subjectively. We documented bird pollination and quantified floral traits in the critically endangered Satyrium rhodanthum (Orchidaceae) from mistbelt grasslands in the summer-rainfall region of South Africa. Direct observations and motion trigger camera footage revealed amethyst sunbirds as the only pollinators, despite the presence of other potential pollinators. Experimental exclusion of sunbirds significantly reduced pollination and fruit set to near zero. Pollination success in naturally pollinated plants was close to 100% in one year, and fruit set varied from 23 to 64% in other years. Pollen transfer efficiency was 5.8%, which is lower than in related insect-pollinated species, probably due to a tendency of birds to wipe pollinaria from their beak. Flowers of S.rhodanthum only reflect light in the red range of the spectrum, and they produce only a few aliphatic and monoterpene scent compounds at comparatively low emission rates. Nectar volume and sugar concentration varied between 2.7 and 3.7L and 23.7 and 25.9%, respectively. We conclude that S.rhodanthum is highly specialized for pollination by sunbirds. Colour, scent and nectar characteristics differ from insect-pollinated Satyrium species and are consistent with those expected for bird-pollinated flowers, and may contribute to lack of visitation by other potential long-tongued pollinators. Habitat loss probably underlies the critically endangered conservation status of S.rhodanthum, but the specialization for pollination by a single bird species means that reproduction in this orchid is vulnerable to losses in surrounding communities of plants that subsidize the energetic requirements of sunbirds.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 177, 141-150.

AB Distribution patterns reflect the interactions of organisms with their environment. We discuss the distribution patterns of Nile Crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) in a naturally patchy floodplain environment with the use of aerial survey data collected over the last 40 yr. Although only 10,000 ha in size, Ndumo Game Reserve (NGR) supports one of the largest wild crocodile populations in South Africa, largely because of landscape complementation with neighboring Mozambique. Distributions within the NGR were influenced by landscape physiognomy and composition as well as connectivity and corridor quality. To quantify the effects of environmental conditions on crocodile distribution, we conducted 40 diurnal counts at Lake Nyamithi in the NGR between 2009 and 2012. Average monthly maximum temperature had an effect on the number of crocodiles in Lake Nyamithi; however, environmental variables influenced different size classes of Nile Crocodiles to a varying extent. Anthropogenic disturbances influenced the functionality of the floodplain landscape negatively, with impacts on habitat use and connectivity. It is considered essential that a cross-border conservation program be initiated in order to conserve the current population of Nile Crocodiles in the greater NGR area.

AB Insect pollinators, both managed and wild, have become a focus of global scientific, political and media attention because of their apparent decline and the perceived impact of this decline on crop production. Crop pollination by insects is an essential ecosystem service that increases the yield and quality of approximately 35% of crops worldwide. Pollinator declines are a consequence of multiple environmental pressures, e.g. habitat transformation and fragmentation, loss of floral resources, pesticides, pests and diseases, and climate change. Similar environmental pressures are faced in South Africa where there is a high demand for pollination services. In this paper, we synthesise data on the importance of different pollinators as a basis for services to South African crops and on the status of managed honeybees. We also focus on insect pollination services for the Western Cape deciduous fruit industry, which is worth ZAR9800 million per year and is heavily reliant on pollination services from managed honeybees. We discuss landscape and regional level floral resources needed to maintain sufficient numbers of managed honeybee colonies. In summary, the available literature shows a lack of data on diversity and abundance of crop pollinators, and a lack of long-term data to assess declines. We highlight key areas that require research in South Africa and emphasise the critical role of floral resource availability at the landscape and regional scale to sustain pollinators. We conclude that understanding the dynamics of how floral resources are used will help inform how landscapes could be better managed in order to provide long-term sustainable pollination services.

AB This study identifies 'centers of endemism' for typhlocybine leafhoppers in China, revealing diversity patterns and congruence of patterns between total species richness and endemism. Distribution patterns of 774 Typhlocybinae (607 described and 167 undescribed species) were mapped on a 1.50 degrees x 1.50 degrees latitude/longitude grid. Total species richness, endemic species richness and weighted endemism richness were calculated for each grid cell. Grid cells within the top 5% highest values of weighted endemism richness were considered as 'centers of endemism' Diversity patterns by latitude and altitude were obtained through calculating the gradient richness. A congruence of diversity patterns between total species richness and endemism was confirmed using correlation analysis. To investigate the bioclimatic factors (19 variables) contributing to the congruence between total species richness and endemism, we compared the factor's difference between non-endemic and endemic species using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Eleven centers of endemism, roughly delineated by mountain ranges, were identified in central and southern China, including the south Yunnan, Hengduan Mountains, Qinling Mountains, Hainan Island, Taiwan Island and six mountain areas located in western Sichuan, northwest Fujian, southeast Guizhou, southeast Hunan, central and western Guangdong, and north Zhejiang. Total species richness and endemic species richness decreased with increased latitude and had a consistent unimodal response to altitude. The proportions of endemism decreased with increased latitude and increased with rising altitude. Diversity patterns between total species richness and endemism were highly consistent, and 'Precipitation of Coldest Period' and 'Temperature of Coldest Period' may contribute to the congruence of pattern. Migration ability may play a role in the relationship of endemism and species richness; climate, environment factors and important geologic isolation events can also play crucial effects on relationships under special conditions.

AB Spatio-temporal density-dependent processes are crucial regulatory factors for natural populations. However, there is a lack of studies addressing spatial density-dependence in fish growth. A previous investigation has suggested spatio-temporal density-dependence in body condition of Baltic sprat. Here, we used different techniques, such as centre of gravity, distance, and homogeneity indices, to better characterize the spatial and temporal variations in sprat density and body condition in the Baltic Proper. Our results evidenced a negative spatio-temporal co-variation between the centres of gravity of density and maximum condition. In the 1980s-early 1990s both centres were located in the middle of the Baltic Proper. From the mid 1990s the centres progressively separated in space, as the sprat population moved towards the north-eastern Baltic Proper, and the centre of maximum condition towards the south-western areas. Moreover, at low abundances, sprat density and condition were homogeneously distributed in space, whereas at high abundances both density and condition showed pronounced geographical gradients. The ecological processes potentially explaining the observed patterns were discussed in the light of the Ideal Free Distribution theory. We provide evidence that the shift in the spatial distribution of cod, the main predator of sprat, has been the main factor triggering the overall spatial changes in sprat density, and thus condition, during the past thirty years. The spatial indices shown here, synthesizing the spatio-temporal patterns of fish distribution, can support the implementation of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive.

AB The introduced feral cat (Felis catus) is a widespread generalist with flexible social behaviour and an apex predator without major interspecific competitors in insular ecosystems that evolved in the absence of predators. Mechanistic definitions consider an animal's home range to be the spatial expression of a cognitive map that is kept up-to-date with the status of critical resources that contribute to animal fitness. We assumed there are two major determinants structuring the home range of cats as apex predators in insular ecosystems: the distribution of critical food resources and conspecific distribution. We hypothesized that cats structure their home ranges by optimizing the use of staple critical food resources and that as a consequence of the presence of rich resources cats tend to socialise, aggregate and share space. We carried out spatial analyses using location data for feral cats tracked using lightweight GPS collars in conjunction with the suitability value of rabbit patches and their associated ownership costs for cats within a New Zealand braided-river environment. Cat home ranges and spatial distribution, especially for females, were related to the inclusion of rabbit patches within home ranges with higher mean value than the average of neighbourhood patches in the landscape. Cats showed solitary behaviour but tolerance to conspecific presence by sharing high-use areas and high-value rabbit patches, mostly at different times, resulting in occasional encounters among males and females. Home range size and patterns of spatial overlap were dependant on sex and season. Solitary spacing patterns as consequence of innate preferences together with resource constraints may regulate feral cat population densities.

AB The use of species distribution models is gaining popularity in biological sciences. We used Maxent, a maximum entropy-based program, to predict distribution of Sapium sebiferum in western Himalaya. Sapium sebiferum is amongst the highly invasive species of the world and its spread in western Himalaya is a serious conservation issue. In order to model its distribution, we used field-collected coordinates of 177 presence locations of the species. Additionally, environmental data downloaded from the worldclim data portal were also used. Maxent was then run using default settings with 70% of the locations being used for training and the remaining 30% for testing the model. Area under curve for the receiving operator analyses measured at all possible threshold values training (0.993) and test (0.993) was close to 1, thereby showing the accuracy of the model.

AB The accumulation of body mass, as growth, is fundamental to all organisms. Being able to understand which model(s) best describe this growth trajectory, both empirically and ultimately mechanistically, is an important challenge. A variety of equations have been proposed to describe growth during ontogeny. Recently, the West Brown Enquist (WBE) equation, formulated as part of the metabolic theory of ecology, has been proposed as a universal model of growth. This equation has the advantage of having a biological basis, but its ability to describe invertebrate growth patterns has not been well tested against other, more simple models. In this study, we collected data for 58 species of marine invertebrate from 15 different taxa. The data were fitted to three growth models (power, exponential and WBE), and their abilities were examined using an information theoretic approach. Using Akaike information criteria, we found changes in mass through time to fit an exponential equation form best (in approx. 73% of cases). The WBE model predominantly overestimates body size in early ontogeny and underestimates it in later ontogeny; it was the best fit in approximately 14% of cases. The exponential model described growth well in nine taxa, whereas the WBE described growth well in one of the 15 taxa, the Amphipoda. Although the WBE has the advantage of being developed with an underlying proximate mechanism, it provides a poor fit to the majority of marine invertebrates examined here, including species with determinate and indeterminate growth types. In the original formulation of the WBE model, it was tested almost exclusively against vertebrates, to which it fitted well; the model does not however appear to be universal given its poor ability to describe growth in benthic or pelagic marine invertebrates.

AB Empirical models of habitat selection are increasingly used to guide and inform habitat-based management plans for wildlife species. However, habitat selection does not necessarily equate to habitat quality particularly if selection is maladaptive, so incorporating measures of fitness into estimations of occurrence is necessary to increase model robustness. Here, we incorporated spatially explicit mortality events with the habitat selection of elephants to predict secure and risky habitats in northern Botswana. Following a two-step approach, we first predict the relative probability of use and the relative probability of mortality based on landscape features using logistic regression models. Combining these two indices, we then identified low mortality and high use (primary habitat) and areas of high mortality and high use (primary risk). We found that mortalities of adult elephants were closely associated with anthropogenic features, with 80% of mortalities occurring within 25 km of people. Conversely, elephant habitat selection was highest at distances of 30-50 km from people. Primary habitat for elephants occurred in the central portion of the study area and within the Okavango Delta; whereas risky areas occurred along the periphery near humans. The protected designation of an area had less influence on the proportion of prime habitat therein than did the locations of the area in relation to human development. Elephant management in southern Africa is moving towards a more self-sustaining, habitat-based approach, and information on selection and mortality could serve as a baseline to help identify demographic sources and sinks to stabilize elephant demography.

AB Both large herbivores and termites are key functional groups in savanna ecosystems, and in many savanna areas, large termite mounds (termitaria) are associated with distinct woody clusters. Studies on the effect of large mammals on tree regeneration are few, and the results are conflicting. Large herbivores have been found to be important seedling predators in some areas, but facilitate tree regeneration by outcompeting small mammals and reducing grass cover in other areas. Through the use of the experimental fencing of termite mounds and adjacent savanna areas in this study, we investigated how termites and large herbivores influence tree regeneration. Termite mounds had a higher number of seedlings, more species richness, more alpha diversity (OD) and lower evenness (E) than savanna plots. Large herbivores did not significantly affect overall seedling density, species richness, OD or E. Beta diversity was higher in savanna areas than on termitaria, and beta diversity decreased in savanna areas when herbivores were excluded. Herbivore exclusion increased the density of the 12 (40 %) most common seedling species, representing 79 % of all seedlings, and fenced plots had relatively taller seedlings than open plots. Thus, termites were the main determinants of tree regeneration in our study area, but large mammals regulated the most common species. Although our study confirms previous work suggesting that large herbivores affect tree regeneration, we found that termites were an even more important determinant. Termite impacts on tree regeneration deserve increased attention by savanna ecologists.

AB Coexistence of trees and grasses in nutrient-poor arid savannas may result in competition for soil N. While grasses may be more effective than woody plants in acquiring N from the soil, some leguminous woody species rely on N-2 fixation. We assessed the role of N-2 fixation in the N-budget of Acacia mellifera seedlings by varying N supply and grass competition.
   The contribution of N-2 fixation to the N-budget of Acacia mellifera seedlings with varying N supply and grass competition was determined by measuring growth, nutrient concentrations, and N-15 values.
   Tree seedlings were 4-fold taller and had 20-fold more biomass in the absence of grass. Tree foliar delta N-15 was lower with (-0.25 +/- 0.2aEuro degrees, n = 9) than without grasses (5.2 +/- 0.1aEuro degrees, n = 64). The contribution of N-2-fixation to the N budget decreased with increasing N supply. Greater reliance on N-2-fixation by trees in the presence of grasses did not result in greater biomass accumulation or tissue [N] relative to tree seedlings grown without grass competition. Tree seedlings competing with grass had significantly more negative delta C-13 (-29.5 +/- 0.6aEuro degrees) than seedlings without grass competition (-28.8aEuro degrees aEuro parts per thousand +/- 0.5aEuro degrees).
   Induction of N-2-fixation by grass may have resulted from competition for nutrients. N-2-fixation enables tree seedlings to compensate for limited soil N and survive grass competition at a critical and vulnerable developmental stage of germination and establishment.

AB Virgilia divaricata is a fast-growing nitrogen-fixing tree species often found on the margins of forest in the southern Cape of South Africa and is particularly abundant after fire. However, V. divaricata may invade fynbos even in the absence of fire and it has been described as a forest precursor. We investigated whether V. divaricata enriches soil fertility after its invasion into fynbos areas adjacent to forests. We measured soil organic carbon and soil nutrients at four sites. At each site, three vegetation types (forest, V. divaricata and fynbos) were examined on the same soil type and at the same elevation. Our results showed that, on average, soils taken from V. divaricata stands had higher nitrogen and phosphorus values than the adjacent fynbos soils, with either lower or similar values to the adjacent forest soils. Higher soil fertility under V. divaricata, together with their shading effect, may create conditions favourable for shade-loving forest species dependent on an efficient nutrient cycle in the topsoil layers, and less favourable for shade-hating fynbos species, which are generally adapted to low soil fertility. We suggest that the restoration of the nutrient cycle found in association with forest may be accelerated under V. divaricata compared with other forest precursor species, which has important consequences for the use of V. divaricata in ecosystem restoration.
   Conservation implications: Alien plantations in the Outeniqua Mountains are being phased out and the areas are being incorporated into the Garden Route National Park. Fynbos areas are increasingly being invaded by forest and thicket species owing to fire suppression in lower-lying areas. An improved understanding of the fynbos-forest boundary dynamics will aid in efficient management and restoration of these ecosystems.

AB Experiments have shown that interspecific interactions within consumer guilds can alter patterns of distribution, abundance and size of species. Plastic behavioural responses can be modulated by agonistic interactions. In many cases, consumers compete for space and shelters, and these interactions change the manner in which they exploit food. This study investigates the consequences of competition in the spatial and temporal organization of behaviour of intertidal grazers, which share algal resources and the use of rock crevices while resting, but exhibit different body sizes, spatial behaviour and foraging modes. We evaluate interaction strength between small gregarious Siphonaria lessoni and the larger territorial keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa and between S. lessoni and the medium-size gregarious chiton Chiton granosus. Using field manipulations and artificial arenas in the laboratory, we tested whether the use of crevices, micro-spatial distribution and activity are modified by the density of conspecifics and the presence of heterospecifics. Our results show that small-scale spatial segregation observed in the field between S. lessoni and C. granosus result from species-specific differences in habitat use. In turn, we found evidence that spatial segregation between F. crassa and S. lessoni results from highly asymmetric interference competition in the use of shelters. The presence of F. crassa reduced the use of crevices and growth rates of S. lessoni. Effects on growth rates are assumed to result from exposure to harsh environmental conditions rather than food limitation. Thus, neither gregarious behaviour nor differences in activity were sufficient to prevent competition with the larger grazer. Our study illustrates the importance of competition for shelters, which results in behavioural changes of the smaller-sized species, and how these plastic responses can translate into differences in growth rates. Use of shelters can thus be modulated by environmental conditions in a species-specific as well as an interactive manner within consumers' guilds.

AB Missoup, A.D., Nicolas, V., Wendelen, W., Keming, E., Bilong Bilong, C.F., Couloux, A., Atanga, E., Hutterer, R. & Denys, C. (2012). Systematics and diversification of Praomys species (Rodentia: Muridae) endemic to the Cameroon Volcanic Line (West Central Africa). Zoologica Scripta, 41, 327345. Our integrative approach combines two mitochondrial genes (16S and cyt b gene), two nuclear genes (exon 10 GHR and exon 1 IRBP) and craniometrical data to test the status and to infer phylogenetic relationships of the three Praomys Cameroon Volcanic Line endemics (P. hartwigi, P. morio and P. obscurus). The taxonomic rank of the principal genus group is assessed and the mode of diversification of species of the P. tullbergi complex in Afrotropical forests is discussed based on estimates of times to the most recent common ancestors and on tree topologies. This study documents for the first time the molecular and morphometrical distinctiveness of P. hartwigi and P. morio within the P. tullbergi species complex. Further studies including specimens of P. hartwigi from all its distribution range are needed to conclude on the status of P. obscurus. The monophyly of the genus Praomys is refuted. Times to the most recent common ancestors of major clades within the P. tullbergi species complex are estimated for the last 2.5 Mya and during the last 1 or 2 Mya for different species or forms. The lowland forest refuge hypothesis might well explain the diversification of P. misonnei, P. rostratus and P. tullbergi in the guineo-congolese forest block. The isolation of montane forests could have facilitated the divergence between the two montane forest forms P. hartwigi and P. obscurus and between populations of P. morio from the continent and those from the island of Bioko. Praomys populations (species) that inhabit the Cameroon Volcanic Line Praomys probably originated as lowland forms subsequently specialized to highland conditions.

AB The ability of resting eggs to survive periods of drying, and hydroperiods that are too short to allow reproduction, affects the ability of a species to colonise and persist in temporary waters. We previously described the formation of an egg bank of Heterocypris incongruens, a widespread and common freshwater ostracod. The egg bank was made up of genetically homogeneous resting eggs produced by a laboratory clonal lineage that we used to colonise a pond with an unpredictable hydroperiod. Here we report on laboratory experiments on the study of hatching phenology of resting eggs from the newly established egg bank. We measured the hatching percentage and egg bank depletion during four successive inundations (followed by dry periods) without reproduction. In a first factorial experiment, egg hatching was assessed under the following set of conditions: egg age (3 or 15 months), inundation photoperiod (12:12 L:D or 16:8 L:D), water quality (mineral water or adult-conditioned water). In a second experiment egg hatching in four successive inundations was assessed varying the duration of the first inundation (6 or 30 days). Our estimation of resting egg density in the pond was 65x 10(4) eggs m(-2). A total of 7133 hatchings were recorded, about 80 % were observed in the first inundation while the rest occurred in three subsequent inundations. Egg age and photoperiod had no effect on hatching percentage while metabolites produced by adult females in conditioned water had a negative effect. Short inundation did not affect hatching percentages or resting egg survivorship. Hatching in successive inundations did not depend on genetic differences among eggs and the process may be considered a stochastic switching of a single genotype among different phenotypes. Such a hatching phenology ensures a risk spreading response that is advantageous in highly stochastic environments. It prevents population extinction following very short hydroperiods and for at least four subsequent generations of failed reproduction.

AB In Central Germany and throughout Europe, arable plants count among some of the most endangered plant species. Over the last few decades, the number and size of populations have been in sharp decline due to modern land use techniques, including the application of fertilizers, herbicide use and seed cleaning procedures. As arable plant species are underrepresented in population genetic studies, it is unknown whether agricultural intensification has affected the extant populations, and whether genetic structure varies among species with differing vulnerability in respect of their Red List status. We sampled 53 populations from 6 arable plant species throughout Central Germany. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analyses (RAPD) were applied to calculate measures of genetic diversity at the population level and genetic differentiation. Genetic diversity was found to be lowest in Bupleurum rotundifolium and Anagallis foemina, and highest in Consolida regalis and Nigella arvensis. The highest levels of genetic differentiation were observed among populations of An. foemina and B. rotundifolium but within populations in all other species. I broken vertical bar(ST) values differed strongly ranging between 0.116 for C. regalis and 0.679 for An. foemina. Patterns of genetic structure were related to the Red List status for all the species studied except An. foemina, for which it should consequently be raised. Our data confirm that even relatively recent threats are accompanied by detrimental genetic structure. As losses of populations and increased fragmentation have occurred in all common and uncommon species, the situation for arable plants could change for the worse in the following decades, highlighting the need for consistent monitoring.

AB Aim To evaluate whether natural larval transport and behaviour alone can explain the pattern of invasion and establishment of the non-indigenous Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum (Adams & Reeve, 1850), and its spread beyond the point of introduction in the UK. Location The study is focused on Poole Harbour, south England, the point of introduction of the Manila clam in the UK. Methods We use fine-resolution hydrodynamic models coupled with a water salinity model and an individual behaviour model of Manila clam larvae. The model was informed by experimental studies on the vertical response of larvae to salinity and field studies of the species in its natural and new environments. Results Variations in the behavioural response of larvae to salinity in the model considerably affected the retention of clam larvae within the harbour. High levels of predicted larval retention occurred in two of five zones in the harbour when the salinity target was set at 17 practical salinity units. Persistently high densities of adult clams and recruits are accurately predicted in these regions. Main conclusions Even within a relatively small region such as Poole Harbour, there is both localized retention of larvae or 'closed' areas and areas that are considerably more 'open' and potentially connected. The behavioural response of larvae to salinity significantly affected the degree of retention and 'openness' of the harbour to this species. Although, through natural transport, larvae could theoretically reach the next available habitat within the duration of their pelagic stage our study indicates that areas of sufficiently reduced salinity may be necessary for sufficient retention, recruitment and establishment of new adult populations in estuaries. High resolution hydrodynamic models, coupled with larval behaviour, can accurately simulate and predict biological invasion along complex coastlines and contribute to risk assessment of the introduction of nonindigenous species for aquaculture and spatial management of marine protection.

AB In this study, we analyzed the effect of topography, particularly slope, on the expansion rates and population dynamics of Echinospartum horridum at small spatial and temporal scales in the grassland communities of Ordesa-Monte Perdido National Park (OMPNP) (NE Spain). E. horridum is a thorny cushion dwarf, endemic of Spain and south of France, forming dense mono-specific large patches difficult to be penetrated by other plants and large herbivores once it is established. Between 2005 and 2007, we collected demographic parameters from 300 marked plant; of E. horridum that were distributed in the center and the edge of four patches. At the patch edge, two of the four patches had a high slope (>= 10 degrees) and two had a low slope (< 10 degrees), whereas at the patch centers the slope was high (18 degrees-30 degrees). To calculate invasion speed, we use aerial photographs from 1981 and 2003. Plants in the center of patches had lower growth rates, fewer flowers, and higher crown death rates than did le plants at edge of patches. Slope influenced significantly invasion rates: the speed of expansion was lowest on gentle slopes, probably because of competition with grass. The speed of diffusion from 1981 to 2003 varied from 2.09 m yr(-1) on the steep slopes to 1.93 m yr(-1) on the shallow slope. Plant dynamics at patch edges suggest that colonization by E. horridum will continue in the grasslands of the OMPNP.

AB The relationship between meroplankton distribution and spatio-temporal variability of coastal mesoscale hydrological structure was investigated in the northern Bay of Biscay, North-East Atlantic. For the three coastal polychaetes studied, i.e. Pectinaria koreni, Owenia fusiformis and Sabellaria alveolata, the highest larval abundances were sampled in low-salinity, low-density and high-temperature river plume waters. For two species (P. koreni and O. fusiformis), maximal abundances were observed in the surface and thermocline layers due to ontogenic migrations. Variance partitioning based on multiple regression and redundancy analyses was used to assess the relative roles played by the hydrological environment alone, the geographical space alone and their interactions, i.e. the spatial structure of the hydrological environment. These analyses demonstrate the key role played by the hydrological spatial structure in the distribution of larval abundances. The hydrological environment alone was insignificant, whereas geographical space alone explained a significant part of the variability in meroplankton distribution, probably in conjunction with ecological processes. For species whose benthic populations are spatially structured, the distribution and the size of adult populations and the timing of spawning events can significantly affect larval distribution and dispersal.

AB Pollination systems in orchids tend to be specialized as a consequence of restrictive floral morphology and specific advertising signals Here we document a notable exception Disa fragrans subsp fragrans, a taxon from the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa, which is pollinated by insects belonging to at least four orders (flies, beetles, bees, and moths) Pollinaria of D fragrans are attached to the feet of these visitors and pollination thus occurs in a rather haphazard fashion Nevertheless, its pollination success and pollen transfer efficiency are comparable to those of its close relative, Disa sankeyt, which is pollinated by a single genus of wasps D fragrans has an exceptionally strong floral scent volatile emission is 19-86 mu g per inflorescence per hour, which is up to 100 fold greater than in D sankeyt The scent bouquet is comprised of at least 46 compounds, mostly benzenoids and phenylpropanoids, which are known to be general attractants to a wide range of insects In contrast to D sankeyt, the flowers of D fragrans have a high level of spectral purity (chroma) as is typical of many generalist insect-pollinated plants At a site where D fragrans co-occurs with D sankeyt we found a plant with intermediate characteristics that may be a hybrid between the two taxa The novel case of generalist pollination in D fragrans documented here serves as an example of how floral advertising traits might evolve during an evolutionary shift from specialized to generalized pollination (C) 2010 SAAB Published by Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB In October 1991, invertebrate larvae abundances were analysed to study the influence of the disturbance of the Canary Current flow by the Canary Islands archipelago on the variability of larval distribution. Two transects and two time-series stations located to the north (non-perturbed zone) and the south (perturbed zone) of the Canary Islands were sampled. Oceanographical data showed a highly stratified water column and zonally uniform salinity and temperature seaward of the African upwelling in the non-perturbed zone, while the perturbed zone presented strong turbulence in the form of mesoscale eddies. Invertebrate larval abundances were lower for most taxa studied in the non-perturbed zone and northern time-series station. Significant differences (P < 0.001) of invertebrate larval abundance between the two zones sampled were found. Decapod larvae were the most abundant larval group in both zones. Stations located in eddy structures presented the highest values of larval densities. Specifically, the larvae collected at Station 18, located in the core of an anticyclonic eddy, represented 60 +/- 18% of total larvae collected in the south transect. Finally, our results suggest that eddies, mainly anticyclonic eddies, act as a strong larval retention zone south of the islands, and that there is a local northward transport from the Canary Islands.

SO ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS

DE Monitoring; State indicators; Response indicators; Conservation;

ID INDICATORS; MANAGEMENT; WOODLAND; SPRUCE; POLICY
AB Forest biodiversity cannot be measured and monitored directly. Indicators are needed to tackle this task and must be based on scientifically valid relationships concerning different levels of biodiversity. In addition, indicators must provide tangible goals for forest policy and other relevant stakeholders. Here, we propose a single aggregated measure - the Austrian Forest Biodiversity Index (AFBI) - which is composed of different indicator values being weighed depending on their significance for the maintenance of forest species richness and genetic diversity. The AFBI consists of nine state and four response indicators. Selection of state indicators was based on the general hypothesis that forests which mimic natural conditions or are characterised by structural elements of old-growth forests maintain a high number of forest dependent species and a high genetic richness therein. Among the response indicators we considered the establishment of natural forest reserves, genetic reserve forests, seed stands and seed orchards as most relevant. Proposed operational tools, especially for state indicators, are mainly based oil the Austrian forest inventory. The sum of all weighted indicator measures is rescaled as a total score that may vary from 0 to 100, so that the AFBI is simple to communicate and straightforward to apply. The AFBI gives certain weight to genetic parameters which are often neglected in previous approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATIONAL-PARK; FIRE; TASMANIA; GRASSLAND; RECOVERY;
   IMPACTS
AB Fire appears to be a rare event in alpine vegetation, suggesting that its effects might be more persistent than in most lowland vegetation types. However, it has been suggested that the Australian alpine biota is resilient to infrequent large fires. This paper describes decades-scale vegetation and soil change after fire in paired plots over fire boundaries in Tasmanian alpine coniferous heath. The effect of fire on soils persisted for decades. Recovery of vegetation was extremely slow by global standards, with delayed reinvasion of previously dominant species. There was low cover of the most fire-sensitive species 43-69 years after fire and much bare ground still evident, with the rate of revegetation declining through time. Gymnosperm shrubs increased at the expense of angiosperms in the unburned plots in the same period and cryptogams declined in both burned and unburned plots. These results suggest that the Tasmanian alpine flora cannot be characterised as resilient to infrequent large fire, although most species survive its incidence. The many centuries that it appears are necessary for coniferous heath to recover to its pre-burn state suggest that fires caused by increased ignitions from lightning and arsonists are the major issue for conservation of the vegetation type.

AB Aims
   To determine how changes in land use, climate and shrub cover affect the invasion dynamics of native (Pinus sylvestris L.) and introduced (Pinus nigra Arn. subsp. nigra) pines in grasslands. To analyse how these factors interact and affect seedling recruitment, a bottleneck in the lifecycle of many trees. Such information is required to manage the dynamics of these species.
   Location
   Grands Causses, calcareous plateaus (Southern France).
   Methods
   We used both published and unpublished demographic and dispersal data to assess population growth and invasion speed of invading pines. A demographic and spatially explicit model, which included density dependence and stochasticity in dispersal, demography and environment, was run for different scenarios of sheep grazing pressure (nil, extensive or intensive), shrub cover (0, 10 or 20%) and drought frequency (past-to-present or future). For each scenario, population growth rate, invasion speed and elasticity of invasion speed to each demographic and dispersal parameter were computed.
   Results
   Grazing was the main factor for limiting invasion speed. Shrub cover reduced tree spread under nil or extensive grazing pressure, but increased it under intensive grazing pressure. Although dry years led to nil seedling establishment rates, an increase in their frequency had surprisingly few effects on pine invasion speed. This last result remained unchanged when very dry years, inducing seedling, but also sapling mortality were introduced. In most environmental conditions, population growth rate and invasion speed were higher for the introduced than for the native pine. Elasticity analysis highlighted the importance of demographic parameters on invasion speed, notably adult and sapling survival.
   Main conclusion
   Tree invasion speed may rely at least as much on human activities, like sheep grazing, tree cutting and non-native trees introduction, as on changes in climate factors. Therefore, human activities need to be explicitly taken into account in the prediction and management of tree dynamics.

AB Cape Gannets Morus capensis are declining in numbers in all breeding colonies at the southern African west coast, potentially caused by deteriorating food availability. The behavioural responses of individuals to changing conditions can provide insights into the mechanisms that drive population dynamics. We studied the relationship between parental provisioning behaviour and the breeding success of Cape Gannets breeding at Ichaboe Island (Namibia) in two years with different nesting success, to assess the potential role of variation in food availability in explaining variation in chick survival. In 2006/07 parents delayed the onset of breeding and visited nests at a lower frequency than in 2005/06, indicating that food availability was limited. Within the years individual differences in provisioning rate but not in parental condition were associated with chick growth and survival. These associations remained present when controlling for seasonal changes. Predation, not starvation, was the main cause of mortality. Under poor conditions, as indicated by long foraging trips, Cape Gannet parents left small chicks unattended, resulting in many being killed by Kelp Gulls Larus dominicanus. Long foraging trips were associated with reduced average breeding success, but impacted some parents more than others. Knowledge of the origin of this inter-individual variability is needed to predict how changes in food availability affect seabird population dynamics, which is one of the steps towards conservation of these birds.

AB In the vicinity of Palmer Station, Antarctica, the seabird tick, Ixodes uriae, forms large aggregations under rocks at the periphery of Adelie penguin rookeries. When the adult penguins return to the rookeries at the beginning of the nesting season the ticks leave their off-host aggregation site, attach to the penguins for a period of feeding, and then subsequently return to the aggregation site. In this study, we searched for chemical cues that may be used by the ticks to locate their aggregation sites as well as cues involved in finding penguins. Tick excreta and soil extracts from beneath tick aggregations contained a pheromone that elicited assembly behavior in unfed larvae, non-fed nymphs and non-fed adults. Guanine, the major excretory product of ticks, elicited assembly behavior, thus, guanine is likely an active component involved in assembly. Non-fed stages also responded positively to penguin guano and uric acid, the primary excretory product of penguins, suggesting that uric acid and other components of penguin guano function as a kairomone used by the non-fed ticks to locate their host. After feeding, the immature ticks' response to both the assembly and kairomones is switched off for several days, and the ticks regain responsiveness only after they have molted. Fed adult females lay eggs and die without ever regaining responsiveness. Thus, I. uriae relies on two closely related chemicals to regulate two critical aspects of its life: assembly and host-finding. Guanine and other components of tick excreta function as an assembly pheromone in promoting the formation of off-host aggregations, while uric acid and other components of penguin guano function as a kairomone used by the tick to locate its host.

AB Structural patterns of tall stands ("tussock") and short stands ("lawn") are observed in grazed vegetation throughout the world. Such structural vegetation diversity influences plant and animal diversity. A possible mechanism for the creation and preservation of such patterns is a positive feedback between grazing and plant palatability. Although some theoretical studies have addressed this point in a non-spatial setting, the spatial consequences of this feedback mechanism on the stability and spatial characteristics of vegetation structure patterns have not been studied. We addressed this issue by analyzing a spatially explicit individual-based plant-grazer simulation model, based on published empirical relations and the assumption of optimal foraging. In the model, the selection by the grazer of short stands (that have a higher energy content and are more palatable) is affected by traveling costs and the spatial organization of swards. Nevertheless, the most selected biomass in this type of short stands was the optimal biomass predicted by cropping and digestion constraints. As a result of the optimal foraging strategy, the grazers displayed Levy-flight traveling behavior during the simulations with characteristic exponent mu approximate to 2. Patterns of short and tall stands created by grazing were preserved for at least a decade. Even in seasonal habitat, the spatial organization of the patterns remained relatively constant, despite fluctuations in the area of short stands. Heterogeneity of initial vegetation increased heterogeneity of the grazing-induced pattern, but did not affect its stability. The area of short stands that was preserved by grazing scaled with the herbivore mass to the power 0.4 and with the carrying capacity of the vegetation to the power -0.75. Patterns of tall and short stands can be created and perpetuated by optimally grazing ruminants, irrespective of possible underlying soil patterns. The simulations generate predictions for the stability and spatial characteristics of such structural vegetation patterns. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB 1. Larvae of a Myrmecaelurus sp. are unique among antlions because they have two prey-capture methods; they either ambush prey at the surface, or dig pit traps that prey fall in to. It was hypothesised that larvae will use the capture method that maximises their net rate of energy gain, which will be influenced by food availability (encounter rate) and by past energy inputs (body condition).
   2. Costs were estimated by measuring resting and activity metabolic rates and determining the duration of pit maintenance at various encounter rates with ants that served as prey. Benefits were estimated from the energy gained per ant captured at different encounter rates.
   3. Net energy gained was higher with a pit than without one, and was influenced more by the differences in prey capture rate between the two capture methods, and less by the differences in energy costs associated with each method. The proportion of larvae that constructed pits was higher when they were in intermediate body condition than when in good or in poor body condition.
   4. Thus, the use of one capture method or the other depends on a combination of the influences of past net energy gain and the antlion's most recent change in encounter rate with prey. Ambushing without a pit may serve as a default when physiological constraints limit the larvae's ability to invest in pit construction and maintenance, or when larvae are sated, and saving the energy of pit construction and maintenance is worthwhile.

AB Photoprotective compounds (PPCs), such as carotenoids and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), confer photoprotection to aquatic organisms against harmful ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. The natural variability of these compounds in zooplankton has been related to temperature, radiation and diet, but the ultimate mechanisms regulating the observed patterns in the field are still unclear. In this study, we analysed the variability of carotenoids and MAAs in a population of the calanoid copepod Boeckella antiqua in a shallow pond located in Northern Patagonia (Argentina). During our field survey, carotenoids and MAAs in B. antiqua varied without a clear seasonal pattern. Nevertheless, both groups of PPCs reached their maxima during spring and minima during summer. Inverse relationships were found between carotenoid concentrations versus temperature and irradiance. For MAAs, the same relationships were not significant. Tolerance experiments showed that mortality of B. antiqua was significantly influenced both by temperature and UVB dose, being more vulnerable at high temperature. We further investigated the effect of radiation regime and temperature on the bioaccumulation of PPCs in controlled laboratory experiments. We found that the concentrations of PPCs could be experimentally modified by manipulating radiation exposure and temperature. In addition, by breaking down the bioaccumulation processes into uptake and elimination, we were able to show that (i) the uptake rate was stimulated by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)+UVA exposure and (ii) both uptake and elimination rates increased with temperature. Thus, the net accumulation (i.e. the balance between uptake and elimination), which ultimately dictates the concentration observed in an animal, could be either positive or negative depending on the specific combination of radiation exposure and temperature. The dual regulation of PPCs by radiation exposure and temperature should be considered in future efforts to reconstruct or predict the photoprotective responses of aquatic organisms to the past or future climate scenarios.

AB This article is a sequel to a word-model description of the ecosystem of sub-Antarctic Marion Island, published in this journal 30 years ago (Smith 1977). It expands on the qualitative considerations of patterns of energy flow and nutrient cycling presented in that paper, by providing quantitative information from subsequent research at the island. Primary production of the island's lowland plant communities is high on an annual basis, because the vegetation has a long growing season due to the lack of severely cold winters or drought. Daily productivity is actually low due to low radiation levels and a cool growing season. The vegetation is particularly efficient regarding its use of nutrients for its growth, but still requires substantial amounts of nutrients to support the high annual production. Seabirds and seals import large quantities of nutrients from the ocean when they breed and moult on the island. They markedly enhance soil and plant nutrient status in the areas in which they occur, and also in adjacent areas. However, by far the greater part of the island's inland vegetation is not directly influenced by birds or seals and most of the nutrients required for plant growth are provided by decomposition of plant litter and peat. Soil invertebrates are crucial facilitators of decomposition processes, which are otherwise restricted by low soil temperatures and high soil moisture contents. Introduced house mice have invaded almost all parts of the island and predate heavily on the invertebrates, thus affecting nutrient mineralisation. This threatens not only the functioning (lowered nutrient availability leading to slower plant growth and the production of a lower quality, more decomposition-recalcitrant plant litter), but also the structure (an altered balance between production and decomposition leads to a change in the relation between peat formation and degradation, which is an important determinant of vegetation succession) of the island's ecosystem. It is suggested that mice may also affect the island's ecology by predating on seabird chicks.

AB We compared the plant understorey between stands of introduced Pinus contorta and native P. sylvestris in boreal northern Sweden using a chronosequence of 24 paired stands of P contorta or P. sylvestris. We located one 1000 m(2) sample plot in each stand in which we recorded tree variables. number of vascular plant and lichen species, and cover of the understorey of each of the groups vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. We tested for differences between the two chronosequences and assessed relationships between the understorey and stand variables. Tree variables did not differ between stands but stands of P contorta had more than three times greater percent ground cover of needle litter compared to stands of P sylvestris. Naturally regenerated individuals of P contorta occurred in five out of 12 stands of P contorta older than 25 years. The understorey was similar between stand types in terms of species richness, cover, and species composition but the entire species pool was larger for stands of R sylvestris than for stands of P contorta. Thirty-eight species were only found in stands of P sylvestris; the corresponding figure for stands of P contorta was six species. Shade-intolerant understorey species were disfavoured in stands of P contorta. The development at the stand level of understorey (vascular plant and lichen) species richness and cover over time was similar between stand types. In both types of stands, the number of lichen species and the percent ground cover of lichens and bryophytes increased with stand age; the corresponding values for vascular plant species did not. The results propose a more homogeneous flora in stands of P contorta compared to stands of P sylvestris, suggesting lower understorey species richness at the landscape scale. The larger shading effect of needles in the canopy and on the ground in stands of P contorta, which is supposed to imply less habitat variation, might contribute to this difference.

AB Above- and belowground phenology and water relations of Enterolobium cyclocarpum Jacq. trees in the dry forest of Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica were studied during two consecutive phenological cycles, from November 1998 to June 2000. Aboveground phenological activity, including leaf shedding, growth and maturation of dormant fruits, new leaf flushing and flowering, occurred during the dry season. Measurements of leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and sap flow indicated that stomata of newly flushed leaves remained essentially closed until the onset of the first rains, suggesting that the main factor accounting for the favorable water balance of dry-season flushed leaves was their capacity to restrict water loss. Evidence of a contribution from stem and root water stores to shoot expansion was mixed because only the first dry-season flushing episode monitored was accompanied by a marked decrease in stem and root water potentials. Fine root production did not precede leaf flushing, occurred only after the onset of the rainy season and stopped under drought conditions, suggesting that soil water content was the most important variable controlling fine root dynamics in this species.

AB 1. The combined effects of deposit-feeding, bioturbation and bioirrigation by benthic macrofauna on the enzymatic hydrolysis of organic matter were studied in microcosms. Chironomus riparius larvae (Insecta, Diptera) served as model macrofauna and stinging nettle leaves (Urtica dioica) were used as a detrital food source.
   2. In the upper 10 mm of the sediment (the habitat of C. riparius larvae), the activities of several exoenzymes, the contents of several fractions of particulate organic matter (POM), and the concentrations of dissolved oxidants (O-2, NO3-) were measured on a small scale. Fluorescent particles (luminophores) were used to quantify the vertical redistribution of particles within the same layer.
   3. In control sediment, the addition of detrital food enhanced exoenzyme activities in the 0-2 mm layer only. In the presence of C. riparius larvae, exoenzyme activities increased to 10 mm depth. Further, the content of POM in the 0-2 mm layer was lower in the presence than in the absence of larvae, suggesting ingestion and subduction of the added detritus. After prolonged incubation without further food addition, exoenzyme activities returned close to background values in both treatments, whereas the vertical distribution of POM remained unchanged.
   4. The overall penetration depth of O-2 and NO3- into the sediment was greater in the presence than the absence of C. riparius, the differences being more pronounced after prolonged incubation. Locally high O-2 and NO3- concentrations due to bioirrigation by C. riparius were measured deep in the sediment. Net downward transport of particles was observed only in the presence of C. riparius larvae and only at the beginning of the incubation.
   5. I conclude that deposit-feeding and bioturbation by macrofauna can quickly remove freshly deposited POM from the sediment surface and transfer it to less oxygenated sites (i.e. animal guts and deep sediment layers). Bioirrigation also increases the availability of oxidants deep in the sediment. The oscillation of oxidant supply to POM particles by ingestion-egestion, burial and re-burial, and the intermittent bioirrigation of subsurface sediment, is probably the cause of the increased rate of organic matter hydrolysis, the rate-limiting step in mineralization.

AB In spite of its wide distribution, Geoffroy's cat (Oncifelis geoffroyi) has been recently upgraded from Least Concern IUCN category to Near Threatened because of lack of knowledge. In this study, we examine at the Mar Chiquita Biosphere Reserve (37 degrees 46'S, 57 degrees 27'W; Argentina) their seasonal diet, and their feeding preference in relation to waterbird abundance, size, and distance of waterbird prey before attack. The diet, evaluated by feces analysis, was comprised of 42% waterbirds and 40% small mammals. The relative importance of waterbirds in the diet changed throughout the year associated with seasonal fluctuations in their availability. Predation on waterbirds increased from autumn to summer, while predation on small mammals decreased during this period. Trophic-niche breadth for prey occurrence was higher in autumn and lower in spring. We found that abundance, distance of waterbird prey before attack, and prey size were significant predictors of waterbird consumption by the Geoffroy's cat. This small cat appears to change its kill rate in relation to waterbird abundance changes. The overconsumption of prey close to vegetation and big prey indicates selective predatory behavior by this cat. (c) 2006 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB The impacts of runoff events on external suspended solids loading to Schoharie Reservoir, New York, and patterns of light scattering and sediment deposition in this reservoir are assessed. The assessment is based on monitoring of suspended solids concentrations in the reservoir's primary tributary, detailed vertical profiles of optical backscattering (a surrogate measure of light scattering) in the reservoir water column, and analysis of sediment trap collections, over a seven-month interval of high runoff. These impacts are reported to be tightly temporally coupled and strongly positively related to the magnitude of runoff events. The primary tributary entered the reservoir as a plunging inflow during runoff events, causing conspicuous subsurface peaks in light scattering, with vertical patterns that varied strongly for different events. Deposition quantified by near-bottom trap deployments is reported to be more representative than results from metalimnetic deployments that were generally within, rather than below, the turbid layers. Direct inputs of sediment, transported by density currents, are found to drive deposition, rather than resuspension/redeposition. More than 50 percent of the reported deposition occurred in less than 15 percent of the study period, associated with the four largest runoff events.

AB There are 21 and 15 species of seabirds that breed in the Humboldt and Benguela upwelling systems respectively. Only two species of gull are common to both systems, one as an endemic subspecies to the Benguela system. Eleven species and two subspecies are endemic (or nearly so) to the Humboldt system; seven species and one subspecies to the Benguela system. Each system has an endemic penguin, sulid, cormorant and tern that feed mainly on anchovy Engraulis spp., sardine Sardinops sagax or both these fish. The Peruvian pelican Pelecanus thagus also feeds primarily on these prey items. A plentiful availability of food has resulted in many of these seabirds attaining high levels of abundance. For the four pairs of species that feed on anchovy and sardine, those in the Humboldt system all have a biology that enables them to increase more rapidly than their Benguela counterparts. This reflects the higher frequency of environmental perturbations that depress seabird populations in the Humboldt system. In addition, both systems have a small endemic cormorant that feeds near the coast and a small endemic tern that breeds in the adjacent mainland desert and feeds at the sea surface. Several seabirds endemic to a system have no obvious ecological equivalent in the other system: the pelican, a diving petrel, four storm-petrels and a gull in the Humboldt system; a cormorant and a gull in the Benguela system. Some species with tropical or subantarctic affinities breed at the boundaries of the systems. Others breed also in freshwater systems. The grey gull Larus modestus, which feeds in the Humboldt system, breeds in montane deserts.

AB High-resolution acoustic and ichtyoplankton sampling with a 'continuous under-way fish egg sampler (CUFES)' was performed in two regions of approximately 100 square nautical miles off southern Iberian Peninsula, with the aim of studying the small scale distribution of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) adults and eggs during a spawning event. Very dense patches (246 eggs m(-3)) Of recently spawned eggs with dimensions (up to 3 nautical miles wide) significantly larger than daytime sardine schools were present in both regions. Egg staging and ageing showed very little intra-sample. variation, indicating a synchronous spawning period at dusk. The internal structure of the patches evaluated by variography showed very low internal variability, as if they consisted of a single unit. This hypothesis is confirmed by the acoustic finding of large sardine shoals with similar dimensions to those of the patches after sunset and throughout the night. During that period, adults were found near or in contact with the bottom, suggesting that spawning occurred at depth. A distinct patch of older eggs was found in both areas, but with a few nautical miles of horizontal separation. Their characteristics (a larger area, lower egg densities and a more irregular shape) indicate that these patches were exposed to dispersion and 'stirring' by physical forces, reshaping their initial appearance, while mesoscale water circulation could have displaced the core of the patches away by several kilometres within a day.

AB The Cabrera vole (Microtus cabrerae) is a threatened rodent endemic in the Iberian Peninsula with a patchy distribution and specific microhabitat requirements. This aim of this study was to document the composition of plant communities in habitats of Cabrera vole colonies in southern Portugal. Differences observed in plant species composition were also compared with vegetation structure, taxonomic and life form groups, species and group diversity, disturbance, topography and soil properties. Vegetation was sampled between March and July 2004, in 26 colonies occurring in five geographical areas. Grasses were the most abundant, common and diverse family in the colonies, and the perennial grass Agrostis castellana was present in 92% of colonies, with a mean cover of 16% of the site. Other frequently occurring species were Briza maxima (85%), Vulpia myuros (85%), Gaudinia fragilis (81%), Leontodon spp. (81%), Avena barbata (77%), Bromus hordeaceus (77%) and Tolpis barbata (77%). Colonies were classified in eight vegetation groups that included meadows, tall perennial grasslands, manured meadows with tall sedges, annual grasslands and ruderal and nitrophilous grasslands. Main gradients associated with composition differences were grass richness, annual and perennial grass cover, vegetation structure (herbaceous vegetation height), soil properties (texture and moisture), disturbance (ruderal species) and colony dimensions (area). Results suggest that the Cabrera vole is able to exploit a wide variety of grasslands, with a varying degree of ecological disturbance. Meadows and perennial grassland communities seem to be higher-quality microhabitats for voles.

AB Large animal colonies are significant sources of atmospheric NH3 that can potentially increase the nitrogen status of nearby ecosystems. Atmospheric NH3 concentrations were measured at different distances from a Cape fur seal colony at Cape Cross, northwest coast of Namibia, and an atmospheric dispersion model was applied inversely to estimate the total NH3 emission. Mean concentrations ranged from 354 to 0.01 mu g NH3 m(-3) at 0.01 and 26 km from the source, respectively. The model simulations suggest that the colony emits 25 - 70 tonnes of NH3-N yr(-1), c. 3% of the total N excreted by the seals.

AB Proliferation of artificial structures is a common feature in urbanized environments. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), much of the coastline is composed of seawalls that have replaced natural habitats, such as rocky shores. Many of these seawalls are made of sandstone blocks or concrete, but the effects of the type of substratum on assemblages living on seawalls has not been documented. Nevertheless, differences in characteristics of substratum have been shown to affect composition and development of intertidal assemblages. Grazing molluscs are important agents in the structuring of intertidal assemblages affecting numbers and distribution of other organisms. This study compares species and numbers of grazing molluscs at midshore levels between concrete and sandstone seawalls across Sydney Harbour. The two habitats supported a similar suite of species, although in different numbers and frequencies of occurrence, particularly higher on the shore. Therefore, concrete and sandstone seawalls provide different habitat for intertidal molluscs depending on tidal height. Experimental work is needed to assess properly the impact of construction of seawalls with different materials on intertidal biodiversity.

AB In order to investigate continental-scale patterns of plant species richness and rarity, distribution maps of 3661 plant species were digitized into a one degree grid of sub-Saharan Africa using the WORLDMAP computer programme. Cells with high species richness were also likely to be those containing the greatest number of species of restricted range, but areas such as the South African Cape and the Eastern Arc mountains were found to have more restricted-range species than predicted from their richness scores. The two environmental predictors which had the strongest individual relationships with both species richness and range-size rarity were absolute maximum annual temperature and mean monthly potential evapotranspiration. However, correlative predictive powers of these variables were low, with R = -0.58 and R = -0.54, respectively (P < 0.01). Multiple regression also failed to produce a strong explanatory model for observed continental-scale patterns of diversity. Spatial variability analysis showed that this was likely to be because different environmental parameters predicted different centres of richness and rarity. West African species richness was better predicted by absolute maximum annual temperature, whereas East African species richness was better predicted by mean monthly potential evapotranspiration.

AB We experimentally determined whether the low density of antlion larvae found in ant-acacia clearings is due to high levels of ant predation or an inadequate substrate for pit-trap construction. Pit establishment was more affected by soil improvement than by the exclusion of ants, suggesting that soil condition is the main factor that affect antlions' density. The low density of this ant-predator in ant-acacia clearings may be considered as an indirect advantage of the ant's pruning behavior.

   BEHAVIOR; DEFENSE
AB Over the last three decades, the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis has invaded rocky shores on the west coast of southern Africa, and now makes up 74 % of intertidal mussel biomass. It competes directly with an abundant indigenous limpet, Scutellastra argenvillei, which attains high densities and biomass due to collective feeding on kelp. This competition has reduced the limpet's access to kelp, and dense aggregations of the limpets are now found only in small patches (termed 'established patches') that are remnants of the previous limpet belt. Lower densities of the limpets occur on mussel beds or in patches cleared of mussels by wave action ('cleared patches'). We investigated the effects of Mytilus encroachment on the movement patterns of S. argenvillei by comparing its homing and movements in these 3 situations. Short-term (12 h) homing frequency was similar on established patches (86.5 %) and newly created cleared patches (81.3 %) but significantly less on the mussel bed (60.4 %). On a monthly basis, homing frequency was lower, but significantly different in all 3 habitats (51.0, 29.2 and 10.9 %, respectively). Distances moved did not differ between habitats during the 12 h observations, but on a monthly basis were significantly greater on the mussel bed than in the other 2 habitats. There were no significant differences between the distances moved by juveniles versus adults for either 12 h or 1 mo periods. Small limpets on mussel beds frequently moved into cleared patches (29.8 %) while other limpets virtually never changed habitats. Mytilus encroachment has thus increased the mobility and reduced the homing frequency of S. argenvillei, probably because it limits access to kelp and increases dependency on alternative food sources. These changes in behaviour are associated with radical reductions' of the density and mean size of S. argenvillei in areas dominated by M galloprovincialis. Individuals that survive on the secondary substratum provided by mussels are all small and sexually immature. M galloprovincialis has thus had an impact on both the behaviour and population dynamics of S. argenvillei, with considerable implications for the proposed commercial harvesting of S. argenvillei.

AB A method for studying the response of vegetation to environmental gradients, based on the community niche and fuzzy set theory, is presented. The approach is illustrated using an example from perennial halophilous vegetation along the Northern Adriatic coast of Italy. Compatibility curves are obtained by fuzzy set theoretical methods, and are used to model the response functions of plant associations to environmental gradients, including soil and ground water salinity, soil pH, soil and ground water temperature, percentage of sand, and variations in the ground water level. The compatibility curves summarize the similarity of a given plant community, with a particular value of an environmental variable, to the species combination of a given plant association. Compatibility curves offer an alternative approach to non-linear regression and best fit analyses normally used to model single species responses to environmental gradients. The approach is particularly useful given there is no single mechanistic model that can capture the exact shape of the functional response along environmental gradients, and given that environmental data are commonly affected by high levels of noise.

AB In most tropical trees, vegetative and reproductive development are distinctly periodic, but often poorly correlated with seasonal climatic change. Growth periodicity of individual trees is proposed here to reflect primarily an endogenous rhythm of vegetative growth resulting from periodic leaf replacement. This endogenous periodicity determines the species-specific timing of flowering and can be entrained secondarily to seasonal changes in water stress. These assumptions have been incorporated into a simple computer model which illustrates the effects of various degrees of seasonal drought on tree growth periodicity. A range of periodic growth patterns observed in individual trees and tree communities subject to increasing seasonal drought can be simulated by the model suggesting that causal interactions similar to those operating in the model are sufficient to determine growth periodicity in tropical trees and forests.

AB 1. The number of co-flowering species, floral density and floral trait diversity can be major determinants of pollinator-mediated plant-plant interactions in a community. However, evaluation of how each one of these co-flowering components affects the pollination success of a single focal plant species, and how these effects vary at different spatial scales, is lacking.
   2. Here, we evaluated the effects of functional diversity (flower morphology and colour), taxonomic diversity (reflecting potential sampling effects) and flower density (conspecific and heterospecific), on the pollinator environment (i.e. visitation rate and pollinator diversity) and pollination success (i.e. pollen load size and number of pollen tubes per style) of Cakile edentula (Brassicaceae). We applied structural equation models (SEMs) at the floral-neighbourhood (plot level) and community-wide scales to uncover the factors that mediate co-flowering community effects on C. edentula pollination success.
   3. We found that co-flowering community effects at the community level are more important than fine-scale floral-neighbourhood differences in mediating plant pollination success in our study species. Increasing plant functional diversity decreased pollinator visitation rate but increased the diversity of pollinator functional groups visiting C. edentula flowers. Taxonomic diversity negatively affected pollinator diversity suggesting that other unmeasured floral traits may be relevant or that single-species effects (sampling effects) may be important. Overall, our results suggest that functional floral trait diversity in a community may be the most important factor influencing pollination success of species in a community. We also found evidence for intra- and interspecific pollinator competition mediated by flower density, but none of these effects seemed to have a significant impact on pollination success.
   4. This study is an important step towards understanding the complexity of co-flowering community effects on the pollination success of individual plant species at multiple spatial scales. This study further reveals the potential importance of plant functional diversity in a community in helping predict competitive and facilitative interactions in co-flowering communities.
   5. Synthesis. Floral density and taxonomic and functional co-flowering diversity are important drivers of pollination success in flowering plants. The effects of the co-flowering diversity on the pollination success of plant species can largely depend on the spatial scale being studied. Only evaluating the outcomes of pollinator-mediated plant-plant interactions at multiple stages of the pollination process can lead to a complete understanding of their ecological consequences in nature.

AB Muzaffarabad district, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan is part of the western Himalaya and rich in phytodiversity, but until now little was known about its plant diversity on larger spatial scale and vegetation composition through multivariate statistical tools. To fill this research gap, the whole district was ecologically explored for the collection of field data from August 2014 to July 2016. For vegetation studies, a total of 16 altitudinal transects comprising 110 sampling stations (samples) with 990 plots were studied by using a stratified random vegetation sampling method. Different multivariate statistical tools including Monte Carlo permutation test, Indicator species analysis, hierarchical clustering, ordination, variation partitioning and multi-response permutation procedures tests were used for the first time for the study area to elucidate the number of significant vegetation groups, ranking and placement of plant species in these groups, classification of vegetation units, detection of important gradients, importance of groups of environmental variables and pairwise compositional differences of the species groups respectively. The results showed that all the recorded 343 plant species belong to seven significant plant associations which were further placed into 5 major forest types. Out of the total 19 variables studied, CCA detected the significant contribution of the majority (simple effects: 12; unique effects: 8) of them. The latter (unique effects) in descending order included altitude, forest cover, deforestation, community maturity, forest density, latitude, slope aspect, and longitudinal variations. Similarly, variation partitioning results depicted that topography was the leading driver affecting vegetation distribution, followed by the biotic and edaphic factors. The forest edges, especially the sub-alpine ecosystem, were most diverse, supported higher tree density and also faced maximum deforestation pressure. Furthermore, rangelands in the temperate to alpine zones were affected by heavy overgrazing. Due to the disrupted local ecosystem functioning, the study area needs proper management and conservations plans to save its biodiversity wealth in this part of western Himalaya.

AB This review compiles, summarizes and provides new analytical insights on large amounts of fragmented information on the diets and feeding behaviours of syngnathids (Family Syngnathidae). This review is broken down into two distinct sections that address two central questions: (1) How, where, when and what do syngnathids eat? And (2) How does diet differ with feeding morphology? For (1) we summarized both qualitative and quantitative information on the diets and feeding behaviours of syngnathids found in the published and grey literature. This section includes a narrative summary of syngnathid feeding events and foraging behaviours (e.g. body mechanics and feeding morphologies, habitat use, seasonal and diurnal timing of feeding, energetics) and a tabulated summary of what syngnathids eat. For (2) we performed a comparative analysis on the diets of 41 species of syngnathid, comprising 15 genera from 39 sources in peer-reviewed and grey literature. Redundancy analyses on bulk, numeric, and frequency of occurrence data, analyzed separately, all show large unexplained dietary variation, which we hypothesize is the result of large differences in prey availability. Of the explained variation, syngnathid diets were most strongly correlated with head characteristics: most notably relative snout lengths and gape sizes. Syngnathid feeding morphologies also showed high phylogenetic signal; this suggests that dietary differences across genera were largely explained by how syngnathids differed with respect to these feeding morphologies. This review identifies new taxonomic patterns, and expands on previous generalities, improving our ecological understanding of this diverse group of fishes.

AB Expanding cities present a sustainability challenge, as the uneven proliferation of hybrid landscape types becomes a major feature of 21st century urbanization. To fully address this challenge, scholars must consider the broad range of land uses that being produced beyond the urban core and how land use patterns in one location may be tied to patterns in other locations. Diverse threads within political ecology provide useful insights into the dynamics that produce uneven urbanization. Specifically, urban political ecology (UPE) details how economic power influences the development decision-making that proliferate urban forms, patterns of uneven access, and modes of decision-making, frequently viewing resource extraction and development through the urban metabolism lens. The political ecology of exurbia, or, perhaps, an exurban political ecology (ExPE), examines the symbolic role nature and the rural have played in conservation and development efforts that produce social, economic, and environmental conflicts. While UPE approaches tend to privilege macroscale dynamics, ExPE emphasizes the role of landowners, managers, and other actors in struggles over the production of exurban space, including through decision-making institutions and within the context of broader political economic forces. Three case studies illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, demonstrating the benefits for and giving suggestions on how to integrate their insights into urban sustainability research. Integrated political ecology approaches demonstrate how political-economic processes at a variety of scales produce diverse local sustainability responses.

AB Growing concerns over the ecological consequences of global changes in rainfall regimes have motivated exploration into how variable rainfall influences the persistence of plant species. Understanding the influence of rainfall events on seedling establishment is critical for predicting the consequences of potential changes to the rainfall regime in coastal salt marshes. However, it is not clear whether seedling establishment of various species responses to rainfall are strongly regulated by tidal inundation. We conducted a series of rainfall manipulation experiments in salt marshes and controlled greenhouse experiments to test the effect of post-dry season rainfall on seedling establishment of plant species among different tidal elevations and during drought and large rainfall events. Our results showed that post-dry season rainfall created an opportunity for seedling establishment by strongly influencing the suitability of abiotic factors for species niches, but plant soil rainfall interactions were nonlinear across existing soil conditions, which were controlled by tidal inundation. Seedling establishment was highly dependent on post-dry season rainfall amount. The seedlings of species that were sensitive to saline soil or had low tolerance to soil moisture only established successfully during large rainfall events. Consequently, changes in the rainfall amount caused shifts in native species composition and opened invasion opportunities for new species. Our study highlighted that small changes in rainfall amount or distribution can trigger comparatively large and abrupt changes in different species depending on their ecological niches and local abiotic gradients. Within tidal marshes, exploration of rainfall tide linkages advanced fundamental understanding of the effects of changing rainfall regimes and provided implications for coastal wetland management and restoration efforts to prepare for the future rainfall changes related to climate change.

AB An understanding of the balance of interspecific competition and the physical environment in structuring organismal communities is crucial because those communities structured primarily by their physical environment typically exhibit greater sensitivity to environmental change than those structured predominantly by competitive interactions. Here, using detailed phylogenetic and functional information, we investigate this question in macrofaunal assemblages from Northwest Atlantic Ocean continental slopes, a high seas region projected to experience substantial environmental change through the current century. We demonstrate assemblages to be both phylogenetically and functionally under-dispersed, and thus conclude that the physical environment, not competition, may dominate in structuring deep-ocean communities. Further, we find temperature and bottom trawling intensity to be among the environmental factors significantly related to assemblage diversity. These results hint that deep-ocean communities are highly sensitive to their physical environment and vulnerable to environmental perturbation, including by direct disturbance through fishing, and indirectly through the changes brought about by climate change.

AB With food supply chains distributed across global markets connected via internet using e-business solutions, transporting food from farm to fork is a critical element of any such supply chains. The transport can fall anywhere in the spectrum from long distances between farmers in one country to processors or distributors in another country, to short distances from retailers to end consumers both on the same street. We identify the key characteristics of the food supply chain and review the literature. Furthermore, we discuss a few trends that will lead the future of food transport and list a number of relevant and challenging research areas. In general, food supply chains are impacted by (1) socio-economic trends, (2) digitalization and innovation, and (3) transboundary animal and plant pests and diseases. Such developments have significant implications for food transport. In order to feed the billions of people that will live in big cities across the world in the coming decades, the academic community needs to unite with practitioners to efficiently manage the global transportation of food using the traditional and new modes of transportation that will be all connected thanks to digitalization.

AB It has long been recognized that superior carnivores can impact on the demography and ecology of smaller members of the guild, although exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here we use original data from a unique natural experiment to study some of the mechanisms by which African lions Panthera leo impact on African wild dogs Lycaon pictus. Using a study site where wild dogs outnumbered lions for several years prior to lion population recovery, we aimed to investigate whether or not, and by which means, wild dog populations are regulated and influenced by lions. We used 38 pack-years of demographic and behavioural data across two 4-year periods where lion density differed 20-fold (pre-lion era: 1996-1999 and lion era: 2010-2013) to assess how lions may affect wild dog pack size and age structure, litter size and pup survival (n = 329 pups), as well as den site selection (n = 46 dens). Pack size was significantly greater during the pre-lion era. The pup to adult ratio was lower during the lion era and the change in pack composition was directly attributable to significantly greater lion-induced pup mortality. We also demonstrate a behavioural shift, with locations selected for the vulnerable denning period being in more rugged terrain and in areas with lower prey densities during the lion era, as compared with the pre-lion era. Lower adult recruitment into a population of an obligate cooperative breeder like the African wild dog can have complex consequences, including on feeding and defence of young, and mate finding.

AB Demographic connectivity is fundamental to the persistence and resilience of metapopulations, but our understanding of the link between reproduction and recruitment is notoriously poor in open-coast marine populations. We provide the first evidence of high local retention and limited connectivity among populations spanning 700 km along an open coast in an upwelling system. Using extensive field measurements of fecundity, population size and settlement in concert with a Bayesian inverse modelling approach, we estimated that, on average, Petrolisthes cinctipes larvae disperse only 6.9 km (+/- 25.0 km s.d.) from natal populations, despite spending approximately six weeks in an open-coast system that was once assumed to be broadly dispersive. This estimate differed substantially from our prior dispersal estimate (153.9 km) based on currents and larval duration and behaviour, revealing the importance of employing demographic data in larval dispersal estimates. Based on this estimate, we predict that demographic connectivity occurs predominantly among neighbouring populations less than 30 km apart. Comprehensive studies of larval production, settlement and connectivity are needed to advance an understanding of the ecology and evolution of life in the sea as well as to conserve ecosystems. Our novel approach provides a tractable framework for addressing these questions for species occurring in discrete coastal populations.

   EXTINCTIONS; TOLERANCE; INCREASES; COMMUNITY; STRENGTH
AB In the last 15 years, a complex networks perspective has been increasingly used in the robustness assessment of ecological systems. It is therefore crucial to assess the reliability of such tools. Based on the traditional simulation of node (species) removal, mutualistic pollination networks are considered to be relatively robust because of their 1) truncated power-law degree distribution, 2) redundancy in the number of pollinators per plant and 3) nested interaction pattern. However, species removal is only one of several possible approaches to network robustness assessment. Empirical evidence suggests a decline in abundance prior to the extinction of interacting species, arguing in favour of an interaction removal-based approach (i.e. interaction disruption), as opposed to traditional species removal. For simulated networks, these two approaches yield radically different conclusions, but no tests are currently available for empirical mutualistic networks. This study compared this new robustness evaluation approach based on interaction extinction versus the traditional species removal approach for 12 alpine and subalpine pollination networks. In comparison with species removal, interaction removal produced higher robustness in the worst-case extinction scenario but lower robustness in the best-case extinction scenario. Our results indicate that: 1) these two approaches yield very different conclusions and 2) existing assessments of ecological network robustness could be overly optimistic, at least those based on a disturbance affecting species at random or beginning with the least connected species. Therefore, further empirical study of plant-pollinator interactions in disturbed ecosystems is imperative to understand how pollination networks are disassembled.

AB The Iberian sardine (Sardina pilchardus) is a traditional fishery in western Iberia that is economically important in Portugal and in Galicia (NW Spain). The International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) advice for the sardine in regions VIII and IXa in 2013 indicated that the biomass has decreased since 2006 and recruitment has been below the long term average since 2005. Recruitment is very variable, so it is important to understand the underlying processes driving this variation in order to manage the fishery effectively. In this study, a biophysical model was used to simulate the early life (egg and larval) stages of sardine. A high resolution hydrodynamic model for North and Northwest Iberia was used to force a Lagrangian Individually-Based Model (IBM) that simulated advection and dispersion (both horizontal and vertical) and included some biological behaviour. A Lower Trophic Level (LTL) model coupled to the hydrodynamic model was also used to get some insight on recruitment for years 2006-2007. Additionally, since in this area there are two different spawning grounds that could be associated with two eventually different populations, we have tried to show how the model can be used for giving insight on stock connectivity and therefore can contribute to stock delineation.

AB Marine invertebrate microbiota has a key function in host physiology and health. To date, knowledge about bivalve microbiota is poorly documented except public health concerns. This study used a molecular approach to characterize the microbiota associated with the bivalve Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) by determining (1) the difference among organs either or not under the influence of host habitat, (2) small-scale variability of microbiota, and (3) the experimental response of the Manila clam microbiota submitted to different lateral transmissions. These questions were investigated by sampling two groups of individuals living in contrasting habitats and carrying out a transplant experiment. Manila clam microbiota (i.e., bacterial community structure) was determined at organ-scale (gills, gut, and a pool of remaining tissues) by capillary electrophoresis DNA fingerprinting (CE fingerprinting). The Manila clam microbiota structure differed among organs indicating a selection of Manila clam microbiota at organ scale. Habitat strongly influenced gill and gut microbiota. In contrast, microbiota associated with remaining tissues was similar between group individuals suggesting that these communities are mostly autochthonous, i.e., Manila clam specific. Transplant experiment showed that improving living condition did not induce any change in microbiota associated with remaining tissues. In contrast, the reduction in individual habitat quality led to individuals in declining health as strongly suggested by the increase in phagocytosis activity and decrease in condition index together with the change in internal organ microbiota. This study provides a first description of the Manila clam holobiont which can withstand disturbance and respond opportunistically to improved environmental conditions.

AB Re-establishing nutrient-cycling is often a key goal of mine-site restoration. This goal can be achieved by applying fertilisers (particularly P) in combination with seeding N-fixing legumes. However, the effect of this strategy on other key restoration goals such as the establishment and growth of non-leguminous species has received little attention. We investigated the effects of P-application rates either singly, or in combination with seeding seven large understorey legume species, on jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining. Five years after P application and seeding, legume species richness, density and cover were higher in the legume-seeded treatment. However, the increased establishment of legumes did not lead to increased soil N. Increasing P-application rates from 0 to 80 kg P ha(-1) did not affect legume species richness, but significantly reduced legume density and increased legume cover: cover was maximal (similar to 50%) where 80 kg P ha(-1) had been applied with large legume seeds. Increasing P-application had no effect on species richness of non-legume species, but increased the density of weeds and native ephemerals. Cover of non-legume species decreased with increasing P-application rates and was lower in plots where large legumes had been seeded compared with non-seeded plots. There was a significant legume x P interaction on weed and ephemeral density: at 80 kg P ha(-1) the decline in density of these groups was greatest where legumes were seeded. In addition, the decline in cover for non-legume species with increasing P was greatest when legumes were seeded. Applying 20 kg P ha(-1) significantly increased tree growth compared with tree growth in unfertilised plots, but growth was not increased further at 80 kg ha(-1) and tree growth was not affected by seeding large legumes. Taken together, these data indicate that 80 kg ha(-1) P-fertiliser in combination with (seeding) large legumes maximised vegetation cover at five years but could be suboptimal for re-establishing a jarrah forest community that, like unmined forest, contains a diverse community of slow-growing re-sprouter species. The species richness and cover of non-legume understorey species, especially the resprouters, was highest in plots that received either 0 or 20 kg ha(-1) P and where large legumes had not been seeded. Therefore, our findings suggest that moderation of P-fertiliser and legumes could be the best strategy to fulfil the multiple restoration goals of establishing vegetation cover, while at the same time maximising tree growth and species richness of restored forest.

AB In sexually deceptive orchids, pollinator specificity is the main factor responsible for species isolation. The two sexually deceptive orchids Ophrys chestermanii and Ophrys normanii occur sympatrically on Sardinia and attract the same pollinator, males of Bombus vestalis, by producing the same odour bouquets. Since gene flow between these two species has been shown to be almost absent, their genetic distinctness seems to be preserved by other forms of reproductive barrier than pollinator specificity. The aim of this study is to investigate the nature and strength of these isolation barriers which apparently halt gene flow between these two orchids that share the same pollinator. Morphological measurements, combined with observations of cross-pseudocopulations, revealed that, in sympatry, the longer caudicles of O. normanii and the smaller and differently shaped stigmatic cavity in O. chestermanii are the main factors preventing gene flow between these two sympatric species. In contrast, other pre- or post-mating barriers seem to be weak or absent, as the two species have overlapping flowering time and we were able to rear hybrid offspring from interspecific manual crosses. At the same time, genetic analysis of orchid plantlets collected at sympatric sites detected the presence of only two putative hybrid individuals. Thus, the probability of natural cross-pollination between O. normanii and O. chestermanii seems to be strongly limited by divergence in their floral morphology. For some traits, this divergence was found increased between sympatric populations.

AB Ecological connectivity is critical for population dynamics but in many benthic species it is complicated by a planktonic larval phase, whose dispersal remains poorly understood. Using a plankton pump, we examine the distribution of intertidal mussel larvae along three axes: alongshore, cross-shelf and by depth during a large scale (600 km) cruise over the Agulhas Bank off southern Africa in August/September 2010. As a general pattern, higher veliger abundances were found close to the coast. Our analyses of the nearshore flow, estimated from ADCP data and the vertical distribution of larvae, show that onshore larval retention may be mediated by active vertical swimming through the water column guided by light and wind-induced turbulence. A massive offshore export of larvae off St Francis Bay was, however, observed during an Agulhas Current meander which influenced inner shelf waters. We hypothesize that, by increasing and homogenizing flow, the Agulhas Current may erase the effects of larval vertical positioning on onshore retention and transport larvae offshore. Our study highlights the need to integrate the effects of complex, region-specific physical dynamics with the swimming behaviour of larvae in order to explain their spatial distribution, population connectivity and the consequences for population dynamics.

AB Google Earth (GE) provides very high resolution (VHR) natural-colored (red-green-blue, RGB) images based on commercial spaceborne sensors over worldwide coastal areas. GE is rarely used as a direct data source to address coastal issues despite the tremendous potential of data transferability. This paper describes an inexpensive and easy-to-implement methodology to construct a GE natural-colored dataset with a submeter pixel size over 44 km(2) to accurately map the water depth, seabed and land cover along a seamless coastal area in subtropical Japan (Shiraho, Ishigaki Island). The valuation of the GE images for the three mapping types was quantified by comparison with directly-purchased images. We found that both RGB GE-derived mosaic and pansharpened QuickBird (QB) imagery yielded satisfactory results for mapping water depth (R-GE(2) = 0.71 and R-QB(2) = 0.69), seabed cover (OA(GE) = 89.70% and OA(QB) = 80.40%, n = 15 classes) and land cover (OA(GE) = 95.32% and OA(QB) = 88.71%, n = 11 classes); however, the GE dataset significantly outperformed the QB dataset for all three mappings (Z(Water depth) = 6.29, Z(Seabed) = 4.10, Z(Land) = 3.28, alpha(two-tailed) < 0.002). The integration of freely available elevation data into both RGB datasets significantly improved the land cover classification accuracy (OA(GE) = 99.17% and OA(QB) = 97.80%). Implications and limitations of our findings provide insights for the use of GE VHR data by stakeholders tasked with integrated coastal zone management.

AB Copepods and bacteria are fundamental components of the pelagic food web and play a major role in biogeochemical cycles. Marine bacteria have a free-living or particle-attached lifestyle, but as members of the microbial food web, the only biotic interaction of bacteria is commonly assumed to be with their predators (protists and/or viruses). However, a copepod's body is highly enriched in organic matter and harbors a large and complex bacterial community. The aim of this study was to compare the composition of the free-living bacterial community of the open Atlantic to that associated with copepods. We used 454 high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to decipher the bacterial community composition associated with this zooplankton group and the ambient water. Significant differences were found between the bacterial communities associated with the dominant copepod families (Calanoida: Centropagidae and Clausocalanidae; Cyclopoida: Corycaeidae, Oncaeidae, and Lubbockiidae) and the ambient water. Bacilli and Actinobacteria dominated the copepod-associated community and Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Synechococcus dominated the free-living community. However, the presence of shared bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between these 2 distinct habitats suggests a dynamic exchange of bacteria between seawater and copepods. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that the interior and exterior surfaces of copepods provide a specific niche with a strong selective pressure for bacteria.

AB In the resource-limited Arctic environment, vegetation developing near seabird colonies is exceptionally luxuriant. Nevertheless, there are very few detailed quantitative studies of any specific plant species responses to ornithogenic manuring. Therefore, we studied variability of polar scurvygrass Cochlearia groe nlandica individual biomass and leaf width along a seabird influenced gradient determining environmental conditions for vegetation in south-west Spitsbergen. We found seabird colony effect being a paramount factor responsible for augmented growth of C. groenlandica. The species predominated close to the colony and reached the highest mean values of individual biomass (1.4 g) and leaf width (26.6 mm) 10 m below the colony. Its abundance and size declined towards the coast. Both C. groenlandica individual traits significantly decreased with distance from the colony, soil water and organic matter content and increased with guano deposition, soil delta N-15, conductivity, acidity and nitrate, phosphate and potassium ion content. Our study supports the hypothesis that seabirds have fundamental importance for vegetation growth in poor Arctic environment. Highly plastic species such as C. groenlandica may be a useful instrument in detecting habitat condition changes, for instance resulting from climate change.

AB The soils impacted by sea animal excreta are important sources of nutrients in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, and soil microorganisms are the principal drivers of carbon and nitrogen cycling. However, microbial diversity and enzyme activities in these soils have still received little attention. In this paper, we investigated the distribution characteristics of bacterial community in four penguin and seal colony soil profiles collected in East Antarctica, using 16S rDNA-DGGE and real-time quantitative PCR. Soil microbial biomass carbon (C-mic), soil respiration (SR), and enzyme activities involved in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus metabolisms were also measured. Overall soil C-mic, SR, enzyme activities, and bacterial abundance decreased with depth. The bacterial abundance had a significant correlation with soil organic carbon and total nitrogen and highly corresponded to the relative content of penguin guano or seal excreta in these soil profiles. The 16S rDNA-DGGE revealed the complicated bacterial community structure in penguin and seal colony soils, and the band richness and dominant bands decreased with soil depth. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles indicated that bacterial community in those soil profiles were divided into four main categories with the bacterial genetic similarity of 22 %, and the majority of the sequenced bands were Proteobacteria (alpha, beta, gamma), Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes. Our results indicated that the deposition of penguin guano or seal excreta, which caused the variability in soil soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, and soil moisture, might have an important effect on the vertical distribution pattern of bacterial abundance and diversity in Antarctic soil profiles.

AB Most populations of wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) are declining across southern and southeastern Africa, and in the Save Valley Conservancy (SVC) the decline appears to be associated with declining populations of prey and increasing numbers of competitors. Identifying the threats to this wild dog population is currently needed to determine the most appropriate conservation actions. We studied the diet composition, breadth and overlap among four sympatric carnivores in SVC: African wild dog, spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), lion (Panthera leo) and leopard (Panthera pardus), using faecal analysis. We found remains of 16 mammalian prey species, ranging from small to large mammals (2-525 kg). The four carnivores had many prey species in common (>70% diet overlap), with impala (Aepyceros melampus) consistently the most frequent. The frequency of occurrence of impala, however, was highest in the diets of wild dogs (74%), and wild dogs were found to have the narrowest standardized dietary niche breadth (0.087). The diets also varied significantly in the contribution of different prey-size categories, with large prey (>100 kg) contributing most to the diets of lions and hyaenas, and small prey (<5 kg) to the diet of leopards. With impala populations in decline, competition for prey can explain the observed decline in the less competitive and more specialized wild dog, whose main food resource is shared with a rapidly increasing population of spotted hyaenas and lions in the SVC.

AB The ingestion rate, egg production, egg-hatching success and survival rate of adult female copepods, Paracalanus sp., in relation to a suspended sediment concentration gradient (control: 0 mg L-1, low: 10 mg L-1, middle: 30 mg L-1 and high: 100 mg L-1) were examined in the laboratory under two concentrations (1 10(3) and 1 10(4) cells mL(1)) of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum to understand the impacts of turbidity on the reproductive responses. Ingestion rates under both phytoplankton concentrations were significantly lower at high level of suspended sediments than at the control level. The egg production rate at the low phytoplankton concentration also decreased with increasing suspended sediment concentration, but there was no effect of suspended sediment on egg production at the high phytoplankton concentration. Egg-hatching success was relatively high at 90; thus, there was no deleterious effect of suspended sediments on egg viability. The survival rate of adult females decreased with time in all treatments, indicating no negative effects of suspended sediments on the mortality of female copepods. These results suggest that higher concentrations of suspended sediments might have negative effects on copepod recruitment in the field. Feeding efficiency on phytoplankton decreased in the presence of suspended sediments, thus potentially decreasing the copepod egg production rate. However, the negative effects may be lessened if the copepod ingests more food in terms of both quality and quantity in favorable food environments.

AB Background: The field of synthetic biology has greatly evolved and numerous functions can now be implemented by artificially engineered cells carrying the appropriate genetic information. However, in order for the cells to robustly perform complex or multiple tasks, co-operation between them may be necessary. Therefore, various synthetic biological systems whose functionality requires cell-cell communication are being designed. These systems, microbial consortia, are composed of engineered cells and exhibit a wide range of behaviors. These include yeast cells whose growth is dependent on one another, or bacteria that kill or rescue each other, synchronize, behave as predator-prey ecosystems or invade cancer cells.
   Results: In this paper, we study a synthetic ecosystem comprising of bacteria and yeast that communicate with and benefit from each other using small diffusible molecules. We explore the behavior of this heterogeneous microbial consortium, composed of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli cells, using stochastic modeling. The stochastic model captures the relevant intra-cellular and inter-cellular interactions taking place in and between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Integration of well-characterized molecular regulatory elements into these two microbes allows for communication through quorum sensing. A gene controlling growth in yeast is induced by bacteria via chemical signals and vice versa. Interesting dynamics that are common in natural ecosystems, such as obligatory and facultative mutualism, extinction, commensalism and predator-prey like dynamics are observed. We investigate and report on the conditions under which the two species can successfully communicate and rescue each other.
   Conclusions: This study explores the various behaviors exhibited by the cohabitation of engineered yeast and bacterial cells. The way that the model is built allows for studying the dynamics of any system consisting of two species communicating with one another via chemical signals. Therefore, key information acquired by our model may potentially drive the experimental design of various synthetic heterogeneous ecosystems.

AB Although understanding the patterns of diversity is essential for conservation and environmental studies, an understanding of bryophyte distributions in Australia has been limited by the absence of continental-scale maps for patterns of bryophyte diversity. The aim of this study was to identify the patterns of species richness and endemism of hornworts, liverworts, and mosses in Australia. A database of 85383 geo-referenced herbarium records was assembled and aggregated at a grid cell resolution of 0.5 degrees. A one-cell radius neighbourhood analysis was applied to identify the spatial patterns of species richness and endemism. Primary centres of species richness were located on the east of the continent, with the highest number of species occurring in Queensland's Wet Tropics, the Border Ranges near the Queensland-New South Wales border, the central coast of New South Wales, southern Victoria, and Tasmania. Endemism scores were high in the Wet Tropics, but highly endemic regions were scattered across the continent but not found in arid regions. The spatial patterns of diversity differed among hornworts, liverworts, and mosses, and areas of endemism and species richness did not always overlap. Comparisons with other taxa additionally indicated that areas of bryophyte diversity do not correspond with groups that are currently used as proxies in conservation.

AB We use a 31 year dataset to assess the effects of resources (rainfall, soil, relief) and disturbance (cattle browsing and fire) on regeneration and growth in a long-lived tree Acacia peuce from arid inland Australia. Temporal and spatial resource availability had an overwhelming effect on recruitment and stand density; but cattle browsing and fire limited sapling growth and stand persistence, respectively. Seedling establishment over the 31 years was effectively confined to a single prolonged high rainfall phase. Cattle browsing in productive (run-on) patches kept saplings short; while long-fenced and low cattle-use (run-off) patches provided spatial escape opportunities for sapling growth. Fire caused the death of standing plants, but it did not stimulate recruitment, and was therefore an additional limiting factor for stand persistence. Our study provided further support for the central role of prolonged large rainfall events for regeneration in long-lived arid trees, but it also emphasised how disturbance can strongly limit stand regeneration. Overall, we expect that desert trees such as Acacia peuce that are characterised by slow population dynamics will be adversely affected by climate change due to increasingly rare recruitment. Minimisation of disturbance factors will be an increasingly important requirement for the long-term persistence of this species. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Forest management alters species behaviours, distributions and interactions. To evaluate forestry effects on ant foraging performance, we compared the quality and quantity of honeydew harvested by ants among clear-cuts, middle-aged and mature spruce-dominated stands in boreal forests in Sweden. Honeydew quality was examined using honeydew collected by squeezing the gasters of laden Formica aquilonia workers. We used fifteen laden individuals at each study site (four replicates of each stand age) and analysed honeydew chemical composition with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. To compare the quantity of honeydew collected by individual ants, we collected and weighed five ants moving up and five ants moving down each of ten trees at the twelve sites (totally 1200 ants). The concentration of trehalose in honeydew was lower in clear-cuts compared with middle aged and mature stands, and similar trends were shown for sucrose, raffinose and melezitose, indicating poorer honeydew quality on clear cuts. Concentrations of the amino acid serine were higher on clear-cuts. The same trend occurred for glutamine, suggesting that increased N-uptake by the trees after clear cutting is reflected in the honeydew of aphids. Ants in mature stands had larger heads and carried proportionally more honeydew and may therefore be more efficient foragers. Human alternation of habitats through clear-cutting thus affects food quality and worker condition in F. aquilonia. This is the first study to show that honeydew quality is affected by anthropogenic disturbances, likely contributing to the reduction in size and abundance of F. aquilonia workers and mounds after clear cutting.

AB We used a polyphasic approach for precise identification of bacterial flora (Vibrionaceae) isolated from crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) from Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) and Guam (USA, Western Pacific Ocean). Previous 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis was useful to allocate and identify isolates within the Photobacterium, Splendidus and Harveyi clades but failed in the identification of Vibrio harveyi-like isolates. Species of the V. harveyi group have almost indistinguishable phenotypes and genotypes, and thus, identification by standard biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene analysis is commonly inaccurate. Biochemical profiling and sequence analysis of additional topA and mreB housekeeping genes were carried out for definitive identification of 19 bacterial isolates recovered from sick and wild COTS. For 8 isolates, biochemical profiles and topA and mreB gene sequence alignments with the closest relatives (GenBank) confirmed previous 16S rRNA-based identification: V. fortis and Photobacterium eurosenbergii species (from wild COTS), and V. natriegens (from diseased COTS). Further phylogenetic analysis based on topA and mreB concatenated sequences served to identify the remaining 11 V. harveyi-like isolates: V. owensii and V. rotiferianus (from wild COTS), and V. owensii, V. rotiferianus, and V. harveyi (from diseased COTS). This study further confirms the reliability of topA-mreB gene sequence analysis for identification of these close species, and it reveals a wider distribution range of the potentially pathogenic V. harveyi group.

AB Measurements from recently installed 5 MHz high-frequency radar (CODAR) stations south of Point Arena, California, are used to describe surface current patterns during the upwelling season (June-August 2007). The systems provide hourly current maps on a 5-km grid, covering a region from approximately 10 to 150 km offshore (the continental shelf into the deep ocean). These HF-radar observations provide an unprecedented view of circulation in this "coastal transition zone", between the wind-driven circulation over the shelf and the California Current circulation offshore. Circulation patterns include: (1) bifurcation of the coastal upwelling jet downstream of Point Arena into an along-shelf (down-coast) branch and an offshore branch, and (2) a large-scale anticyclonic meander that often develops into an eddy-like recirculation south of the bifurcation. The "recirculation" feature extends well offshore, with surface currents 50-100 km from the coast consistently opposing the wind stress. The spatial and temporal evolution of the surface current features during upwelling events affects surface transport from Point Arena to areas in the south, increasing the travel time of a substantial fraction of newly upwelled water from a few days to roughly two weeks. Thus, surface currents even far offshore influence coastal transport of nutrients, phytoplankton and larvae on ecologically relevant timescales, with resultant connectivity patterns very different than implied by a simple examination of the mean flow.

AB Since only 12.6% of the Brazilian Araucaria Forest remains and timber tree monocultures are expanding, biological invasion is a potential threat to the conservation of natural forest remnants. Here, we test (1) the susceptibility of Araucaria Forest to invasion by Pinus taeda and Eucalyptus saligna, (2) the efficiency of different mechanisms controlling the early establishment of these two exotic timber tree species, and (3) the potential of the native timber tree Araucaria angustifolia to establish successfully in ecologically-managed monocultures of Araucaria, Pinus and Eucalyptus. In Araucaria Forest, more than a thousand Pinus seeds landed annually in a hectare; however, experimentally exposed seeds were 100% removed in only 6 days. Furthermore, all experimentally transplanted seedlings of Pinus taeda and Eucalyptus saligna died in less than a year in Araucaria Forest, but not in the monocultures. Correlative evidence suggests that this mortality was associated to plant community richness, plant abundance, and soil fertility. Araucaria angustifolia, in contrast, showed an establishment success in ecologically-managed tree monocultures as high as that exhibited in its natural habitat. The current resistance of Araucaria Forest to invasion by exotic timber trees is good news for the conservation of Araucaria Forest remnants and for its keystone species. The understanding of the mechanisms providing such resistance against invasion points towards management tools for minimizing future threats.

AB Recruitment patterns of coastal species with complex life cycles are heavily influenced by physical variability in the coastal ocean. Spatial and temporal patterns of variability in rates of larval settlement may provide clues as to the processes that drive their transport and onshore delivery, as well as variation in the supply side of population dynamics. Over 3 consecutive seasons (2006-2008), the settlement of three intertidal barnacles (the chthamaloids Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus, and the balanoid Notobalanus flosculus) was monitored daily at 5 to 6 sites spread over ca. 10 km around the bay of Cartagena in central Chile, and over periods of 48,71 and 53 consecutive days that encompassed the settlement season of these species. This sampling effort yielded settlement data with an unprecedented combination of temporal resolution and spatial coverage, which allowed us to assess and compare: (1) spatial patterns of settlement and their persistence over scales of days within each season, (2) inter-annual variation in pattern persistence, and (3) the relationship between such variation and inter-annual changes in spatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) variability over synoptic and high-frequency scales. While on average the spatial pattern of settlement in chthamaloids became less persistent from 2006 to 2008, the settlement pattern of N. flosculus across sites remained persistent regardless of inter-annual changes in mean settlement rates. Within seasons, the spatial patterns of settlement of N. flosculus were persistent over scales of at least 15 days, whereas for chthamaloids a spatially ordered pattern of settlement in 2006 disappeared in subsequent years. Together, these results suggest that spatially structured processes that drive larval transport, and which can vary from year to year, may have played a greater role in shaping settlement patterns of chthamaloids versus balanoids. Synoptic-scale SST variability (i.e. days) exhibited spatial structure that was highly persistent within all three seasons. Although high-frequency SST variability (i.e. hours) has been associated to onshore larval transport within the study region, its among-site patterns were not as persistent as the daily ones. Since neither synoptic-scale nor high-frequency processes shaping patterns of physical variability are sufficient to explain inter-annual variability in patterns of larval settlement, more complex physical-biological interactions must be examined. We suggest that inter-annual changes in the pattern of wind forcing relative to local topography, and the thermal structure that results from such interaction, might be related to whether the spatial structure of barnacle settlement is persistent or fluctuating within a given season. We discuss the limitations of inferences that can be made regarding transport processes from time series of larval settlement, and the insights that can be gained by focusing on the variability of spatial patterns rather than temporal changes at individual sites.

AB The suitability of plantation monocultures for the conservation of forest animals is an issue under continous debate. The adaptability of forest dwellers and the forest management regime seem to play key roles. In this study, I investigated the habitat selection of a generalist bird, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), within a pine (Pine spp.) monoculture, as well as the importance of the native habitat features within the pine matrix for the species' conservation. I compared 52 plots with woodpecker presence against 121 plots where the species was absent, as well as 68 nest-trees against 90 random ones. Regression analyses were used to investigate the habitat attributes involved in the habitat selection. Although the great spotted woodpecker is considered a generalist forest dweller, it shows a marked habitat selection. Based on presence/absence records, the woodpecker prefers well-forested patches with high levels of tree diversity and with good coverage of a secondary species such as the strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo). To excavate their nests, woodpeckers select large trees in patches where other trees are also larger, rejecting patches with a high number of small trees. The most striking conclusion from this work is the preference shown for native trees, especially Portuguese oaks (Quercus faginea), as nest-trees. This is noteworthy because native trees are smaller and they are surrounded by smaller trees than pines. These findings support that woodpecker conservation benefits from an increase of habitat heterogeneity, particularly by the retention of native woodland patches within the plantation matrix.

AB The morphological versatility of the pharyngeal jaw of cichlid fishes is assumed to represent a key factor facilitating their unparalleled trophic diversification and explosive radiation. It is generally believed that the functional design of an organism relates to its ecology, and thus, specializations to different diets are typically associated with distinct morphological designs, especially manifested in the cichlids' pharyngeal jaw apparatus. Thereby, the lower pharyngeal jaw (LPJ) incorporates some of the most predictive features for distinct diet-related morphotypes. Thus, considering that piscivorous cichlids experience an ontogenetic dietary shift from typically various kinds of invertebrates to fish, concomitant morphological changes in the LPJ are expected. Using Lepidiolamprologus elongatus, a top predator in the shallow rocky habitat of Lake Tanganyika, as model, and applying geometric and traditional morphometric techniques, we demonstrate an allometric change in ontogenetic LPJ shape development coinciding with the completion of the dietary shift toward piscivory. The piscivorous LPJ morphotype is initiated in juvenile fish by increasing elongation and narrowing of the LPJ and-when the fish reach a size of 80-90 mm standard length-further refined by the elongation of the posterior muscular processes, which serve as insertion for the fourth musculus levator externus. The enlarged muscular processes of the fully mature piscivorous morphotype provide for the construction of a powerful lever system, which allows the large individuals to process large prey fish and rely on exclusive piscivory.

AB There are numerous reports of spiders that have become established outside of their native ranges, but few studies examine their impact on native spiders. We examined the effect of the European hammock spider Linyphia triangularis (Araneae, Linyphiidae) on the native bowl-and-doily spider Frontinella communis (Araneae, Linyphiidae) in Acadia National Park, Maine, USA. First, we added L. triangularis to established plots of F. communis. Significantly more F. communis abandoned their webs when L. triangularis were added compared to control plots. Second, we tested whether F. communis were deterred from building webs in areas where L. triangularis was established. Significantly fewer F. communis built webs on plots with L. triangularis than on control plots. In both experiments, L. triangularis sometimes took over webs of F. communis or incorporated F. communis webs into their own webs, but F. communis never took over or incorporated L. triangularis webs. Competition between L. triangularis and F. communis for both webs and web sites may contribute to the decline of F. communis.

AB This study examines the impact of the exotic nitrogen-fixing legume Melilotus officinalis (L.) Lam. on native and exotic species cover in two Great Plains ecosystems in Badlands National Park, South Dakota. Melilotus is still widely planted and its effects on native ecosystems are not well studied. Melilotus could have direct effects on native plants, such as through competition or facilitation. Alternatively, Melilotus may have indirect effects on natives, e. g., by favoring exotic species which in turn have a negative effect on native species. This study examined these interactions across a 4-year period in two contrasting vegetation types: Badlands sparse vegetation and western wheatgrass (Pascopyrum smithii) mixed-grass prairie. Structural equation models were used to analyze the pathways through which Melilotus, native species, and other exotic species interact over a series of 2-year time steps. Melilotus can affect native and exotic species both in the current year and in the years after its death (a lag effect). A lag effect is possible because the death of a Melilotus plant can leave an open, potentially nitrogen-enriched site on the landscape. The results showed that the relationship between Melilotus and native and exotic species varied depending on the habitat and the year. In Badlands sparse vegetation, there was a consistent, strong, and positive relationship between Melilotus cover and native and exotic species cover suggesting that Melilotus is acting as a nurse plant and facilitating the growth of other species. In contrast, in western wheatgrass prairie, Melilotus was acting as a weak competitor and had no consistent effect on other species. In both habitats, there was little evidence for a direct lag effect of Melilotus on other species. Together, these results suggest both facilitative and competitive roles for Melilotus, depending on the vegetation type it invades.

AB The impacts of invasive alien plants (IAP) and their subsequent clearing by the Working for Water Programme (WfW) on (a) overstorey (woody plant) vegetation structure, (b) invasion intensity (overstorey aerial cover of woody alien plants) and (c) ground cover, in a temperate to subtropical riparian ecosystem were studied in 1996/7 and again in 2005, in order to provide a longer-term perspective on the effectiveness of WfW clearing. Forty 1000 in 2 plots were surveyed and resurveyed, comparing between (a) higher altitude Grassland and lower altitude Savanna, (b) high (> 50% invasion intensity) versus low (< 50% invasion intensity) alien invasion sites, and (c) WfW cleared versus uncleared sites (the three 'treatments'). Pre-clearing estimates from cut stumps in 1996/7 indicated high alien invasion intensities of 72 +/- 8% in Grassland and 69 +/- 11% in Savanna. From 1996/7 to 2005 there was a large decrease in aerial cover of alien trees of > 5 m and to a lesser extent 2-5 m in height, and a large increase in alien plants of < 2 m. Hence WRV was initially successful, with the original tall Eucalyptus grandis tree layer largely removed. However, total invasion intensity remained unchanged over the first decade (30.4 +/- 4.6% in 1996/7, 31.9 +/- 3.2% in 2005). From 1996/7 to 2005, grass and herbaceous cover decreased, while bare soil and litter increased, indicating reduced surface stability. This was in response to (a) the major flood event of February 2000, (b) the effects of IAP invasions and (c) WfW clearing. Total ground vegetation cover was negatively related to alien aerial cover in both biome reaches in 1996/7 and 2005. By 2005, there were no longer any differences in the aerial cover of woody alien plants in response to the original 1996/7 invasion intensity or clearing 'treatments', and hence progressive homogenization of LAP cover. Aerial cover of woody indigenous plants also responded negatively to increasing alien aerial cover in 1996/7 and 2005 in both Savanna and Grassland. In conclusion, the nature of the IAP problem has changed from dealing largely with relatively few large E. grandis trees in the mid-90s, to the present large Suite of invasive species with numerous smaller individuals. This has implications for the time needed for clearing. This is one of few studies to have assessed the initial and longer-term (1995-2005) effectiveness of WfW clearing operations. It shows that improved IAP clearing protocols are needed. More follow-up treatments are recommended to 'capture' alien resprouts and new seedlings before they establish and reproduce. Secondly, integrating clearing with restoration of the tall indigenous riparian canopy tree species in heavily invaded sites would help to shade out many alien recruits. (C) 2008 SAAB.

AB The blood-feeding juvenile stages of gnathiid isopods are important ectoparasites of marine fishes on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and are a major component of the diet of cleaner fishes. We report here that these gnathiids have undergone evolutionary diversification, both geographically and temporally (into diurnally and nocturnally active taxa), which has been accompanied by changes in their morphology and behaviour. To perform this analysis, we sequenced a portion of the nuclear ribosomal ITS2 for 47 gnathiids collected from 29 host fishes of 11 species at three locales spanning 2000 km on the GBR. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses both revealed four major clades. There was some degree of geographical structuring in these clades, but there was no evidence supporting host fish specialization, as gnathiids collected from the skin of different teleost taxa did not resolve into distinct clades. The topology of the phylogeny also implied some structuring that was dependent upon collection time (day or night), so we investigated whether there were also behavioural and morphological differences between taxa active at these different times. Nocturnal gnathiids had significantly longer antennules and larger eyes than diurnal gnathiids - two traits presumably adaptive for nocturnal activity. Behavioural tests showed that both nocturnal and diurnal gnathiids use olfaction and vision while foraging, but that nocturnal gnathiids used olfaction more often in dark conditions, and that they were able to perceive movement under extremely low levels of light. Diurnal gnathiids used vision more effectively when there was some ambient light. Our results thus suggest that both phenotypic and genotypic divergence in gnathiids may be influenced by natural selection acting on ecological traits, such as predator avoidance and host detection.

AB 1. We used structural equation models to discriminate direct and indirect effects of soil structure on the abundance of the antlion Myrmeleon crudelis, a neuropteran larva that digs conical pits in soil to capture small arthropods. We proposed that soil structure may modify antlion density indirectly through its influence on tree cover, which in turn directly alters the amount of sun and rain that can reach the forest floor and the amount of litter fall.
   2. The proportion of finer soils positively affected antlion density directly, but negatively tree cover. Tree cover positively affected both the amount of leaf litter and antlion density. Leaf litter negatively affected antlion density. The indirect effects of soils varied in strength and sign depending on whether trees are considered shelters against sun and rain, or leaf litter sources. The relative importance of these effects might also vary between years and seasons.
   3. Antlions may select patches of finer soils not only because they are easy substrates in which to build pits, but also for their indirect benefit as sites with low leaf litter, illustrating how indirect interactions may affect the local abundance of semi-sedentary insects.

AB Research on biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions has mainly focused on native species in natural ecosystems. However, much of the ozone and aerosol formation occurs in city atmospheres due to BVOC emissions by local urban vegetation. Plant composition of urban habitats is often dominated by non-native ornamental plant species, for which only limited data on BVOC emissions are available. To gain insight into the influence of ornamental vegetation on the urban atmospheric reactivity in Barcelona, Spain, we studied volatile isoprenoid emissions in 11 widespread ornamental tree species (three conifers and nine angiosperms). We found significant monoterpene emissions in all studied species, with normalized emission potentials (T = 30 degrees C, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) = 1000 mu mol.m(-2).s(-1)) ranging between 0.2 to 110 mu g.g(-1) (dry weight) h(-1). Depending on species, the emissions were dominated by alpha- and beta-pinene, myrcene, alpha- and beta-phellandrene, carene, limonene and eucalyptol. These data demonstrate that ornamental plants may significantly contribute to the BVOC load in urban atmospheres and also underscore the importance of broadleaf angiosperms as significant monoterpene emitters.

AB 1. In order to coexist in sympatry, subordinate species must somehow obtain resources that dominant taxa may generally control. This study examines the response of an ant community to fine-scale variation in resource distribution, as a mechanism enabling resource acquisition by subordinates in the presence of dominant taxa. Food (6 g) was portioned as one, eight, or 64 items in a 0.4-m(2) area, centred on nests of Monomorium sydneyense Forel, considered the most dominant ant in the area. This ant is a newly established exotic species in our study site of Tauranga, New Zealand.
   2. As the number of food items increased, a significant increase in the number of species utilising the food was observed, associated with an increase in the non-utilised proportion of food items.
   3. The changing occupation rates of food items by M. sydneyense and three other species were modelled against soil surface temperature and the varying dispersion rates of the food resource. Significant main effects of food density, site, species, and temperature were observed on the probability of food being occupied by a species. However, there were also significant interaction effects, making it impossible to interpret the main effects in isolation. Monomorium sydneyense dominated a smaller proportion of resources in trials with increased resource distribution and cooler temperatures, allowing more species to access resources.
   4. There was considerable variation between species in their responses to variation in temperature and food distribution. Although most species were able to respond to increasing resource dispersion, species that were in low abundance apparently could not. However, even species that could respond to increasing resource dispersion were limited in the number of resources they could secure.

AB Mesopodopsis africana is an abundant zooplankton species in the currently drought stricken St. Lucia Estuary. The estuary is freshwater-starved, partly because its connection with the large Mfolozi catchment has been discontinued. This is due to the extremely high silt load carried by its waters. A series of in vitro experiments were conducted in May, July, August and December 2006, in order to determine the effect of silt loading on the feeding rate and mortality of M africana. Mysids were subjected to different sediment concentrations in controlled experiments for a 12-hour period. The turbidity regimes were generated by adding pre-weighed silt concentrations, ranging from 0.03 g/L to 13 g/L, to natural estuarine water. Results in all cases showed a major effect of high silt levels upon food availability, as water chlorophyll losses increased with increased silt concentration. Hindrance in the food collecting abilities appears to have a compounding influence as on two occasions, May and August, ingestion rates decreased with an increase in silt concentration. However, in July, mysid ingestion and clearance rates were higher under increased suspended silt concentrations. In such cases, mysids may be clearing more water under conditions of low food concentration, or alternatively, they may switch to feeding on metazoan prey. In the December experiment, there was no relationship between ingestion rate and silt concentration, possibly because food supplies were sufficient to sustain constant ingestion rates or because mysids increased their clearance rates in the more turbid treatments to compensate for any negative effects of silt. Mysid health also declined, with the mean percentage of survivors decreasing consistently with an increase in silt concentration. Results indicate that the overall effect of increased silt load is negative, and subsequently, increased silt loading in the St. Lucia estuary is expected to have detrimental effects on communities of mysids within the estuary.

AB The fate of colloidal particles in Lake Brienz and its two main tributaries, the Aare and Lutschine Rivers, was studied over a period of more than a year. Lake colloid loads from the unmodified Lutschine fluctuated significantly across seasons. The highest loads are in summer due to glacier melting. Colloid loads from the Aare reflected the seasonal water use by upstream hydropower plants. A significant number of mineral particles, even outside the theoretical non-settling range, remain in suspension in the epilimnion of Lake Brienz in summer because of the mineralogical nature and shape of the particles and the high input loads. Only 1730 of the 16,800 tons of colloidal particles that entered the lake during the period from 1 June 2004 - 31 July 2005 were exported through the lake outlet. The remainder was presumably lost in the lake through coagulation-sedimentation processes. Coagulation properties of non-fractionated colloid samples in quiescent conditions were studied in the laboratory both in the absence and presence of different organic compounds representative of natural organic matter. Lake Brienz colloids coagulate slowly, as expected from particles (mainly phyllosilicates) bearing a net negative surface charge. Slightly higher coagulation rates were recorded in March and April during the spring algal bloom, which suggests that colloid coagulation is enhanced by carbohydrates. This effect was confirmed in laboratory experiments. However, the concentration of natural organic matter in Lake Brienz is so low that it is not having any significant effect on the fate of inorganic colloids.

TI How to survive as a pioneer species in the Antarctic benthos: minimum

AB Very few details exists concerning the dispersal traits of Antarctic species and dispersal distances in particular are mostly unknown. Especially the general low number of mesoplanktonic larvae has caught attention, leading to the formulation of Thorson's rule. From this concept, originally concerning only trophic aspects, sometimes a reduced dispersal distance is deduced. Using a generic simulation model we show that in a benthic habitat exposed to iceberg scouring, even short dispersal phases of few hours are sufficient for a pioneer species to persist. This is very surprising for a pioneer species which should be able to disperse widely and colonise distant disturbed areas which are free of superior competitors. Our model revealed that the reason for this is the non-linear dependence of the dispersal distance on the disturbance regime and on species longevity. Thus, it is the combined effect of life history and disturbance traits which is important here: a sufficiently high disturbance frequency due to iceberg scouring and a long individual lifetime due to the low temperature decrease minimum dispersal distances required for persistence and thus coexistence and present an additional explanation for the relative rarity of planktonic larvae.

AB Acacia is the second largest genus within the Leguminosae, with 1352 species identified. This genus is now known to be polyphyletic and the international scientific community will presumably split Acacia into five new genera. This review examines the diversity of biological nitrogen fixation symbiosis within Acacia as a single genus. Due to its global importance, an extensive body of scientific literature is available on Acacia, particularly in the area of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Most significantly, Acacia can be separated into nodulating and non-nodulating species. The nodulating Acacia species are symbiotically compatible with a wide range of soil rhizobia. Four different genera of rhizobia are known to nodulate with species of Acacia, while most other legumes nodulate with only a single species of rhizobia. The diversity of symbiotic interactions in Acacia also corresponds to a wide range of flavonoid inducers produced by the different species. Corresponding to the chemical inducers produced by the host Acacia, the nodulating rhizobia also produce a wide range of lipo-chito-oligosaccharide inducers, called Nod factors. The symbiotic diversity we describe for Acacia helps to explain the adaptability of different species within this genus to a wide. range of extreme environments.

AB We investigated factors influencing the hatching of the fairy shrimp, Branchinella thailandensis in relation to brood order, and also responses of cysts to wet and dry periods. Male-female pairs of B. thailandensis were cultured under static conditions at room temperature and fed ad libitum micro-algae (Chlorella sp.). Deposited cysts of the first, sixth and eleventh broods were monitored for cyst hatching under wet and dry conditions. Cyst hatching was scored daily for 5 days after incubation. Freshly laid cysts, immediately incubated, did not hatch in any of the experimental conditions (wet/dry). On the contrary, undried cysts immersed in their parental medium for 4 weeks showed the highest hatching in all brood treatments (76.67, 94.67, and 99.33% of the first, sixth, and eleventh broods, respectively). The cysts of the first brood hatched less successfully than did those of the sixth and eleventh broods. Cyst hatching mostly took place within 24 hours after incubation. The present study shows that a wet period has a strong influence on the cyst hatching success of B. thailandensis. The cysts require a period of retention in the parental medium for 2-4 weeks to complete their embryonic development before hatching. Hatching of the three representative broods showed a different pattern for each brood. The early broods required a longer wet period than did the late broods. In contrast to the hatching behaviour of many other species, drying is not absolutely essential for cyst hatching of this species.

AB Pit-building antlions are predators with a unique predation strategy, namely using pitfall traps constructed in loose sand to catch prey. Here, prey escape-time in the field is measured by introducing ants into one of four different treatment arenas. The first treatment lacks pits and antlions, the second includes 10 antlions that did not build pits, the third comprises eight artificially constructed pits, and the fourth is a treatment of eight antlions in pits and two without pits. Their pits are of a similar size to those used in the third treatment. When antlions are present without constructing pits, they impede the dispersal of prey. The mean escape-time for one half of the released ants is twice as long with antlions present as without them. When pits are present, the time taken for one half of the released ants to escape the predator is more than 10 times as long as when pits are absent. Escape-time from artificial pits is three times that from nonpit building antlions. Pits hinder the escape of ants and therefore increase the amount of time that the prey is available for capture. In the area where the pits are occupied by antlions, escape-time is four times longer than in a treatment with similar sized artificial pits. Thus, it appears that not only a pit, but also the presence of antlions influences the capture success.

AB We evaluated three monitoring techniques to determine the spatial pattern and relative abundance of the bilby (Macrotis lagotis) in the Tanami Desert, Northern Territory. All the methods examined relied on the identification of animal sign ( foot imprints or diggings) to indicate the presence of a species. With fixed transects, a 10-km prepared tracking surface was monitored regularly using an all-terrain vehicle. With random plots, an unprepared tracking surface within a 200 x 300 m area was searched on foot for sign of the species. A helicopter was used in an aerial survey to identify bilby diggings from an altitude of 15 - 20 m while travelling at a speed of 30 - 40 knots along a predefined transect. The results for each method were stratified in relation to latitude and substrate to facilitate comparison of the efficacy of each technique. The fixed transects returned the least number of bilby records for most effort. The aerial transect technique resulted in few (< 4%) false negative records but a sizeable (42%) number of false positive records. It is suggested that the aerial survey technique combined with ground-truth survey plots would provide reliable information on the extent of occurrence and status of the bilby in the remote spinifex deserts of central Australia.

AB The benefits of marine protected areas (MPAs) to fish productivity remain debated, and comprehensive research projects have been suggested to assess MPA function. This study evaluated MPA performance in a developing country in the context of local needs. We compared density and size of the blackspot snapper, Lutjanus fulviflamma (Forsskal), in Mafia Island Marine Park (MIMP), Tanzania, with adjacent intensively fished areas (IFA) using underwater visual censuses (a total of 105, 50-m transects) as well as investigating the catches in the local fishery. The target species was over four times more numerous, its biomass six to ten times higher and individual sizes on an average 37% larger on reefs in MIMP compared to the IFA. Fish numbers and biomass were negatively correlated with fishing intensity and positively correlated with hard coral cover and structural complexity. This study supports predictions that MPAs can play a key role in the conservation of habitats and management of a fishery. It is suggested that for the purpose of management, it is possible to evaluate MPA performance with limited resources by focusing on key information. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The dimension, water content and germination of the seeds from 90 woody species in the lower subtropical forest were analyzed in this study. Out of 90 species, germination analysis was performed in 45 species (in which there were enough genninating individuals), and the effect of storage of seed and fruit on germination of seed was studied in 41 species (in which there were enough seeds and germinating individuals). Most of the species began to germinate within 60 d. Hypogeal species had longer dormancy than epigeal species. Dormancy of fleshy seeds and seeds in pulpy fruit was also longer than that of dry seeds. There were no significant differences in length of dormancy (LD, days from sowing to germination) between fleshy seeds ripening in summer and those ripening in winter and spring, and between big seeds and small seeds. Seeds in pulpy fruit or fleshy seeds had more germination than the dry seeds ( P < 0. 05), however, percentage germination was not significantly correlated with water content of fresh seeds. Water loss in the seeds could obviously affect percentage germination, especially during the early three days when the seeds were laid open in air in the laboratory. When water content of the seeds decreased to about 20% (fresh weight basis), percentage germination became very low, this happened when the seeds were laid open in air for 10 - 14 d. Percentage germination decreased with the length of storing in refrigerator ( (4 +/- 1) degreesC), but it was not markedly affected for one month's storage, with a decrease by 8.3% in comparison with the fresh seeds, and it was greatly affected by storing for more than three months, with values decreasing by 37 %, 63 %, and 81 % for three months', six months' and 12 months' storage respectively. Difference in percentage germination as well as in LD was not significant for most lots after different storing periods between big seeds and small seeds, between fruit storage and seed storage, and between seeds in pulpy fruits or fleshy seeds and dry seeds.

AB Phenological patterns of dry tropical forests have been related to environmental factors, mainly rainfall and insolation, and to plant endogenous rhythms inherent to trees as. large, perennial plants. Superimposed to these environmental ('external hypothesis') and intrinsic ('endogenous hypothesis') explanations, there may be phylogenetic constraints contributing to shape phenology.
   The phenology of tree and shrub species with fleshy fruits in a Dry Chaco forest in Argentina was studied addressing these hypotheses and following two approaches, with the species average values taken as independent data points, and removing phylogenetic effects.
   The hypotheses addressed are largely complementary to one another. Strong environmental restrictions conditioned general flowering patterns with species endogenous characteristics acting secondarily. Phylogenetic patterns were also masked by climatic variables. When considering fruiting phenology, however, phylogeny, representing a set of species shared traits, predominated over environmental restrictions.

AB On sedimentary tidal flats near the island of Sylt (German Eight, North Sea) abundance and size distribution of periwinkles, Littorina littorea L., were studied in low intertidal and in shallow and deep subtidal mussel beds (Mytilus edulis L.). In low intertidal mussel beds, surveys revealed that high densities (1,369+/-571 m(-2)) of juvenile snails (113 mm) were positively correlated with strong barnacle epigrowth (Semibalanus balanoides L. and Balanus crenatus Bruguiere) on mussels. A subsequent field experiment showed that recruitment of L. littorea was restricted to the intertidal zone. Abundances of periwinkles (213+/-114 m(-2)) and barnacles abruptly decreased in the adjacent shallow subtidal zone, which served as a habitat for older snails (>13 mm). L. littorea was completely absent from disjunct deep (5 m) subtidal mussel beds. Snail abundance varied seasonally with maxima of >4,000 m(-2) in low intertidal mussel beds in October and minima in July, just before the onset of new recruitment. I suggest that the presence of cracks and crevices among the dense barnacle overgrowth in intertidal mussel beds favoured recruitment and survival of juvenile snails. Larger (older) specimens are assumed to actively migrate to the less favourable adjacent subtidal. Therefore, intertidal mussel beds are considered as nurseries for the population of L. littorea in the Wadden Sea.

Changes to vegetation communities in Kalahari rangelands have been expressed in terms of a state-and-transition model. However, there remain uncertainties as to the mechanisms and conditions for ecological change. In part, this is due to previous (inadequate) spatial and temporal scales of data collection. This paper describes the results of ongoing ecological studies in the Makoba ranches and analyses the contribution that fine-scale ground-based surveys and interpretation of Earth observation data can make to reducing uncertainties in state-and-transition models. This detailed case study provides a mechanism for evaluating the role of multi-source information for monitoring and modelling open savannas.

AB New leaf production in seasonal tropical forests may result from changes in water or light availability. In this study, the relationship between leaf flushing, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and rainfall was examined for understorey saplings in a moist tropical forest over one year. During the wet season, weeks with greater PAR were correlated with a greater proportion of saplings flushing new leaves during subsequent weeks in nine out of ten species. Rainfall was negatively correlated with subsequent leafing during the wet season for six of ten species. However, during the dry season, rainfall was positively correlated with leafing during the following weeks for six species, but the relationship was much weaker. PAR in the dry season was negatively correlated with flushing in eight species. These results support the hypothesis that under well-watered conditions, light limits leaf production, and peaks in insolation result in greater leaf production.

AB Three fairy shrimp species (freshwater Anostraca) (including three populations of Streptocephalus proboscideus) and four clam shrimp species (Spinicaudata), from different African arid and semi-arid regions, were studied under laboratory conditions with respect to their fecundity, the hatchability of their resting eggs, and culturing potential. Fecundity rate was significantly higher in the clam shrimps, but the longer life span of the anostracans resulted in total fecundity being not significantly different (P >0.05). Fecundity variables were not found to differ significantly (P >0.05) among three successive periods of the reproductive period for any of the species tested. The smaller mean egg size in spinicaudatans (182 +/- 40 mum), in comparison with the fairy shrimps (255 +/- 41 mum), might be explained in terms of size constraints rather than by a difference in ecological strategy. Egg size was furthermore significantly different (P <0.05) between all pairs of species (except between the clam shrimps Leptestheria aegyptiaca and Eocyzicus klunzingeri) and even between different populations of Streptocephalus proboscideus. The fact that part of the eggs produced are quiescent in E. klunzingeri (100 %); S. proboscideus (Sudan), S. proboscideus (from site SWA48; Namibia), and S. sudanicus (10-30 %); S. proboscideus (from site SWA 42; Namibia), and S. ovamboensis (0-5 %), is a major advantage for practical applications, since no elaborate diapause deactivating techniques are required to start the next active generation.

AB Progress in any area of biology has generally required work on a variety of organisms. This is true because particular species often have characteristics that make them especially useful for addressing specific questions. Recent progress in studying the evolutionary biology of senescence has been made through the use of new species, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, because of the ease of working with them in the laboratory and because investigators have used theories for the evolution of aging as a basis for discovering the underlying mechanisms.
   I describe ways of finding new model systems for studying the evolutionary mechanisms of aging by combining the predictions of theory with existing information about the natural history of organisms that are well-suited to laboratory studies. Properties that make organisms favorable for laboratory studies include having a short generation time, high fecundity, small body size, and being easily cultured in a laboratory environment. It is also desirable to begin with natural populations that differ in their rate of aging. I present three scenarios and four groups of organisms which fulfill these requirements. The first two scenarios apply to well-documented differences in age/size specific predation among populations of guppies and microcrustacea. The third is differences among populations of fairy shrimp (Anostraca) in habitat permanence. In all cases, there is an environmental factor that is likely to select for changes in the life history, including aging, plus a target organism which is well-suited for laboratory studies of aging.

AB Context Spatial planning system needs the support of approaches toward achieving sustainability, with sustainable landscape pattern (SLP) for one potential spatial approach. However, the scientific definition of SLP has not been clarified in previous studies, and the support of SLP for spatial planning is also few summarized. Objectives The scientific definition and conceptual connotation of SLP were proposed, and its application status and development directions of theory and practice in spatial planning were further summarized. Methods We systematically reviewed the literature on landscape sustainability, urban growth boundary, ecological network, green infrastructure, ecological security pattern, ecological red line and others close to SLP, and qualitatively summarized the key theoretical and practical support of SLP for spatial planning. Results SLP is defined as a certain combination of composition and configuration of landscape elements that enables social-ecological processes to sustainably provide stable ecosystem services for promoting human well-being in a particular region. SLP effectively supports spatial planning to determine planning targets, analyze spatial patterns, and compare and select schemes by assessing target landscape elements, identifying key spatial areas, and simulating future development scenarios. It is proposed that frontier concepts (i.e. spatial resilience, metacoupling framework and landscape multifunctionality) provide new research perspectives for SLP, and that SLP can also be applied to ecological restoration, urban agglomeration coordinated development, and nature-based solution in the future. Conclusions Clarifying the scientific connotation of SLP can provide theoretical and methodological support for spatial planning practice and also a spatial approach for sustainable development.

AB Seabirds, with approximately 1 billion specimens, are the main exchangers of nutrients between Terrestial and Marine Systems and they have become an emerging interest group because of their effects on the planet's ecosystem. This review paper aims to highlight the impact of seabird droppings at different trophic levels, their occurrence, ecological risks and effects on soil, water, atmosphere and biota at global and local level to try to understand the ecological and climatic changes associated with the activities of these birds. Seabirds they have a very marked influence on the ecosystems where they form their colonies since, in addition to their function as predators, alongside with their depositions, they condition the primary producers and, consequently, the rest of the food chain. Their excrements contain large amounts of N, P and trace elements, most of which are bioavailable. In this study, besides bringing together the different works on nutrients and trace elements in excrements and differentiating some terms referring to these excrements, a brief historical overview of their importance for agriculture is made. In addition, the impacts produced by these birds on the ecosystem are also analysed according to two levels, at a global and local level. At each of these levels, a current state of the effects on the different compartments of the ecosystems is made, from the biota to the soils, the water or the atmosphere. This review supports the idea that more studies are needed both at the atmospheric level and in the terrestrial or marine environment for a better understanding of the changes these birds generate.

AB Resilience-informed water quality management embraces the growing environmental challenges and provides greater accuracy by unpacking the systems' characteristics in response to failure conditions in order to identify more effective opportunities for intervention. Assessing the resilience of water quality requires complex analysis of influential parameters which can be challenging, time consuming and costly to compute. It may also require building detailed conceptual and/or physically process-based models that are difficult to build, calibrate and validate. This study utilises Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to develop a novel application to predict water quality resilience to simplify resilience evaluation. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process method is used to rank water basins based on their level of resilience and to identify the ones that demand prompt restoration strategies. The commonly used 'magnitude * duration of being in failure state' quantification method has been used to formulate and evaluate resilience. A 17-years long water quality dataset from the 22 water basins in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, was used to train and test the ANN model. The overall agreement between the measured and simulated WQI resilience values is satisfactory and hence, can be used by planners and decision makers for improved water management. Moreover, comparative analyses show similarities and differences between the 'level of criticalities reported in each zone by Environment Agency of the state of Sao Paulo (CETESB) and by the resilience model in this study.

AB Plant functional traits provide a valuable tool to improve our understanding of ecological processes at a range of scales. Previous handbooks on plant functional traits have highlighted the importance of standardising measurements of traits to improve our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes. In open ecosystems (i.e. grasslands, savannas, open woodlands and shrublands), traits related to disturbance (e.g. herbivory, drought, and fire) play a central role in explaining species performance and distributions and are the focus of this handbook. We provide brief descriptions of 34 traits and list important environmental filters and their relevance, provide detailed sampling methodologies and outline potential pitfalls for each trait. We have grouped traits according to plant functional type (grasses, forbs and woody plants) and, because demographic stages may experience different selective pressures, we have separated traits according to the different plant life stages (seedlings saplings and adults). We have attempted to not include traits that have been covered in previous handbooks except for where updates or additional information was considered beneficial.

AB There is a long history of crayfish introductions in Europe and numbers keep increasing. In Hungary, spiny-cheek crayfish Faxonius limosus, signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii, marbled crayfish P. virginalis and Mexican dwarf crayfish Cambarellus patzcuarensis have become established. Here we report on monitoring at two localities with novel crayfish assemblages closely linked to releases associated with the pet trade. Florida crayfish Procambarus alleni were recorded from the Gombas brook near Vac living in syntopy with the established spiny-cheek crayfish. Dozens of Florida crayfish individuals including egg-carrying females have been detected. The short lifespan of this species and its documented presence including two overwintering in at least two years suggests possible establishment. However, the lack of juvenile records calls for further monitoring as long-term propagule pressure cannot be ruled out. We also identified a single marbled crayfish in the Danube floodplain at the end of the monitoring campaign. The second locality (Varosliget thermal pond in Budapest) harbours an even more diverse crayfish assemblage. Here, we identified numerous red swamp and marbled crayfish in syntopy with dozens of monitored redclaws Cherax quadricarinatus and seven individuals of New Guinean Cherax species - C. holthuisi, C. snowden, as well as two scientifically undescribed species. These findings clearly indicate the attractiveness of urban and, especially, thermal waters for the release of even expensive aquatic pets and highlight the hitherto poorly known biodiversity of New Guinean crayfish species.

AB Dispersal of benthic species in the sea is mediated primarily through small, vulnerable larvae that must survive minutes to months as members of the plankton community while being transported by strong, dynamic currents. As climate change alters ocean conditions, the dispersal of these larvae will be affected, with pervasive ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review the impacts of oceanic changes on larval transport, physiology, and behavior. We then discuss the implications for population connectivity and recruitment and evaluate life history strategies that will affect susceptibility to the effects of climate change on their dispersal patterns, with implications for understanding selective regimes in a future ocean. We find that physical oceanographic changes will impact dispersal by transporting larvae in different directions or inhibiting their movements while changing environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and turbidity, will affect the survival of larvae and alter their behavior. Reduced dispersal distance may make local adaptation more likely in well-connected populations with high genetic variation while reduced dispersal success will lower recruitment with implications for fishery stocks. Increased dispersal may spur adaptation by increasing genetic diversity among previously disconnected populations as well as increasing the likelihood of range expansions. We hypothesize that species with planktotrophic (feeding), calcifying, or weakly swimming larvae with specialized adult habitats will be most affected by climate change. We also propose that the adaptive value of retentive larval behaviors may decrease where transport trajectories follow changing climate envelopes and increase where transport trajectories drive larvae toward increasingly unsuitable conditions. Our holistic framework, combined with knowledge of regional ocean conditions and larval traits, can be used to produce powerful predictions of expected impacts on larval dispersal as well as the consequences for connectivity, range expansion, or recruitment. Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies take a holistic view of dispersal incorporating biological and oceanographic impacts of climate change rather than solely focusing on oceanography or physiology. Genetic and paleontological techniques can be used to examine evolutionary impacts of altered dispersal in a future ocean, while museum collections and expedition records can inform modern-day range shifts.

AB Pangolins are threatened by overexploitation for local and international use. They are subject to an international commercial trade ban, and are also the focus of other interventions, including attempts at commercial captive breeding. The impact that the latter could have on the conservation of wild populations deserves consideration. We critically evaluate the feasibility of commercial captive breeding (or farming) of pangolins to displace wild collection and assess its potential conservation impact on pangolin conservation using a recently published framework developed for this purpose. Of the 17 conditions posited that need to be met for supply-side interventions to displace wild collection, we find that pangolins meet a maximum of only six conditions. This analysis suggests that pangolin farming will not displace wild collection in the near future. Major barriers include an inability to breed pangolins on a commercial scale and available data suggest that it would be unprofitable. The immediate impact of pangolin farming on conservation of the species' is unclear, but it is unlikely to benefit the conservation of wild populations. If commercial captive breeding were possible, it is uncertain how it would affect economic incentives for poaching, interactions between legal and illegal markets, stockpile policies, and how consumers and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners would respond. To understand better the potential overall impact of pangolin farming on wild populations there is a need for further research on these uncertainties. The framework used has utility in analysing the potential impact of wildlife farming but there remains a need for a more robust approach to evaluate potential impacts of supply-side interventions.

AB High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been used to identify the intestinal microbiota of many animal species, but that of marine invertebrate organisms remains largely unknown. There are only a few high-throughput sequencing studies on the intestinal microbiota of echinoderms (non-vertebrate Deuterostomes). Here we describe the intestinal microbiota of the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima, an echinoderm, well-known for its remarkable power of regeneration. We characterized the microbiota from the anterior descending intestine, the medial intestine (these two comprise the small intestine) and the posterior descending intestine (or large intestine), using pyrosequencing to sequence the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. We compared animals in their natural marine environment and in sea-water aquaria. A total of 8,172 OTU's were grouped in 10 bacterial phyla, 23 classes, 44 orders, 83 families, 127 genera and 1 group of unknown bacteria, present across the digestive tract of 10 specimens. The results showed that the anterior intestine is dominated by Proteobacteria (61%) and Bacteroidetes (22%), the medium intestine is similar but with lower Bacteroidetes (4%), and the posterior intestine was remarkably different, dominated by Firmicutes (48%) and Bacteroidetes (35%). The structure of the community changed in animals kept in aquaria, which had a general dominance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, regardless the intestinal segment. Our results evidence that in the natural sea environment, there is intestinal segment differentiation in the microbiota of H. glaberrima, which is lost in artificial conditions. This is relevant for physiological studies, such as mechanisms of digestive regeneration, which might be affected by the microbiota.

AB The effective sustainable management of introduced woody species requires understanding of the mechanisms which affect successful colonization in different forest habitats. We studied the spontaneous spread of the alien species Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) in the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest located in Poland. We analysed the impacts of seed source distance, presence of and distance from linear structures (public and forest roads) in the landscape, as well as microhabitat diversity, on the distribution of juvenile red oaks. We also studied the effects of types of acorn deposition sites (under shrubs, within clumps of Vaccinium myrtillus, in the open), and ways of seed burial (in moss wefts, in rodent corridors) by animal seed hoarders on seed germination and seedling growth. Field data were collected in six transect lines divided into 3300 plots (1 m(2) each). We found that Q. rubra efficiently colonizes Scots pine monoculture. Results of spatially explicit hierarchical generalized linear models showed that distance from acorn sources and occurrence of sparse shrub layers are the most important predictors of Q. rubra ecological success, defined as establishment of juvenile specimens. The presence of roads - potential migration corridors for avian and mammalian acorn consumers/dispersers - favoured non-random red oak spread. The "nurse effect" of native understory components on red oak seed germination and seedling growth was indicated by higher numbers of juvenile specimens as well as by higher proportions of germinated seeds noted under shrubs than in open areas (without shrubs) or within clumps of V. myrtillus. All red oaks developed from seeds buried in compact moss wefts or in spacious caches and corridors created by rodents in the moss layer, which indicated a positive "burial effect". We conclude that microhabitats make the Scots pine forests very suitable for Q. rubra invasion. Because of the wide distribution of numerous red oak stands in European temperate forests and the presence of numerous oak seed dispersers, the continuous colonization of widespread Scots pine monocultures by Q. rubra must be expected.

AB This study aimed to characterize the landscape sustainability in terms of landscape services (LS) provided in seven study areas with different characteristics located in Malopolska Province. The results of the qualitative categorization of LS using an assessment matrix were juxtaposed with the results of the quantitative assessment using indicators.
   As a result, study areas were divided into three groups regarding the bundle of provided LS. In multifunctional landscapes characterized by moderate flow of most LS and often high flow of cultural LS, there were: high landscape diversity, moderate connectivity of forest patches and moderate values of regulating LS. Mountainous landscape with a high flow of regulating LS was characterized by moderate landscape diversity, high connectivity of forest class and high values of erosion control and climate regulation. In agricultural landscapes with a high flow of agricultural production LS, there were: low landscape diversity and connectivity of forest patches, low values of erosion control and climate regulation, but high values of nutrient retention. Consequently, all analyzed landscapes may be described as sustainable in terms of LS, as every landscape provides a specific bundle of IS and a reasonable level of landscape diversity, connectivity and regulating LS.
   The qualitative categorization of LS provided the most complete perspective on LS provided in the study areas. Landscape metrics (LM) allow the significance of landscape diversity and connectivity to be emphasized, whereas the quantitative analysis of regulating IS allow to compare the results of quantitative assessment and qualitative categorization. These two types of indicators are especially useful when threshold values are required. Composition metrics (proportion of forest and arable land) allow a determination of landscapes dominated by regulating and provisioning LS, whereas configuration metrics (especially Shannon's Diversity Index and Contagion Index) allow landscapes with a high flow of cultural LS to be identified.

AB Marine population dynamics often depend on dispersal of larvae with infinitesimal odds of survival, creating selective pressure for larval behaviors that enhance transport to suitable habitats. One intriguing possibility is that larvae navigate using physical signals dominating their natal environments. We tested whether flow-induced larval behaviors vary with adults' physical environments, using congeneric snail larvae from the wavy continental shelf (Tritia trivittata) and from turbulent inlets (Tritia obsoleta). Turbulence and flow rotation (vorticity) induced both species to swim more energetically and descend more frequently. Accelerations, the strongest signal from waves, induced a dramatic response in T. trivittata but almost no response in competent T. obsoleta. Early stage T. obsoleta did react to accelerations, ruling out differences in sensory capacities. Larvae likely distinguished turbulent vortices from wave oscillations using statocysts. Statocysts' ability to sense acceleration would also enable detection of low-frequency sound from wind and waves. T. trivittata potentially hear and react to waves that provide a clear signal over the continental shelf, whereas T. obsoleta effectively "go deaf" to wave motions that are weak in inlets. Their contrasting responses to waves would cause these larvae to move in opposite directions in the water columns of their respective adult habitats. Simulations showed that the congeners' transport patterns would diverge over the shelf, potentially reinforcing the separate bio-geographic ranges of these otherwise similar species. Responses to turbulence could enhance settlement but are unlikely to aid large-scale navigation, whereas shelf species' responses to waves may aid retention over the shelf via Stokes drift.

AB Planktonic larvae are thought to be very susceptible to offshore advection in upwelling regimes, increasing dispersal and decreasing recruitment. However, larvae of 42 species of nearshore benthic crustaceans primarily developed on the inner shelf at locations both in (98.5%) and away (99.8%) from a perennial upwelling center in the upwelling season of a recruitment-limited region characterized by persistent, strong, upwelling. During three cross-shelf cruises conducted at each location, larvae of 21 species remained on the inner shelf at both sites by occurring beneath seaward-flowing surface currents while larvae of other species migrated to midshelf (four species) or offshore (14 species) by initially developing near the surface. Postlarvae apparently returned to shore either deep in landward-flowing upwelled water or near the surface where behavior allows them to be transported shoreward by internal waves, dial wind cycles or wind relaxation events. Thus, recruitment limitation in upwelling regimes does not appear to be caused by larval mortality from offshore transport, requiring new research directions to advance our understanding of population dynamics, structure and connectivity.

AB Accelerating pressures to accommodate rapidly increasing human populations in Australia pose major problems for insect conservation in urban and periurban regions from loss of natural habitats, alien species impacts and a variety of other causes. Several urban insects have become notable flagships for promoting wider conservation interests, leading to wider appreciation of environmental benefits of 'open spaces', urban forests, connectivity, 'green architecture' and other landscape features as relevant planning considerations in urban development. Their conservation, under a range of ecological contexts and threats, occurs in conjunction with energetic advocacy and educational programs that can emphasise the roles and diversity of Australia's unique insect fauna. Approaches to conserving native insects amidst urban intensification are discussed from selected case studies and citizen science projects that illustrate principles and complexities of single-species conservation, the values of indicator and diversity surrogate taxa and the implications of alien species on native insect diversity and its losses in urban environments. Important lessons and implications include the following: (1) recognition that taxonomic and ecological diversity of insects can be high in urban areas; (2) acknowledgment that insect diversity in urban environments is vulnerable to changes and a variety of threatening processes; (3) mitigation responses that involve reducing threats, preserving open spaces with natural vegetation, creating new open areas and promoting connectivity; (4) establishment of partnerships that enhance conservation values and prospects through individual people, local authorities and government agencies; and (5) increasing awareness of insects as integral components of ecological sustainability contributing to the wider values of urban environments.

AB Plant invasions are affected by many factors that must be favourable in order for invasions to occur. Factors can be grouped into three major categories: propagule pressure, biotic factors and abiotic characteristics; all may be moderated by human activity. However, studies examining all factors simultaneously are rare, and most are limited to a single factor. This hampers our understanding of the mechanisms driving invasions.
   In recent decades, an alien walnut (Juglans regia) has become invasive in Central Europe due to an increase in the populations of native dispersers, rooks (Corvus frugilegus) and political changes that have resulted in the abandonment of farmland. Here, we test whether increased propagule pressure resulting from the presence of seed-bearing walnuts in abandoned fields interacts with native forest seed-dispersing animals (biotic factors), landscape structure and management, and passive secondary dispersal by gravity (abiotic factors) to facilitate the further invasion of walnuts into forests.
   Seed-dispersing animals were observed visiting walnuts growing in abandoned fields and in human settlements. Walnuts and seed dispersers were surveyed in 102 forest patches. Forest characteristics were examined, and field experiments examining passive dispersal were conducted.
   Walnut seeds were carried into forests by native birds, jays (Garrulus glandarius). Jays harvested seeds from both wild walnuts growing in abandoned fields and walnuts planted in human settlements. The density of walnuts in forest patches was correlated with jay density. Forest occupancy by walnuts and walnut densities were correlated with the cover of abandoned fields and human settlements containing seed-bearing walnuts. Secondary seed dispersal also affected forest colonization. Walnut seeds hidden by native rooks in sloping, arable fields may be transported passively to forest edges.
   Synthesis. Our results show that this invasion is a multifaceted process in which human-related alterations to propagule pressure and biotic and abiotic factors have led to the spread of alien walnuts from human settlements and abandoned fields into forest ecosystems. Thus, politically related land use changes can create an invasion debt that causes unexpected linkages among the invasive plant, native dispersers, land management and topography that together can cause cascading changes in ecosystems.

AB A major challenge in community ecology is to understand how species respond to environmental changes. Previous studies have shown that the reorganization of interactions among co-occurring species can modulate their chances to adapt to novel environmental conditions. Moreover, empirical evidence has shown that these ecological dynamics typically facilitate the persistence of groups of species rather than entire communities. However, so far, we have no systematic methodology to identify those groups of species with the highest or lowest chances to adapt to new environments through a reorganization of their interactions. Yet, this could prove extremely valuable for developing new conservation strategies. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to estimate the effect of the reorganization of interactions on the adaptability of a group of species, within a community, to novel environmental conditions. We introduce the concept of the adaptation space of a group of species based on a feasibility analysis of a population dynamics model. We define the adaptation space of a group as the set of environmental conditions that can be made compatible with its persistence thorough the reorganization of interactions among species within the group. The larger the adaptation space of a group, the larger its likelihood to adapt to a novel environment. We show that the interactions in the community outside a group can act as structural constraints and be used to quantitatively compare the size of the adaptation space among different groups of species within a community. To test our theoretical framework, we perform a data analysis on several pairs of natural and artificially perturbed ecological communities. Overall, we find that the groups of species present in both control and perturbed communities are among the ones with the largest adaptation space. We believe that the results derived from our framework point out towards new directions to understand and estimate the adaptability of species to changing environments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The archaeological site of Klasies River is famous for the richness of its Middle Stone Age deposits, which offer the opportunity to document behaviors of early modern humans in Africa, as well as the paleo-environmental context of their occupation of the area during the late Pleistocene. The Main Site deposits (dated to ca. 115 to 55 ka) include botanical remains such as seeds and charcoal, which suggests that micro-plant particles like phytoliths could also have been deposited. Yet, no phytolith reference collection based on both modern plant and soil material has been produced for Klasies River, which complicates attempts of phytolith analysis of the site's deposits. One of our challenges was therefore to initiate a new and comprehensive phytolith reference collection of modern plants and soils occurring today in the vicinity of Klasies. For this purpose, we processed phytoliths from 24 modern plant specimens and 16 soil samples from different vegetation patches, all located today in a perimeter <5 km(2) around the Main Site. Our analyses indicate that ovate/orbicular and/or tabular polygonal phytoliths are the most recurrent and abundant morphotypes (>53% and up to 94%) produced in the leaf tissues of the Anacardiaceae, Asteraceae, Celastraceae, Ericaceae, Proteaceae, and Vitaceae species we studied, which are all eudicotyle-doneous taxa. Regarding the Cyperaceae, Restionaceae, and one of the Proteaceae species (Leucadendron spissifolium, a fynbos shrub), they each produce distinct phytolith assemblages: the Restionaceae leaf/culm assemblage is dominated by psilate and decorated globular/spheroid phytoliths (94%), whereas the Cyperaceae leaf/culm content and the Proteaceae leaf content are both dominated by silicified papillae (-like) bodies (54% and 63%, respectively). Besides, both globular/spheroid and papillae (-like) phytoliths account for 34% and 8% in the fynbos soil collected. Our analyses also show that ovate/orbicular and/or polygonal phytoliths occur in very small amounts (<2%) in modern soils of the area although they are numerous in most of the eudicotyledoneous leaf tissues we analyzed. Conversely, grass silica short cell phytoliths are found abundantly in the soils collected in close proximity to the Main Site (>66%), where grasses do however occur sparsely in the current vegetation.

AB Bacterial community associated with the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of aquaculture animals can play important roles in health, nutrition and disease. Compared with the GI tract of aquatic vertebrates such as fish, crustacean GI tract has unique structures and surfaces in different segments that may contribute to differences in the bacterial communities. This study examined the bacterial composition and distribution in different segments along the GI tract and in digesta of wild-caught adult Penaeus monodon using Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA), real-time quantitative PCR and clone libraries of 16S rRNA genes. Thirty-nine bacterial species in four phyla including Proteobacteria (, , epsilon, ), Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were represented in the GI tract of adult P.monodon. Proteobacteria comprised over 80% abundance of the bacterial community in most segments of the GI tract, except the middle intestine that was dominated by Firmicutes (similar to 50% abundance). The results also showed that bacterial communities showed significant differences along the GI tract segments, particularly the hindgut (p<.001) with Vibrio and Ferrimonas as dominant genera. The knowledge about the distribution of bacteria could be useful in understanding interaction of commensal bacteria and pathogens in different segments, and its potential influence on the effectiveness of probiotic bacteria in the GI tract of shrimp.

AB Conservation and sustainable management of wetlands requires participation of local stakeholders, including communities. The Bigodi Wetland is unusual because it is situated in a common property landscape but the local community has been running a successful community-based natural resource management programme (CBNRM) for the wetland for over a decade. Whilst external visitors to the wetland provide ecotourism revenues we sought to quantify community benefits through the use of wetland goods such as firewood, plant fibres, and the like, and costs associated with wild animals damaging farming activities. We interviewed 68 households living close to the wetland and valued their cash and non-cash incomes from farming and collection of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and water. The majority of households collected a wide variety of plant and fish resources and water from the wetland for household use and livestock. Overall, 53% of total household cash and non-cash income was from collected products, mostly the wetland, 28% from arable agriculture, 12% from livestock and 7% from employment and cash transfers. Female-headed households had lower incomes than male-headed ones, and with a greater reliance on NTFPs. Annual losses due to wildlife damage were estimated at 4.2% of total gross income. Most respondents felt that the wetland was important for their livelihoods, with more than 80% identifying health, education, craft materials and firewood as key benefits. Ninety-five percent felt that the wetland was in a good condition and that most residents observed the agreed CBNRMrules regarding use of the wetland. This study confirms the success of the locally run CBNRM processes underlying the significant role that the wetland plays in local livelihoods.

AB Wildlife population declines in Africa are widespread. However, species-specific population trends and dynamics in mammal community composition have rarely been described over long time periods. To describe population trends of 13 large herbivore species in Lake Manyara National Park (Tanzania) from 1959 to 2016 and to discover whether the herbivore community structure changed, we used general additive models and additional statistical methods to detect structural changes in the time series. Population dynamics were non-linear and population growth rates were not correlated with precipitation anomalies. Relatively steep population declines of three megaherbivores occurred during the 1980s and early 1990s, resulting in severe reductions in African elephant and buffalo populations and the local extinction of black rhinoceros. These declines coincided with reported peaks of illegal hunting of these species and expansion of agriculture at the periphery of the park. Population densities of elephant and buffalo seem to have stabilized in recent times, yet have not recovered to previous densities. In contrast, eight species (giraffe, zebra, waterbuck, wildebeest, warthog, impala, bushbuck, and baboon) have apparently fared well (similar or higher densities in most recent compared to first decade), despite having undergone substantial fluctuations over the past 58 yr. Population fluctuations in these species were likely caused by disease outbreaks, heavy bush encroachment, and reduced competition with buffalo. Possibly, declines in megaherbivore densities (mainly elephants) facilitated bush encroachment. Albeit grazers are still dominating in the herbivore community, the proportion of browsers is currently increasing, likely encouraged by dense vegetation in the shrub layer in large parts of the park. Overall, herbivore biomass density has declined by similar to 40% compared to the baseline estimate in the first decade of the time series. Our analyses and ancillary information provide evidence that this overall decline in the herbivore assemblage was triggered by human-induced reductions in megaherbivore population densities during the 1980s, either through excessive poaching, insularization of the park, or both. Likely, this had cascading and interacting effects on the vegetation structure and the herbivore assemblage. Thus, legacy effects of ineffective megaherbivore conservation efforts 30 yr ago are likely still affecting the ecology of this national park.

Using a deterministic model we explored the demographic outcome for one ("focal") species of its co-occurrence with a species that shares pollinators and competes for both pollinator visitation and abiotic resources. In this paper we showed how the overall impact can be positive or negative, depending on the balance between enhanced fertilization versus increased competition. Our model could predict the density of co-flowering species that will maximize the pollination rate of the focal species by attracting pollinators. Because that density will also give rise to competitive effects, a lower density of co-flowering species is required for optimizing the trade-off between enhanced fertilization and competition so as to give the maximum possible facilitation of reproduction in the focal species. Results were qualitatively different when we considered attractiveness of the co-flowering species, as opposed to its density, because attractiveness, unlike density, had no effect on competition for abiotic resources. Whereas unattractive neighbours would not bring in pollinators, very attractive neighbours would captivate pollinators, not sharing them with the focal species. Thus optimal benefit to the focal species came at intermediate levels of attractiveness in the co-flowering species. This intermediate level of attractiveness in co-flowering species simultaneously maximized pollination and overall facilitation of reproduction for the focal species. The likelihood of facilitation was predicted to decline with the selfing rate of the focal species, revealing an indirect cost for an inbreeding mating system. Whether a co-flowering species can be facilitative depends on the way pollinators respond to the plant density: only a Type III functional response for visitation rate can result in facilitation. Our model provided both a conceptual framework and precise quantitative measures for determining the impacts of a neighbouring co-flowering species on reproduction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Viewing the landscape as a spatialized social-ecological system allows identification of specific management challenges: integration of multiple views, multiple levels of organization, complex spatial-temporal patterns and uncertainties. Multi-criteria assessments (MCAs), which allow the comparison of alternative actions when multiple interests collide, are considered adequate to support landscape management. However, there is no consensus about how they should be applied and can integrate both multiple views and spatial dimension. We conducted an extensive quantitative and qualitative literature review targeting MCAs with a participatory and spatial approach. Our results suggest that (1) for sustainability assessments, participatory and spatial approaches endorse different rationales and hybrid methods are not so common; (2) within those methods, only scenario selection methods (as opposed to design methods) can integrate spatially-explicit, spatially-implicit, place specific, and overall values; and (3) current applications, which aggregate values ignoring their spatial and social distribution, do not coincide with the nature of landscape-management challenges. In addition, they give little importance to the structuration of information and to collective deliberation. We conclude that, in the absence of a good match between spatiality and participation, MCAs should, for now, be handled as insightful but distorted tools to explore and structure landscape-level management problems.

AB Patellogastropods, also known as true limpets, are distributed throughout the world and constitute key species in coastal ecosystems. Some limpet species achieve remarkable sizes, which in the most extreme cases can surpass 35 cm in shell length. In this review, we focus on giant limpets, which are defined as those with a maximum shell size surpassing 10 cm. According to the scientific literature, there are a total of 14 species across five genera that reach these larger sizes. Four of these species are threatened or in danger of extinction. Inhabiting the intertidal zones, limpets are frequently affected by anthropogenic impacts, namely collection by humans, pollution and habitat fragmentation. In the case of larger species, their conspicuous size has made them especially prone to human collection since prehistoric times. Size is not phylogeny-dependent among giant limpets, but is instead related to behavioural traits instead. Larger-sized species tend to be nonmigratory and territorial compared to those that are smaller. Collection by humans has been cited as the main cause behind the decline and/or extinction of giant limpet populations. Their conspicuously large size makes them the preferred target of human collection. Because they are protandric species, selectively eliminating larger specimens of a given population seriously compromises their viability and has led to local extinction events in some cases. Additionally, sustained collection over time may lead to microevolutionary responses that result in genetic changes. The growing presence of artificial structures in coastal ecosystems may cause population fragmentation and isolation, limiting the genetic flow and dispersion capacity of many limpet species. However, when they are necessitated, artificial structures could be managed to establish marine artificial microreserves and contribute to the conservation of giant limpet species that naturally settle on them.

AB Increasing diet breadth, a distinguishing characteristic of human foraging strategies at the end of the Pleistocene and in the early Holocene, is known to be a key development contributing to domestication and the spread of agriculture and pastoralism. Many scholars have focused on broad-spectrum foraging as a result of resource depression due to demographic stress or environmental degradation. However, these factors are absent in an increasing number of cases. New research in the Gobi Desert shows that a dramatic change in organizational strategies, including the intensified use of low-ranked foods from dune-field and wetland habitats, is closely correlated with the establishment of dispersed patches boasting high species diversity and a concentrated abundance of small prey. According to a global suite of paleoenvironmental and archaeological data, it appears that the fragmentation of more homogeneous grassland habitats coincided with the rise of broad-spectrum foraging and that these fragmented ecosystems were ideally suited to the unique set of foraging strategies employed by modern Homo sapiens. This study shows how broad-spectrum foraging, increased human population density, and the shift toward food production should be considered by-products of major environmental changes that created an ecological setting ideal for enhanced human reproduction.

AB Insect pollinators play a keystone role in terrestrial ecosystems. The parallel declines in plant and pollinator communities emphasizes that plant-pollinator interactions at the community level are highly relevant for biodiversity conservation. Here we examine relationships between plants and flower-visiting insects (anthophiles) at the scale of local floral patches. We conducted a visitation survey during the spring flowering season, a peak time for pollinator activity in the threatened Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. We tested floral density, diversity and composition as predictors of anthophile diversity (measured at the family/family group level) and visitation rates in multispecies stands of flowers. Although different anthophile groups responded differently, generally anthophile visitation rates and diversity were positively affected by floral density, diversity and community structure. Anthophiles were more abundant and diverse in areas with a high density and diversity of flowers. Plant community structure affected both the likelihood of occurrence and activity of anthophiles in the plots. The two mass flowering species examined here, Relhania fruticosa and Salvia chamaeleagnea, were strong determinants of anthophile activity, greatly increasing visitation rates, even though there was, on average, lower floral density and diversity. Our results show that anthophile activity is affected by highly localised, small-scale factors, namely the density and diversity of flowers and community structure. Important among these factors are patches of high quality habitat, high in floral abundance and diversity, both of which should be included in landscape-level plans for pollinator conservation, providing stepping stones for these insects in transformed landscapes.

AB The exponential increase of mobile telephony has led to a pronounced increase in electromagnetic fields in the environment that may affect pollinator communities and threaten pollination as a key ecosystem service. Previous studies conducted on model species under laboratory conditions have shown negative effects of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) on reproductive success, development, and navigation of insects. However, the potential effects that widespread mobile telecommunication antennas have on wild pollinator communities outside the laboratory microcosm are still unknown. Here we studied the effects of EMR from telecommunication antennas on key wild pollinator groups (wild bees, hoverflies, bee flies, remaining flies, beetles, butterflies, and wasps). We measured EMR at 4 distances (50, 100, 200 and 400 m) from 10 antennas (5 on Limnos Island and 5 on Lesvos Island, eastern Mediterranean, Greece), and correlated EMR values with insect abundance and richness (the latter only for wild bees and hoverflies). All pollinator groups except butterflies were affected by EMR. In both islands, beetle, wasp, and hoverfly abundance decreased with EMR, whereas the abundance of underground-nesting wild bees and bee flies unexpectedly increased with EMR. The effect of EMR on the abundance of remaining flies differed between islands. With respect to species richness, EMR only tended to have a negative effect on hoverflies in Limnos. As EMR affected the abundance of several insect guilds negatively, and changed the composition of wild pollinators in natural habitats, it might also have additional ecological and economic impacts on the maintenance of wild plant diversity, crop production and human welfare.

AB Infectious animal and plant diseases introduced through international trade in goods and services are a classic example of market externality. The potential harm they do is visited on people other than those engaged in their export or import, and is not taken into account in reaching export or import decisions. The use of economic instruments to internalize market externalities has been shown to yield substantial benefits in many areas of economic activity. By confronting decision-makers with the expected damage they cause, instruments of this kind have forced decision-makers to take the wider costs of their actions into account. This paper reviews the arguments for extending the range of instruments currently used to manage trade-related pest and pathogen risks, and assesses the options for deploying new instruments in the existing regulatory environment.

AB International case studies of protected area performance increasingly report that conservation and socio-economic outcomes are interdependent. Effective conservation requires support and cooperation from local governments and communities, which in turn requires that protected areas contribute to the economic well-being of the communities in which they are sited. Despite increasing recognition of their importance, robust studies that document the socio-economic impacts of protected areas are rare, especially in the developed world context. We proposed 3 potential pathways through which protected areas might benefit local communities in the developed world: the improved local housing value, local business stimulus, and increased local funding pathways. We examined these pathways by undertaking a statistical longitudinal analysis of 110 regional and rural communities covering an area of approximately 600,000 km(2) in southeastern Australia. We compared trends in 10 socio-economic indicators describing employment, income, housing, business development and local government revenue from 2000 to 2010. New protected areas acquisitions led to an increased number of new dwelling approvals and associated developer contributions, increased local business numbers, and increased local government revenue from user-pays services and grants. Longer-term effects of established protected areas included increased local council revenue from a variety of sources. Our findings provide support for each of our 3 proposed benefit pathways and contribute new insights into the cycling of benefits from protected areas through the economy over time. The business and legislative models in our study are typical of those operating in many other developed countries; thus, the benefit pathways reported in our study are likely to be generalizable. By identifying and communicating socio-economic benefits from terrestrial protected areas in a developed world context, our findings represent an important step in securing local support and ongoing high-level protection for key components of the world's biodiversity.

AB The Badain Jaran Desert is the second-largest desert with mobile dunes in China. Understanding its vegetation and soil characteristics and their relationships will support management and restoration of this ecosystem. To provide this knowledge, we selected eight areas for the study. We found 14 families, 28 genera, and 37 species of plants. The largest families were the Zygophyllaceae and Chenopodiaceae, accounting for 21.6 and 18.9 % of the total, respectively. The species richness (R (s)), Shannon-Wiener index, and dominance index (C (d)) differed significantly among the areas. Soils also differed in their water content and particle-size distribution. Total nitrogen, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, available potassium (AK), and electrical conductivity also differed significantly. However, soil organic matter, total potassium, AN, and pH did not differ. We found a significant correlation between AK and all diversity indexes except Pielou's evenness index (J (sw)). However, J (sw) was significantly positively correlated with pH. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed a relatively strong relationship between the vegetation and soil factors. The first RDA axis was associated with soil chemical properties; the second axis reflected changes in soil physical properties, but was not statistically significant. RDA suggested that AK was the only statistically significant factor in the study area. Our results describe the spatial variability of vegetation and soil properties, and show that the plant distribution was affected by soil factors, but not strongly. There was insufficient data available on precipitation, temperature, and geomorphology to permit an analysis of the potential effects of these factors; this data should be obtained in future research.

AB Large-scale efforts to restore oyster (Crassostrea virginica) habitat rely on the creation of high-relief hard substrate to improve the natural recruitment of larvae originating from existing oyster populations. Delivery of competent larvae to reefs is influenced by larval behavior, which respond to elevated levels of turbulence by a downward swimming behavior. To determine the geographic dispersal of populations of oyster larvae and how swimming behavior of larvae alters settlement patterns within Virginia (USA) coastal bays, this study utilized a depth-averaged Delft3D(C) hydrodynamic model coupled to a larval behavior model which incorporates an increased downward swimming speed in response to elevated turbulence. Turbulence and flow measurements over oyster reefs, oyster restoration sites, and bare seafloor were quantified using velocimeters. Hydrodynamic cues were input into the larval behavior model to determine how changes in swimming behavior due to turbulence influence settlement patterns. Results indicate that alterations in settlement velocity, specifically maintaining approximate neutral buoyancy until larvae are both mature and over an existing reef, substantially increased the probability of settling on suitable substrate. We also found that oyster reefs in low velocity regions have a higher probability of self-colonization, while reefs found in less sheltered higher velocity environments receive comparatively little of their own larvae and depend upon connectivity with other areas. Data from in situ larval settlement plates agree with model results and indicate that rates of settlement are similar to 1.5 to 3x greater over existing reefs composed of primarily vertically oriented oysters than over restoration reefs that are less topographically complex.

AB The wide-ranging behaviour of large carnivores and low densities at which they occur make direct population surveys of these species expensive and time consuming, and consequently indirect methods are widely used. We compared the accuracy, precision and cost of two methods commonly used to survey African lions, namely call-up surveys and track-count surveys. Surveys were performed in the 11,000 km(2) northern sector of Zambia's Kafue National Park (Kafue), an area for which no previous empirical lion population data are available. We estimate lion abundance of 200 individuals over 1 year of age in northern Kafue, at a density of 1.83 lions 100 km(-2). We used GPS collars and regular observations of lions to establish a reference population in an Intensive Study Site for comparison with survey results. Both survey methods produced accurate results, though precision was higher for call-up surveys, despite lower costs. Stratification of the study area did not improve the survey estimates. We recommend call-up surveys as the most appropriate method for surveying lions in Kafue and similar large protected areas, and suggest standardisation of survey equipment and protocols.

AB Many invasive alien plants alter soil-nutrient regimes of invaded ecosystems, affecting management outcomes. We assessed the effects of Eucalyptus camaldulensis invasions on physical and chemical properties of riparian soils in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Samples were collected from topsoil beneath the canopy of uninvaded and a gradient of invaded sites, namely, light, moderate and heavy over four seasons. We quantified soil moisture, temperature, litter depth and thickness, primary textural components, concentrations of soil macro (C, N, P and K) and micro (Mn, Zn, Cu and Fe) nutrients, and pH. Available N (NO3--N and NH4+-N) and P, as well as exchangeable Ca and Mg were also assessed. Soil pH levels were significantly lower in invaded than in uninvaded sites in all seasons. Soil moisture decreased consistently with invasion intensity. Concentrations of macro, micro and available nutrients did not vary significantly along the invasion gradient (p>0.05), but exchangeable cation content was significantly higher in uninvaded than in invaded sites, especially in winter and spring. Sites invaded by E. camaldulensis had higher litter build-up than non-invaded sites, but this appears to have little effect on soil-nutrient regimes. It appears that restoration following removal of invasive stands of E. camaldulensis will not require major interventions to return soil to pre-invasion conditions.

AB Questions: Humans are altering land use and impacting grazing intensities worldwide in alpine and sub-alpine grasslands, and functional diversity (FD) is a useful tool for predicting changes in these grassland communities and for improving biodiversity conservation. We asked: (1) how does functional richness (FRic) differ between the five predominant grassland types in Andorra (2) of these five grassland types, which plant communities are subject to high habitat filtering and which are driven primarily by competitive interactions; (3) are certain grassland communities more prone to degradation than others; and (4) how do grazing intensity and elevation influence variations in FD indices?
   Locations: Five types of sub-alpine and alpine grassland communities dominated by Festuca airoides, F.eskia, F.gautieri, F.paniculata and Nardus stricta in Andorra, at various elevations and with differing grazing intensities within a grassland type.
   Methods: We used multiple functional diversity indices and structural equation modelling (SEM) to determine how grazing intensity, elevation, species richness and productivity affect functional diversity in 222 vegetation transects.
   Results: Both plant diversity and functional richness were higher at higher grazing intensities, with the highest values found in the F.gautieri and F.paniculata grasslands and lowest in the Nardus stricta, F.airoides and F.eskia grasslands. Habitat filtering was observed in F.airoides grasslands. There was a general tendency for higher competitive interactions among plants at higher elevations and/or when species diversity increased. None of the five grassland communities considered appears disturbed, and all present similar functional attributes between dominant species.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight the fact that grazing is an integral part of Andorran mountain grasslands, acting as a structural component and providing higher functional richness in the most grazed communities.

AB Background: Agrobiodiversity is said to contribute to the sustainability of agricultural systems and food security. However, how this is achieved especially in smallholder farming systems in arid and semi-arid areas is rarely documented. In this study, we explored two contrasting regions in Benin to investigate how agroecological and socioeconomic contexts shape the diversity and utilization of edible plants in these regions.
   Methods: Data were collected through focus group discussions in 12 villages with four in Bassila (semi-arid Sudano-Guinean region) and eight in Boukoumbe (arid Sudanian region). Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 180 farmers (90 in each region). Species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index were estimated based on presence-absence data obtained from the focus group discussions using species accumulation curves.
   Results: Our results indicated that 115 species belonging to 48 families and 92 genera were used to address food security. Overall, wild species represent 61% of edible plants collected (60% in the semi-arid area and 54% in the arid area). About 25% of wild edible plants were under domestication. Edible species richness and diversity in the semi-arid area were significantly higher than in the arid area. However, farmers in the arid area have developed advanced resource-conserving practices compared to their counterparts in the semi-arid area where slash-and-burn cultivation is still ongoing, resulting in natural resources degradation and loss of biodiversity. There is no significant difference between the two areas for cultivated species richness. The interplay of socio-cultural attributes and agroecological conditions explains the diversity of food plants selected by communities.
   Conclusions: We conclude that if food security has to be addressed, the production and consumption policies must be re-oriented toward the recognition of the place of wild edible plants. For this to happen we suggest a number of policy and strategic decisions as well as research and development actions such as a thorough documentation of wild edible plants and their contribution to household diet, promotion of the "bringing into cultivation" practices, strengthening of livestock-crop integration.

AB Altered disturbance regimes and novel introductions are causing rapid shifts in the distribution of pines (Pinus L.). The functionally obligate symbiosis between pines and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi dictates that shifts in the distribution of one partner will affect the distribution of the other. In this review, we examine evidence for three hypotheses. (1) The loss of photosynthates through stress or tree mortality decreases the abundance of EM fungi and selects for less carbon-demanding species. (2) Pine introductions initiate establishment of novel EM fungal communities. (3) The extent of shifts in EM fungal abundance and community composition is mediated by surrounding vegetation. We find support for these hypotheses though changes in EM fungal abundance are variable and context-dependent. We posit that the consequences of shifts in EM fungal abundance and community composition extend beyond the individual tree to the landscape; these changes may affect population dynamics of both symbionts, ecosystem processes, and the conservation and evolution of fungi. In addition to conducting baseline surveys to assess the distribution of EM fungi, increasing our understanding of their function, morphology, propagation, and controls on host-specificity, and shifts would also assist in predicting the trajectory of ecosystems following the loss or gain of pine.

AB Myths and metaphors that occur in media frames play an important role in influencing public perceptions of an issue in times of war, political conflict, crisis and disaster. This, in turn, influences policy makers and (inter)national assistance and aid programmes. We investigated whether a metaphoric spill-over of frames used in connection with political events could explain the misrepresentation in the framing of wildlife conservation. Zimbabwe experienced a severe political conflict and economic downturn in 2000 when land reforms took place. We analyzed newspaper articles on Zimbabwe's wildlife conservation published between 1989 and 2010 from newspapers in Zimbabwe, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. We selected three issues about wildlife conservation in Zimbabwe in the local and international media, namely, the ivory ban, rhino protection, and Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources to investigate the spill-over effect. Our results show that in the 1990s, the majority of newspaper articles highlighted that wildlife conservation in Zimbabwe was largely successful. However, two major changes occurred after 2000 following the land reforms in Zimbabwe. First, the international media showed little interest in wildlife conservation in Zimbabwe as evidenced by a sharp decline in published articles and second, the frames changed in the international media with the "political unrest and land reform" blame frame becoming more dominant. This transition in reporting, frames, and low frame parity shows that there was a spill-over effect of political frames into wildlife conservation following Zimbabwe's land reforms in 2000. Metaphoric spill-over effects may thus create myths in the readership, in turn influencing policy-derived actions in a sector that is not or poorly related to the actual disaster.

AB Question: Renosterveld - a vegetation complex within the Fynbos Biome of South Africa - occurs in multiple structural states, including shrublands and various types of grasslands, lawns and herb-lands. Uncertainty exists over whether the present unpalatable shrubland state might have replaced a historical grassland state. Settled agriculture characterized by fixed burning cycles and overgrazing by livestock has been blamed for this putative change. However, the disappearance of native large herbivores has also been implicated. Understanding the drivers responsible for putative state changes is of importance for conservation of this critically endangered vegetation type.
   Location: Renosterveld shrublands and grasslands of the De Hoop Nature Reserve, Western Cape Province, South Africa.
   Methods: Three structural states of renosterveld (grazing lawn, tussock grassland and shrubland) were subjected to an experiment involving fire (burned/unburned) and herbivory (grazed/ungrazed by native mesoherbivores). Using animal exclosures and experimental burning, we measured the responses of the biomass of major plant functional types over 6 yrs to test whether switches between states occur in order to discern the drivers of these changes. The data were analysed using permutational MANOVA, Fisher's exact contingency tests and NMDS.
   Results: Herbivory (but not fire) had significant effects on lawn and tussock grassland biomass. Palatable shrubs proliferated in tussock grassland protected from herbivory. Unpalatable shrubs invaded burned lawn habitats exposed to herbivory. The vegetation composition of the shrubland state was affected by fire, herbivory and by the interaction between the two. Burned and grazed shrubland reverted to a dense canopy unpalatable state, while shrubland plots protected from grazing became palatable shrubland with a grass understorey. Palatable shrub species increased in the unburned and ungrazed shrubland plots, while the biomass of unpalatable shrubs declined in both the unburned grazed and exclosure plots.
   Conclusion: We found no evidence supporting the hypothesis that the disappearance of native large herbivores led to the conversion of tussock grassland into unpalatable shrubland. Instead, the removal of native browsers caused palatable shrubs to dominate tussock grassland areas. Unpalatable shrubland is retained through a combination of fire and herbivory, but how this state established and persisted historically remains undetermined. Temporary relief from large herbivore grazing after unpalatable shrubland has been burned is recommended if a more open grassland state is the desired target.

AB Many organisms exhibit parental optimism, producing more of the initial stages of offspring (e. g., eggs, embryos) than they can usually mature. For plants, parental optimism may be linked to the risk of seed production being limited by pollen receipt (pollen limitation). Here we elaborate a stochastic model of pollen limitation developed by Haig and Westoby (1988) and Burd (2008) and link it with published data on the magnitudes of prepollination costs versus postpollination costs of seed production in 80 plant species. We demonstrate that parental optimism should be expected when prepollination costs of seed production are small relative to postpollination costs. This was observed for most (62 of 80) of the plant taxa surveyed. Under parental optimism, plants overinvest in securing fertilized ovules, and consequently pollen limitation is predicted to be uncommon. However, for a sizable minority of plant species (18 of 80), prepollination costs approach or exceed postpollination costs. For these species, parental pessimism is instead optimal. Parents initiate fewer zygotes than they can usually mature, and pollen limitation is predicted to be severe. Because the relative magnitudes of prepollination and postpollination costs vary by more than 1,000-fold across plant taxa, parental outlook (optimism vs. pessimism) and levels of pollen limitation are predicted to vary widely.

AB The coexistence of shrubs and grasses has intrigued ecologists for the past century, and the conundrum of shrub-grass coexistence is at the core of debates on the functioning of semi-arid ecosystems. Here, we explored how the interplay of root competition and facilitation between life-forms at different life stages and demographic bottlenecks controls the long-term coexistence of multiple shrub and grass species in semi-arid Patagonian steppes.
   We used the spatially explicit and individual-based simulation model DINVEG that integrates the abundant information on the semi-arid Patagonian grass-shrub steppes to test six competing hypotheses on the mechanisms that govern the coexistence and relative abundances of several grass and shrub species. The structurally realistic model allows for a direct comparison of model outputs with a wide range of previously collected field data.
   We formulate three competing hypotheses on vertical root overlap between grasses and shrubs (no overlap, partial overlap, full overlap) that were crosses with two hypotheses on asymmetric shrub-grass facilitation (with and without). Each of the six variants of DINVEG were tested in their ability to generate dynamics in accordance with detailed field data, and we performed global sensitivity analyses to reveal demographic bottlenecks and controls.
   The hypothesis combining partial vertical root overlap with no facilitation was the most likely hypothesis given the data. It created demographic bottlenecks in recruitment and emergence that controlled grass and shrub abundances, respectively, and only this hypothesis generated a situation where grasses controlled shrub abundances (by limiting shrub recruitment), but where grass abundance was only weakly controlled by shrubs. Internal water dynamics generated reduced competition of shrubs to neighboured grasses that was sufficient to produce the observed ring of grasses around shrubs, and most of the parameterizations that approximated the observed species-specific abundances were able to reproduce the observed equilibrated spatial patterns of the mature community.
   Synthesis. We found a complex network of mechanisms that controlled growth-form coexistence and relative abundances in the Patagonian grass-shrub steppe where both, demographic bottlenecks and species interactions across life-forms, species and life stages were important. Our study points to alternative mechanisms of shrub-grass coexistence that may play an important role in dry grasslands and steppes where fire and herbivory are not key drivers and provide an avenue to detect them.

AB The objective of this study was to compare the protective role of bark against fire for three selected indigenous and five exotic species in the Western Cape, South Africa. Bark thickness, compass direction, stem diameter at breast height, bark moisture content and relative height of the sample in the stem were tested for their effect on heat insulation capacity of bark. Trees were felled and heating experiments were conducted at 400 A(0)C on fresh billets with intact bark. Time to heat the cambium to lethal 60 A(0)C was determined. Statistical analysis based on correlation, multi-model inference and multiple regression revealed no significant influence of compass direction and diameter at breast height. Heat resistance was mainly determined by bark thickness, to a lesser degree by moisture content. In several species relative height at the stem modulated the bark thickness effect. Higher up the stem bark of the same thickness offered less protection against heat. Significant species-specific differences in heat resistance were apparent in the results, which could not be explained by bark thickness thus indicating further need for research in scrutinising these factors, which might help to explain the relative higher fire tolerance of certain species compared to others.

AB The coupling of benthic and pelagic life stages of marine invertebrates is central to understanding their population dynamics and is influenced by hydrodynamic processes at multiple spatial scales. Here we provide a regional scale study that identifies mesoscale oceanographic features linked to the distribution of mussel larvae. We surveyed the distribution of mussel larvae along 12 shelf to slope transects within an alongshore distance of about 700 km along the Agulhas Bank off South Africa. Oceanographic and larval abundance data were collected simultaneously to determine how larval distribution is related to physical factors. Larval abundances were most closely correlated with temperature, salinity, beam attenuation (which indicates particle concentrations), and zonal (east west) water velocity. In most regions, the highest larval concentrations were observed within an average distance of 3.7 km from the coastline. Three mesoscale oceanographic mechanisms were identified that could explain larval distribution on separate parts of the coast. These were: a solitary meander whose leading end advects the Agulhas Current onto the continental shelf as an Agulhas Current Meander and whose lagging end advects the Agulhas Current offshore as a Natal Pulse, and the accumulation of larvae in a region with known internal wave activity. The Agulhas Current Meander swept large numbers of recently "spawned" larvae up to 30 km offshore, acting as a corridor for larval loss, or a population sink. Onshore retention seems, however, to be generally characteristic of this region, when the Agulhas Current is not on the continental shelf. This study highlights how mesoscale features are associated with larval density, transport, and coupling between the pelagic and benthic systems of the Agulhas Bank. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study provides the first concurrent measurements of nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from a tundra marsh and an upland tundra in maritime Antarctica over the summers of 2007/2008 and 2011/2012. Tundra N2O and CH4 fluxes showed large spatial variations depending on local hydrological regimes. N2O sinks generally occurred at waterlogged marsh sites (-3.0 to 27.5 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)) whereas relatively dry and mesic sites presented weak or strong N2O sources (2.2-41.6 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)). Upland tundra sites showed negligible N2O emissions due to low soil TN and NH4+-N contents. Dry/upland tundra sites showed weak to strong CH4 uptake (-4.5 to -85.8 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). The waterlogged sites showed weak to strong CH4 emissions (29.8 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1)-2.4 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Both tundra marsh and upland tundra experienced a large net CO2 uptake with the greatest mean CO2 uptake rate (-92.1 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) at dry marsh sites. Mean ecosystem respiration (ER) ranged between 82.5 +/- 13.2 and 174.9 +/- 25.7 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) at all the sites, and showed a strong exponential correlation (P < 0.001) with 0-10 cm soil temperature. Gross photosynthesis (P-g) was more than two times higher in tundra marsh than in upland tundra due to the difference of vegetation coverage. N2O flux showed a strong negative correlation (P < 0.01) with 0-10 cm soil temperature at the marsh sites, and significant or weak positive correlations with total daily radiation (TDR) and sunlight time (ST). No significant correlation was obtained between CH4 fluxes and environmental variables at tundra marsh and upland tundra sites. There was a significant negative correlation (P < 0.01) between NEE and 0-10 cm mean soil temperature, total daily radiation. Our results indicated that the lowering of water table significantly increased N2O emissions and CH4 consumption, but decreased C loss from the tundra marsh. In the future, the combination of climate warming and frequent precipitation will alter tundra hydrological conditions, and thus decrease N2O emission and CH4 consumption from maritime Antarctic tundra.

AB Carbon offset projects through forestation are employed within the emissions trading framework to store carbon. Yet, information about the potential of landscapes to stock carbon, essential to the design of offset projects, is often lacking. Here, based on data on vegetation carbon, climate and soil, we quantify the potential for carbon storage in woody vegetation across tropical Africa. The ability of offset projects to produce co-benefits for ecosystems and people is then quantified. When co-benefits such as biodiversity conservation are considered, the top-ranked sites are sometimes different to sites selected purely for their carbon-stocking potential, although they still possess up to 92% of the latter carbon-stocking potential. This work provides the first continental-scale assessment of which areas may provide the greatest direct and indirect benefits from carbon storage reforestation projects at the smallest costs and risks, providing crucial information for prioritization of investments in carbon storage projects.

AB Early life-stage dispersal influences recruitment and is of significance in explaining the distribution and connectivity of marine species. Motivations for quantifying dispersal range from biodiversity conservation to the design of marine reserves and the mitigation of species invasions. Here we compare estimates of real particle dispersion in a coastal marine environment with similar estimates provided by hydrodynamic modelling. We do so by using a system of magnetically attractive particles (MAPs) and a magnetic-collector array that provides measures of Lagrangian dispersion based on the time-integration of MAPs dispersing through the array. MAPs released as a point source in a coastal marine location dispersed through the collector array over a 5-7 d period. A virtual release and observed (real-time) environmental conditions were used in a high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to estimate the dispersal of virtual particles (VPs). The number of MAPs captured throughout the collector array and the number of VPs that passed through each corresponding model location were enumerated and compared. Although VP dispersal reflected several aspects of the observed MAP dispersal, the comparisons demonstrated model sensitivity to the small-scale (random-walk) particle diffusivity parameter (K-p). The one-dimensional dispersal kernel for the MAPs had an e-folding scale estimate in the range of 5.19-11.44 km, while those from the model simulations were comparable at 1.89-6.52 km, and also demonstrated sensitivity to K-p. Variations among comparisons are related to the value of K-p used in modelling and are postulated to be related to MAP losses from the water column and (or) shear dispersion acting on the MAPs; a process that is constrained in the model. Our demonstration indicates a promising new way of 1) quantitatively and empirically estimating the dispersal kernel in aquatic systems, and 2) quantitatively assessing and (or) improving regional hydrodynamic models.

AB We conducted single- and mixed-litter experiments in a hardwood forest in Long Island, New York, using leaf litter from phylogenetically paired native and invasive species. We selected long-established, abundant invasive species with wide-ranging distributions in the eastern United States that likely make substantial contributions to the litter pool of invaded areas. Overall, leaf litter from invasive species differed from native litter, though differences varied by phylogenetic grouping. Invasive litter had lower carbon:nitrogen ratios (30.9 +/- A 1.96 SE vs. 32.8 +/- A 1.36, P = 0.034) and invasive species lost 0.03 +/- A 0.007 g of nitrogen and had 23.4 +/- A 4.9 % of their starting mass remaining at the end of 1 year compared with a loss of 0.02 +/- A 0.003 g nitrogen and 31.1 +/- A 2.6 % mass remaining for native species. Mixing litter from two species did not alter decomposition rates when native species were mixed with other native species, or when invasive species were mixed with other invasive species. However, mixing litter of native and invasive species resulted in significantly less mass and nitrogen loss than was seen in unmixed invasive litter. Mixtures of native and invasive litter lost all but 47 +/- A 2.2 % of initial mass, compared to 37 +/- A 5.8 % for invasive litter and 50 +/- A 5.1 % for native litter. This non-additive effect of mixing native and invasive litter suggests that an additive model of metabolic characteristics may not suffice for predicting invasion impacts in a community context, particularly as invasion proceeds over time. Because the more rapid decomposition of invasive litter tends to slow to rates typical of native species when native and invasive litters are mixed together, there may be little impact of invasive species on nutrient cycling early in an invasion, when native leaf litter is abundant (providing litter deposition is the dominant control on nutrient cycling).

AB The prevalence of antibiotic resistance and the implicated mechanisms of resistance were evaluated in Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli, isolated from a total of 250 faecal samples of echinoderms collected from Azorean waters (Portugal). A total of 144 enterococci (120 Enterococcus faecium, 14 E. hirae, 8 E. faecalis, 2 E. gallinarum) and 10 E. coli were recovered. High percentages of resistance in enterococci were found for erythromycin, ampicillin, tetracyclin and ciprofloxacin. The erm(A) or erm(B), tet(M) and/or tet(L), vat(D), aac(6')-aph(2 '') and aph(3')-IIIa genes were found in isolates resistant to erythromycin, tetracycline, quinupristin/dalfopristin, high-level gentamicin and high-level kanamycin, respectively. Resistance in E. coli isolates was detected for streptomycin, amikacin, tetracycline and tobramycin. The aadA gene was found in streptomycin-resistant isolates and tet(A) + tet(B) genes in tetracycline-resistant isolates. The data recovered are essential to improve knowledge about the dissemination of resistant strains through marine ecosystems and the possible implications involved in transferring these resistances either to other animals or to humans.

AB Previous research has shown that the geographical distribution patterns of freshwater fishes and amphibians have been influenced by past climatic oscillations in China resulting from Pleistocene glacial activity. However, it remains unknown how these past changes have impacted the present-day distribution of Chinese freshwater crabs. This work describes the diversity and endemism of freshwater crabs belonging to Sinopotamon, a highly speciose genus endemic to China, and evaluates its distribution in terms of topography and past climatic fluctuations. Species diversity within Sinopotamon was found to be concentrated in an area from the northeastern edge of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to the Jiangnan Hills, and three areas of endemism were identified. Multiple regression analysis between current climatic variables and Sinopotamon diversity suggested that regional annual precipitation, minimum temperature in the coldest month, and annual temperature range significantly influenced species diversity and may explain the diversity patterns of Sinopotamon. A comparison of ecological niche models (ENMs) between current conditions and the last glacial maximum (LGM) showed that suitable habitat for Sinopotamon in China severely contracted during the LGM. The coincidence of ENMs and the areas of endemism indicated that southeast of the Daba Mountains, and central and southeastern China, are potential Pleistocene refuges for Sinopotamon. The presence of multiple Pleistocene refuges within the range of this genus could further promote inter- and intraspecific differentiations, and may have led to high Sinopotamon species diversity, a high endemism rate and widespread distribution.

AB Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) are currently being studied as green magnet resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. They are also used in huge quantities for environmental remediation and water treatment purposes, although very little is known on the consequences of such applications for organisms and ecosystems. In order to address these questions, we synthesised polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated IONP, characterised the particle dispersion in various media and investigated the consequences of an IONP exposure using an array of biochemical and biological assays. Several theoretical approaches complemented the measurements. In aqueous dispersion IONP had an average hydrodynamic diameter of 25 nm and were stable over six days in most test media, which could also be predicted by stability modelling. The particles were tested in concentrations of up to 100 mg Fe per L. The activity of the enzymes glutathione reductase and acetylcholine esterase was not affected, nor were proliferation, morphology or vitality of mammalian OLN-93 cells although exposure of the cells to 100 mg Fe per L increased the cellular iron content substantially. Only at this concentration, acute toxicity tests with the freshwater flea Daphnia magna revealed slightly, yet insignificantly increased mortality. Two fundamentally different bacterial assays, anaerobic activated sludge bacteria inhibition and a modified sediment contact test with Arthrobacter globiformis, both rendered results contrary to the other assays: at the lowest test concentration (1 mg Fe per L), IONP caused a pronounced inhibition whereas higher concentrations were not effective or even stimulating. Preliminary and prospective risk assessment was exemplified by comparing the application of IONP with gadolinium-based nanoparticles as MRI contrast agents. Predicted environmental concentrations were modelled in two different scenarios, showing that IONP could reduce the environmental exposure of toxic Gd-based particles by more than 50%. Application of the Swiss "Precautionary Matrix for Synthetic Nanomaterials" rendered a low precautionary need for using our IONP as MRI agents and a higher one when using them for remediation or water treatment. Since IONP and (considerably more reactive) zerovalent iron nanoparticles are being used in huge quantities for environmental remediation purposes, it has to be ascertained that these particles pose no risk to either human health or to the environment.

AB For 30years, regular aerial surveys in Zimbabwean protected areas were funded, designed and executed primarily to estimate elephant numbers. Other large herbivores were recorded, even though some species were not easily seen from the air in savannah woodlands. Population estimates for species other than elephant provided indices of abundance that could be used to determine temporal trends in population size. This study tests for significant trends in the abundance of large herbivores in Gonarezhou National Park, assuming that data from aerial sample surveys designed for elephant also provide accurate estimates of real trends in the populations of other herbivores. For each species, the exponential rate of population change was calculated using weighted regression, with the variance of this rate based on the sampling variances of the population estimates. Significant population trends were detected for eight species. Before the 1992 drought, elephant number was held approximately constant by frequent culls, but afterwards, it increased at a mean annual rate of 6.2% (confidence limits 4.0% and 8.6%). Elephants in cow herds increased at 7.3%, significantly faster than elephants in bull herds (-0.5%). Buffalo, eland, kudu, nyala, waterbuck, wildebeest and zebra all increased in number, after population declines during the drought.

AB Behavioral plasticity allows animals to maximize their fitness in a variety of environmental conditions. Trap-building predators represent case studies in such plasticity as the characteristics of their traps are dependent upon the substrate available. We investigated the effect of sand particle size on pit construction in antlions (Euroleon nostras), sand-dwelling insect larvae that build pitfall traps to capture prey. The pit construction behavior of the species comprises six stages. When antlions were exposed to different sand particle sizes, their behavior differed in terms of the occurrence and duration of particular stages and in the frequency of jerks produced during sand tossing. Jerk frequency was negatively correlated with sand particle size and also changed during pit construction. Furthermore, at larger particle sizes, individuals occasionally constructed irregular traps with a figure of eight shape, and they crossed the center of the truncated cone during deepening. In the largest substrate, particle size of antlions did not construct pits. Our results demonstrate that variation in traps under differing environmental conditions stems directly from behavioral plasticity in this species.

ID VEGETATION; GRASSES; WATER
AB Roads extend throughout savannas, yet few studies have quantified their effects on adjoining woody vegetation structure. Airborne LiDAR imagery collected over 168 experimental fire plots in the Kruger National Park, all bounded by graded firebreak roads, provided an opportunity to study if, and to what extent, roads influence woody vegetation structure under different rainfall, geologic and fire conditions. In 91.7% of the plots, woody canopy cover was higher on the edges of roads compared to areas farther away. The increase was most pronounced within 5 m of the road edge, but was detectable 10-15 m from the edge. On average, the area within 15 m from the road had approximately 6% and 2% higher woody vegetation cover than areas further than 15 m from the edge on wetter granitic and drier basaltic savanna landscapes, respectively. Increased edge effects on woody cover were observed even in fire exclusion plots, suggesting that non-fire processes, likely altered hydrological regimes, may be the underlying reason for woody encroachment. This study illustrates that roads cause selective woody plant thickening in savannas, even in areas without road edge management, and therefore careful consideration should be paid on how road edges are managed and when roads are planned.

AB Forest duikers (Cephalophinae) are important targets of the bushmeat trade but a reliable and efficient assessment of these shy animals is often regarded as problematic. Using a power analysis approach, we assessed the performance of three established methods (diurnal, nocturnal and indirect dung surveys) in producing density estimates for the blue and the Ogilby's duiker (Cephalophus monticola, Cephalophus ogilbyi ogilbyi) in a 16 km(2) section of primary forest, systematically sampled using line transects. Direct survey methods (diurnal and nocturnal) yielded density estimates between 8.3 and 6.8 (blue duiker) and 6.5 and 4.3 animals/ km(2) (Ogilby's). The coefficients of variation of density estimates implied a resolution of 44% density change detectable in diurnal surveys but only of 140% in nocturnal surveys. Density estimates derived from the dung survey were lower than those of direct surveys (1.5 animals/ km(2) and 1.4 animals/ km(2), respectively). Associated coefficients of variation imply a resolution of change in density estimates detectable for changes far larger than 100%. However, dung pile density was susceptible to variation in key parameters (decay and production rates) and difficulties in data acquisition lead us to reject the dung survey as a suitable method in our particular setting. Our results suggest that diurnal direct surveying from line transects can be reliable and effective even for shy forest ungulates under (some) hunting pressure.

AB The impacts of habitat fragmentation and reduced population sizes on ecological processes deserve more attention. In this study we examine pollination in rural and urban populations of Brunsvigia litoralis (Amaryllidaceae), an endangered endemic and a flagship species for plant conservation in South Africa. B. litoralis has flowers conforming to the bird-pollination syndrome, but the only flower visitor at the urban sites, the Greater Double-collared Sunbird (Cinnyris afra) (1.6 visits/flower/hour), is unable to access the nectar in the usual way due to a long perianth tube (38.8 mm) and resorts to robbing. Supplemental hand pollination was used to test for pollen limitation of seed set at the urban sites flowers were pollen-supplemented. Seed set in supplemented plants increased by more than an order of magnitude relative to controls. The longer-billed Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa) was observed as the sole pollinator of B. litoralis at the rural site where seed set was significantly higher. Although B. litoralis plants are long lived, the absence of pollinators in these urban fragments might place populations at an extinction risk. (C) 2011 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The tree-grass co-existence in savannas involves multiple and sometimes connected biogeophysical conditions. The savanna domain, its boundaries, and transitions (gradual or abrupt) to other vegetation types (i.e., grassland or forest) are fundamental for the management of ecosystems and for preserving the biodiversity in present conditions and in future changing scenarios. Here we investigate the savanna domain within grazers-fire and browsers-fire parameter planes through a simple ecohydrological model of tree-grass-soil water dynamics. Stability maps allow to identify savanna domains and to show the behavior of vegetation under increasing pressure of grazing and browsing. Stability maps shed light on the causes behind possible vegetation abrupt transitions (e.g., forest collapse and bush encroachment). An application to 15 African savannas sites is presented and discussed with the support of a local sensitivity analysis of the model's parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Life table characteristics of three species of fairy shrimps from Thailand, Streptocephalus sirindhornae, S. siamensis. and Branchinella thailandensis are reported, based on laboratory cultures at 24-26 degrees C. Comparative data on their growth and fecundity revealed that B. thailandensis had the largest size (male 26.2, female 27.8 mm) and the highest hatchability 87.67%. The shortest hatching time was found in B. thailandensis, it hatched within 3 days, while the other two species hatched within four days. Branchinella thailandensis showed more rapid growth than the other two species, and it reached maturity within 6.5 days. In contrast, S. sirindhornae had the highest fecundity, producing a mean of 35.3 broods and 17,865 eggs per individual female over its life time, whereas the other two species produced less than 8000 eggs. Life span was equal for both males and females in all three fairy shrimp species (P > 0.05). In this study, the fecundity data indicated that the number of eggs per brood recorded in the three species showed a positive correlation with the body length and age of females. The result indicated that the Thai fairy shrimps show several biological attributes making them suitable for aquaculture and other commercial purposes; B. thailandensis shows rapid growth and high hatching percentage which is suitable for mass production, while S. sirindhornae has high fecundity which is appropriate for the commercial production of eggs.

AB A common perception, particularly in South Africa, is that heavily and continuously grazed communal land leads to degradation and loss of plant diversity when compared to commercial rangeland farming or conservation areas. We focus on whether this applies to the Grassland Biome of South Africa and whether the opposite can occur, namely, an increase in plant species richness under heavy grazing. A study of a contrast between a communal area of the former Ciskei and a neighbouring nature reserve showed that intense utilization under communal use led to a significant increase in plant species richness. However, this increase was scale-dependent with the greatest significant difference occurring at sample plot scale (50 m(2)) but converging at the broader scale of the whole study site. Species that increased with heavy grazing included those from arid Karroid areas as well as some from more mesic grassland and savanna areas. The contribution of beta diversity to gamma diversity across the grazing contrast was relatively low which reflects the relatively high proportion of species shared between treatments. Total plant canopy cover declined sharply with heavy grazing. In terms of plant canopy cover, grazing favoured annual over perennial plants, prostrate over erect plants, and stoloniferous over tussock plant architecture. This pattern was not supported when expressed in terms of number of species belonging to these grazing response groups or traits.

AB In obligate ant-plant mutualisms, the asymmetric engagement of a single plant species with multiple ant species provides the opportunity for partners to vary in their behaviour. Variation in behaviour has implications for the interactions with third-party species such as herbivores. This study assessed the effect of obligate ant-mutualists (Crematogaster mimosae, Crematogaster nigriceps and Tetraponera penzigi) inhabiting the African ant-acacia (Acacia drepanolobium) on three mega-herbivore browsers: the Maasai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi), the reticulated giraffe (Giraffa c. reticulata) and the black rhino (Diceros bicornis). Giraffes are abundant and wide-ranging herbivores of the acacias, whereas black rhinos are localized and perennial herbivores of the acacias. Multiyear field studies comparing the ants' aggressive behaviour and browsing by mega-herbivores suggested differences between the tending abilities of the primary ant species inhabiting A. drepanolobium. Trees occupied by the aggressive ant species C. mimosae had significantly less browsing by giraffes and black rhino than trees occupied by other ant species. The results of this study provide evidence that ant-mutualists on African acacias can serve as deterrents to mega-herbivores and that different ant species vary in their tending abilities.Resume

AB Competition in trap-building predators such as antlion larvae is a complex biotic interaction, potentially involving exploitation competition, sand throwing (i.e., interference competition), cannibalism and intra-guild predation. We investigated the short-term behavioral and developmental responses of the strict sit-and-wait antlion predator Myrmeleon hyalinus to sand disturbance (i.e., quantification of the impact of severe sand throwing), and to con- and hetero-specific competition by a larger sit-and-pursue antlion species Lopezus fedtschenkoi. We found that antlions subjected to sand disturbances reduced their pit construction activity and relocated less often. Furthermore, the reduction in pit construction activity was stronger among antlions subjected to disturbances prior to feeding. Almost no death occurred during the sand disturbance experiment, but as expected, disturbances caused reductions in the relative growth rates of antlions. This negative effect was stronger in the group exposed to sand disturbances prior to feeding. The presence of the sit-and-pursue competitor led to reductions both in pit construction and in relocation activities of M. hyalinus. Although the per-capita food supply was identical in both experiments, only 48% of M. hyalinus larvae survived the competition experiment, and this pattern was consistent between the con- and hetero-specific treatments. However, in the presence of hetero-specific competitors, the relative growth rate of surviving larvae was significantly lower than that measured in the presence of con-specific competitors. Our study demonstrates that investigating the different components of complex biotic interactions can markedly improve our understanding of how these different factors interact to influence the behavior and life history of organisms.

AB It is widely accepted that protected areas alone are not sufficient to conserve wildlife populations particularly for migratory or wide-ranging species. In this study, we assess the population density of migratory species in the Tarangire-Simanjiro Ecosystem by conducting a ground census using DISTANCE sampling. We focus on the Simanjiro Plains which are used as a dispersal area by wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and zebra (Equus burchellii). We demonstrate that DISTANCE sampling can provide precise estimates of population density and is an affordable method for monitoring wildlife populations over time. We stress the importance of involving local communities in monitoring programmes across landscapes that incorporate communal lands as well as protected areas.Resume

AB Understanding the ways that resource heterogeneity shapes the performance of individuals and the dynamics of populations offers a central challenge in contemporary ecology. Emerging evidence shows that herbivores track heterogeneity in nutritional quality of vegetation by responding to phenological differences in plants, differences that result from spatial and temporal variation in conditions favoring plant growth. Theory predicts that when spatial variation in temperature, nutrients, or moisture results in spatially asynchronous pulses of plant growth, herbivores are able to prolong the period during which they have access to forage of peak nutritional value. Although this idea has substantial support from observational and modeling studies, it has not been examined experimentally. We hypothesized that access to asynchronous resources enhances nutritional status and growth of herbivores and that the magnitude of this effect depends on the scale of access relative to the grain of resources. We tested these hypotheses in mesocosm experiment using the migratory grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes, feeding on young wheat and protein-rich bran as a model system. We demonstrated access to asynchronous pulses in resources enhanced the efficiency of use of high quality resource use and increased growth of individuals by 13%. Disruption of this mechanism when landscapes were fragmented lowered efficiency of resource use and caused growth of individuals to decline by 15%. However, the strength of the effects of fragmentation on herbivore performance depended on the spatial extent of fragmentation relative to the spatial and temporal grain of resource emergence. Our findings add experimental support to modeling and observational studies that have linked herbivore performance to spatial and temporal variation in plant phenology. We also offer evidence that fragmentation can impair herbivore performance, even when the total amount and quality of resources on landscapes remains unchanged.

AB Bird droppings are often quoted as a decay agent for outdoor goods, in particular buildings and statues. Undoubtedly, they represent one of the major causes of aesthetic damage on outdoor materials, but the real chemical damage they are able to induce, in particular on metals, is not so well studied. This work focused on the short term role of uric acid, the main constituent of bird urine, with respect to copper, which make such an important contribution to architectural elements of buildings and outdoor sculpture. Preliminary results of laboratory tests and analyses on real exposed samples showed that uric acid chemically affects copper and bronzes: the surface of the metal is modified and copper urates formed. Also natural patina, formed on statues and roof, react with uric acid, even if it seems to afford some protection toward bird droppings. In general, experimental results confirm that the potential chemical damage by bird droppings is significant when considering external cultural heritage such as statues, metal monuments and buildings with historic copper roofs.

AB Exotic species have been widely used in reforestation in arid areas in northern Africa, as they provide ecosystem services that native species may be unable to supply. But information on their effect on ecosystem function and composition is scarce. We have evaluated the effect of 20-year-old Acacia saligna (Labill.) H.L. Wendl. plantations on the soil surface conditions and vascular plant composition in central Tunisia. Landscape function analysis (LFA) indices of soil stability, infiltration, and nutrient recycling underneath A. saligna increased by 1%, 138%, and 148%, respectively, in comparison to bare areas. This species, however, did not affect indicators of soil surface functionality, the spatial pattern of resource sinks-sources, or vascular plant species composition at a plot scale. This was probably due to low A. saligna cover, and a limited degree of litter incorporation into the soil surface. Our results suggest that the potential for improving ecosystem function and fostering succession by using this species seems to be limited in this arid environment.

AB Nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas, is mainly emitted from soils during the nitrification and denitrification processes. N2O stable isotope investigations can help to characterize the N2O sources and N2O production mechanisms. N2O isotope measurements have been conducted for different types of global terrestrial ecosystems. However, no isotopic data of N2O emitted from Antarctic tundra ecosystems have been reported although the coastal ice-free tundra around Antarctic continent is the largest sea animal colony on the global scale. Here, we report for the first time stable isotope composition of N2O emitted from Antarctic sea animal colonies (including penguin, seal and skua colonies) and normal tundra soils using in situ field observations and laboratory incubations, and we have analyzed the effects of sea animal excrement depositions on stable isotope natural abundance of N2O. For all the field sites, the soil-emitted N2O was N-15- and O-18-depleted compared with N2O in local ambient air. The mean delta values of the soil-emitted N2O were delta N-15 -13.5 +/- 3.2 parts per thousand and delta O-18 = 26.2 +/- 1.4 parts per thousand for the penguin colony, delta N-15 = -11.5 +/- 5.1 parts per thousand and delta O-18 = 26.4 +/- 3.5 parts per thousand for the skua colony and delta N-15 = -18.9 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand and delta O-18 = 28.8 +/- 1.3 parts per thousand for the seal colony. In the soil incubations, the isotopic composition of N2O was measured under N-2 and under ambient air conditions. The soils incubated under the ambient air emitted very little N2O (2.93 mu g N2O-N kg(-1)). Under N-2 conditions, much more N2O was formed (9.74 mu g N2O-N kg(-1)), and the mean delta N-15 and delta O-18 values of N2O were -19.1 +/- 8.0 parts per thousand and 21.3 +/- 4.3 parts per thousand, respectively, from penguin colony soils, and -17.0 +/- 4.2 parts per thousand and 20.6 +/- 3.5 parts per thousand, respectively, from seal colony soils. The data from in situ field observations and laboratory experiments point to denitrification as the predominant N2O source from Antarctic sea animal colonies.

AB Baseline data on distribution and abundance of tigers in the Sundarbans is required to identify problem areas and evaluate management strategies. This paper outlines a khal (creek) bank survey of track set frequency throughout the Bangladesh Sundarbans to aid formulation of a management-driven monitoring program. Three teams of two observers surveyed a total of 1201 km of waterways throughout the Sundarbans, recording 1338 tiger track sets. These sets became unrecognizable as tiger sign after a mean 10 days (range 614). Proportion of detectable sign recorded was 0.91. Mean (+/- standard error) sample unit track frequency was 1.12 +/- 0.86 track sets/km of khal. The mean coefficient of variance in sample unit track rate, estimated by multiple counts of six sample units, was 0.21 (range 0.06-0.34). Track frequency generally increased from northeast to southwest. Four sample units (6%) had signs of reproduction, with a mean litter size of 1.75 +/- 0.5. Monte Carlo simulation suggests a monitoring program of one complete survey every two years will have power of 0.8 (alpha = 0.2), to detect track frequency declines of >= 19% and increases of >= 17%. We recommend this monitoring scheme be implemented on the Indian side of the Sundarbans to provide a standard assessment of the tiger population and to form the basis for setting management objectives and evaluating transboundary conservation initiatives.

AB We studied the inter-year and inter-sex variation of the post-fledging body mass development of Common Terns Sterna hirundo in 2000 and 2001 at the Banter See colony, northern Germany. Here, post-fledglings can be identified and weighed remotely and automatically by a transponder system that makes use of automated balances installed at the colony. Individuals were sexed with PCR amplification methods. After fledging, young generally continued to increase their mass. However, in 2000, the young did not significantly increase their mass during the post-fledging period. In 2001, conditions were more favourable and body mass increased continuously. Further, in 2001, male post-fledglings were significantly heavier than female post-fledglings. Once having left the colony area (on average 18-23 days after fledging in 2000, and 14-16 days after fledging in 2001), post-fledgling body mass had still not reached adult body mass. The longer a juvenile stayed at the colony, the higher was its final body mass, which if acting as a threshold level may control departure time. Neither brood size nor hatching order affected post-fledging mass or period. In the unfavourable year 2000, when many individuals were found dead after fledging, fledging age but not fledging mass was found to be a predictor of post-fledging survival before departure: individuals fledging when older had a lower survival probability. Our results stress the importance of the post-fledging period for body mass increase and survival prior to departure. The variation in post-fledging mass growth between years and between the sexes is discussed with respect to parental effort and a possible selective provisioning of sons over daughters.

AB Scutellastra flexuosa (Quoy and Gaimard, 1834) was studied at Temae islet reef on Moorea, Society Islands, French Polynesia between 1998 and 2001 to compare and contrast the respective roles of deep phyletic history with recent adaptations in shaping its current ecological and life history characteristics. Most of the characters examined are consistent with related specialist species and are therefore determined by ancestry. These characteristics include habitat restriction, algal gardening, local distribution, home site fidelity, adult/juvenile differentiation, and protandric hermaphroditism. The only character that appears autapomorphic and a possible adaptation to its proximal setting is its small body size. Large body size is often associated with species that maintain and defend territories. However, the variance in size in clades with and without territorial species presents a more complex picture. The putative size reduction of S. flexuosa has not affected many of the specialized traits shared within its lineage and it remains a classic territorial taxon albeit in miniature. The phyletic pattern that emerges here is one of a clade dominated by specialist species that gave rise to generalist species that in turn gave rise to another group of specialists with identical traits albeit in different habitats.

ID AERIAL COUNTS; POWER; TEMPERATURE; ABUNDANCE; TIME
AB The federally listed desert tortoise ( Gopherus agassizii) is currently monitored using distance sampling to estimate population densities. Distance sampling, as with many other techniques for estimating population density, assumes that it is possible to quantify the proportion of animals available to be counted in any census. Because desert tortoises spend much of their life in burrows, and the proportion of tortoises in burrows at any time can be extremely variable, this assumption is difficult to meet. This proportion of animals available to be counted is used as a correction factor ( g(0)) in distance sampling and has been estimated from daily censuses of small populations of tortoises ( 6 - 12 individuals). These censuses are costly and produce imprecise estimates of g(0) due to small sample sizes. We used data on tortoise activity from a large ( N 150) experimental population to model activity as a function of the biophysical attributes of the environment, but these models did not improve the precision of estimates from the focal populations. Thus, to evaluate how much of the variance in tortoise activity is apparently not predictable, we assessed whether activity on any particular day can predict activity on subsequent days with essentially identical environmental conditions. Tortoise activity was only weakly correlated on consecutive days, indicating that behavior was not repeatable or consistent among days with similar physical environments.

AB Slopes of an abandoned waste rock at Wangaloa coal mine, south-east New Zealand, have naturally developed variable vegetation cover over the last 40-60 years. Three distinct areas of revegetation can clearly be identified: dense cover, patchy cover, and largely unvegetated, and the differences in revegetation success are directly related to the physical properties of different rock types making up the waste rock substrate. The colonizing plants have become established in largely unweathered rock with essentially no soil development. Quartz gravel and siltstone waste rock are the two principal rock types forming substrates for revegetation. The quartz gravel has clasts up to 3 cm, and was derived from the coal-bearing sequence. Siltstone was largely derived from a Quaternary loess cap on the coal mine area. These two substrates have similar mineral contents, and this mineral material provides the low level of available nutrients. However, there is little difference in nutrient status or trace element load of the different substrates, and differences in cohesion, moisture content, and proportion of quartz pebbles control revegetation success. Finer grained matrix has been flushed from quartz gravel waste rock by rain water, leaving a dry surface armour layer of quartz pebbles. This surface layer inhibits plant establishment, so quartz gravel waste rock remains largely unvegetated. Erosion creates deep rills, and steep surfaces creep downslope. In contrast, full vegetation cover was established on the siltstone waste rock that was cohesive and did not erode. Patchy revegetation was localized by siltstone in mixed quartz gravel and siltstone substrate. Invertebrate diversity and distribution were closely linked to the spatial patterns of revegetation. The rate of revegetation and ecosystem recovery was primarily dependent on the proportion of siltstone waste rock in the last dumped truck load. A quartz pebble content < 15% is optimal for plant establishment.

AB We investigated the digestive potential of the stream detritivore Tipula lateralis Meigen, 1804 as a tool to understand and predict their ability to adapt to environmental changes, such as the nature of leaf resources reaching streams. The structure of larval digestive tracts and the presence of bacteria were investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Gut sections were investigated with respect to pH, microbial counts, and ability to digest protein and carbohydrates of unconditioned leaves of Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. and Eucalyptus globulus Labill. Alkaline conditions prevailed throughout the gut, with the highest values in the middle midgut (pH up to 10.8). An abundant microflora was closely associated with the caecum (similar to 34 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu)) and hindgut (similar to 50 x 10(4) cfu), whereas the foregut and midgut seemed to be almost devoided of permanent bacteria (similar to 0.45 x 10(4) to similar to 2.1 x 10(4) cfu). Digestion of T.alateralis seems to be optimized by compartmentalization: proteinase activity was limited to the midgut (0.017 +/- 0.0054 change in absorbance units), while the capacity to release reducing substances was almost completely restricted to the caecum and being higher when alder was used as a substratum (0.437 +/- 0.153 g glucose center dot mg(-1)center dot h(-1)). Eucalyptus oils resulted in a 25% reduction in enzymatic capability of gut extracts. Overall, the results suggest that T. lateralis has the enzymatic capability of feeding on recalcitrant leaves, but specific components of leaves such as oils have the potential to interfere with food intake by this leaf consumer. In a more general context, the results help to assess biological changes introduced by eucalyptus plantations in non-native areas.

AB Ongoing large-scale habitat disturbance requires quick identification of conservation priorities such as targeting sites rich in species and/or endemics. Biodiversity assessments are time consuming and expensive, so surveys often rely on partial sampling. Optimal use should be made of all currently available sources of information, but methodological differences between surveys hamper direct comparison. Because diversity depends on spatial scale, diversity characteristics of different sites are best compared on the basis of species-area relationships. As a result of the incompleteness of sampling, the observed species-area relationship deviates from the "true" species-area relationship.
   In this paper, we identify five key factors affecting the shape of the species-area relationship due to incomplete sampling: (1) the total spatial extent of the observations, (2) the spatial distribution of the observations, (3) the proportion of the total extent sampled, (4) the proportion of the individuals in the sampled area included in the survey, and (5) the proportion of the included individuals successfully identified. We outline how methodologically different surveys can be combined to optimize the use of existing data in the evaluation of conservation needs, particularly for tropical forests.
   As an illustration, we analyzed four methodologically different botanical surveys in the same area of old growth lowland forest in South Cameroon with the aim of reconciling these surveys. The four surveys were (1) reconnaissance scale vegetation mapping, (2) detailed botanical assessment (all individuals), (3) incomplete botanical assessment (10% individuals), and (4) herbarium collections.
   By correcting for the five key factors we were able to match the results of the four different biodiversity surveys. The five key factors affected the recorded number of species and endemics differently; partial sampling of extent (3) and individuals (4) and partial identification of individuals (5) were the three most important factors.
   We conclude that reconciliation of biodiversity assessments is possible if the differences between methods can be accounted for. We advocate reliable documentation of survey methods, especially the five key factors, because it greatly enhances the potential of combining methodologically different surveys for comparative biodiversity analyses.

AB Crustacean dormancy, like diapause in insects and seeds, is a remarkable and not always clear life-hi story event. Many problems, ranging from the question of frequency of diapause in the distinct taxonomic groups, to the possibility of the identification of features that define dormancy, have been posed and need investigation. This paper is concerned with one of the main questions in the field, namely the problem of studying the relationships between environment unpredictability and dormancy. This result explores, in particular, both rigorously and empirically, the well known prediction that says that a decline of the hatching rate should correspond to an increase of unpredictability of the habitat. This theoretical result was formulated by Cohen in 1966, and its validity in the original form is, also presently, a matter of discussion. Despite the growth of the literature on the subject, in fact, almost no advances have been made in relating environmental findings to the theory and this has resulted, mainly, from the difficulty of defining a good measure of habitat unpredictability. In this paper we propose an interpretation of this quantity in terms of fundamentals of Shannon information statistics, and by using this idea, we verify the validity of Cohen's original statement on experimental data of three different populations of Chirocephalus diaphanus Prevost, 1803 (Crustacea, Anostraca), inhabiting both semi-permanent and temporary pools in Italy. We find an encouraging fitting between experimental and theoretical predictions and this can be interpreted, almost for the case under study, as an indication that Cohen law should hold.

AB Various global change factors such as natural and anthropogenic climate change, tropospheric ozone, CO(2), SO(2), and nitrogen deposition affect forest growth, but in species-specific ways. Since even small differences in growth rates between competing species can lead to eventual competitive exclusion, it is important to know the rate at which displacement might occur. Similarly, invasive species may displace native species and cause their extinction. A simulation study of displacement velocity was conducted. Competitive displacement between pairs of similar tree species in which one species has a growth advantage produced trajectories that fit an exponential decay model, leading to the use of the half-life as a useful summary statistic. At any given level of growth differential, the half-life for shade-tolerant species was found to be much longer than for shade-intolerant species due to the ability of shade-tolerant species to survive even when their growth is very slow. Trees with longer life-spans also persisted longer, but this effect was weaker than the shade-tolerance effect. Disturbances speeded up displacement by increasing turnover. For short-lived, intolerant species with a 20% disturbance rate and 20% growth suppression, the estimate of an approximate to 100-year half-life could be considered a precipitous rate of decline, with a risk of extinction at about 500 years. In the absence of disturbance, and with a 20% growth reduction or differential between competing species, half-lives for species replacement ranged from 100 + to nearly 800 years. With lesser growth differentials, half-lives are much longer. Such gradual competitive displacement processes will be very difficult to detect in the field over periods of even decades. Results of this study have implications for exotic species invasions. It is predicted that intact forest is not truly resistant to invasion, but that invasion of shade-tolerant tree species should be very slow. Invasion of shade-intolerant species is predicted to be accelerated by disturbance, as has been frequently observed. Results of the simulations were supported by data compiled from several parts of the world.

AB Several methods of assessment have been used to document variation in grazing pressure on temperate rocky shores, although often these methods are applied without consideration of local conditions or species. In this study, a comparison was made between abundance counts of inactive molluscan grazers at low tide, direct observations of grazer activity and distribution throughout day and night tidal cycles, and records of grazing marks on wax discs, for the mid-shore of Hong Kong. The abundance of grazers found during low-tide counts varied among dates, sites and species. This method, however, did not record all grazer species that day/night observations showed to migrate from the low shore with the rising tide. Low-tide counts, therefore, underestimate grazing pressure (number of active grazers per unit area) and grazer guild (number of species). Grazing marks on wax discs also recorded a greater number of species than the low-tide counts of inactive grazers, and included grazers that were seen to migrate up shore during day/night observations. Certain limpet species, however, avoided the wax and did not leave grazing marks, showing this method to also underestimate grazing pressure. All methods showed grazing pressure to be variable at spatial scales of tens of metres or less and also temporally variable between sampling dates. The sole use of either low-tide counts or wax discs is likely to underestimate grazing pressure, due to variation in shore topography and grazer foraging behaviour, especially on shores with a narrow tidal range such as in Hong Kong. To gain a more accurate assessment of total grazing pressure, it is suggested that recording of grazing marks on wax discs should be used in conjunction with direct day/night observations.

AB Over the past decade, ecosystem ecologists have become increasingly interested in the effects of individual plant species on ecosystem processes. Several recent studies have demonstrated that rates of nitrogen mineralization are significantly different under plots with different plant composition and have correlated differences with plant traits such as C:N ratio or other measures of litter quality. However, these studies have not evaluated how rapidly changes in plant composition translate into changes in ecosystem N availability or cycling and the conditions under which individual species can change ecosystem nutrient fluxes. Exotic plant invasions offer an opportunity to evaluate how species effects develop as species move into communities where they have no prior history. We believe that they also offer an opportunity to explore how different and how abundant a species has to become to have a measurable impact on a key ecosystem process.
   In this chapter, we review the literature on the effects of nonnative plant invaders on nitrogen cycling with the goal of trying to identify when and where invaders should be expected to increase or decrease N cycling. We believe that the speed and magnitude of invader effects should vary as a function of how different invaders are from residents in particular traits, and how resistant the resident community and soils are to change. We also believe that the application of a variety of modeling approaches holds great promise in understanding interactions between invader traits and environmental conditions and that this application should be explored more completely. Because the database for this review is not large, we focus on identifying gaps in our knowledge that could be filled by carefully directed empirical work and quantitative modeling.

AB Food provisioning rates and chick growth rates of Common Terns Sterna hirundo and Arctic Terns S. paradisaea were studied in Northeast England. Adult terns of both species fed large broods more frequently than those containing fewer chicks. Energy supply per nestling declined slightly as brood size increased and as a result, chicks in large broods developed body mass at a slightly lower rate than those in small broods. Although brood size had no effect on fledging mass in either species, Common Tern chicks from large broods reached fledging mass later than those in small broods. Despite significant effects of brood size, mass growth rate hierarchies did not occur within broods of either species and hatching position had no effect on the mass of fledglings. Brood size and hatching position had no effect on the rate at which chicks developed structurally or on final body size. These results suggest that flexibility of mass growth rates in Arctic and Common Terns may act as a fine-tuning mechanism, allowing parents to increase their annual reproductive output through slower mass growth rates of chicks.

Patella occurs in the diets of various predators, but Siphonaria is rarely eaten. The possibility of chemical defence in Siphonaria was tested using co-occurring predators. Live limpets were used to establish that predators differentiate between the two species; limpet tissue to establish that this was not due to behavioural defence; and chemical extracts from Siphonaria to eliminate the possibility of physical effects such as tissue toughness.
   The predators capable of taking live limpets (clingfish, starfish and two species of whelks) took Patella in preference to Siphonaria (chi(2) tests, P < 0.05 in all cases). Of 331 limpets eaten during trials, only 12% were Siphonaria. Whelks refused the tissue of Siphonaria while accepting Patella. Gobies ate Siphonaria tissue, but were then reluctant to feed again. Anemones showed no difference in their response to tissues of the two species.
   Coating Patella tissue with the ether-soluble organic fraction of a chemical extracted from Siphonaria using acetone did not affect feeding by gobies. However, starfish which were touched by a glass rod smeared with Siphonaria mucus or extract suffered temporary paralysis of the tube-feet. Patella which had their shells coated with Siphonaria extract were eaten significantly less often by starfish. This effect was strongly dose dependent. We conclude that avoidance of Siphonaria by those predators capable of attacking live individuals was due to chemical defence, the active components being present in both the mucus and the foot tissues.

AB Littorina striata King and Broderip, 1832 is a strictly Macaronesian, intertidal periwinkle with planktonic development. The species displays a high degree of shell variation involving size and sculpture (nodulose vs smooth shells). The present work provides a preliminary account of some aspects of this shell variation on wave-exposed shores over the entire geographical range of the species. Based on morphological patterns observed among other prosobranchs it was predicted that southern specimens of L. littorina should on the average be larger, heavier, more nodulose, and should show more shell repair marks, than northern specimens. These expectations were confirmed for shell size and weight. In contrast, there was no consistent pattern in nodulosity between archipelagos, even though there were differences at much smaller scales. Shell repair marks were more prevalent in northern populations, but this trend was only due to a significant N-S difference among nodulose shells. This is surprising as nodulose shells displayed significantly fewer shell repair marks than smooth shells. These observations were tentatively interpreted as a function of presumed differential N-S patterns of wave action and ambient temperatures. in this context, wave action in Macaronesia seems to increase in the south (contrary to what current theories predict). This atypical situation may confound the interpretation of morphological patterns in L. striata so that firm conclusions cannot be drawn without further experimental work at different spatial scales, Nevertheless, it seems that generalisations about macrogeographic shell morphology patterns, based on interspecific comparisons, are not directly applicable to intraspecific patterns, and may strongly depend on local conditions, which make adequate sampling and data treatment very difficult.

AB Community-based wildlife conservation (CBWC) programmes have been a pervasive paradigm in the conservation circles since the 1970s. The key elements of such programmes are that local communities are given ownership rights or custodianship and management responsibilities over wildlife, and that they gain social and economic benefits from conservation of the resources. However, to date, there have been only a few studies that offer in-depth analyses of the interplay between governance processes and livelihood impacts of CBWC programmes. Here, I conducted key informant interviews and focus group discussions in five wildlife conservancies in the Maasai Mara ecosystem in Kenya to address the following questions: i) What are the perceived impacts of the wildlife conservancies on livelihoods of the local people? ii) To what extent are the wildlife conservancies governed in relation to the principles of environmental governance? I assessed impacts on livelihoods by applying the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework to explore perceived conservancy-related benefits and costs (i.e. perceived changes in social, financial, human, physical, and natural capitals). I assessed governance by asking the respondents whether the following eight principles of environmental governance were applied: legitimacy, transparency, accountability, inclusiveness, fairness, integration, capability, and adaptability. Perceived benefits of participating in wildlife co-management were identified as: enhanced income from gainful employment and new business opportunities, membership to cooperative societies and participation in community work (e.g. school bursary and feeding programmes), enhanced social relations, improved access to credit and health facilities, enhanced physical infrastructure (schools, roads and bridges), improved physical security and coordinated sharing of provisioning ecosystem services like pasture and water. The principles of legitimacy, inclusiveness, and integration had reportedly been well implemented in wildlife co-management. However, the institutional mechanisms for sharing resources within the conservancies lacked transparency, accountability, and fairness, and tended to favour those who were politically connected to the leadership of the conservancies. Moreover, most of the conservancies had weak systems and few resources to facilitate delivery on responsibilities (i.e. had low capability), and had some costs associated with human-wildlife conflicts. For an improved co-management of wildlife to be achieved in these conservancies, local institutions should be reconfigured to allow active participation by conservancy landowners in decision-making, information sharing, and equitable access to conservancy-related benefits.

AB Context Landscape sustainability emerges from interactions between linked human and natural systems. Many of these interactions are mediated by institutions (e.g., rules, laws, customs, traditions), most of which are themselves spatially defined entities that both generate and respond to spatial variation in the landscape. However, the spatial dynamics of the interplay between institutions and landscape heterogeneity are poorly understood. Objective To define the landscape ecology of institutions as an emerging research field, providing a summary of key themes and frontiers. Methods We draw on existing theory in both landscape ecology and institutional analysis to explore the interface between landscape ecology and institutions in social-ecological systems. Results Three central themes in understanding landscape sustainability through an institutional lens include the role of landscape heterogeneity as a driver of institutions; the spatial properties of institutions as influences on ecological and socioeconomic processes; and the relationships between institutions and landscape resilience. Emerging frontiers for further research include understanding the roles of top-down vs bottom up processes (design vs. emergence); understanding landscapes as institutional filters; the role of landscapes in institutional development and change; and co-evolutionary dynamics between landscapes and institutions. We discuss each of these points in detail. Conclusions Spatially mediated feedbacks between landscape structure and institutions are poorly understood and critical for landscape sustainability. Further research in this area will depend heavily on generating data sets that describe the spatial properties of institutions and allow them to be analysed as landscape features.

AB Urban forests often occur as highly fragmented patches with many non-native plant species, altered disturbance regimes, environmental pollutants, and uncertain trajectories of plant community composition. In 1998, the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, a U.S. National Science Foundation-funded Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program, established eight forested plots to investigate long-term impacts of urbanization on natural ecosystems. All plots were located in the Baltimore metropolitan area with four in urban forest patches and four in a rural forest. In 1998, these forest patches had closed canopies with well-developed tree, shrub and vine layers, and extensive herbaceous cover. The 1998 alpha diversity (species richness) was higher in urban plots than in rural plots, whereas both plot types had similar forest structure and a relatively small number of non-native species. In 2015, we resampled these plots to investigate changes in plant structure, composition, and diversity based on the abundance, cover, and size of plant species. Trees and vines experienced minimal structural changes in all the plots. Sapling, shrub, and herbaceous abundances all declined over time in the rural plots. In the urban plots, however, only the sapling and herbaceous layers experienced declines. Despite having fewer structural changes, urban plots showed a greater shift in species composition than did rural plots. As in 1998, alpha diversity was lower in the rural plots. Beta diversity (community dissimilarity) decreased among rural plots but remained nearly unchanged in the urban plots, whereas beta turnover (species turnover) was much higher in the urban plots. These data suggest that the urban plots may have divergent compositional trajectories from the rural plots, which may help urban forests retain structural similarities through functional redundancy.

AB Interactions occurring between species in multiple invaded freshwater ecosystems are often difficult to observe and study. Studies on invasive alien species typically focus on single species, and, when the species community is exclusively composed of alien species, their interactions, eventual facilitation and hindering processes are very scarcely assessed. To investigate such a community, the species community in the Arno River (Tuscany, Italy) was examined as a model system using the combined approach of stable isotopes and dietary analyses. Established alien species have formed a pyramid shaped community with the European catfish Silurus glanis and the North American channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus in the apex position, followed by opportunistic predatory (Lepomis gibbosus) and omnivore (Alburnus alburnus, Cyprinus carpio, Barbus barbus, Pseudorasbora parva, Padogobius sp., Tinca tinca) species. These species were observed to feed on a variety of primary producers (Myriophyllum sp., Potamogeton sp., Phragmites australis) and consumers (aquatic insects, molluscs, Dikerogammarus villosus, Procambarus clarkii, Palaemon antennarius, tadpoles). Remarkably, the channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus showed an ontogenetic niche shift, with juveniles occupying a slightly higher trophic position than mature individuals. Pseudorasbora parva and A. alburnus showed a strong niche overlap, with the former having a wider niche. Such wide niches were also found for the invasive crustaceans D. villosus and P. clarkii. Outgoing from our findings, we suggest that life-history and geographic origin play a role in determining competition and interaction type among alien species, with species from the same geographic area showing a lower potential to compete than species from different areas, hence affecting their potential impact on native species.

AB Inaccurate estimates of animal populations may lead to flawed management interventions, therefore, it is essential to understand the status and population trend of a species in order to plan its management efficiently. Aerial surveys are considered a useful method for estimating the population size of large conspicuous animals inhabiting large areas, but raw count data from aerial surveys usually underestimate population sizes due to imperfect detection. The use of N-mixture models with aerial count data provides a useful tool to estimate the population sizes while taking detection probability into account. As a study case we used aerial surveys conducted for monitoring black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) in Madikwe Game Reserve and Pilanesberg Nature Reserve (South Africa) during 1999-2015, and we analysed data with a dynamic extension of the N-mixture model. We estimated 0.078-0.098 and 0.139 -0.142 individuals/km(2) , respectively, and we found evidence for density dependence in both reserves with a carrying capacity of 0.122 (0.102-0.142) individuals/100 km(2) . Based on simulations used to assess precision of the estimates, root-mean-square error model (RMSE) estimates was significantly smaller than those for the raw maximum counts.
   The N-mixture models provide a promising approach to estimate population size, trends and demographic characteristics of large conspicuous mammals such as black rhinoceroses. Such analysis can provide estimates that are more accurate than raw counts. In addition, use of model covariates that affect a species' population parameters can provide useful information for their conservation and management. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB Assessing the resilience of plant-animal interactions is critical to understanding how plant communities respond to habitat disturbances. Most ecosystems experience some level of natural disturbance (e.g. wildfires) to which many organisms are adapted. Wildfires have structured biotic communities for millennia; however, the effects of fire on interactions such as pollination have only recently received attention. A few studies have shown that generalist plants can buffer the impact of fires by pollinator replacement, suggesting that the resilience to disturbance could depend on the level of specialization of the interactions. Here, we hypothesize that (1) fires could impose negative effects on plants with specialized pollination systems, and (2) in large wildfires, these negative effects will be stronger with increasing distance inside the burnt area because pollinators will need more time to recolonize.
   These questions were tested in the specialized pollination system of a widespread Mediterranean palm, Chamaerops humilis. The post-fire pollination resilience was assessed in replicated wildfires representing three post-fire ages by measuring the abundance of beetle pollinators and by estimating fruit set (i.e. the proportion of flowers setting fruits) in burnt and unburnt areas. To test for distance effects, plants were sampled along transects inside the burnt area.
   Despite a marked post-fire decline in the specialist pollinator, exacerbated by the distance from the fire's edge, the palm's fruit set was barely affected. The temporary replacement by a sap beetle at burnt sites - an effective pollinator that had not been previously recognized - provided post-fire reproductive resilience.
   Differential pollinator responses to disturbance can ensure plant success even in plants with only two functionally similar pollinators. This highlights the importance of pollinator replacement and dynamics for the resilience of interactions and ultimately of plant reproduction in disturbance-prone ecosystems.

TI Herbaceous responses to herbivory, fire and rainfall variability differ

AB Herbivory and fire are known to shape plant community structure and function in savanna ecosystems worldwide, yet these drivers are increasingly being altered in their behaviour, or completely excluded. Furthermore, herbaceous responses to rainfall in semi-arid and arid savannas may outweigh the effects of herbivory and fire, especially in nutrient-rich ecosystems. Despite considerable recognition of herbaceous responses to drivers in savanna systems, few studies consider grasses and forbs as distinct herbaceous functional entities. To address this shortcoming, we used long-term herbaceous vegetation data collected from herbivore and fire exclusion treatments in the Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa. We investigated response patterns in herbaceous abundances per functional group for three sampling years, which represented different rainfall conditions (i.e., average for 2010, above average for 2001, and below average for 2015. Dynamic shifts in forb versus grass dominance were revealed across treatments. Surprisingly, palatable annual forb communities seemed more resilient to herbivores, or their removal, dominating over palatable annual grass communities. Furthermore, unpalatable perennial forbs were revealed to be more resilient to herbivore presence than their absence. Palatable perennial grass abundances were consistently enhanced by above-average rainfall conditions, whereas equal dominance of palatable grasses and forbs was evident during the drought year. This highlights that palatable perennial functional groups (not grasses alone) provide important ecosystem functions, such as forage stability, and hence functional redundancy to absorb disturbances such as droughts. Moreover, rainfall variability and herbivory are considered the main drivers of palatable perennial functional groups in this nutrient-rich ecosystem. Palatable perennial grass abundances differed significantly from other alleged unfavourable herbaceous functional groups (e.g., unpalatable perennial grasses, annual grasses, and annual and perennial forbs) and, although they presented contrasting patterns for each sampling year, fire and herbivory treatments, palatable perennial grasses remained the dominant functional group in this ecosystem type. Therefore, this study did not support previous findings that conditions such as drought, fire and herbivory favour unfavourable functional groups at the expense of palatable perennial grasses. Observed patterns provide evidence of a dynamic and less predictable coexistence between grasses and forbs. (C) 2018 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Making use of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) with pulses and green manure legumes can help to alleviate nitrogen deficiencies and increase soil fertility, problems faced particularly in smallholder agriculture in Subsahara Africa (SSA). The isolation of indigenous rhizobia provides a basis for the formulation of rhizobial inoculants. Moreover, their identification and characterization contribute to the general understanding of species distribution and ecology. Here we discuss global species discovery of Bradyrhizobium spp. Although recently the number of validly published Bradyrhizobium species is rapidly increasing, their diversity in SSA is not well-represented. We summarize the recent knowledge on species diversity in the Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense lineage to which most SSA isolates belong, and their biogeographic distribution and adaptations. Most indigenous rhizobia appear to differ from species found on other continents. We stress that an as yet hidden diversity may be a rich resource for inoculant development in future. As some species are exceptionally temperature tolerant, they may be potential biofertilizer candidates for global warming scenarios.

AB Ontogenetic variation of cranial characters used in crocodylian phylogenetic systematics has never been studied. Furthermore, the relationship between diet and skull morphological transformation during ontogeny has not been properly explored yet. We quantify the inter- and intraspecific skull morphological variation in extant caiman species focusing on those areas relevant to systematics and, also investigate the relation between diet and morphological changes during ontogeny. We applied a three-dimensional approach of geometric morphometrics on post-hatching ontogenetic cranial series of Cain= latirostris and C. yacare. In order to incorporate incomplete material, we additionally tested four different methods of missing landmark estimation and apply the thin-plate spline interpolation. We detected morphological changes between species and during ontogeny (snout and pterygoid flanges increase their proportions and, orbits, temporal fenestrae, skull roof and foramen magnum decrease their relative size) that constitutes part of a general morphological change in the cranial ontogeny of crocodylians. Moreover, the negative allometry of the fenestrae and neurocranium and the positive allometry of the splanchnocranium in both caiman species are the plesiomorphic condition, at least, for tetrapods. Shape changes during growth were found to be related to ontogenetic changes in the diet. Dissimilarities between species seem to be related to different mechanical requirements and different use of the habitat. We found inter-and intraspecific variation in some morphological characters with systematic implications (the contact of nasals with naris, the contact of prefrontals in the midline, and the bones that border the suborbital fenestra and the proportion in which one of them participates) that are not currently considered in phylogenetic analyses.

AB Warming is among the major drivers of changes in biotic interactions and, in turn, ecosystem functioning. The decomposition process occurs in a chain of facilitative interactions between detritivores and microorganisms. It remains unclear, however, what effect warming may have on the interrelations between detritivores and microorganisms, and the consequences for the functioning of natural freshwater ecosystems. To address these gaps, we performed a field experiment using tank bromeliads and their associated aquatic fauna. We manipulated the presence of bacteria and detritivorous macroinvertebrates (control, bacteria, and bacteria+macroinvertebrates) under ambient and warming scenarios, and analyzed the effects on the microorganisms and ecosystem functioning (detritus mass loss, colored dissolved organic matter, and nitrogen flux). We applied antibiotic solution to eliminate or reduce bacteria from control bromeliads. After 60days incubation, bacterial density was higher in the presence than in the absence of macroinvertebrates. In the absence of macroinvertebrates, temperature did not influence bacterial density. However, in the presence of macroinvertebrates, bacterial density decreased by 54% with warming. The magnitude of the effects of organisms on ecosystem functioning was higher in the combined presence of bacteria and macroinvertebrates. However, warming reduced the overall positive effects of detritivores on bacterial density, which in turn, cascaded down to ecosystem functioning by decreasing decomposition and nitrogen flux. These results show the existence of facilitative mechanisms between bacteria and detritivores in the decomposition process, which might collapse due to warming. Detritivores seem to contribute to nutrient cycling as they facilitate bacterial populations, probably by increasing nutrient input (feces) in the ecosystem. However, increased temperature mitigated these beneficial effects. Our results add to a growing research body that shows that warming can affect the structure of aquatic communities, and highlight the importance of considering the interactive effects between facilitation and climatic drivers on the functioning of freshwater ecosystems.

AB Key message The outcome of the present study leads to the application of a spatially explicit rule-based expert system (RBES) algorithm aimed at automatically classifying forest areas according to the European Forest Types (EFT) system of nomenclature at pan-European scale level. With the RBES, the EFT system of nomenclature can be now easily implemented for objective, replicable, and automatic classification of field plots for forest inventories or spatial units (pixels or polygons) for thematic mapping.
   Context Forest Types classification systems are aimed at stratifying forest habitats. Since 2006, a common scheme for classifying European forests into 14 categories and 78 types (European Forest Types, EFT) exists.
   Aims This work presents an innovative method and automated classification system that, in an objective and replicable way, can accurately classify a given forest habitat according to the EFT system of nomenclature.
   Methods A rule-based expert system (RBES) was adopted as a transparent approach after comparison with the well-known Random Forest (RF) classification system. The experiment was carried out based on the information acquired in the field in 2010 ICP level I plots in 17 European countries. The accuracy of the automated classification is evaluated by comparison with an independent classification of the ICP plots into EFT carried out during the BioSoil project field survey. Finally, the RBES automated classifier was tested also for a pixel-based classification of a pan-European distribution map of beech-dominated forests.
   Results The RBES successfully classified 94% of the plots, against a 92% obtained with RF. When applied to the mapped domain, the accuracy obtained with the RBES for the beech forest map classification was equal to 95%.
   Conclusion The RBES algorithm successfully automatically classified field plots and map pixels on the basis of the EFT system of nomenclature. The EFT system of nomenclature can be now easily and objectively implemented in operative transnational European forest monitoring programs.

AB The general public is increasingly critical of extensive, ruminant-dominated systems for their attributed high greenhouse gas emissions. However, advocates of low input, grass-fed systems present them as paradigmatic sustainable production systems because of their biodiversity, land use, rural development and animal welfare benefits. We reconcile both analyses by proposing to assess baseline emissions in grazed ecosystems. We show that policies aiming at transitioning grass-fed systems towards fodder-based (concentrate- or grain-based) systems can be ineffective at reducing emissions because wild ruminants or termites fill livestock's ecological niche. Climate change policies targeting livestock should carefully evaluate derived emissions scenarios.

AB In this contribution, we review our knowledge on bet-hedging strategies associated with rotifer diapause. First, we describe the ecological scenario under which bet hedging is likely to have evolved in three diapause-related traits in monogonont rotifer populations: (1) the timing of sex (because diapausing eggs are produced via sexual reproduction), (2) the sexual reproduction ratio (i.e. the fraction of sexually reproducing females) and (3) the timing of diapausing egg hatching. Then, we describe how to discriminate among bet-hedging modes and discuss which modes and mechanisms better fit the variability observed in these traits in rotifers. Finally, we evaluate the strength of the empirical evidence for bet hedging in the scarce studies available, and we call for the need of research at different levels of biological complexity to fully understand bet hedging in rotifer diapause.

AB Floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important signals in plant-pollinator communication and thus subjected to olfactory-mediated selection. Occasionally, phylogenetically unrelated plant species will converge towards similar patterns of floral scent signalling to harness pollinators, representing a common adaptive pollination niche. Catasetum cernuum and Gongora bufonia, epiphytic orchids that are native to the Atlantic Forest of southeastern South America, are exclusively pollinated by male Eufriesea violacea orchid-bees; we hypothesised that the two species have converged towards similar floral scent compositions to effectively attract these particular fragrance-seeking floral visitors. The similarity of the chemical composition of floral scent samples obtained through headspace collection was tested using multiple approaches of multivariate analyses (Multiple Response Permutation Procedure-MRPP). According to MRPP, floral scents of C. cernuum and G. bufonia are significantly different. Additionally, the floral scents of C. cernuum and G. bufonia present (E)-beta-ocimene and (E)-epoxyocimene as their major compounds, respectively. (E)-beta-ocimene is a common constituent of floral scents from euglossine-pollinated orchids, while (E)-epoxyocimene is quite rare in orchids' floral scents and it is found in only a few other species which occur outside the distribution range of C. cernuum, G. bufonia and E. violacea. However, 12 out of the 34 identified VOCs, including (E)-beta-ocimeneand (E)-epoxyocimene, are shared between both species. Therefore, we assume that both (E)-beta -ocimeneand (E)-epoxyocimene, either alone or mixed with other floral VOCs, play a major role in the specific association between these two orchids and their exclusive euglossine pollinator.

AB Despite the potential utility of a biogeographical approach to understanding the naturalization of exotic species, studies using this approach are scarce. Eucalyptus globulus is an economically important Australian tree species that has become naturalized in a number of countries where it was introduced. Portugal is an ideal territory to study the naturalization of E. globulus owing to: a long introduction history, the antipodal location compared to Australia and the large cultivated area. Wildling density was assessed in 116 E. globulus plantations in central Portugal through 213 transects established along plantation borders. Boosted regression trees were used to model the influence of plantation-scale variables. Results from this survey were compared with data obtained in plantations from seven Australian regions, where a similar sampling protocol had been used. In Portugal, wildlings were more abundant in plantations that were: located in moist aspects, coppiced, with older tree stems and corresponding to intermediate site growth indexes. The overall density (127 plants ha(-1)) was 14.9 times higher than in the Australian estate, but this ratio was reduced to 3.1 in a more comparable subset of unburnt, first rotation plantations. A generalized linear model fitted using a dataset combining the two surveys showed that country influenced wildling density, together with plantation rotation and stem age. These results provide insights into the naturalization of a widely cultivated tree species, pointing to a fundamental role of the introduction history, possibly acting along with the biogeographical characteristics of the introduced range.

AB Knowledge of aquatic invasive species (AIS) dispersal is important to inform surveillance and management efforts to slow the spread of established invaders. We studied potential dispersal of invasive Eurasian ruffe Gymnocephalus cernua and golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei larvae in Lakes Michigan and Erie using a three-dimensional particle transport model. Ruffe is currently in Lake Superior and northern Lake Michigan, while Limnoperna has not yet invaded the Great Lakes. We predicted larval transport during several spawning seasons (individual years) from several major tributaries and ports that are most prone to invasion because of their significant recreational and commercial usage. Depending on release location, larvae traveled distances ranging from <1 km to tens of kilometers (in some cases over 100-200 km, depending on species) during 2-3 weeks of drift time. Dispersal distances from nearshore locations (i.e. rivers and ports) were smaller than from offshore deballasting locations near ports. Limnoperna dispersal distances were larger than ruffe due to stronger seasonal currents and longer drift period. Settlement areas resulting from offshore releases were larger than for nearshore releases, and larger for Limnoperna than for ruffe. Model results compared favorably to observed spread of ruffe and Dreissena spp. mussels in Lake Michigan. Our modeling effort suggests that larval advection by lake currents is an important AIS dispersal mechanism in the Great Lakes. It also emphasizes the importance of effective surveillance programs that maximize early detection of new introductions before lake current dispersal obviates containment and prevention of spread and impacts.

AB This study classified the vegetation of the Savuti-Mababe-Linyanti ecosystem (SMLE), northern Botswana and developed a detailed map that provides a reliable habitat template of the SMLE for future wildlife habitat use studies. The major vegetation units of the SMLE were determined from satellite imagery and field visits and then mapped using Landsat 8 and RapidEye imagery and maximum likelihood classifier. These units were sampled using 40 m x 20 m (800 m m(2)) plots in which the coverage of all plant species was estimated. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) demonstrated that plant communities were determined by gradients in soil texture or fertility and wetness. NMS 1 represented a gradient of soil texture with seven woodland communities on sandy soils (sandveld communities and Baikiaea forest) dominated by Baikiaea plurijuga in Baikiaea forest and Terminalia sericea and Philenoptera nelsii in sandveld, with various indicator species differentiating the various sandveld community types. Mopane woodland further from and riparian woodland adjacent to permanent water was common on less sandy alluvial soils. Mineral-rich, heavy clay soils in the sump of a large paleolake system support open grassland and mixed Senegalia/Vachellia (Acacia) savanna, with the mineral-rich soils supporting grasses high in minerals such as phosphorus, calcium, sodium and potassium, and thus this region is a critical wet season range for migratory zebra. Taller, high-quality grasses in the mosaic of sandveld and mopane woodland communities provide critical grazing for taller grass grazers such as buffalo, roan and sable antelope, whereas wetland communities provide reliable green forage during the dry season for a variety of herbivores, including elephant. This study has demonstrated how large-scale environmental gradients determine functional habitat heterogeneity for wildlife.
   Conservation implications: Our study demonstrated that the functionality of protected areas is determined by large-scale environmental gradients. Thus conservation science must aim to ensure that protected areas cover the full range of key environmental gradients in a region ( soil texture and wetness in our study). Our habitat map provides a data base for wildlife habitat use studies in the region.

AB Arctic colonial seabirds are recognized as effective fertilizers of terrestrial ecosystems by delivering marine-origin nutrients to the vicinities of their nesting sites. A proportion of this ornithogenic matter is then thought to return to the sea and, concentrated within a smaller area, locally provides additional nutrients for the nearshore marine communities. The aim of this study was to assess the presence and impact of local ornithogenic enrichment on two important elements of the Arctic coastal food web: (1,) the planktonic pathway originating in the surface water, and (2) the benthic pathway based on benthic primary production. We sampled two areas in Isfjorden (Spitsbergen): one located below a coastal mixed breeding colony of guillemots and kittiwakes, and a control area not influenced by the colony. Slightly higher nitrogen stable isotope ratios (615N.) were found in particulate organic matter suspended in the surface water (POM), sedimentary organic matter (SOM) from outside the zone of dense kelp forest, and the predatory/scavenging whelks Buccinum sp. collected below the seabird colony (the components recognized as following the planktonic path). In contrast, no ornithogenic isotopic enrichment was detected in the herbivorous gastropod Margaritas helicinus or in SOM from the kelp zone (benthic path). The data are compatible with those obtained from the same location a year before, showing 615N enrichment in predatory/ scavenging hermit crabs Pagurus pubescens below the seabird, and no such changes in kelps Saccharina latissima or their presumed consumers, sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (Zmudczyfiska-Skarbek et al., 2015a). The results suggest that, in the conditions of periodic, short-term pulses of ornithogenic nutrient inputs to the local marine environment, which typify the short High Arctic summer, planktonic organisms are the initial organisms to incorporate these nutrients before transfer to the benthic food web via pelagic benthic coupling. However, the supply of ornithogenic resources alone is insufficient to support benthic producers and the trophic pathways based on them. Overall, the ornithogenic subsidies are not a major nutrient source for marine organisms from below the seabird colony. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The majority of research on savanna vegetation dynamics has focused on the coexistence of woody and herbaceous vegetation. Interactions among woody plants in savannas are relatively poorly understood. We present data from a 10-yr longitudinal study of spatially explicit growth patterns of woody vegetation in an East African savanna following exclusion of large herbivores and in the absence of fire. We examined plant spatial patterns and quantified the degree of competition among woody individuals. Woody plants in this semiarid savanna exhibit strongly clumped spatial distributions at scales of 1-5 m. However, analysis of woody plant growth rates relative to their conspecific and heterospecific neighbors revealed evidence for strong competitive interactions at neighborhood scales of up to 5 m for most woody plant species. Thus, woody plants were aggregated in clumps despite significantly decreased growth rates in close proximity to neighbors, indicating that the spatial distribution of woody plants in this region depends on dispersal and establishment processes rather than on competitive, density-dependent mortality. However, our documentation of suppressive effects of woody plants on neighbors also suggests a potentially important role for tree-tree competition in controlling vegetation structure and indicates that the balanced-competition hypothesis may contribute to well-known patterns in maximum tree cover across rainfall gradients in Africa.

AB The international wildlife trade has spread numerous species across the planet and reduced populations of many of these same species in their native ranges. In some cases, the intentional or accidental release of traded organisms has led to the establishment of populations beyond their native ranges, in urban centers or adjacent wilderness and often with negative environmental consequences. Here, we describe examples of the conservation dilemma posed by introduced, threatened species and highlight ways to mitigate the threats presented by introduced populations - as well as the threats facing native populations - of the same species. Managing introduced populations - either by using them as substitutes to help offset the demand for wild-caught organisms or by translocating them in an effort to reinforce imperiled populations within their native ranges - represents a currently underutilized solution to two pressing conservation problems. Alternatively, naturalized populations could serve as research surrogates to facilitate an understanding of the natural history of the species in its native range. Such creative conservation strategies could help stem the continuing worldwide degradation of biodiversity.

AB Changes in the spatial distribution of resources constitute an indicator of degradation of arid grazing lands. In arid and semi-arid ecosystems, the distribution of soil resources has been commonly associated with the structure and the spatial arrangements of the vegetation. Although the formation of "fertile islands" beneath vegetation patches is well documented, much less is known about the changes induced by grazing systems on the distribution of soil resources. We examine how pastoralist settlements are affecting the spatial distribution of soil resources and the soil nutrient balance in central-western woodlands of Argentina. We analyzed the distribution of soil water, chloride, nitrate, total nitrogen, and organic matter at increasing distances from livestock corrals and in undisturbed woodlands, at different soil depths. We also calculated variation indexes of soil organic matter and total nitrogen produced by livestock settlements, as an indicator of degree of deterioration or improvement of the soils. The transects located in pastoralist settlements demonstrated an increasing centripetal gradient in availability of soil water and nutrients compared to transects outside of these disturbed areas. Livestock corrals create local hotspots of nutrient enrichment, but when we analyzed the effects of livestock settlements at a higher spatial scale, we found net losses of soil organic matter and total nitrogen. We conclude that the coupling between nutrient and patch dynamics is disrupted by the pastoralist settlements, which caused a redistribution of soil resources, controlled by the location from the livestock corrals. The processes that promote nutrient losses, such as ammonium volatilization, denitrification, nitrate leaching, organic matter oxidation, manure exports, and soil erosion, are relatively higher than the extra inputs of dung and urine. Therefore, this study emphasizes the role of grazing systems as modulators of water and nutrient fluxes, and soil nutrient balance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Environmental disturbances to benthic habitat on coral reefs can affect fish assemblages, with dietary specialists like corallivorous Chaetodon butterflyfishes particularly sensitive to declines in hard coral cover. However, declines in density of corallivorous Chaetodon due to declines in hard coral cover are usually documented for individual environmental disturbances, often with limited quantification of post-disturbance recovery. Here, we documented effects of hard coral loss and recovery on the Chaetodon assemblage for 31 years at four sites in the Philippines. In this long-term "natural experiment", we documented five environmental disturbance events (two typhoons, two mass coral bleaching events, and one period of destructive fishing) that reduced live branching hard coral cover on average by 61% and density of corallivorous butterflyfish by 47%, with an average duration of decline of 2 years. On average, these disturbance events resulted in an 8% annual decrease in absolute coral cover. We also monitored five periods of hard coral and butterflyfish recovery, with an average 202% increase in branching hard coral cover over 11 years, and a 196% increase in density of corallivorous butterflyfish over 12 years. On average, these recovery periods had a 2.4% annual rate of increase in absolute coral cover. The density of butterflyfish was not significantly affected by marine reserve protection, and thus, changes in butterflyfish density were most likely driven by change in benthic habitat. Assemblage structure of Chaetodon at each site was distinct and remained remarkably consistent for 31 years, despite substantial declines and recovery of coral cover. The difference in the rates of decline and recovery of butterflyfish raises concerns for the persistence of this iconic taxon in the face of increasing frequency and intensity of environmental disturbances to coral reefs.

AB Calcification and reef growth processes dominated by corals and calcifying algae are threatened by climate and fishing disturbances. Twenty-seven environmental, habitat, and species interaction variables were tested for their influence on coral and calcifier cover in 201 western Indian Ocean coral reefs distributed across similar to 20 degrees of latitude and longitude and up to 20 m deep. These variables predicted more of the total between-site variance of calcifying organism cover (similar to 50%) than coral cover (similar to 20%). Satellite-derived environmental variables of temperature, light, and water quality predicted more of the coral and calcifier cover than feeding interactions when groups of related variables were analyzed separately. Nevertheless, when simultaneously evaluating all variables, the environmental variables better predicted coral cover, but proxies of feeding interactions better predicted calcifier cover. Coral and calcifier cover were most consistently negatively influenced by sea surface temperature distributions (right skewness), but the orange-lined triggerfish Balistapus undulatus consistently had a strong positive association with coral and calcifier cover. Herbivorous fish and Diadematidae sea urchins were not positively associated with coral and calcifier cover. A primary prey of B. undulatus, the rock-boring sea urchin Echinometra mathaei, had a strong negative association with coral cover and particularly calcifier cover. Island reefs had higher calcifier abundance than fringing reefs, which probably results from high Acropora and B. undulatus but low E. mathaei abundance. When comparing all variables and models, these taxonomic associations had more influence than environmental stress variables on calcifiers. Given the important predatory role of B. undulatus in controlling E. mathaei populations, fishing restrictions on this species could help attenuate calcification losses predicted by climate change.

AB Even though African rain forests display high levels of local species diversity and endemism, their lower continental species diversity when compared with the Neotropics and Asia is paradoxical. This disparity is mainly thought to be linked to either important extinction events during the Pleistocene or at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. African rattans or climbing palms are one of the most diverse clades of palms in Africa, representing one-third of all known species. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny and temporal evolution of African rattans (Arecaceae: Calamoideae: Lepidocaryeae: Ancistrophyllinae) to test the two main hypotheses of palm evolution in Africa. We constructed a near-complete, dated species-level phylogenetic tree for subtribe Ancistrophyllinae using plastid and nuclear markers. The generic relationships between Ancistrophyllinae were fully resolved and species-level relationships are well to weakly supported. Ancistrophyllinae diversified during the Eocene with most species originating during the late Miocene after 10 Mya. This result is in agreement with several other studies suggesting a pre-Pleistocene origin of the extant African flora. Ancistrophyllinae display an anti-sigmoidal lineage-through-time plot with a moderate overall extinction fraction. Our simulations suggest important roles for an ancient extinction event at the Oligocene-Eocene boundary. In contrast, the hypothesis of an important extinction event in palms during the late Pliocene at 3 Mya is not supported. We suggest that the evolutionary history of African rattans has undergone a constant diversification rate punctuated by one or several important extinction events during the first part of the Cenozoic with most species diversity accumulating during the late Miocene and Pliocene.

AB To maximize limited conservation funds and prioritize management projects that are likely to succeed, accurate assessment of invasive nonnative species impacts is essential. A common challenge to prioritization is a limited knowledge of the difference between the impacts of a single nonnative species compared to the impacts of nonnative species when they co-occur, and in particular predicting when impacts of co-occurring nonnative species will be non-additive. Understanding non-additivity is important for management decisions because the management of only one co-occurring invader will not necessarily lead to a predictable reduction in the impact or growth of the other nonnative plant. Nonnative plants are frequently associated with changes in soil biotic and abiotic characteristics, which lead to plant-soil interactions that influence the performance of other species grown in those soils. Whether co-occurring nonnative plants alter soil properties additively or non-additively relative to their effects on soils when they grow in monoculture is rarely addressed. We use a greenhouse plant-soil feedback experiment to test for non-additive soil impacts of two common invasive nonnative woody shrubs, Lonicera maackii and Ligustrum sinense, in deciduous forests of the southeastern United States. We measured the performance of each nonnative shrub, a native herbaceous community, and a nonnative woody vine in soils conditioned by each shrub singly or together in polyculture. Soils conditioned by both nonnative shrubs had non-additive impacts on native and nonnative performance. Root mass of the native herbaceous community was 1.5 times lower and the root mass of the nonnative L. sinense was 1.8 times higher in soils conditioned by both L. maackii and L. sinense than expected based upon growth in soils conditioned by either shrub singly. This result indicates that when these two nonnative shrubs co-occur, their influence on soils disproportionally favors persistence of the nonnative L. sinense relative to this native herbaceous community, and could provide an explanation of why native species abundance is frequently depressed in these communities. Additionally, the difference between native and nonnative performance demonstrates that invasive impact studies focusing on the impact only of single species can be insufficient for determining the impact of co-occurring invasive plant species.

AB Giraffes Giraffa camelopardalis are megafaunal browsers and keystone species in African savanna ecosystems. Range-wide population declines are suspected, but robust data are lacking. Tanzania holds the largest population of giraffe of any range state, and aerial surveys constitute most of Tanzania's giraffe population monitoring data, but their accuracy has not yet been assessed. An IUCN status assessment for giraffe is currently underway, and calibrating aerial surveys with ground-based surveys can quantify accuracy of the aerial surveys to ensure more reliable estimates of populations nationwide. We estimated giraffe density and abundance in the Tarangire Ecosystem in northern Tanzania using 2 ground survey methods, distance sampling and capture-mark-recapture, and compared our ground-based estimates with those from the most recent aerial survey in 4 sites. We found aerial survey estimates were biased low, while ground-based surveys were more precise and cost less. We computed correction factors to improve the accuracy of aerial surveys and suggested ways to further improve aerial survey methods.

AB Endemism is an important concept in biogeography and biodiversity conservation, and much attention has been given to methods that operationally identify centers or hotspots of endemic species diversity to effectively protect biodiversity. China is one of the richest countries in terms of plant biodiversity and has very high levels of plant endemism. In this study, conservation priorities for endemic seed flora in China based on a distribution database that includes both specimen records and published references. In China, a total of 12,824 endemic species belong to 194 families and 1598 genera. Biogeographically weighted endemic evolutionary distinctiveness indices were constructed to identify endemic flora conservation priorities at family and genus levels. All of the grids ranked within the top 5 % for the constructed indices were designated as hotspots and conservation priority areas. Distributions of Chinese endemic flora varied at the family and genus levels. At the family level, 14 centers of biodiversity were identified as priority areas for conservation of Chinese endemic flora. All centers were distributed in subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest, tropical monsoon/rainforest, or mountainous areas of south Qinghai. At the genus level, 15 centers were identified as conservation priority areas, and most were distributed within the Qinling Mountains and further south or the Hengduan Mountains and to the east. Among the 15 centers, 11 overlapped with conservation priority areas for endemic flora families. Our analysis indicates that different groups have different diversity centers, and different taxa ranks have similar, but not identical, diversity distribution patterns.

AB Traditionally, spoor (tracks, pug marks) have been used as a cost effective tool to assess the presence and in some cases the individual identity of larger mammals. Automated camera traps are now increasingly utilised to monitor wildlife, primarily as the cost has greatly declined and statistical approaches to data analysis have improved. While camera traps have become ubiquitous, we have little understanding of their effectiveness when compared to traditional approaches using spoor in the field. Here, we 1) test the success of camera traps in recording a range of carnivore species against spoor in realistic field settings (dirt roads in a South African wilderness reserve); 2) ask if simple measures of spoor size taken by amateur volunteers are likely to allow individual leopards to be tracked in the field and 3) for a trained tracker, ask if this approach may allow individual leopards to be followed with confidence in savannah habitat. We found that camera traps under-recorded mammalian top and meso-carnivores when compared with spoor in the field, with camera traps more likely to under-record the presence of smaller carnivores (civet 64%; genet 46%, Meller's mongoose 45%) than larger (jackal sp. 30%, brown hyena 22%), while leopard was more likely to be recorded by camera trap (all recorded by camera trap only). We found that amateur trackers could be beneficial in regards to recording leopard presence; however the large variance in measurements of spoor taken by volunteers suggests that this approach is unlikely to allow the collection of further information about individual leopards. Nevertheless, the use of simple spoor measurements in the field by a trained field researcher increases their ability to reliably follow a leopard trail in difficult terrain. This allows researchers to glean further data on leopard behaviour and habitat use without the need for complex spoor analysis.

AB Although many plant communities are invaded by multiple nonnative species, we have limited information on how a species' origin affects ecosystem function. We tested how differences in species richness and origin affect productivity and seedling establishment.
   We created phylogenetically paired native and nonnative plant communities in a glasshouse experiment to test diversity-productivity relationships and responsible mechanisms (i.e. selection or complementarity effects). Additionally, we tested how productivity and associated mechanisms influenced seedling establishment. We used diversity-interaction models to describe how species' interactions influenced diversity-productivity relationships.
   Communities with more species had higher total biomass than did monoculture communities, but native and nonnative communities diverged in root : shoot ratios and the mechanism responsible for increased productivity: positive selection effect in nonnative communities and positive complementarity effect in native communities. Seedling establishment was 46% lower in nonnative than in native communities and was correlated with the average selection effect. Interspecific interactions contributed to productivity patterns, but the specific types of interactions differed between native and nonnative communities.
   These results reinforce findings that the diversity-productivity mechanisms in native and nonnative communities differ and are the first to show that these mechanisms can influence seedling establishment and that different types of interactions influence diversity-productivity relationships.

AB Resource subsidies can influence the structure and dynamics of recipient food webs in a wide range of ecosystems through direct and indirect effects. On the sub-Antarctic Prince Edward Islands (PEIs), large populations of top predators import substantial amounts of nutrients from the oceans to the islands. Guano runoff from the islands increases the availability of nutrients in the nearshore marine environment, supporting phytoplankton blooms. We apply food web models to the PEIs marine ecosystem to investigate food web responses to variability in resource subsidies. Modelled scenarios of island-associated blooms indicated small effects on the ecosystem under both normal bloom conditions and when the input of blooms was removed entirely. Benthic communities benefited most strongly from blooms and a fivefold increase in bloom production had broadly positive impacts throughout the entire food web, including the pelagic food web. Land-based predators were shown to contribute significantly to nearshore ecosystem production via their contributions to ammonia runoff. Transfers of material across the land-sea interface were estimated to contribute 0.73 t N km(-2) y(-1) to the nearshore ammonium pool. The effects of removing terrestrial nutrient input were very small when 100% of nutrient runoff was converted to island-associated bloom phytoplankton while the macrophyte production rate was held constant. If, however, macrophyte production was also supported in part or wholly by terrestrial nutrient runoff, the ecosystem-level effects of runoff variability were much greater and more broadly distributed throughout the food web. Given the potential of habitat linkages to alter or structure communities, populations, and environments, it is important to incorporate land-sea linkages into ecological models.

AB The role of livestock grazing in regulating woody cover and biomass in grass-dominant systems is well recognized. However, the way in which woody plant populations in respond when livestock are removed from grazing in the absence of other disturbances, such as fire, remains unclear. We conducted a 10-year, replicated fencing experiment in a sandy semiarid rangeland in northern China (which has a mean annual rainfall of 365mm), where fires have been actively suppressed for decades. Fencing dramatically influenced the growth and age structure of the native tree species, Ulmus pumila, which is the sole dominant tree in the area. After a decade, the density of the U.pumila tree population in the fencing plots increased doubly and canopy cover increased triply. The proportion of both saplings (U-2) and young trees (U-3) increased in fencing plots but decreased in grazing plots after the 10-year treatment period. The effects of fencing on U.pumila trees varied by age class, with potential implications for the future structure of the U.pumila tree community. Decadal fencing led to approximately 80-fold increase in recruitment and a nearly 2.5-fold decrease in the mortality of both U-2 and U-3. Further, livestock grazing generated a browsing trap to the recruitment of both U-2 and U-3, and had a small impact on the mortality of old trees. A long-term, fencing-driven shift in woody species composition was mediated via its effects on both recruitment and mortality rates.Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that in the long-term absence of both fire and livestock, native woody plant encroachment tends to occur in sandy rangelands, transforming the woody plant demography in the process. The feasibility of full livestock exclusion in sandy rangelands requires further discussion. A balanced amount of livestock grazing may provide critical ecosystem services by regulating woody cover and mediating woody plant encroachment.

AB The Afromontane phytochorion is a region delineated on the basis of shared plant species distributions and centres of plant endemism occurring mainly in the high elevation regions of sub-Sahelian Africa. We have provided in this study a synthesis of the various contexts in which the Afromontane concept has been applied in the past, highlighting many complexities, nuances and shortcomings. A complicating factor is that the Afromontane region has both a phytogeographical and ecological context, operating at different spatial scales. We note that use of the Afromontane region as a broad floristic framework is problematic because it incorporates non-montane (alpine) regions above the treeline. Going back to first principles of phytogeography and ecology, we have developed a novel framework to resolve the aforementioned challenges. We argue that the best way to make sense of the Afromontane region is to reconcile the phytogeographical and ecological contexts to a common and unambiguous spatial boundary. We also question the recognition of the Afromontane phytochorion as a floristic region in future. Spanning some 48 of latitude, it is a rather ungainly frame of reference probably immune to detecting the nuances of floristic, physiognomic, elevational, climatic and topographic variability at finer scales, particularly in the species-rich grasslands and plateau margins.

AB In coevolutionary relationships, such as those between flowering plants and their pollinators, parasites and their hosts, or predators and their prey, each species exerts selection pressures on the other, often resulting in a reciprocal, continually evolving series of adaptations and counter-adaptations. In the predator-prey relationship, for example, faster pursuit in predators leads to more effective strategies to evade capture in their prey, which in turn leads to improved predatory tactics. Although researchers have uncovered many highly specialized behavioral and morphological adaptations in these coevolutionary arms races between predators and their prey, the capacity to learn is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we explore the role of both learned and hard-wired behavior in a predator-prey model of a coevolutionary arms race, namely, predatory larval antlions and one of their prey, sand-dwelling ants. We review research demonstrating multiple ways in which the ability to anticipate prey via associative learning provides clear fitness advantages for antlions. On the other side of this predator-prey relationship, ants that live in the vicinity of predatory antlions have evolved the ability to rescue nestmates from antlion pits. Although it appears that many, perhaps all, ant species have the potential to perform rescue behavior, those species that live in the same ecological niche as antlions are capable of performing highly integrated, precise rescue behavior patterns, targeting what, exactly, has bound their nestmate, whether it be a predatory antlion or some other form of entrapment.

AB Global climatic oscillations have shaped the contemporary genetic structure of marine taxa in different ways. Previous demographic studies have indicated that various intertidal marine species display genetic signatures of demographic expansion that either pre- or postdate the Last Glacial Maximum. Such expansions and the ability of species to colonise new habitats will influence their genetic structure, but the link between scales of larval dispersal and the strength of phylogeographic structure is not always clear. We analysed a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene of 11 sympatric species of intertidal southern African patellid limpets to investigate how ancient oceanographic dynamics have shaped and maintained their contemporary spatial genetic variation. Our data show that the patellid limpets investigated display congruent evidence of spatial expansion during the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene, which corresponds with the establishment of the contemporary southern African shoreline. We argue that closely related and co-distributed southern African intertidal invertebrates responded to ancient climatic oscillations as a cohesive group. In contrast, contemporary oceanographic circulation has shaped the phylogeographic patterns of these limpets in different ways. We show close relationships between phylogeography and biogeography for some species, but not for others, despite the similarities in their life histories and exposure to the same climatic changes.

TI Landscape Suitability in Botswana for the Conservation of Its Six Large

AB Wide-ranging large carnivores often range beyond the boundaries of protected areas into human-dominated areas. Mapping out potentially suitable habitats on a country-wide scale and identifying areas with potentially high levels of threats to large carnivore survival is necessary to develop national conservation action plans. We used a novel approach to map and identify these areas in Botswana for its large carnivore guild consisting of lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), brown hyaena (Hyaena brunnea), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). The habitat suitability for large carnivores depends primarily on prey availability, interspecific competition, and conflict with humans. Prey availability is most likely the strongest natural determinant. We used the distribution of biomass of typical wild ungulate species occurring in Botswana which is preyed upon by the six large carnivores to evaluate the potential suitability of the different management zones in the country to sustain large carnivore populations. In areas where a high biomass of large prey species occurred, we assumed interspecific competition between dominant and subordinated competitors to be high. This reduced the suitability of these areas for conservation of subordinate competitors, and vice versa. We used the percentage of prey biomass of the total prey and livestock biomass to identify areas with potentially high levels of conflict in agricultural areas. High to medium biomass of large prey was mostly confined to conservation zones, while small prey biomass was more evenly spread across large parts of the country. This necessitates different conservation strategies for carnivores with a preference for large prey, and those that can persist in the agricultural areas. To ensure connectivity between populations inside Botswana and also with its neighbours, a number of critical areas for priority management actions exist in the agricultural zones.

AB Ecosystem benefits of heterogeneity-based rangeland management have been widely documented, but little research has explored ecologically based grazing systems from the livestock perspective. Fire and grazing management can advance conservation goals in old-field pasture stands in the southeastern US. but the viability of fire-based grazing for natural areas management remains unknown. Fire is a natural process in the southeastern US that can increase the forage quality of native vegetation. We report results from a patch-burn-grazing trial on a 16-ha pasture in eastern Tennessee, in which we predicted that fire would increase the crude-protein content of the stand and grazing would be concentrated in the burned patch. We measured crude protein content for the entire grazing season (April-September), expecting forage quality to decrease as forage matured. We also sampled fecal-pat density, tiller height, and frequency of herbivory in the burned and unburned areas in May and July to describe the spatial distribution of grazing before and after a four-week drought. Crude-protein content decreased as biomass increased following the fire, and in both sampling periods, fecal-pat density and frequency of herbivory were higher and tiller height was lower in the burned patch. Although the dominant native grass is widely perceived to have low forage quality, fire substantially increased crude-protein content in this study. We discuss how limited productivity between sampling events drove grazing in the unburned area, which acted as a grass-bank

AB A popular hypothesis for tree and grass coexistence in savannas is that tree seedlings are limited by competition from grasses. However, competition may be important in favourable climatic conditions when abiotic stress is low, whereas facilitation may be more important under stressful conditions. Seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in abiotic conditions may alter the outcome of tree-grass interactions in savanna systems and contribute to coexistence. We investigated interactions between coolibah (Eucalyptus coolabah) tree seedlings and perennial C-4 grasses in semi-arid savannas in eastern Australia in contrasting seasonal conditions. In glasshouse and field experiments, we measured survival and growth of tree seedlings with different densities of C-4 grasses across seasons. In warm glasshouse conditions, where water was not limiting, competition from grasses reduced tree seedling growth but did not affect tree survival. In the field, all tree seedlings died in hot dry summer conditions irrespective of grass or shade cover, whereas in winter, facilitation from grasses significantly increased tree seedling survival by ameliorating heat stress and protecting seedlings from herbivory. We demonstrated that interactions between tree seedlings and perennial grasses vary seasonally, and timing of tree germination may determine the importance of facilitation or competition in structuring savanna vegetation because of fluctuations in abiotic stress. Our finding that trees can grow and survive in a dense C-4 grass sward contrasts with the common perception that grass competition limits woody plant recruitment in savannas.

AB Animal populations are frequently limited by the availability of food or of habitat. In central-place foragers, the cost of accessing these resources is distance-dependent rather than uniform in space. However, in seabirds, a widely studied exemplar of this paradigm, empirical population models have hitherto ignored this cost. In part, this is because non-independence among colonies makes it difficult to define population units. Here, we model the effects of both resource availability and accessibility on populations of a wide-ranging, pelagic seabird, the black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophris. Adopting a multi-scale approach, we define regional populations objectively as spatial clusters of colonies. We consider two readily quantifiable proxies of resource availability: the extent of neritic waters (the preferred foraging habitat) and net primary production (NPP). We show that the size of regional albatross populations has a strong dependence, after weighting for accessibility, on habitat availability and to a lesser extent, NPP. Our results provide indirect support for the hypothesis that seabird populations are regulated from the bottom-up by food availability during the breeding season, and also suggest that the spatio-temporal predictability of food may be limiting. Moreover, we demonstrate a straightforward, widely applicable method for estimating resource limitation in populations of central-place foragers.

AB The role of oceanographic processes in mediating passive marine dispersal events is poorly understood. We conducted transect surveys across the subtropical front (STF), a major oceanographic boundary, to test the hypothesis that this physical feature constrains the rafting of detached macroalgae. Specifically, we used genetic analysis to assess the geographic origins of floating bull-kelp Durvillaea antarctica specimens in southern New Zealand. Nearly half of the floating specimens sampled immediately beyond the STF (30 to 60 km offshore) were shown to have distant subantarctic origins, despite their proximity to the New Zealand mainland at the time of sampling. These results suggest that the biogeographic composition of rafting communities is often predictable based on oceanographic features, but also imply that strong wind events have the potential to modify such patterns.

AB Woody plant encroachment is a common consequence of disturbance in savannas. Grazers and browsers interfere with sapling establishment dynamics by direct consumption of plant tissue, changing soil nutrient status (through fertilization and trampling) and grass competition. Studies evaluating the effects of herbivory on sapling establishment have mostly been extrapolated from single species. In a controlled field experiment, we studied the effects of clipping (simulating grazing and browsing), nutrients, grass competition, and their interactive effects on sapling survival and growth of four dominant humid and four dominant mesic savanna species. We conducted this experiment in a humid South African savanna. We found no effects on sapling survival by the treatments provided. However, clipped saplings of all species increased their investment in relative growth rate of stem length (RGR(L)). Clipping had a greater negative impact on relative growth rate of more humid than mesic species in terms of stem diameter (RGR(D)), total dry biomass and proportion of leaf biomass. Nutrients had a positive effect on the RGR(L) and sapling biomass of three mesic species. Positive effects of nutrients on RGR(L) of one humid and two mesic species were observed in their clipped saplings only. Grass competition had a strong negative impact on all growth parameters measured. Clipped saplings of one humid and two mesic species had lower RGR(L) with grass competition whereas intact saplings showed no significant response. After clipping, humid savanna species were more vulnerable to grass competition than mesic species, with reduced ability to use nutrients. In conclusion, herbivory increases sapling vulnerability to grass competition, with humid species being more susceptible than mesic species, indicating that woody-plant control strategies are more likely to be effective in humid savannas.

AB During a 10 d survey off the Central Cantabrian Coast, we used GPS-drifters and bongo nets to observe water circulation and meroplankton distributions associated with 4 different nearshore surface slicks or foam lines. Accumulation of larvae was observed associated with surface convergence at these slicks. Three of the slicks moved onshore at velocities ranging between 2 and 11 cm s(-1) and accumulated cyprid barnacle larvae, crab zoeae, littorinid veligers, and annelid and ascidian larvae from the onshore side of the front. The predominant onshore source of larvae suggests that, in our study area, surface slicks may result in onshore retention of larvae. Accumulation at surface slicks was greatest for larvae with swimming speeds about half the speed of the cross-frontal, horizontal surface convergence. We hypothesize that this peak corresponds to an optimum slick speed for which the horizontal surface flow is strong enough to bring significant numbers of larvae to the front, but the associated downward vertical flow at the convergence line is weak enough to be countered by upward swimming. However, we estimated that the vertical flow may be stronger than the horizontal convergence, thus buoyancy and behavioural shifts in larval swimming performance may play an important role in the frontal accumulation of larvae. Given differences in swimming capabilities of different taxa and larval stages, a surface convergence can bring about different transport outcomes, accumulating or acting as a barrier for some larvae while allowing others to move through.

AB Much of the theory on offspring size focuses on the effects of habitat quality on the relationship between offspring size and fitness. Habitat spacing may be another important factor that affects selection on offspring size when offspring disperse prior to colonization and accrue deferred costs that are mediated by offspring size. We developed a theoretical model, based on a well-known optimality model, of how selection on offspring size changes with dispersal distance. The model assumes that offspring fitness depends on both offspring size and dispersal duration and that dispersal time and distance are positively related. Such assumptions are based on thousands of marine invertebrate species with non-feeding larvae, but our model also applies more generally to any organism where offspring size modifies the energetic costs of dispersal, and there is a positive relationship between dispersal duration and distance. Our model predicts that, even when habitat quality does not vary, more isolated habitats may favour the production of fewer, larger offspring if smaller offspring incur greater deferred costs of dispersal. We then empirically demonstrate that offspring size and dispersal duration have interactive effects on post-settlement survival in a marine invertebrate (Bugula neritina), and such size-dependent deferred costs of dispersal are of a magnitude sufficient enough to potentially favour larger offspring in isolated habitats. Together, our results indicate that the spatial pattern of suitable habitat could impose very different selective regimes on offspring size compared with the effects of habitat quality. Furthermore, our predictions contrast to those predicted for seed size and dispersal in plants, where the production of smaller, more numerous seeds is often a more efficient way for mothers to access distant, suitable habitat.

AB Rates of growth and survival in wild populations are affected by the physical environment, biotic interactions, and density-dependent processes, such as growth and fecundity. However, the relative importance of these factors in long-lived reptiles is poorly understood. We analyzed growth rates of Melanosuchus niger and Caiman crocodilus coexisting in two areas of the Brazilian Amazon with very different environmental characteristics. Growth rates of Caiman crocodilus at the two sites were similar, but M. niger grew more slowly in the area with higher productivity and higher density of caimans. Growth rates of the same species from other sites and of the temperate-zone Alligator mississippiensis indicate large differences among sites, but little evidence that these differences are primarily due to differences in productivity or temperature. Demographic models used to estimate sustained yields from caiman harvests should take into account the likely importance of density-dependent growth.

   FRAMEWORK; WOODLAND; FORESTS; TREES
AB The influence of soil nutrients on woody plants is poorly understood. Are trees - fire and other disturbance factors being equal - generally promoted by nutrient-rich or by nutrient-poor soils? To determine the edaphic parameters controlling woody cover, we sampled soils and summed the extent of the crowns of trees and tall shrubs on 364 plots at 20 sites in Namibia and adjacent South Africa, ranging from desert lichen-fields to caesalpiniaceous woodland with associated mean annual rainfall of 11 mm to 535 mm. Our analysis included the macro-nutrients N, P, Mg, K and Ca and the trace elements Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn. A boundary line analysis showed that woody cover was densest, with the greatest large-scale heterogeneity, at intermediate nutrient contents, but consistently constrained at extreme nutrient richness as well as poverty. If aridity exerted the ultimate constraint at extreme nutrient richness, no such correlation with climate apparently applies at extreme nutrient poverty, where our graphs show an 'oligotrophic decline'. Notwithstanding the importance of water, we suggest that extreme nutrient richness and poverty both favour grasses over tree seedlings. This is because catabolic dystrophy - a regime in which the supply of catabolic nutrients shortfalls their demand - is unlikely in environments where nutrient richness allows catabolic rates to match anabolic rates or where nutrient poverty constrains anabolic rates. We also reason that surpluses of photosynthate resulting from dystrophy can be allocated to lignin and that the potential for woody growth thus corresponds to soils of intermediate nutrient content. This explains why woody cover is consistently but not homogeneously densest in nutritionally intermediate plots in our dataset. Hence, the abundance of woody plants in various biomes may be determined partly by soil nutrient content, particularly of Cu, Zn, and other elements indispensible for catabolism.

AB Explorations of the dynamics of nearshore regions of the coastal zone are missing from many efforts to understand larval transport and delivery to suitable habitats. Larval distributions in the coastal ocean are variable and depend on physical processes and larval behaviors, leading to biophysical interactions that may increase larval retention nearshore and bolster their return to natal sites. While recent evidence suggests that many larvae are retained within a few kilometers from shore, few studies incorporate measurements sufficiently close to shore to plausibly assess supply to the shoreline benthos. We measured cross-shore distributions of larvae of benthic crustaceans between 250 and 1100 m from shore (i.e. just beyond the surf zone) within the coastal boundary layer (CBL)-a region of reduced alongshore flow-and simultaneously quantified a suite of physical factors that may influence larval distributions. We found high larval abundance within the CBL, with a peak at 850 m from shore, and a decrease in abundance along the shoreward edge of the sampled transect. We also found distinctly different larval assemblages at outer stations within the CBL, as compared to inner stations that are more influenced by shoreline dynamics. These patterns persisted across sample dates, suggesting that the spatial structure of nearshore larval assemblages is at least somewhat robust to temporal changes in physical conditions. Thus, while larval abundance appears to be high within the CBL, larvae appear to be sparse within the narrow band of water adjacent to the surf zone. Low larval supply adjacent to suitable habitats has important implications for the coupling of supply and recruitment, and resulting dynamics of shoreline populations.

AB Assessing the extent to which populations are limited by bottom-up processes driven by food limitation is crucial to our understanding of how ecosystems should be managed. Using satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an index of resource availability, we investigated the relationships between greenness levels and African elephant (Loxodonta africana) population densities. Our results unveiled a positive relationship between NDVI and elephant densities in nonforest populations, but failed to capture any significant effects of survey area and type, number of years after the continental poaching ban and the IUCN category of the protected area in which the survey was undertaken. The number of forest elephant populations for which density estimates were available was very low, and no significant relationship between NDVI and forest elephant density could be established. Altogether, our study suggests that NDVI can successfully be linked to megaherbivore abundance across Africa and further highlights that a continental approach to energyabundance relationships can be conducted in a relatively low-cost manner and short timescale, supporting managers' efforts to identify future suitable areas for elephant populations.

AB Accurate estimates of predator densities are important for the conservation management of large predator populations. Predator densities outside of protected areas are often understudied and management decisions are based on assumptions of predator numbers. This study conducted three spoor surveys on commercial farmland in Botswana to estimate large predator densities. Brown hyaenas (Hyaena brunnea) were found to occur evenly across both cattle and game farms at higher densities than previously assumed. Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus) were more commonly located on game ranches, at or below population density assumptions. This study demonstrated the importance but difficulties of conducting predator surveys on farmland, where study animals are often at risk of persecution by landowners, due to the perceived or real threat predators may pose to livestock and stocked game.

AB In a marine ecosystem, the diversity of phytoplankton can influence the diversity of zooplankton, or vice versa, and both can be affected by the environmental factors. In this study, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the major sources of influence on the coastal water near an industrial park, following by construction of structural equation model (SEM) to determine the direct and indirect effect of the factors on phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity. PCA results indicated that the coastal area was mainly affected by riverine discharge (represented by high PC factor loadings of transparency and turbidity) and seasonal change (represented by temperature). SEM further suggested that both riverine discharge and seasonal influences can directly affect phytoplankton diversity, but indirectly affected zooplankton diversity via changes in phytoplankton. Using PCA to determine the sources of influence followed by construction of SEM allowed us to understand the relative importance of the environmental factors, direct or indirect, on phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity. When environmental changes occur, a new SEM could be constructed using the same category of physical and biological data and then compared to the current model to verify whether the environmental changes were the cause of alterations in planktonic communities in the area.

AB Body condition factors have been used as an indicator of health and well-being of crocodilians. We evaluated body condition of More let's Crocodiles (Crocodylus moreletii) in northern Belize in relation to biotic (size, sex, and habitat) and abiotic (location, water level, and air temperature) factors. We also tested the hypothesis that high water levels and warm temperatures combine or interact to result in a decrease in body condition. Size class, temperature, and water level explained 20% of the variability in condition of More let's Crocodiles in this study. We found that adult crocodiles had higher condition scores than juveniles/subadults but that sex, habitat, and site had no effect. We confirmed our hypothesis that warm temperatures and high water levels interact to decrease body condition. We related body condition of More let's Crocodiles to natural fluctuations in air temperatures and water levels in northern Belize, providing baseline conditions for population and ecosystem monitoring.

AB Predators are important for regulating adult sea urchin densities. Here, we employ remote underwater video cameras to record diurnal predation on tethered sea urchins at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). We identified four fish predators of adult sea urchins (Balistoides viridescens, Balistapus undulatus, Lethrinus atkinsoni and Choerodon schoenleinii). Predator activity appeared to be site-specific. Balistoides viridescens and B. undulatus (f: Balistidae) were the two most important predators of Echinometra mathaei with the former handling E. mathaei significantly faster (mean 0.7 min) than B. undulatus (5.2 min). Balistoides viridescens also successfully preyed on 70 % of detections, while C. schoenleinii, B. undulatus and L. atkinsoni preyed on just 33, 17 and < 1 %, respectively. Additionally, B. viridescens were behaviourally dominant among predator species and were observed as aggressors in 30 encounters with B. undulatus and 8 encounters with L. atkinsoni. In only one encounter was B. viridescens the recipient of any aggression (from B. undulatus). In terms of relative vulnerability, of the three sea urchin species examined, E. mathaei were more vulnerable to predation than Diadema setosum or Echinothrix calamaris, with mean handling times of 1.2, 4.8 and 10.3 min, respectively. Balistoides viridescens and B. undulatus both appear to be able to play an important role as predators of sea urchins on the relatively intact coral reefs of Lizard Island. However, B. viridescens emerge as the most efficient predator in terms of handling speed and the proportion of detections preyed upon. They were also the behaviourally dominant predator. This preliminary study of the predators of sea urchins on the GBR highlights the potential significance of relatively scarce but functionally important species.

   INVASIONS; BIOLOGY; IMPACT
AB Acacia saligna is potentially the most damaging invasive species in the coastal lowlands of the south-western Cape. The gall rust fungus, Uromycladium tepperianum, has been highly successful as a biological control agent for A. saligna populations in South Africa and has effectively reduced density, canopy cover and seed production of the tree. However, concerns still remain about the soil-stored seed bank and knowledge of seed bank status and dynamics is crucial for effective management. This study evaluated the effectiveness of two different sampling methods in assessing the status of the seed bank, how the seed bank of A. saligna at two different sites varies over time and how these findings compare to findings of other seed bank studies of A. saligna across southern Africa. Even with the reduction in seed production caused by biological control, numbers of seed in the soil seed bank are high enough to maintain high levels of recruitment after management or natural disturbances. Both sampling methods (grid and random sampling) attempted were effective in assessing the vertical distribution of the seed bank and estimated the size of the seed bank to be within the same order of magnitude. However, random sampling is more effective in assessing seed bank size as it was found that the seed has a clumped horizontal distribution. The vertical distribution of seed in the seed bank was found to be influenced by soil properties. The largest portion of the seed bank is situated in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile and declines in size with depth. (C) 2011 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Acacia mearnsii is an introduced Australian acacia in South Africa and has invaded more than 2.5 million ha, primarily establishing in rangeland and riparian areas. Because acacias have the capability to fix N, A. mearnsii invasions may fundamentally change N dynamics in invaded systems. This study compares biological N-2-fixation in the alien invasive A. mearnsii and the native A. caffra growing in a grassland riparian zone in the Komati Gorge Reserve, Mpumalanga, South Africa. A N-15 natural abundance field survey suggested that both mature alien and native acacias fix N under current conditions in the riparian zone. Significantly depleted delta N-15 was observed in both acacias relative to reference species, although variation in delta N-15 was not correlated with N concentrations. Calculated contributions of N-2-fixation (%Ndfa) suggest that alien acacias fix significantly more of their N than native acacias (similar to 75 +/- A 5% SE and 53 +/- A 9% SE, respectively). There was a larger variation in delta N-15 and %Ndfa in the native acacia, suggesting relatively high plasticity in its N-2-fixation contributions. This plasticity was interpreted as a facultative N-2-fixation strategy for the native acacia, while the N-2-fixation strategy of the alien acacia remained unclear. Our results emphasize the importance of potentially elevated N inputs through N-2-fixation by invasive legumes in invaded landscapes. Furthermore, they suggest that N-2-fixation by invasive acacias may not respond to fine-scale patchiness in soil N in the same manner as native acacias, making them potential contributors to N excess in Southern Africa.

AB The esophagus and intestine form the longest regions of the digestive tract in the giant keyhole limpet and are lined by epithelial cells sharing a common morphology and releasing materials into the gut lumen by apocrine secretion. The purpose of this study was to determine if these morphologically similar regions release similar digestive enzymes and compare their contributions to digestive enzymes released from other regions of the gut. Principal component analysis of enzymes detected by the API ZYM system for 19 enzymes plus EnzChek assays for protease, a-amylase, lipase, cellulase, and lysozyme identify four distinct regions of the gut: 1) crystalline style and style sac, 2) digestive gland, 3) salivary glands, and 4) esophagus and intestine. Heterogeneity in enzymatic activity was observed in regions of the gut with similar cell morphology (middle and posterior esophagus and intestine) as well as regions with different cell morphology (salivary glands, digestive gland and crystalline style). Enzyme activity in each of these regions is compared to other gastropods, in particular the abalone. Although much of the length of the digestive tract is lined by a morphologically similar epithelium, different regions of the alimentary tract produce a different suite of enzymes which may contribute to the digestive process. These data will help enhance our limited understanding of the digestive physiology of Megathura crenulata and lead to improvement of its culture for clinical research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB We need to monitor wildlife populations to determine whether management goals are achieved and to improve future decisions. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the cost and accuracy of monitoring strategies in the context of management. Using a computer simulation of a harvested population, we tested the relative performance of three survey methods: aerial survey, pellet-group counts and hunters' observations, to inform about the management of Swedish moose Alces alces populations. Where more than one survey method was used in a single year, we used Bayes' theorem to combine information and estimate population size. We used two measures of performance: the fraction of time in which the population had an 'undesirable size and inter-annual variation in harvest. Furthermore, we traded these performance measures against their cost. An annual aerial survey was the most costly monitoring method (27,000(sic)) and maintained the population within the desired range 72% of the time. The least expensive monitoring strategy (hunters' observations; 1,600(sic)) maintained the population within a desired range of 66% of the time. A combination of two relatively inexpensive survey methods (i.e. pellet-group counts and hunters' observations; at an expense of 10,000(sic)) maintained the population within the desired range in 76% of the simulated years. Thus, a combination of annual pellet-group counts and hunters' observations performed better than annual aerial surveys, but was considerably less expensive. Furthermore, the annual combination of pellet-group counts and hunters' observations also performed best regarding the inter-annual harvest variation. Management actions only maintained the population within the desired range 81% of the time, even when population size was observed without error, mainly due to variable net growth rates. In wildlife management systems, where a variety of monitoring methods are used, the overall performance generally improves with monitoring expenditure, but very few studies explicitly account for expenditure. However, our study shows that combinations of inexpensive methods can reduce monitoring costs substantially while yielding an equal or an increased performance.

We studied gradients in several case studies - successional, altitudinal, gradient of human impact, phenological, macroecological, (phyto) geographical - and tried to detect the main gradient (by direct or indirect ordination methods) and arrange the plant assemblages along the gradient. We then applied different classification methods to test whether it is possible to detect discrete plant communities. We analyzed the secondary succession of birch forests in Slovenia, the process of autosuccession of Pinus brutia in Turkey, the altitudinal distribution of communities in rock crevices on silicate bedrock in Slovenia, the gradient of spruce planting in beech forest, the influence of the introduction of non-native tree species into forests, the macroecological and phenological development of weed vegetation in Europe, and the circum-Adriatic pattern of broadleaved ravine forests. The results show that, in most cases, the turnover of species composition along the gradient, according to the integrative concept, is due to species interactions. This enables us to detect and describe discrete plant communities in terms of the central European Braun-Blanquet method.

AB Fecal pellets make up a significant fraction of the global flux of organic matter in oceans, and the associated bacterial communities in particular are a potential food source for marine organisms. However, these communities remain largely unknown. In the present study, the bacterial communities on fecal pellets of the benthic copepod Paramphiascella fulvofasciata feeding on the diatoms Navicula phyllepta and Seminavis robusta were analyzed. The aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial communities associated with the diatoms and the fecal pellets by means of DGGE profiling. Furthermore, isolated bacteria were characterized by means of partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The composition of the bacterial microflora on fecal pellets was studied in terms of the effect of the original food source, the age of the fecal pellets and the copepod's identity. Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, and Bacilli were found on the fecal pellets; whereas on diatoms, exclusively Gammaproteobacteria were identified. Especially after eating N. phyllepta, there was an important increase in bacterial diversity, although the diatom N. phyllepta harbored a less diverse bacterial community than S. robusta. Our data suggest that the additional bacteria originate from the copepod's digestive tract and largely depends on the initial food source.

AB A major life-history challenge for fairy shrimps (Anostraca) is the unpredictable environment of the ephemeral pool. The duration and predictability of pool inundations affects their life history strategy. The growth and reproduction schedule of a thamnocephalid fairy shrimp, Branchinella (Branchinellites) kugenumaensis, in an unpredictable ephemeral pool in northern Taiwan was monitored from 2004 to 2008. A total of 15 inundation episodes, resulting from typhoons or, occasionally, frontal systems, was recorded over the five-year period. Thirteen episodes lasted no more than 2-3 weeks. Two exceptionally long inundation periods were caused by additional rain events before the pool dried out. We recorded the growth patterns, egg spawning time, and clutch size of each fairy shrimp cohort during each inundation episode. No significant differences were observed in either growth or reproductive pattern from hatching to first spawning between short and long inundation episodes. The fairy shrimps stopped increasing in size during the first clutch production. Upon subsequent rainfall before the pool dried, the shrimp stopped reproducing and resumed growth, demonstrating a discontinuously indeterminate growth pattern, before resuming egg production. Body length was positively correlated with clutch size, and this can be expressed as clutch size = 0.0059 x body length(3,165). The potential reproductive fitness of this indeterminate growth strategy demonstrates optimal resource allocation between growth and reproduction.

AB Floristic composition and distribution of the Andean subtropical riparian forests of Lules River, Tucuman, Argentina. We studied the floristic composition and distribution of the riparian forest of two hydrographical systems in a subtropical Andean region. Using uni and multivariate techniques, we tested the hypotheses that a differentiable riparian forest exists, composed by native vegetation typical of the Yungas phytogeographical province, and that the distribution of vegetation varied significantly with geomorphologic characteristics. Parallel transects along the water courses were used to collect presence-absence data of vegetation in eleven sites. Detrended Correspondence Analysis defined a group of common riparian species for the studied area (Solanum riparium, Phenax laevigatus, Tipuana tipu, Cestrum parqui, Carica quercifolia, Acacia macracantha, Celtis iguanaea, Juglans australis, Pisoniella arborescens, Baccharis salicfolia, Cinnamomum porphyrium and Eugenia uniflora) and identified two reference sites. The distribution of the riparian vegetation varied significantly with the geomorphic characteristics along the studied sites. Riparian habitats were composed by native and exotic species. A distinct riparian flora, different in structure and function from adjacent terrestrial vegetation, could not be identified. Riparian species were similar to the adjacent terrestrial strata. These species would not be limited by the proximity to the river. Anthropogenic impacts were important factors regulating the introduction and increase of exotic vegetation. The lack of regulation of some activities in the zone could cause serious problems in the integrity of this ecosystem. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58(1): 499-510. Epub 2010 March 01.

AB To inform the design of MPA networks and ensure that they will meet stated goals, spatially explicit metapopulation models are often used to simulate the response of fished species to MPA implementation. Typically, such models are simply spatial extensions of traditional, nonspatial population models used in fisheries management. A common assumption used in making this transition is that R'(0), the slope at the origin of the nonspatial, population-wide egg-recruit relationship (often termed the steepness or compensation ratio), can be used to estimate alpha, the slope at the origin of the small-scale settler-recruit relationship used in spatially explicit models. This assumption is not always correct. In particular, the value of R'(0) often implicitly accounts for a variety of processes spanning the egg-recruit transition, including larval mortality and advection away from suitable habitat. If a spatial model accounts for some of those loss processes explicitly, such as by using an oceanographically realistic dispersal matrix, it becomes necessary to adjust the estimate of alpha upwards to avoid double-counting those losses. Here I present a simple correction involving the dominant eigenvalue of the dispersal matrix that adjusts the value of R'(0) to avoid this error. Applying this correction factor ensures that a spatially explicit model will predict population collapse at the same level of fishing implied by a large-scale estimate of R'(0).

AB The contribution of predators and abiotic factors to the regulation of the biomass and seasonal succession of crustacean zooplankton was studied in Lake Rehtijarvi (southern Finland). Field data in combination with bioenergetics modeling indicated that invertebrate planktivory by Chaoborus depressed cladoceran populations during early summer. In particular, bosminids that generally form the spring biomass peak of cladocerans in stratified temperate lakes did not appear in the samples until July. In July, predation pressure by chaoborids was relaxed due to their emergence period and cladoceran population growth appeared to be limited by predation by planktivorous fish. The effect of fish predation was amplified by reduced refuge availability for cladocerans. The concentration of dissolved oxygen below the epilimnion was depleted, forcing cladocerans to move upward to less turbid and thus more dangerous water layers. The effect of size selective predation by fish resulted in reduced mean size of cladocerans during the period when refuge thickness (thickness of the water layer with oxygen concentration < 1 mg l(-1) and water turbidity > 30 NTU) was lowest. The results confirmed that in clay-turbid lakes, invertebrate predators could be the main regulators of herbivorous zooplankton even when cyprinid fish are abundant.

AB Temporal variations in the concentration and N isotopic ratios of inorganic N (NH(4)- and NO(3)-N) as affected by the soil temperature regime together with the input of bird excreta were analyzed in a sedentary soil under a dense colony (1.6 nests/m(2)) of breeding Black-tailed Gulls (Larus crassirostris: a ground-nesting seabird). Surface soil samples were taken monthly from mid-March to late July 2005 from Kabushima Island. Hachinohe, northeastern Japan. The spatial concentration of inorganic N in the soils varied considerably on all sampling dates. There may be a statistically significant trend, showing increased NH(4)-N content from settlement up to early June when the input of fecal N attains its maximum, and then decreases towards the end of breeding activity (early August). Abundant NO(3)-N was observed in all soils, particularly in the later stage of breeding (up to 3800 mg-N/kg dry soil), refuting earlier claims that nitrification is unimportant in the soils. delta(15)N values of NH(4) in the soils showed unusually high values up to +51 parts per thousand, reflecting N isotope fractionation due to volatilization of NH(3) during the mineralization. Mean delta(15)N values of the monthly collected totals of NH(4) and NO(3) were not significantly different at the 5% level based on ANOVA and significant differences were observed only among the three means of NO(3)-N collected in mid-March (settlement of colony: delta(15)N = -0.2 +/- 3.5 parts per thousand) and late July (later stages of breeding: delta(15)N = +22.1 +/- 7.0%, +23.3 +/- 7.8 parts per thousand) at the 1% and 5% levels by t-test, respectively. Such an observation of significantly increased delta(15)N values for NO(3)-N in soils from the fledgling stage indicates the integration of denitrification coupled with nitrification under a limited supply of fecal N.

AB Debate among scientists about ecological dynamics and appropriate management of semi-arid rangelands has led to a challenge of received wisdoms of range management and pastoral development in dryland Africa. In our study, we investigated impacts of grazing on grass composition around permanent water points along a pipeline and around a traditional hand-dug well in an important grazing area in central northern Namibia. Grass species abundance and selected environmental variables sampled along transects radiating out from these water points were analysed using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Significant grazing-induced changes, manifested by palatable perennial grasses being replaced by less palatable annual grasses, were identified around water points along the pipeline. There annual grasses Schmidtia kalihariensis and Aristida stipioides dominate the vegetation as far as 5 km from the water points. No significant grazing-induced changes in grass composition were observed around the hand-dug well. Private ownership leading to stronger control of access to traditional wells compared to the open access water points along the pipeline seems to be a key factor preventing overutilisation of grazing resources around the former.

AB The establishment of exotic trees such as Pinus radiata (radiata pine, Pinaceae) and Eucalyptus globulus (eucalyptus, Myrtaceae) in fragments of native vegetation at the Parque Nacional Tunari (PNT, Cochabamba-Bolivia), can affect the regeneration of the native species that live there. Polylepis subtusalbida's (kewina, Rosaceae) regeneration was surveyed, evaluating the density of seedlings, their size structure, and growth forms, as well as variables of growth and survival in fragments of pure forests (P. subtusalbida fragments without exotic trees) and mixed fragments (P. subtusalbida fragments with exotic trees). Sixty-four permanent study plots were established in mixed fragments of P. subtusalbida-P. radiata, P. subtusalbida-E. globulus and fragments with only P. subtusalbida, in three locations within the Parque Nacional Tunari. Mixed fragments with both native and exotic trees and native pure fragments did not present differences in seedling density. Differences in density were related to adult native tree densities. A greater proportion of P. subtusalbida's seedlings exhibited lateral growth and adventitious roots in mixed fragments than in pure fragments. The size structure only varied between locations and not between fragment-types. Smaller individuals grew more, in both pure and mixed fragments. Greater survival of seedlings was observed in the larger individuals and in the ones that exhibited lateral growth. P. subtusalbida's regeneration in the PNT is complex and varies at two spatial scales: between locations and between fragment type. If conservation of P. subtusalbida fragments in the PNT is considered a priority, their regeneration should be favored and different measures for the management of forests must be in accordance with the specific needs given the locations and fragment type.

AB The Ternstroemiaceae is a family of vascular plants with many taxonomic problems, basically in the delimitation of some of its species. Little is known about its world distribution and about the real state of conservation of its species. An analysis of the distribution patterns of the Mexican species was undertaken to provide information about the present status of species and possible conservation areas. Also, an analysis of the species richness, endemism centres, extension and location of the areas occupied by these species with a 1: 50 000 chart index was made. Finally, we propose some of the species of this family to be included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and in the next Mexican 'Norma Oficial Mexicana 059'.

AB The conservation policy of banning pastoral grazing, and subsequently emerging conflicts between conservationists and pastoral communities regarding the proliferation of Himalayan knotweed ( Polygonum polystachyum), was studied in the Valley of Flowers National Park, a high altitude protected area of the Western Himalaya, India. A total of 10 habitat types identified in the study area were sampled using quadrats along an altitudinal gradient between 3000 and 4500 m. Plant species richness decreases with altitude and also varies across habitat types. The highest density of P. polystachyum and its associated species, Impatiens sulcata, was found between 3300 and 3500 m in the disturbed habitat types, viz., bouldery areas, fragmented treeline zone, avalanche-prone areas and eroded slopes. Eradication of P. polystachyum from the national park by managers is not going to serve any meaningful purpose to the long-term conservation; rather it initiates soil erosion and instability, hindering the establishment of natural plant communities.

AB Helcion pectunculus has an organized distribution within rock crevices with smaller, younger limpets towards the back of the crevice and larger, older limpets towards the crevice mouth. The crevice refuge provides H. pectunculus with a stable and buffered environment with higher relative humidities and lower rock surface temperatures than adjacent exposed rock surfaces. Limpet body temperatures were significantly lower in crevice refuges compared with limpets on adjacent exposed rock surfaces. Body temperatures never exceeded the rock surface temperatures. It is suggested that this is a result of morphological adaptations such as short spines on the shell and allometric growth (shell increasing in height faster than length). Compared with other South African patellids, less force is required to detach H. pectunculus from the substratum and individuals deprived of a crevice refuge experienced extremely high mortalities, 45% of limpets being lost during the first high tide period.

AB Six Spanish legumes, Cytisus balansae, C. multiflorus, C. scoparius, C. striatus, Genista hystrix and Retama sphaerocarpa, were able to form effective nodules when grown in six south-western Australian soils. Soils and nodules were collected from beneath natural stands of six native Australian legumes, Jacksonia floribunda, Gompholobium tomentosum, Bossiaea aquifolium, Daviesia horrida, Gastrolobium spinosum and Templetonia retusa. Four combinations of soils and bacterial treatments were used as the soil treatments: sterile soil ( S), sterile inoculated soils ( SI), non-treated soil (N) and non-treated inoculated soils ( NI). Seedlings of the Australian species were inoculated with rhizobia cultured from nodules of the same species, while seedlings of the Spanish species were inoculated with cultures from each of the Australian species. All Australian rhizobia infected all the Spanish species, suggesting a high degree of 'promiscuity' among the bacteria and plant species. The results from comparing six Spanish and six Australian species according to their biomass and total nitrogen in the presence ( NI) or absence ( S) of rhizobia showed that all species benefitted from nodulation (1.02 - 12.94 times), with R. sphaerocarpa and C. striatus benefiting more than the native species. Inoculation ( SI and NI) was just as effective as, or more effective than the non-treated soil (i.e. non-sterile) in inducing nodules. Nodules formed on the Spanish legumes were just as efficient at fixing N-2 as were those formed on the Australian legumes. Inoculation was less effective than non-treated soil at increasing biomass but just as effective as the soil at increasing nitrogen content. Promiscuity in the legume - bacteria symbiosis should increase the ability of legumes to spread into new habitats throughout the world.

AB The vertical distribution of the acmaeid limpet Collisella subrugosa (Orbigny) was studied on subtropical Brazilian shores. In a semi-sheltered shore at Ubatuba, monthly monitoring indicated that densities were higher in the mid-intertidal, and lower in the high- and low-intertidal. There was evidence of continuous recruitment mainly to mid- and lower levels on the shore, with a peak in the summer. Shell length increased with tidal height, and this pattern was maintained during the study period. To verify whether these results were consistent over a larger spatial scale, the vertical distribution of size, abundance, and shell shape of C. subrugosa was studied along a wave exposure gradient. Densities were not clearly related to wave action, and other sources of variation such as presence of competitors or secondary substrata appear to influence C. subrugosa distribution. Shell length increased towards the upper intertidal on more exposed shores, but no differences, or the reverse pattern was recorded on sheltered shores. These results are consistent with other studies on limpet distribution, and proposed causes include differential recruitment, migration, or microhabitat availability. Shell height increased faster with shell length in lower intertidal levels, and on more exposed sites. Foot surface area also increased faster with shell length on more exposed shores and indicate that wave action is an important factor determining shell shape in C. subrugosa. Additional sampling of upper and lower populations along a gradient of wave exposure in Florianopolis (southern Brazil) resulted in similar patterns of shell size, but the relationships between shell height and length for these populations were similar and isometric. Thus, there is a geographic variation in the vertical distribution of C. subrugosa, and possible causes include distinct physical conditions or differences in phenotypic plasticity of this limpet.

The specimen is the most complete juvenile phytosaur known, and may shed light on the poorly known ontogenetic development of phytosaurs.

AB The south-eastern Cape is phytochorologically complex with the floras of four main phytochoria reaching the limits of their distribution in this region.  We studied the phytogeography of three subtropical thicket communities and one dwarf karroid shrubland along an environmental gradient in the lower Sundays River Valley, south-eastern Cape.  Using an analysis of generalized tracks, defined relative to established phytochoria, our data showed that the number of widespread species, Karoo-Namib endemics and Karoo-Namib-Zambezian linking species increased from mesic to arid sites.  The number of widespread tropical species, Tongaland-Pondoland-Zambezian linking species and Tongaland-Pondoland regional mosaic endemics decreased along the gradient.  Sustained continuous grazing at fence-line contrast sites resulted in a general increase in the proportion of widespread and Karoo-Namib species for all sites.  The number of Tongaland-Pondoland endemics and Tongaland-Pondoland-Karoo-Namib linking species decreased, as did the number of eastern Cape endemic species.  Regional biogeographic studies have provided a number of general statements.  This account confirms that:  (a) many species (59% of the sample flora) reach the limits of their distribution ranges in the eastern Cape; (b) the subtropical thickets have strong Naroo-Namib phytogeographic links; (c) endemic subtropical trees are poorly represented while succulents are relatively well represented in the endemic flora.  However, an analysis of 206 endemic eastern Cape subtropical thicket and karroid shrubland species, which forms a major focus of this paper, shows that not all succulent endemics are of karroid origin as previously suggested.  Many have subtropical and tropical affinities, suggesting an older age for subtropical elements in the flora of the eastern Cape than previously proposed.

AB The OCBIL theory comprises a set of hypotheses to comprehend the biota of old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs). Here, we review evidence from the literature to evaluate the extent to which this theory could apply to the biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia. We present geological, pedological and climatic evidence suggesting how the island might qualify as an OCBIL. The predictions of OCBIL theory are then reviewed in the context of New Caledonia. There is evidence for a high rate of micro-endemism, accumulation of relict lineages, a high incidence of dioecy, myrmecochory and nutritional specializations in plants. New Caledonian vegetation also exhibits several types of monodominant formations that reveal the importance of disturbances on the island. Fires and tropical storms are likely to be important factors that contribute to the dynamic of New Caledonian ecosystems. Although naturally infertile, there is archaeological evidence that humans developed specific horticultural practices in the ultramafic landscapes of New Caledonia. Further comparisons between New Caledonia and other areas of the world, such as South Africa and Southwest Australia, are desirable, to develop the OCBIL theory into a more robust and generalized, testable framework and to determine the most efficient strategies to preserve their outstanding biodiversity.

TI Why do we need a wildlife consumption ban in China?
SO CURRENT BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
ID TRADE; CORONAVIRUS
AB The COVID-19 pandemic is an alarm call to all on the risks of zoonotic diseases and the delicate relationship between nature and human health. In response, China has taken a proactive step by issuing a legal decision to ban consumption of terrestrial wildlife. However, concerns have been raised and opponents of bans argue that well-regulated trade should be promoted instead. By analyzing China's legal framework and management system regulating wildlife trade, together with state and provincial-level wildlife-trade licenses and wildlife criminal cases, we argue that current wildlife trade regulations do not function as expected. This is due to outdated protected species lists, insufficient cross-sector collaboration, and weak restrictions and law enforcement on farming and trading of species. The lack of quarantine standards for wildlife and increased wildlife farming in recent years pose great risks for food safety and public health. In addition, wildlife consumption is neither required for subsistence nor an essential part of Chinese diets. All these facts make the ban necessary to provoke improvement in wildlife management, such as updating protected species lists, revising laws and changing consumption behaviors. Nonetheless, the ban is not sufficient to address all the problems. To sustain the efficacy of the change, we propose that a long-term mechanism to reduce the demand and improve effective management is needed.

AB It is often argued that biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are linked by both habitat and species composition, and that this relationship is particularly critical for mobile ecosystem service providers. This may be especially true for pollinators, which are essential for the reproduction of the majority of flowering plant species, are highly mobile, and can exhibit dramatically different foraging behaviors across ecosystems. Understanding how habitat and community composition impact pollination is especially relevant in urban environments where pollinators can promote food security. We examined the relationships between local resource density, landscape composition, pollinator abundance and richness, and pollination services in an urban agricultural system spanning >125 km of the California central coast. We used a replicated, experimental approach to evaluate the reproductive success of jalapeno peppers across urban gardens and conducted a greenhouse experiment to evaluate the benefits of insect-mediated pollination to pepper reproduction. In the greenhouse, we found that jalapeno fruit weight and seed number was significantly greater with insect-mediated pollination than without. In the field, we found that jalapeno seed number increased significantly with herbaceous (weed, crop, and ornamental) plant richness and the number of perennial trees and shrubs at the site level, but decreased with the amount of natural landscape cover. We also found that higher pollinator richness enhanced seed number in floral-dense gardens, likely due to the greater functional complementarity of a more diverse pollinator community. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between pollinator abundance and seed number, but it weakened in gardens with more flowers, likely through lower per-plant pollinator visitation in the presence of competing floral resources. As in past studies, we found that mulch had a negative impact on pollinator abundance, highlighting that abiotic factors commonly managed by gardeners can directly impact ecosystem service providers. This study demonstrates that local conditions can significantly influence ecosystem service provision and that urban gardeners need to optimize for both pollinator richness and floral resource availability to achieve optimal pollination.

AB The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau sensu lato (QTPs.l.) harbors an exceptionally high biodiversity, especially at its southeastern margin: this area encompasses the Hengduan Mountains and the eastern Himalayas, which have been listed as biodiversity hotspots. To the contrary, the plateau interior (namely the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau sensu stricto, QTPs.s.) is relatively species-poor because of its particularly harsh climate. With contrasting geological histories and environmental conditions of the Hengduan Mountains, the Himalayas, and the QTPs.s., it would be expected that floristic compositions and diversity patterns of these three regions would differ between each other. To compare the floristic diversity of these three regions, we assembled data on seed plant's distribution in the three regions based on county-level mapping from published monographs and online databases, and we then analyzed their floristic features and species diversity patterns (horizontal and elevational). We found that the Hengduan Mountains hosted the most seed plant species (8,439), as expected. The highest percentage of shrub (22.88%) and tree species (9.80%) were in the Himalayas, whereas herbaceous species (81.50%) were relatively more prominent in the QTPs.s. The Hengduan Mountains also had the most species-rich genera (10) with more than 50% of their total species diversity in China. Also, temperate genera dominated across these three regions, with a highest percentage (77.61%) within the QTPs.s. Across the QTPs.l., species diversity gradually decreased from the southeastern part to the northwest, and most of seed plants were distributed in the southern and eastern margin of the Hengduan Mountains and East Himalayas. Along elevational gradients, species richness all demonstrated a hump-shape curve, but the most species-rich elevation zone differed for each type of life-form across the three regions. Our study sets a base for exploring the origin and evolution of mountain taxa, as well as provides a snapshot of the current plant distribution, which will certainly be modified by climate change.

AB Documentation of international trade in non-CITES species is generally poor. As a result, illegal trade in nationally-protected non-CITES species is often hard to detect. To show that such illicit trade nevertheless occurs, this study has analysed import and export records of the Giant Blue-tongued Skink Tiliqua gigas for the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) between 1999 and 2015. EU trade data for T. gigas was obtained from the UNEP-WCMCM CITES Trade Database. Trade data for the US was extracted from the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Law Enforcement Management Information System (LEMIS). We observed a sudden shift in source codes (from wild-caught to captive-bred) coinciding with legislative changes, which has been indicative of laundering practices in the past. In the US, no less than 45% of all imported T. gigas was declared as wild-caught, constituting a direct violation of Indonesia's national laws and the US Lacey Act. The keeping of trade records is subjected to the willingness of individual countries, yet unwillingness to collect such data can severely threaten species when over-exploitation or laundering practices remain undetected. A CITES Appendix III-listing, obligating participating countries to maintain trade records, would facilitate improved detection and monitoring of illegal trade in nationally-protected species.

AB Wildfire regimes are changing in the western United States, yet the ways in which wildfires influence native bees, the resources they depend on for food and nesting, or the traits that influence their interactions with plants are poorly understood. In burned and unburned areas in Montana, USA, we investigated the abundance and diversity of native bees, floral and nesting resources, nesting success, and traits of flowers and bees. In two of the three localities studied, burned areas, including areas that burned with high-severity wildfires, supported higher density and diversity of native bees and the flowers they depend on for food and larval provisioning. Burned areas also had more bare ground for ground-nesting bees and more available coarse woody debris for cavity-nesting bees than unburned areas. Moreover, cavity-nesting bees were completely unsuccessful at nesting in artificial nesting boxes in unburned areas, while nesting success was 40% in burned areas. Mean bee intertegular distance (a trait strongly correlated with tongue length, foraging distance, and body size) was similar between burned and unburned areas. However, wildfires influenced both interspecific and intraspecific trait variation of bees and plants. Intraspecific variation in bee intertegular distance was higher in unburned than burned areas. Both interspecific and intraspecific variation in floral traits important for interactions with pollinators were generally higher in burned than unburned areas. Thus, wildfires generally increased the density and species diversity of bees and flowers as well as trait variation at both trophic levels. We conclude that wildfires-even large, high-severity wildfires-create conditions that support native bees and the resources they need to flourish, but that unburned areas maintain trait variation in landscape mosaics with heterogeneous fire conditions.

AB Neotropical seasonally dry forests (NSDF) are widely distributed across Latin America and the Caribbean. They possess important levels of species richness and endemism but few studies have assessed the diversity patterns and ecological relationships between the entire avifauna of these threatened forests. Thus, in order to analyse the macro-ecological patterns and the community structure of NSDF avifaunas, we generated species distribution models describing the current geographical distribution of 1,298 bird species inhabiting NSDF. We assessed species richness gradients in terms of distance from the Equator using both linear and polynomial regressions. Then, based on a matrix composed of the presence or absence of species in 563 quadrants, we performed cluster analyses (considering the Simpson dissimilarity index [beta(SIM)] as a distance measure) to identify the main NSDF regions and describe the avifaunal affinities among them. For the identified groups, we estimated the dissimilarity values, using both an ANOSIM test and the beta(SIM) index. Overall, we observed the lack of an equatorial peak for species diversity of NSDF avifauna in the latitudinal gradient and identified 12 avifaunistic groups. The beta(SIM) index among the NSDF avifaunal groups ranged from 0.05-0.73, showing statistically significant differences (R = 0.894, p = 0.001) in species composition among them. Species shared between two or three NSDF groups comprised a higher proportion (similar to 38%) than those exclusive to each group (similar to 23%). Only 35 species were shared between the 12 groups. This information supports a separation of the NSDF avifauna into two major groups (northern and southern), as well as the idea of connections during recent geological time among the NSDF in southeastern South America (the so-called Pleistocene Arc Hypothesis). We provide a scientific framework to contextualise the importance of each NSDF nuclei in terms of their avifauna, supplying an ecological basis for future conservation decisions in order to protect their diversity.

AB Impacts of predators on prey populations are incurred not only through mortality inflicted, but also from how the risk of mortality affects the behaviour, spatial distribution and resource access of potential prey species. This risk is governed by exposure to predators and vulnerability following encounters. Behavioural responses to reduce risks have ramifying consequences for habitat partitioning, regional distributions and local impacts of herbivores on vegetation. These consequences are reviewed for carnivore-ungulate assemblages in African savanna ecosystems. Vigilance serves multiple functions, including locating food and maintaining group cohesion as well as detecting predators. Prey responses depend on whether predators hunt by ambush or pursuit and whether they are mainly diurnally or nocturnally active. Ungulates can lower their vulnerability by restricting time spent foraging at night and avoid places providing cover for lurking carnivores. Risks of predation can have a stronger influence on spatial partitioning among large grazers than distinctions in resource use. Only species above some threshold size have distributions indifferent to tree and grass cover. Observed mortality rates are constrained by recruitment potential. Spatiotemporal variation in risk may regulate populations and limit regional abundance. Herbivores confined to secure habitat may generate local brown-green-black world mosaics. Less common prey species of greatest conservation concern are most susceptible to having their habitat security breached by changes in predation risk. Studies establishing baseline responses of ungulates to the risk of predation need to be augmented by investigations focussed on extreme situations.

AB Heterodonty in Crocodylia and closely related taxa has not been defined quantitatively, as the teeth rarely have been measured. This has resulted in a range of qualitative descriptors, with little consensus on the condition of dental morphology in the clade. The purpose of this study is to present a method for the quantification of both size- and shape-heterodonty in members of Crocodylia. Data were collected from dry skeletal and fossil specimens of 34 crown crocodylians and one crocodyliform, resulting in 21 species total. Digital photographs were taken of each tooth and the skull, and the margins of both were converted into landmarks and semilandmarks. We expressed heterodonty through Foote's morphological disparity, and a principal components analysis quantified shape variance. All specimens sampled were heterodont to varying degrees, with the majority of the shape variance represented by a 'caniniform' to 'molariform' transition. Heterodonty varied significantly between positions; size undulated whereas shape was significantly linear from mesial to distal. Size and shape appeared to be primarily decoupled. Skull shape correlated significantly with tooth shape. High size-heterodonty often correlated with relatively large caniniform teeth, reflecting a prioritization of securing prey. Large, highly molariform, distal teeth may be a consequence of high-frequency durophagy combined with prey size. The slender-snouted skull shape correlated with a caniniform arcade with low heterodonty. This was reminiscent of other underwater-feeding tetrapods, as they often focus on small prey that requires minimal processing. Several extinct taxa were very molariform, which was associated with low heterodonty. The terrestrial peirosaurid shared similarities with large modern crocodylian taxa, but may have processed prey differently. Disparity measures can be inflated or deflated if certain teeth are absent from the tooth row, and regression analysis may not best apply to strongly slender-snouted taxa. Nevertheless, when these methods are used in tandem they can give a complete picture of crocodylian heterodonty. Future researchers may apply our proposed method to most crocodylian specimens with an intact enough tooth row regardless of age, species, or rearing conditions, as this will add rigor to many life history studies of the clade.

AB Civil society can play a relevant role in supporting local environmental management, as volunteer efforts can be carried out at low cost and therefore be sustained over time. We present in this paper the assessment of the effectiveness of a volunteer program for the control of invasive pines in a protected area (PA) in a coastal zone of southern Brazil. Volunteer work has been ongoing for 8years and the current state of invasion was compared with three simulation scenarios of species distribution that considered suitable habitats for pine invasion. Our results suggest that management actions have been effective. In the absence of any control efforts, pine trees would cover a high percentage of suitable habitats within the PA. Eliminating adult pine trees that function as seed sources and not allowing the next generation to reach maturity has been an efficient control strategy that has led to changes in the population structure of pines in the PA. Reaching neighboring private property owners is key for the future effective control of pines in the area, as all sources of pine seeds need to be eliminated. The approach used in our study may be applied to broader spatial scales to provide a baseline for management efforts needed to effectively control non-native invasive species.

AB In Sub-Saharan Africa, resource managers often promote community-based tourism (CBT) around national parks as a win-win strategy for local sustainable development and conserving biodiversity. In Senegal, however, the social, economic, and environmental impacts of CBT remain elusive. Important aspects of the former French colonial policies are still reflected in the ways national parks in Senegal are managed. Such policy framework is inconsistent with participatory management approaches and overall goals of tourism development. This paper examines how this inconsistency impedes the contributions of CBT to local communities, focusing on: 1) the absence of communal land tenure policies; 2) the inequitable allocation of hunting concession rights; and 3) the military culture in the administration of national parks. The paper discusses how these issues reduce the channels through which locals can benefit from tourism, the collaborative space between community members and park administrators, and ultimately, precludes the sustainability of CBT projects in Senegal.

TI Does the CAMPFIRE programme ensure economic benefits from wildlife to

SO ECOSYSTEMS AND PEOPLE
LA English
DT Article
AB This study was conducted in three districts of the southern lowveld of Zimbabwe to assess the economic impact of CAMPFIRE among rural households in the area. Data were collected through surveys from households (n = 569) and key informant interviews from ward councillors from 10 communities, and historical data from the district offices between September and November 2014. Results showed that households were incentivised through direct and indirect economic benefits. The direct economic benefits were small but the households appreciated the infrastructural facilities from CAMPFIRE. About 3% of surveyed households felt that CAMPFIRE contributed to a reduction in human-wildlife conflicts. Both direct and indirect benefits deteriorated after donor withdrawal beginning 2003, as evidenced by a sharp decline in household dividends, and an increase in human-wildlife conflicts and incidences of illegal hunting. However, given that households still benefit from CAMPFIRE, more than a decade after donor withdrawal is an indication of its resilience. Revitalising the CAMPFIRE model is crucial given its benefits for households at the grassroots and its contribution to conservation. Improving transparency and providing tenure security for the hunting area in CAMPFIRE would increase effective ownership of the programme at the household level and promote its sustainability.

AB Afforestation is often viewed as the purposeful planting of trees in historically nonforested grasslands, but an unintended consequence is woody encroachment, which should be considered part of the afforestation process. In North America's temperate grassland biome, Eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) is a native species used in tree plantings that aggressively invades in the absence of controlling processes. Cedar is a well-studied woody encroacher, but little is known about the degree to which cedar windbreaks, which are advocated for in agroforestry programs, are contributing to woody encroachment, what factors are associated with cedar spread from windbreaks, nor where encroachment from windbreaks is occurring in contemporary social-ecological landscapes. We used remotely sensed imagery to identify the presence and pattern of woody encroachment from windbreaks in the Nebraska Sandhills. We used multimodel inference to compare three classes of models representing three hypotheses about factors that could influence cedar spread: (a) windbreak models based on windbreak structure and design elements; (b) abiotic models focused on local environmental conditions; and (c) landscape models characterizing coupled human-natural features within the broader matrix. Woody encroachment was evident for 23% of sampled windbreaks in the Nebraska Sandhills. Of our candidate models, our inclusive landscape model carried 92% of the model weight. This model indicated that encroachment from windbreaks was more likely near roadways and less likely near farmsteads, other cedar plantings, and waterbodies, highlighting strong social ties to the distribution of woody encroachment from tree plantings across contemporary landscapes. Our model findings indicate where additional investments into cedar control can be prioritized to prevent cedar spread from windbreaks. This approach can serve as a model in other temperate regions to identify where woody encroachment resulting from temperate agroforestry programs is emerging.

In addition, 129 natural reserves were used in the aim of exploring biodiversity patterns, identifying species richness centers, endemism centers, and for biodiversity gap analysis. As a result, nine distinct critical biodiversity areas were recognized based on high species richness, high endemic and endangered species: eight patches with highest species number (>1000 species), four patches with high areas of endemism species (>15 species), and three small areas with high percentage of endangered species (>50 species). Results showed that some species richness centers and endemism centers are protected by the current Nature Reserve network in China. However, comparing the nine distinct biodiversity critical areas and current Nature Reserves, many gaps exist, and some places with high endemism or endangered species still need further attention. More Nature Reserves should be established to protect the gap areas. This research provided an overview of approaches to establishing biodiversity conservation priorities, and of strategies for filling gaps in the existing reserve network, and also can shed light on conservation tasks for other similar karst landform regions.

AB Trap-building predators are sit-and-wait predators that construct a trap and wait for other arthropods to be captured in their trap. The abiotic features of their microhabitat play a significant role in their foraging success, and trap relocation can be costly and risky. Wormlions are fly larvae that construct pits in loose soil to catch prey that fall into their pit-traps and serve as a fine example of a trap-building predator. Wormlions flourish in cities and often occur under buildings that provide shelter from direct sunlight and rain. Here, we studied in the laboratory and in the field the effect of simulated rain and soil moisture on wormlion (Vermileo sp.) habitat choice, response to prey and prey escape success. Wet soil had a strong negative effect on the wormlion pit size and its response to prey, and a positive effect on the probability of ant prey escaping the pit-trap. All these limitations led to a strong avoidance by wormlions of wet soil both before and after a pit was constructed, even at the cost of pit relocation. A field experiment comparing wet and dry plots nevertheless failed to show the expected directional relocation from wet to dry plots, and we provide several explanations as to why the patterns detected in the laboratory were less clear in the field. We suggest that rain presents a considerable limiting factor for wormlion hunting success, and that rain-shielding artificial structures could be responsible for the success of these predators in urban environments. It remains to be tested whether our results hold true for other trap-building predators and whether their preference for dry habitats is as strong as that of wormlions.

AB Protected areas (PM) in Central Africa provide unprecedented opportunities to maintain ecosystem integrity and safeguard the unique wildlife of one of the most biodiverse regions in the world. However, conflicts exist between wildlife protection, and the needs of human populations adjacent to PM. Although the use of wildlife resources within PM is nominally regulated, wildlife exploitation in the areas surrounding parks benefit human nutrition and livelihoods of adjacent populations. In 2013-2014, we interviewed 28% of all known households in 37 villages surrounding the Odzala Kokoua National Park (OKNP), Republic of Congo. We gathered information on bushmeat consumption, income, material assets, and hunter perception of the state of wildlife. We show that bushmeat species (mostly duikers, small monkeys and porcupine) were consumed in 38-48% of meals, and 20-30% of households earned cash from hunting wildlife in most villages; more than any other single source of revenue, except cocoa. Although it remains unknown whether the park was a reservoir for wildlife for areas around the studied villages, we showed that more bushmeat was consumed closer to OKNP. By contrast, income from bushmeat sales in villages closer to markets was greater, and as a corollary, market access and household wealth were positively correlated. Overall, total household income, income from bushmeat sales, travel time, and distance to the OKNP were good predictors of household wealth. Wildlife, although considered more abundant around villages closest to the park, was perceived as generally declining around all village groups. Our results highlight the possible importance of PM and adjacent areas as reservoirs of wildlife and in maintaining wild meat resources used by the surrounding human populations.

AB Populations of invasive wild mammals have contributed significantly to the total unwanted impacts of biological invasions. They are known to impact forest ecosystems globally, but reviews summarizing this information are currently lacking. Here we (1) review the ecological characteristics of mammal invasions in forests; (2) characterize the range of ecological impacts on forest communities and the economic consequences of those impacts; (3) review what is known about interactions between the impacts of invasive mammals and other drivers of global change; and (4) consider the complex ecological and socio-economic challenges of simultaneously managing multiple invasive mammals and native biota affected by them. The unwanted impacts of invasive herbivores and predators are intensifying in many parts of the world and the need to manage their impacts to prevent further loss of indigenous biodiversity and damage to productive assets is greater than ever. However, management needs to be conducted within appropriate social, cultural, ethical, and animal welfare frameworks. Achieving effective management of populations of mammals invasive in forest ecosystems will require the filling of many knowledge gaps, including: better understanding their impacts; strategic options and tactical solutions for managing them; and achieving social licence to operate.

AB Background: International travel has an important role in transmission of emerging infectious diseases. We described the imported infectious diseases in Korea from 2003 to 2012, and to analyze association of travels with the change in the incidences.
   Methods: We used National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System to investigate the incidence of salmonellosis, shigellosis, malaria, and dengue. Data from Korea Tourism Organization was used to describe the inbound and outbound travelers by their age group, gender, and purpose of travel. We assessed association between international travel and the incidence of the infectious diseases, and seasonal variability.
   Results: Among 1849 imported cases, dengue comprised the largest number with 631 cases. The proportion of imported cases among total cases gradually increased from 4.1% in 2003 to 30.3% in 2012 (P < 0.001). There was a positive correlation between the number of travelers and the number of imported cases of shigellosis, dengue (P < 0.001), but not for malaria. Seasonal variability was observed for importation of salmonellosis, shigellosis and dengue fever (P = 0.005).
   Conclusion: International travel was associated with the incidence of imported infectious diseases in Korea. Pre-travel consultation for international travelers planned to visit endemic area should be recommended strongly. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Latitudinal gradients in the strength of biotic interactions have long been proposed, but empirical evidence for the expectation of more intense predation, herbivory and competition at low latitudes has been mixed. Here, we use a meta-analysis to test the prediction that predation pressure on sea urchins, a group of consumers with a particularly strong influence on community structure in the world's oceans, is strongest in the tropics. We then examine which biotic and abiotic factors best correlate with biogeographic and within habitat patterns in sea urchin responses to predation. Consistent with expectations, predator impacts on sea urchins were highest in tropical coral reefs and decreased towards the poles in rocky reef habitats (> 25 degrees absolute latitude). However, latitude and temperature were weakly correlated with effect sizes, and the strongest predictor of predator impacts was sea urchin species. This suggests an important role of prey identity (i.e. traits including behaviour, physical, and chemical defences) rather than large scale abiotic factors in determining variation in interaction strengths. Ecosystem-shaping sea urchins such as Tripneustes gratilla, Diadema savignyi and Centrostephanus rodgersii were strongly impacted by consumers, indicating a tight coupling between predators of these species and their boom and bust prey. Anthropogenic activities such as over-fishing, climate change and habitat destruction are causing rapid environmental change, and understanding how predation pressure varies with temperature, across habitats and among prey species, will aid in predicting the likelihood of ecosystem wide effects (via trophic cascades).

AB A behavioural ecological approach to the relationship between pit-digging larval antlions and their common prey, ants, provides yet another example of how the specific ecological niche that species inhabit imposes selection pressures leading to unique behavioural adaptations. Antlions rely on multiple strategies to capture prey with a minimal expenditure of energy and extraordinary efficiency while ants employ several different strategies for avoiding capture, including rescue of trapped nestmates. Importantly, both ants and antlions rely heavily on their capacity for learning, a tool that sometimes is overlooked in predator-prey relationships, leading to the implicit assumption that behavioural adaptations are the result of fixed, hard-wired responses. Nonetheless, like hard-wired responses, learned behaviour, too, is uniquely adapted to the ecological niche, a reminder that the expression of associative learning is species-specific. Beyond the study of ants and antlions, per se, this particular predator-prey relationship reveals the important role that the capacity to learn plays in coevolutionary arms races.

Our main objective was to evaluate the combined effects of climate (mild-summer and warm-summer climate), habitat (oak forest and shrubland), and disturbance (vegetation removal and non-disturbance) on the seedling establishment of species in semi- and natural habitats. Furthermore, we tested the effect of the "sowing season" (autumn and spring) on seedling emergence and survival. Overall, seedling establishment of both species was enhanced by light and water. However, we found important interactions among climate, habitat, and disturbance on both species' emergence and survival. The differences between habitats were more evident in the mild-summer climate than in the warm-summer climate. Our results also suggested that seedling survival may be enhanced by shrub cover in drier conditions (warm-summer climate). Eucalyptus globulus appears more sensitive to drought and disturbance changes than P. pinaster. In shrublands and mild-summer climate conditions, disturbance especially promoted E. globulus seedling establishment, while the forest canopy and the shade appeared to control it in both climatic conditions. After the first summer life, very low seedling survival was observed in both species, although the colonization of new areas appeared to be more limited for E. globulus. Our study suggests that climate conditions influence the effect (direction and intensity) of habitat and disturbance (plant-plant interactions) on seedling survival. Thus, the effect of light availability (forest canopy) and disturbance (vegetation removal) on these species establishment is climate context-dependent. This study presents very useful information to understand future shifts in these species distribution and has direct applications for the management of natural establishment outside the planted areas, and the management of the understorey to favor forest regeneration or limit forest colonization.

TI Crossover phenomena of percolation transition in evolution networks with
   hybrid attachment
SO CHAOS

DT Article
ID EXPLOSIVE PERCOLATION; CONNECTIVITY; CLUSTER
AB A first-order percolation transition, called explosive percolation, was recently discovered in evolution networks with random edge selection under a certain restriction. For many real world networks, the mechanism of preferential attachment plays a significant role in the formation of heterogeneous structures, but the network percolation in evolution process with preferential attachment has not yet been concerned. We propose a tunable network percolation model by introducing a hybrid mechanism of edge selection into the Bohman-Frieze-Wormald model, in which a parameter adjusts the relative weights between random and preferential selections. A large number of simulations indicate that there exist crossover phenomena of percolation transition by adjusting the parameter in the evolution processes. When the strategy of selecting a candidate edge is dominated by random selection, a single discontinuous percolation transition occurs. When a candidate edge is selected more preferentially based on nodes degree, the size of the largest component undergoes multiple discontinuous jumps, which exhibits a peculiar difference from the network percolation of random selection with a certain restriction. Besides, the percolation transition becomes continuous when the candidate edge is selected completely preferentially. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB A checklist to the trees and shrubs of Upper Katanga (the Zambezian part of Katanga, ca. 260,000 km(2)) (D.R. Congo) is presented. It comprises 694 taxa (664 species, 15 subspecies, 15 varieties). For each accepted taxon the list provides habitat and geographic distribution. Eleven taxa are new records for the D.R. Congo and 29 are new records for Upper Katanga. Fourteen new synonyms are proposed. Two families stand out as particularly species-rich, i.e. Fabaceae (110 taxa, i.e. Caesalpinioideae: 50; Faboideae: 29; Mimosoideae: 31) and Rubiaceae (74). Six genera comprise 10 taxa or more i.e. Ficus (25), Combretum (17), Monotes (17), Brachystegia (15), Diospyros (11), Acacia (11). The three most important woody vegetation types in Upper Katanga have different phytogeographic and taxonomic assemblages: miombo woodland (254 taxa, 62% of which are Zambezian, over-representation of Caesalpinioideae), riverine and swamp forest (196 taxa, 36% of which are Guineo-Congolian, 17% Afromontane), and Zambezian dry evergreen forest (117 taxa, 37% of which are Guineo-Congolian, Rubiaceae over-represented). Twenty taxa (3%) are strictly endemic to Upper Katanga, most of which occur only in the Katango-Zambian sector of the Zambezian region. Taxonomic uncertainties are emphasized including 13 endemics known by one or two collections only. Forty-nine taxa are almost exclusively associated with termite mounds. For the miombo woodlands eight ecological groups of indicator species are proposed.

AB Drought can affect forest structure and function at various spatial and temporal scales. Forest response and recovery from drought may be a result of position within landscape. Longleaf pine forests in the United States have been observed to reduce their carbon sequestration capacity during drought. We collected eddy covariance data at the ends of an edaphic longleaf pine gradient (xeric and mesic sites) over seven years; two years of normal rainfall were followed by 2.5 years of drought, then 2.5 years of normal or slightly above-average rainfall. Drought played a significant role in reducing the physiological capacity of the sites and was compounded when prescribed fire occurred during the same periods. The mesic site has a 40% greater basal area then the xeric site, which accounts for its larger sequestration capacity; however, both sites show the same range of variance in fluxes over the course of the study. Following drought, both sites became carbon sinks. However, the xeric site had a longer carry-over effect and never returned to pre-drought function. Although this study encompassed seven years, we argue that longer studies with greater spatial variance must be undertaken to develop a more comprehensive understanding of forest response to changing climate.

AB The soils of the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica are considered weakly developed. Chemical weathering processes are generally considered to be negligible except in areas that receive large additions of seabird guano. In this paper we describe and analyze 19 soils on Hurd Peninsula, Livingston Island in the South Shetland Island Archipelago. The soils were classified according to US Soil Taxonomy and were generally weakly developed Gelorthents, Humigelepts and Haplorthels. However, B horizon formation, rubification and increases in extractable Fe and Al were observed on toposequences of raised beaches. The deposition of tephra and/or guano is likely responsible for the chemically driven processes. Guano deposits contain phosphates and oxalic acid, causing phosphatization and/or dissolution of silicates. Input of tephra with easily weatherable minerals may account for metastable mineral formation. Tephra deposition in the oldest raised beaches has formed a fine-textured mantle overlying the coarser textured subsoils. Highly weatherable tephra, as opposed to guano deposition, appears to influence soil formation at Hurd Peninsula. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the high content of viable seeds, topsoil is usually spread on ground left bare during railway and motorway construction to facilitate the regeneration of vegetation cover. However, during handling of the topsoil, seeds are often buried deeply and they cannot germinate or the seedlings cannot emerge from depth. This study experimentally explores the predictive value of seed mass for seed germination, mortality and seedling emergence at different burial depths for 13 common annual species in semiarid Mediterranean environments. We separate the effect of burial depth on germination and emergence by means of two experiments. In the germination experiment, five replicates of 20 seeds for each species were buried at depths ranging from 0 to 4 cm under greenhouse conditions. Germinated and empty or rotten seeds were counted after 8 weeks. In the emergence experiment, five replicates of four newly-germinated seeds per species were buried at the same depths under controlled conditions and emergence was recorded after 3 weeks. The effect of burial depth on percentage of germination and seedling emergence was dependent on seed size. Although all species showed a decrease in germination with burial depth, this decrease was greater for small-than large-seeded species. Percentage of emergence was positively related to seed mass but negatively related to burial depth. Seed mortality was higher for small-than large-seeded species, but there was no general effect of burial depth on this variable. Thus, the current practice of spreading 30 cm deep layers of topsoil in post-construction restoration projects is unadvisable. In this restoration scenario, thinner layers of topsoil should be used to achieve the maximum potential of the topsoil for germination and seedling establishment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB Exurban development (e.g., second homes) in woodlands spreads urban land use impacts beyond suburbs, but because exurban developments often retain many components of original ecosystem structure-such as a forest canopy rather than open lawn-their ecological impacts may be underestimated. Changes in seed-dispersing ant behavior prompted by exurban land use, such as edge avoidance, may pose deleterious impacts on the woodland plants (myrmecochores) they disperse, and hence the floristic diversity of exurban forests. We examined the effects of exurbanization on seed-dispersing ant nesting and foraging, seed retrieval, dispersal direction and subsequent impact on myrmecochores. We used a matrix of forested and exurbanized habitats to test whether (1) exurban edges decrease ant nest colonization and seed foraging, (2) ants disperse seeds away from exurban edges, and (3) consequently, there is lower ant-dispersed plant abundance nearer exurban edges. We found that exurban development poses little impact on keystone seed-dispersing ants because they foraged, colonized and thrived in fragmented woodland habitats as well as they did in intact forests. Exurban edges changed ant behavior, however, so that they generally moved seeds toward forest interiors, and, hence, away from edges. Corresponding to this behavioral change, we found that ant-dispersed plants declined with proximity to edges, whereas other woodland herbs with dispersal modes other than ants were unaffected. Exurbanization poses little threat to seed-dispersing ant viability, but, by changing foraging patterns (specifically, limiting the directionality of dispersal), it indirectly threatens the plants they disperse. Edge effects on biota commonly are associated with cascades through abiotic resources, but we show a deleterious biotic cascade between exurban edge, keystone ants and herbaceous plants. Species-mediated services, such as seed dispersal and pollination, are key resources, and assessing the full consequences of land use change therefore necessitates evaluation of impacts on biotic interactions.

AB Plant-pollinator interactions are often thought to have been a decisive factor in the diversification of flowering plants, but to be of little or no importance for the maintenance of existing plant diversity. In a recent opinion paper, Pauw (2013 Trends Ecol. Evol. 28, 30-37. (doi:10.1016/j.tree.2012.07.019)) challenged this view by proposing a mechanism of diversity maintenance based on pollination niche partitioning. In this article, I investigate under which conditions the mechanism suggested by Pauw can promote plant coexistence, using a mathematical model of plant and pollinator population dynamics. Numerical simulations show that this mechanism is most effective when the costs of searching for flowers are low, pollinator populations are strongly limited by resources other than pollen and nectar, and plant-pollinator interactions are sufficiently specialized. I review the empirical literature on these three requirements, discuss additional factors that may be important for diversity maintenance through pollination niche partitioning, and provide recommendations on how to detect this coexistence mechanism in natural plant communities.

AB Tree-grass competition is recognized as an important ecological process in savannas and woodlands, yet we only have a limited understanding of how it varies across tree species, particularly in relation to water use and root morphology. We grew seedlings of three African savanna tree species either with or without grasses in a greenhouse experiment over 8 months. We measured soil moisture content at three depths throughout the course of the experiment and measured seedling height, root depth, and root allocation as a function of depth at the end of the experiment. The tree species differed markedly in their response to grass competition, ranging between a reduction > 50 % in relative growth rate to no effect. The species also differed in terms of relative root mass allocation with depth, despite a lack of maximum rooting depth differences. Against expectations, the species with the deepest rooting allocation was highly susceptible to competition from grasses. Grass presence led to a reduction of soil moisture in relation to controls and the reduction increased as a function of depth. Analysis of soil moisture reductions during dry periods indicated that grass uptake was dominant in the upper soil layers, suggesting that lower water availability at depth associated with the presence of grass was the result of reduced flow to deeper layers. We hypothesize that shallow-rooted tree species may be able to successfully engage in exploitative competition with grasses, but deep-rooted species may be exposed to interference competition when water is limiting.

AB Information on the bacterial community associated with octopus is very scarce, unlike fish and other molluscs. This study revealed the bacterial community associated with digestive tract of wild Chilean octopus Octopus mimus using a culture-dependent method and 16S rDNA clone library. Moreover, we analysed the bacterial nutritional enzyme activity of culturable bacteria. A culture-dependent method showed that the composition of the culturable bacterial community was substantially different between female and male octopus. The predominant species in female octopus were Vibrionaceae and Streptococcaceae, whereas only Vibrionaceae was dominated in male octopus. Bacterial nutritional enzyme activities of culturable bacteria from male octopus were much higher than female octopus. The 16S rDNA clone library analysis showed that the bacterial community of male octopus exhibited a higher diversity than that of female octopus. The genus Mycoplasma was the predominant bacteria in the digestive tract of all octopus samples. The results obtained in this study raise the possibility that each octopus has different food consumption due to different bacterial community and nutritional enzyme activity, although Mycoplasma sp. is one of the predominant bacteria in the digestive tract. Moreover, our results are useful for the future of microbiological investigation associated with the octopus and for probiotics in the octopus aquaculture.

AB Branchinecta lindahli is a broadly distributed fairy shrimp, reported from a range of temporary wetland habitat types in arid western North America. This species' eggs hatch after the habitat dries, refills from seasonal rain, and receives a strong cold shock during the winter low temperatures. I studied phenotypic variation in temperature responses in cultures collected from four populations across 8 degrees of latitude with low average temperatures ranging from -8 to 8 degrees C. Time to maturation, mature body size and first clutch size decreased, as temperature increased, with only minor body size variability at mortality, regardless of culture origin. No variation in individual egg size was observed, demonstrating that body size is sacrificed to produce at least a few normal eggs during unfavourable years. Latitudinal variation in hatching temperature demonstrated a pattern of adaptive significance, with some overlap between regional temperature hatching cues. Phenotypic hatching temperature and growth rate responses may cause genetic segregation, selecting one cohort for warmer, dryer years and one cohort for cooler, wetter years. Drier year selected cohorts can exploit habitats that have shorter hydroperiods even in wet years. This may lead to population specialisation and speciation by adapting to more extreme habitats.

AB Establishing and monitoring population trends is essential for implementing informed and timely management decisions and also for the conservation of threatened species. We examined changes in Nile Crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) population size and changes in the size-class distribution within the population using aerial and ground survey data from 1971-2009 in the Ndumo Game Reserve (NGR), South Africa. In addition, crocodiles were caught opportunistically for aging, sexing, and tagging. Precision and accuracy of population estimates were affected by water level, season, and the use of different observers. Future surveys should occur in austral winter and at low water levels. The NGR population increased from an absolute abundance of 348 (+/- 3.4; an estimate of precision based on 1 SE) in the early 1970s to maximum absolute abundance of 992 (+/- 58.7) in 1994 as a result of a restocking program initiated in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The population structure is currently skewed towards subadults and adults and the current population is in decline. This is a result of low recruitment levels in NGR, which are unable to sustain the artificially high population size created by the restocking program. Also contributing to this decline is the poaching of crocodiles and destruction of suitable and historical nest sites. Sex ratios were skewed toward females in juveniles and subadults and toward males in adults, while the overall sex ratio in the population was even. The current NGR Nile Crocodile population is estimated at an absolute abundance of 846 (+/- 263). We predict that the NGR Nile Crocodile population will continue to decline in the future as part of the natural process, but the decline will be accelerated on account of poaching, uncontrolled harvesting, and destruction of nesting habitat.

A laboratory experiment was conducted on polyps of A. aurita attached to oyster shells collected in 2013 from the Port of Koper, Slovenia (North Adriatic Sea). The purpose of the present work is twofold: to study how the substrate availability may affect the growth of the polyps (and consequently of the jellyfish) population, and to propose an example for the classic logistic equation, both in high density (over the equilibrium) and in low density (under the equilibrium).

AB We analyzed delta N-15 in both acid-treated and untreated sediment profiles fromMcMurdo Sound of the Ross Sea region, East Antarctica thatwere influenced by penguin guano. The difference between treated and untreated delta N-15 (Delta N-15) was significant in three profiles which were heavily impacted by guano, and minor in two profiles with less guano influence. We determined that the total nitrogen in the sediments is primarily derived from penguin guano and algae, and used an N-species test to explain the variation of Delta N-15 in two profiles. It was found that post-depositional decomposition and ammonia volatilization, which have important roles in the cold and arid environment of East Antarctica, would render an elevated delta N-15 through kinetic isotopic fractionation in the inorganic nitrogen from guano. N-species analysis revealed that the percentage of inorganic nitrogen in total nitrogen, indicative of the degree of guano influence, is the key factor controlling Delta N-15 in the sediments. This hypothesis successfully explained the nitrogen isotopic composition in the remaining three sediment profiles. We conclude that the parameter Delta N-15, rather than traditionally used untreated delta N-15, can be taken as an effective proxy for the strength of avian influence on ornithogenic sediments in East Antarctica.

AB Coastal dune grasslands are fragile ecosystems that have historically been subjected to various types of uses and human activities. In Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), these areas are frequently afforested for urban and touristic development. The introduction and subsequent spread of exotic tree species is one of the main threats to conservation of natural grasslands as invasive trees strongly transform their structure and composition. The aim of this study was to identify patterns of woody plant invasion comparing plant communities and environmental variables between invaded and non-invaded areas surrounding the coastal village of Mar Azul, Argentina. Coastal grasslands in this area are being invaded by Populus alba (white poplar) and Acacia longifolia (coast wattle). The height of the saplings and the richness of the accompanying vegetation were evaluated in relation to the distance from the edge of the mature tree patches. Also, the cover, richness and diversity of all species in the invaded and non-invaded areas were measured, as well as soil pH, temperature and particle size. Negative correlations were found between the height of the saplings and distance to mature tree patches in all areas. The richness of the accompanying vegetation was negatively and positively correlated with the distance from the poplar and acacia area, respectively. The most abundant native species was Cortaderia selloana. Less cover, richness and diversity of native plant species and greater soil particle size were found in invaded areas, where the proportion of bare soil was higher. Also, a higher proportion of leaf litter in the invaded areas was registered. The results emphasize the invasive capacity of P. alba and A. longifolia advancing on the native communities and reducing their richness. Knowledge of the impact of invasive woody plants in coastal grasslands is important to design active management strategies for conservation purposes.. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

   Location: Tygerberg Nature Reserve - one of the largest remaining fragments of Swartland Shale Renosterveld, Cape Floristic Region, South Africa.
   Methods: Assessment of vegetation, soil parameters and soil seed banks in three renosterveld sites, two adjacent abandoned fields, one pine plantation and one pine plantation clear-cut site. Smoke primer (i.e. fire surrogate) was applied to soil seed bank samples to evaluate fire as a possible management and restoration tool.
   Results: Abandoned agricultural fields adjacent to renosterveld remnants are characterized by alien grass cover, nutrient enrichment of the soil and depletion of the indigenous soil seed bank. In contrast, pine plantations show less alien species infestation, soil nutrient alteration and have a viable soil seed bank as well as re-development of indigenous renosterveld vegetation after clearance. Seedling recruitment was not significantly influenced by application of a smoke primer compared to the magnitude of fire response in fynbos.
   Conclusion: Abandoned agricultural fields (previously renosterveld) at Tygerberg have a very low restoration potential. In contrast, pine plantation sites should be given priority in restoration, because soil chemistry is less significantly altered and a viable indigenous soil seed bank is still present, which can be successfully activated through clearance management.

AB Fragmented forests are under threat worldwide. Understanding fruiting phenology of these is important in terms of food supply to frugivores, particularly avifauna, which can move varying distances between forest fragments. Fragmentation can affect tree species' diversity, which in turn determines fruit availability and quality. Many forest types have predictable, synchronous fruiting which is often linked to climatic cues. However, some forest types show no seasonality in fruiting and have varying fruit outputs between years. We investigated the fruiting phenology of four forest fragments in the Ngele Mistbelt Forest complex, which forms part of the Eastern Mistbelt Forests in KwaZulu-Natal, using fruit-fall traps. We hypothesized that fruit availability would vary with forest fragment size and with season. Fruiting in three of the forest fragments did not show seasonal fruiting trends and had increased fruiting in late summer and autumn months. Middlebrook showed trends. Fruiting varied significantly between months for all fragments, and where annual variation was observed trends were insignificant. The number of fruiting species per fragment varied significantly and numbers of fruiting species per fragment per month were generally low. Tree species varied in their fruiting patterns between fragments and fruiting of Afrocarpus/Podocarpus trees and the implications for endemic, endangered Cape Parrots are discussed as an example. In summary, these forests have variable and unpredictable fruiting between fragments. These results highlight the need to conserve forest fragments of varying sizes as a network to provide a year round supply of fruits to frugivores. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Strip-mining operations greatly disturb soil, vegetation and landscape elements, causing many ecological and environmental problems. Establishment of vegetation is a critical step in achieving the goal of ecosystem restoration in mining areas. At the Shouyun Iron Ore Mine in suburban Beijing, China, we investigated selective vegetation and soil traits on a tailings dam 7 years after site treatments with three contrasting approaches: (1) soil covering (designated as SC), (2) application of a straw mat, known as "vegetation carpet", which contains prescribed plant seed mix and water retaining agent (designated as VC), on top of sand piles, and (3) combination of soil covering and application of vegetation carpet (designated as SC+VC). We found that after 7 years of reclamation, the SC+VC site had twice the number of plant species and greater biomass than the SC and VC sites, and that the VC site had a comparable plant abundance with the SC+VC site but much less biodiversity and plant coverage. The VC site did not differ with the SC site in the vegetation traits, albeit low soil fertility. It is suggested that application of vegetation carpet can be an alternative to introduction of topsoil for treatment of tailings dam with fine-structured substrate of ore sands. However, combination of topsoil treatment and application of vegetation carpet greatly increases vegetation coverage and plant biodiversity, and is therefore a much better approach for assisting vegetation establishment on the tailings dam of strip-mining operations. While application of vegetation carpet helps to stabilize the loose surface of fine-structured mine wastes and to introduce seed bank, introduction of fertile soil is necessary for supplying nutrients to plant growth in the efforts of ecosystem restoration of mining areas.

AB The world is changing rapidly, challenging the sustainability of landscapes and the resources and ecosystem services they provide to people and to plants and animals. Changes in land use and climate will alter the structure and composition of landscapes, and landscape functions may also be disrupted if the changes drive systems past thresholds into novel, no-analog configurations. Although landscapes will persist in some form, it is unlikely that they will provide the same values to people or habitat for wildlife that are the focus of current sustainability efforts. Tradeoffs among services to people or resources for wildlife will be inevitable. For the concept of sustainability to be relevant under these conditions, we must ask, "Sustainability of what, for whom?" Landscapes cannot be all things to all people (or organisms). Decisions about how to balance competing needs and goals and set priorities requires an understanding of landscape structure, function, and change-the foundation elements of landscape ecology.

AB Planning for conservation success requires identifying effective and efficient monitoring strategies but multiple types of uncertainty affect the accuracy and precision of wildlife abundance estimates. Observation uncertainty, a consequence of sampling effort and design as well as the process of observation, is still understudied, with little attention given to the multiple potential sources of error involved. To establish error minimization priorities and maximize monitoring efficiency, the direction and magnitude of multiple sources of uncertainty must be considered. Using monitoring of two contrasting ungulate species in the Serengeti ecosystem as a case study, we developed a virtual ecologist' framework within which we carried out simulated tests of different monitoring strategies for different types of species. We investigated which components of monitoring should be prioritized to increase survey accuracy and precision and explored the robustness of population estimates under different budgetary scenarios. The relative importance of each process affecting precision and accuracy varied according to the survey technique and biological characteristics of the species. While survey precision was mainly affected by population characteristics and sampling effort, the accuracy of the survey was greatly affected by observer effects, such as juvenile and herd detectability. Synthesis and applications. Monitoring efficiency is of the utmost importance for conservation, especially in the context of limited budgets and other priorities. We provide insights into the likely effect of different types of observation and process error on population estimates for savanna ungulates, and more generally present a framework for evaluating monitoring programmes in a virtual environment. In highly aggregated species, the main focus should be on survey precision; sampling effort should be defined according to wildlife spatial distribution. For random or slightly aggregated species, accuracy is the key factor; this is most sensitive to observer effects which should be minimized by training and calibration by observer.

AB We evaluated the effects of afforestation on the composition and structure of southern Brazilian subtropical grasslands directly beneath tree plantations, in pastures, and in permanent protection areas near watercourses. Cover of plants was registered in 120 plots of 1 m(2) in grasslands located at two distances from small watercourses in pasture and eucalypt plantation areas within a livestock ranching landscape. Livestock density is reduced in plantation areas. Species composition beneath tree plantations was significantly different from both pasture and nearby permanent protection areas. Permanent protection areas near plantations were also compositionally different from pastures. Eucalypt plantation was the environment type where ruderals were most abundant. Growth form cover distribution in pasture areas showed a consistent pattern, with graminous herbs being the most common growth form followed by prostrate herbs, prostrate subshrubs, and standing subshrubs. In plantation areas, the dominance of the graminoid herb growth form increased markedly, as well as standing herbs. These increases occurred mainly at the expense of prostrate herbs and subshrubs, which were significantly reduced. Plot-level species density was significantly affected by distance from watercourse and, more importantly, was significantly influenced by the interaction between management regime and distance to watercourse. It was reduced in eucalypt plantations relative to permanent protected areas. Current management of eucalypt plantations in southern Brazil produce unsuitable conditions for grassland species to thrive within plantations. Livestock densities <1.0 animal unit ha(-1) in eucalypt plantations undermines the ability of surrounding permanent protection areas to act as ecological networks for biodiversity conservation.

   RESPONSES
AB Examining the co-occurrence of taxonomically similar species can provide important information about their niches and coexistence. Segregation at smaller scales can be especially relevant for grazers living at the edge of their geographic distribution, because environmental factors can lead to similar distribution. Related grazer species may show dispersive, i.e. uniform, distribution at small scales (few centimetres) to reduce interference among individuals. We examined intra-and interspecific spatial distribution and habitat use in 2 phylogenetically related intertidal limpets, Scurria viridula and S. zebrina, at the polar and equatorial edge of their geographic distribution, respectively, and in S. araucana, a widely distributed species that overlaps the range of the other 2 species across the southeastern Pacific. S. viridula and S. zebrina overlapped in a narrow geographic zone (ca. 250 km) and reached relatively similar densities and sizes. Intraspecific spatial structure estimated through autocorrelation and individual-to-individual distances was random for S. viridula and variable for S. zebrina and S. araucana, depending on the scale considered; S. zebrina was aggregated at the individual-to-individual distances, while S. araucana was mostly random at this scale. Segregated distribution between S. viridula and S. zebrina was observed at the finer scale, whereas the association with S. araucana was random. Abundance of limpets loosely followed major habitats, namely bare rock and the alga Mazzaella laminarioides, which showed patchy distributions. We suggests that similarity in population traits between S. viridula and S. zebrina found in the overlap zone may be compensated by small-scale spatial segregation. Thus, at the edge of their geographic distribution, co existence between related species may be influenced by spatial niche differentiation driven by habitat suitability or competition.

AB In this study, tundra N2O and CH4 fluxes were measured from one seabird sanctuary (SBT) and two non-seabird colonies (NST-I and NST-II) in Ny-Alesund (79 degrees 55'N, 11 degrees 56'E), Svalbard during the summers of 2008 and 2009. N2O and CH4 fluxes from SBT showed large temporal and spatial variations depending on the intensity of seabird activity. High seabird activity sites showed large N2O and CH4 emissions while low N2O and CH4 emissions, even CH4 uptake occurred at medium and low seabird activity sites. Overall the mean fluxes were 18.3 +/- 3.6 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1) and 53.5 +/- 20.3 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1) from tundra SBT whereas tundra NST-I and NST-II represented a relatively weak N2O source (8.3 +/- 13.2 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1)) and strong CH4 sink (-82.8 +/- 22.3 mu g CH4 m(-2) h(-1)). Seabird activity was the strongest control of N2O and CH4 fluxes compared with soil temperature and moisture, and high N2O and CH4 emissions were created by soil physical and chemical processes (the sufficient supply of nutrients NH4+-N, NO3--N, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and total carbon from seabird guano, seabird tramp and appropriate water content) related to the seabird activity. Our work suggests that tundra ecosystems impacted by seabird activity are the potential "hotspots" for N2O and CH4 emissions although these sources have been largely neglected at present. Furthermore the combination of seabird activity and warming climate will likely further enhance N2O and CH4 emissions from the High Arctic tundra. Citation: Zhu, R., Q. Chen, W. Ding, and H.

AB Spatial variability in the effects of fire on savanna vegetation structure is seldom considered in ecology, despite the inherent heterogeneity of savanna landscapes. Much has been learned about the effects of fire on vegetation structure from long-term field experiments, but these are often of limited spatial extent and do not encompass different hillslope catena elements. We mapped vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure over 21 000 ha in nine savanna landscapes (six on granite, three on basalt), each with contrasting long-term fire histories (higher and lower fire frequency), as defined from a combination of satellite imagery and 67 years of management records. Higher fire frequency areas contained less woody canopy cover than their lower fire frequency counterparts in all landscapes, and woody cover reduction increased linearly with increasing difference in fire frequency (r(2) = 0.58, P = 0.004). Vegetation height displayed a more heterogeneous response to difference in fire frequency, with taller canopies present in the higher fire frequency areas of the wetter sites. Vegetation 3-D structural differences between areas of higher and lower fire frequency differed between geological substrates and varied spatially across hillslopes. Fire had the greatest relative impact on vegetation structure on nutrient-rich basalt substrates, and it imparted different structural responses upon vegetation in upland, midslope, and lowland topographic positions. These results highlight the complexity of fire-vegetation relationships in savanna systems, and they suggest that underlying landscape heterogeneity needs more explicit incorporation into fire management policies.

AB Recruitment overfishing (the reduction of a spawning stock past a point at which the stock can no longer replenish itself) is a common problem which can lead to a rapid and irreversible fishery collapse. Averting this disaster requires maintaining a sufficient spawning population to buffer stochastic fluctuations in recruitment of heavily harvested stocks. Optimal strategies for managing spawner biomass are well developed for temperate systems, yet remain uncertain for tropical fisheries, where the danger of collapse from recruitment overfishing looms largest. In this study, we explored empirically and through modeling, the role of marine reserves in maximizing spawner biomass of a heavily exploited reef fish, Lethrinus harak around Guam, Micronesia. On average, spawner biomass was 16 times higher inside the reserves compared with adjacent fished sites. Adult density and habitat-specific mean fish size were also significantly greater. We used these data in an age-structured population model to explore the effect of several management scenarios on L. harak demography. Under minimum-size limits, unlimited extraction and all rotational-closure scenarios, the model predicts that preferential mortality of larger and older fish prompt dramatic declines in spawner biomass and the proportion of male fish, as well as considerable declines in total abundance. For rotational closures this occurred because of the mismatch between the scales of recovery and extraction. Our results highlight how alternative management scenarios fall short in comparison to marine reserves in preserving reproductively viable fish populations on coral reefs.

ID DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; TIME; SYSTEMS; GROWTH; MODELS; FLUCTUATIONS;
   STABILITY; ECOLOGY
AB A class of models is introduced describing the evolution of population species whose carrying capacities are functionals of these populations. The functional dependence of the carrying capacities reflects the fact that the correlations between populations can be realized not merely through direct interactions, as in the usual predator-prey Lotka-Volterra model, but also through the influence of species on the carrying capacities of each other. This includes the self-influence of each kind of species on its own carrying capacity with delays. Several examples of such evolution equations with functional carrying capacities are analyzed. The emphasis is given on the conditions under which the solutions to the equations display extreme events, such as finite-time death and finite-time singularity. Any destructive action of populations, whether on their own carrying capacity or on the carrying capacities of co-existing species, can lead to the instability of the whole population that is revealed in the form of the appearance of extreme events, finite-time extinctions or booms followed by crashes.

AB The Western Cape of South Africa is characterized by the hyperdiverse vegetation of the Fynbos biome. Typical fynbos vegetation is a fire-adapted sclerophyllous Mediterranean-type ecosystem on poor, sandy or stony soils. It is characterized by plants with low nutrient content producing slowly decomposing litter. Fire is recognized as a major factor for carbon and nutrient cycling in this vegetation type. However, knowledge of biological decomposition processes in this biome is limited. We used litter-bags to measure mass loss and changes in chemical composition in litter from three species representing characteristic taxa in fynbos, a Protea exima hybrid, Erica multumbellifera, and Restio multiflorus, during approximately 180 days. In addition, we used a standard litter of a species with high nutrient content, Galenia africana, and a mixture of Protea and Erica. We compare our results with a previous study from renosterveld including the geophyte Watson a borbonica, which occurs in both vegetation types and occurs commonly in the study area. We found that decomposition rate among the true fynbos plant species P. exima, E. multumbellifera, R. multiflorus and W borbonica varied almost eight-fold. Litter decomposition was strongly correlated to litter stoichiometry, i.e. C/N and C/P-ratios. Most litters accumulated one or several nutrients during the study period. The mixture of litters decomposed faster than expected from the results of each litter separately. Our study indicates that biological decomposition may be more important for carbon and nutrient cycling in fynbos than previously thought. These results are in accordance with recent studies showing large variation in plant litter quality within vegetation types and biomes. Such large variation in litter quality and decomposition rate suggests that some generalisations about ecosystem processes in the fynbos may need reevaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Midwestern savannas historically covered >10 M ha in central North America, but are now rare due to agricultural conversion and anthropogenic modifications to disturbance regimes - particularly fire suppression. Throughout this range, Midwestern savannas are characterized by scattered overstory trees; however, with fire suppression, these systems are invaded by non-savanna trees. Restoration of encroached savannas involves removal of invading trees, yet little is known about the impacts of encroachment or encroachment removal on the relict savanna overstory trees, which define these systems. Here, we use tree ring analysis to investigate savanna tree growth rates in encroached, non-encroached, and experimentally restored Midwestern oak savannas in central Iowa. We found that woody encroachment led to pronounced declines in growth rate (ring width) of relict overstory white oak (Quercus alba), relative to Q alba trees in competition-free, open-grown conditions, or in an encroachment-free remnant woodland. To further understand effects of encroachment removal on relict Q alba savanna trees, we conducted a large-scale restoration experiment, where encroaching trees were mechanically removed from four encroached savannas, with an additional four savannas retained as encroached controls. Restoration led to elevated tree growth rates, with these changes generally persistent through 7 years post-restoration (2003-2009). Over the course of this post-restoration study period, ring width, basal area increment, and relative basal area increased by 49%, 59%, and 55%, respectively, in trees from restored sites, relative to trees from encroached, control sites. These results suggest that woody encroachment has strong influence on overstory savanna trees, through increased competitive dynamics; however, woody encroachment removal may help to restore relict savanna tree growth rates, even after prolonged periods of encroachment (>40 years). To restore the oak savannas at our sites, and perhaps elsewhere, we advocate a three step process: (1) mechanical woody encroachment removal, (2) maintenance of the encroachment-free state through prescribed fire, and (3) promotion of a diverse understory layer, characteristic of oak savanna in our region. While promoting oak regeneration will be important for the long-term maintenance of these sites as oak savanna, relict savanna trees appear responsive to restoration and should maintain overstory conditions through the near-term.

AB The recently established Garden Route National Park (GRNP) along the Cape south coast of South Africa occurs in a landscape where indigenous forests, fire-prone fynbos shrublands and fire-sensitive plantations of alien invasive trees are interspersed. We used the area as a case study in the challenges facing conservation managers in the achievement of biodiversity goals in a fire-prone environment. We explored the context within which fire management was practised during the past century by interviewing former catchment managers and reviewing forestry and catchment management policies. Mountain fynbos adjacent to plantations was subjected to burning regimes aimed at the protection of commercial timber resources rather than the preservation of fynbos biodiversity. Prescribed burning of fynbos adjacent to the plantations was typically done in multiple belt systems at rotations of about 4-8 years during spring, summer and autumn, to avoid the winter berg wind season. Such short-rotation and low-intensity fires favour resprouting graminoids over slow-maturing reseeders, and likely account for the compositional impoverishment observed in fynbos near plantations. Current and future challenges faced by the GRNP include (1) balancing conflicting fire management requirements for plantation safety against fynbos conservation; (2) the continual invasion of fynbos by fire-propagated alien pines sourced from plantations; (3) inadequate resources to redress the 'invasion debt' caused by the socio-economic legacy and past management neglect; and (4) fragmentation of land use between conservation and forestry threatening the sustainability of the region at large. We provide recommendations for management actions and research priorities to address these challenges.

AB Planktonic larval durations (PLDs) affect the ecology and evolution of benthic marine populations through their effects on dispersal distance, the spread of sibling larvae, the level of larval mortality, and population connectivity. Despite the importance of PLDs, field estimates of PLDs in marine invertebrates are rare and restricted to specific taxa. The size of the first post-metamorphic feeding structure (the ancestrula lophophore) in Bugula neritina has been shown previously to decline with increases in larval duration. We hypothesised that if the relationship between larval duration and the size of the ancestrula lophophore can be estimated in the laboratory, then it should be possible to infer the PLD of B. neritina settlers in the field. We manipulated the length of the larval period in the laboratory and quantified the relationship between larval duration and the volume of the ancestrula lophophore. We then measured the size of lophophores in field-settled individuals at 2 sites on multiple days over a 2 yr period, and predicted their planktonic durations based on our laboratory-derived classifications. The average percentage of individuals in the field with short (0 to 1.5 h), intermediate (1.5 to 6.5 h), and long (6.5 to 32 h) PLDs was 54, 27, and 19%, respectively. Despite being competent to settle upon release from the colony, a significant proportion of settlers in the field experienced metamorphic delays that would incur significant post-settlement costs. Furthermore, there was a positive relationship between settlement density and the proportion of settlers in any one cohort that had experienced short PLDs. The extended planktonic periods that we predicted are likely to affect the dynamics of adult populations directly via reductions in settlement density and indirectly via reductions in the post-settlement performance of individuals that experienced a metamorphic delay before settling.

AB Spatial heterogeneity is a ubiquitous feature in natural ecosystems, especially in arid regions. Different species and their discontinuous distribution, accompanied by varied topographic characteristics, result in soil resources distributed differently in different locations, and present significant spatial heterogeneity in desert ecosystems. In this study, conventional and geostatistical methods were used to identify the heterogeneity of soil chemical properties in two desert populations, Haloxylon persicum Bunge ex Boss., which dominates on the slopes and tops of sand dunes and Haloxylon ammodendron (C. A. Mey.) Bunge, which inhabits interdunes in the Gurbantunggut Desert of Xinjiang, China. The results showed that soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), available nitrogen (AN) and available phosphorus (AP) were significantly higher in H. ammodendron populations than that in H. persicum. The coefficient of variation (CV) indicated that (1) most parameters presented a moderate degree of variability (10% < CV < 100%) except pH in both plots, (2) the variability of soil pH, EC and AP in H. ammodendron populations was higher than that in H. persicum populations, and (3) SOC and AN in H. ammodendron populations were lower than that in H. persicum populations. Geostatistical analysis revealed a strong spatial dependence (C-0/(C-0+C) < 25%) within the distance of ranges for all tested parameters in both plots. The Kriging-interpolated figures showed that the soil spatial distribution was correlated with the vegetation distribution, individual size of plants, and the topographic features, especially with the plants nearest to sampling points and the topographic features. In each plot, soil EC, SOC, AN and AP presented similar distributions, and fertile islands and salt islands occurred in both plots but did not affect every individual plant, since the sampling distance was larger than the size of such fertile islands. The results of topographic effects on soil heterogeneity suggested significant differences between the interdunes and dune-tops. Different topographic characteristics (physical factors) between plots result in the differences in SOC, AN and AP, while the heterogeneity of soil pH and EC arise from plant species and their distribution (biotic factor). Such biotic and physical factors did not occur in isolation, but worked together on soil heterogeneity, and played important parts in improving the soil properties. Hence these factors were ecologically valuable in the highly resource-stressed arid study area.

AB A TWINSPAN classification divides southern Africa (South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho) into two main bryofloristic regions: (1) a subtropical or palaeotropical region in the northern, eastern and southern parts, characterised by a predominantly mesophytic moss flora; and (2) a temperate or austral region in the central and western parts of the study area with a xerophytic moss flora. The subtropical region is subdivided into the Zambezian and Afromontane Regions, and the temperate region into the Karoo-Namib and Highlands Regions. The four regions are further subdivided into eight domains: (1) the Zambezian Region into the Caprivi and Bushveld Domains; (2) the Afromontane Region into the Drakensberg and Cape Domains; (3) the Karoo-Namib Region into the Western Cape and Namaqua Domains; and (4) the Highlands Region into the Drakensberg Alpine and Upper Karoo Domains. Meaningful phytogeographical classification of the arid and semi-arid central and northwestern sectors of the study area is dependent on future plant collecting or sampling efforts.

AB A fossil leaf compression from the Late Oligocene (28-27 Ma) of northwestern Ethiopia is the earliest record of the African endemic moist tropical forest genus Cola (Malvaceae sensu lato: Sterculioideae). Based on leaf and epidermal morphology, the fossil is considered to be very similar to two extant Guineo-Congolian species but differences warrant designation of a new species. This study also includes a review of the fossil record of Cola, a comprehensive summary of leaf characteristics within several extant species of Cola, Octolobus, and Pterygota, and a brief discussion of the paleogeographic implications of the fossil species affinity and occurrence in Ethiopia.

AB On the western rivers and plains of southern New South Wales, relatively small areas of forests remain in a semi-natural condition and conservation reserves are lacking. Severe drought stress in recent decades after two centuries of European management has raised issues about how best to manage these forests and, if necessary, restore them. The region was explored between 1817 and 1836. Settlers, foresters and ecologists described changes as Aboriginal culture was displaced, domestic stock, feral animals and exotic plants were introduced, rabbits were controlled, rivers were regulated, and grazing was reduced. The Aboriginal ecosystems were different to the new red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and white cypress (Callitris columellaris) forests which lack resilience. Trees, saplings, fallen timber, shrubs and parasitic plants have accumulated in recently 'undisturbed' sites and these features are now promoted as benchmarks for conservation. However, human activity including watering, thinning, firewood collection, grazing and/or burning may aid restoration whereas non-intervention may allow continuing degradation. This historical ecology and recent palaeoecology provide insights to conserving grassy woodlands globally. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phylogenetic diversity and axial distribution of microorganisms in three sections of the gastrointestinal tracts of the polychaete Neanthes glandicincta was evaluated using both most probable number method and cloning analyses of 16S rRNA genes in this study. Quantification of the density of microorganisms in the gut showed that aerobic microorganisms decreased from anterior to posterior, while anaerobic ones showed a reverse trend. The total numbers of microorganisms decreased significantly (p < 0.05, analysis of variance) but more rapidly from the anterior to the middle segment. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the dominating phylogenetic groups included Methanomicrobiales I: Methanosaetaceae (up to 66% of archaeal clones), delta-Proteobacteria (up to 42% of bacterial clones), and gamma-Proteobacteria (up to 30% of bacterial clones) widely distributed throughout the entire gut. Other microbiota distributed in different gut sections were Methanomicrobiales II: Methanospirillaceae, Methanomicrobiales III, Thermoplasmatales, Crenarchaea, Methanobacteriaceae, and Methanosarcinales for archaea; and alpha-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Clostridia, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes for bacteria. The results reveal a difference in microbial community structure along the gut of N. glandicincta. The various phylogenetic diversity and axial distribution of microbes along the gut might indicate an environmental gradient from anterior to posterior sections affecting the structure of the microbial community.

AB Exotic invasive species often affect the pools and fluxes of carbon, nutrient elements, and energy, but there are few sources of information that permit these effects to be anticipated. Some plant traits, such as growth rates and tissue nutrient content, are known to influence the ecosystem process, but information about these traits is often not available. I propose that plant secondary chemistry may be a useful trait for assessing the likelihood of ecosystem (and community) impacts. Information about such traits is readily available from several sources, rendering it a good candidate for screening and monitoring programs. Plant secondary chemicals affect a variety of ecosystem processes, largely through their direct and indirect impacts on soil microbial community composition and function. They also have well-known effects on human physiology, as evidenced in the numerous plant-derived bioactive compounds used for their medicinal and other physiological effects. There is a large amount of information available about plant secondary chemistry due to its role in herbal medicine, dietary supplements and the emerging field of nutraceuticals. This information includes databases and traditional texts in ethnobotany, plant chemistry, and alternative medicine. I review evidence that secondary compounds are widespread in invasive species and affect soil microbial communities and microbially-mediated ecosystem processes. Invasion ecology may profit from collaborations with a novel group of scientists, including those in ethnobotany, nutraceuticals, plant chemistry and alternative medicine.

AB Using known and inferred life-history information, we estimated the dispersal potential of 501 polychaete species sampled during a 1998 monitoring study in the Southern California Bight. We tested the hypothesis that species having life-history traits that suggest long-distance dispersal will be encountered more frequently throughout the region than will species having life histories that suggest limited dispersal. When all 501 species and all 200 sampling sites were analyzed, occurrence frequency (percentage of sites at which a species was collected) was not significantly related to dispersal potential. When data from 53 shelf sites in the Channel Islands were analyzed separately from collections at 147 mainland-shelf sites, there was a significant positive relationship between dispersal potential and occurrence frequency at the island sites but not at the mainland sites. Of the 501 species, 119 were collected only at island sites, 98 were found only at mainland sites, and 284 were found at both island and mainland sites. The majority of the 'island only' species had life-history traits indicating low dispersal potential. In contrast, only 13 % of the 'mainland only' species were categorized as having low dispersal potential. The 'cosmopolitan' species had a broad range of dispersal potential. Models indicate that efforts to conserve biodiversity by establishing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) must consider species' dispersal. In the shelf communities of the Southern California Bight, networks of small reserves that are located in existing areas of high diversity should succeed in the Channel Islands, where the majority of polychaete species tend to have limited dispersal potential. On the mainland shelf, however, designing effective MPAs will be more challenging due to the prevalence of species that have a greater potential for long-distance dispersal to or from unprotected sites.

AB Shoots and foliage elements of shade-intolerant conifers strongly vary in size, but the effects of size on shoot light-harvesting efficiency have not been quantified. We investigated shoot adaptation to seasonal average integrated quantum flux density in gymnosperms Pinus palustris Mill., P. patula Schlect. & Cham., and P. radiata D. Don. and angiosperm Casuarina glauca Sieb. ex Spreng. In addition, P. sylvestris L., sampled from infertile and fertile sites, and P. taeda L. were included to test for general correlations among shoot architecture and size. All studied species possess needle-like photosynthetic elements. A shoot model was fitted to the data to separate the determinants of shoot light-harvesting efficiency. The model estimated shoot light harvesting on the basis of angular distribution of foliage surface areas, degree of spatial clumping, foliage area density in shoot volume, and beam path length in shoot volume. Increases in irradiance primarily led to greater foliage aggregation, greater foliage area density in shoot volume, and to a minor degree, to changes in foliage area angular distribution. Greater foliage aggregation resulted in lower efficiency of light harvesting but greater investment of foliar biomass in high light where the photosynthetic returns are greater. The species behave similarly except that the light-harvesting characteristics of P. patula, which has long, strongly bending needles, were independent of light. In all species, the shoots were larger in higher irradiance, and the fraction of biomass in shoot axis increased with increasing irradiance, indicating greater costs for light harvesting in high light. There were further significant species differences in light-harvesting efficiency that were linked to differences in foliage and shoot size. Foliage element length varied between 1.1 and 31.4 cm and shoot axis length between 1.2 and 36.5 cm among the species, leading to 4 orders of magnitude variation in shoot cylinder volume and three orders of magnitude variation in foliage area density (rho); rho decreased with increasing foliage element length and shoot volume. The degree of foliage clumping scaled positively with r and negatively with foliage element length. Foliage clumping was positively associated with foliage dry mass to shoot silhouette area ratio, signifying a trade-off between efficient light harvesting and large photosynthetic biomass accumulation. These data demonstrate a general increase of light-harvesting efficiency with increasing length of foliage elements, but they also demonstrate that this increase is limited by enhanced bending of longer foliage elements and by augmented support costs.

AB National conservation planning should operate with measures of biodiversity similar to those applied globally in order to harmonize national and international conservation strategies. Here we suggest quantitative measures which enable two criteria of the global biodiversity hotspots to be applied on a national level for 74 large countries, and show how these measures can be applied to map national biodiversity hotspots. The plant endemism criteria of global hotspots are captured by quantitative measures of endemism, which are approximately scale-independent and can be corrected to account for a country's environmental conditions and conservation priorities. The flexible land use criteria for national biodiversity hotspots are defined from percentage of natural vegetation remaining in the global hotspots. The minimum-area-required approach is applied to define the borders of national biodiversity hotspots using data on vascular plants species richness. We show how national biodiversity hotspots can be mapped from the species-energy relationship for vascular plants using climate, topographical and land use data when spatial pattern of species richness is not known. This methodology to map national biodiversity hotspots from abiotic factors is applied to Russia as a case study. Three Russian biodiversity hotspots, North Caucasus, South Siberia and Far East were identified. The resulting hotspot maps cover national-scale environmental gradients across Russia and although they are also identified by Russian experts their actual geographical locations were hitherto unspecified. The large-scale national hotspots, identified for Russia, can be used for further fine scale and more detailed conservation planning. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prosopis caldenia Burk. is one of the woody species that is increasing in abundance due to poor grazing management in the semi-arid phytogeographic region of central Argentina, commonly known as the Caldenal. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of herbaceous cover, cattle dung, soil disturbance, and water supply on emergence and survival of P. caldenia seedlings on sites with different grazing histories: (i) a site exposed to long-term continuous grazing by cattle (grazed site), and (ii) a long-term exclosure to domestic livestock (ungrazed site). Removal of grass cover, addition of cattle dung, and water supply enhanced seedling emergence and survival, especially in the grazed site. Results suggest that factors (direct and indirect) associated with prolonged grazing history markedly affect P. caldenia establishment. This in turn alters the grass-woody plant balance, which might reduce the potential capacity of livestock production in the Caldenal. (c) 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The clonal, invasive New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum is rapidly spreading throughout rivers and estuaries of the western USA, where its densities can exceed 300,000/m(2). Although very little is known about its ecology in the western USA, P. antipodarum can compete with native invertebrates and appears to have altered primary and secondary production in several western aquatic systems. There are no data published on intraspecific competition and density dependence for this species in the western USA. Populations contain a wide range of sizes; mechanisms responsible for this size distribution are unknown. We conducted laboratory growth experiments on P. antipodarum to determine if intraspecific competition would cause shifts in size hierarchy and decrease growth rates. We used the Gini coefficient (G) to evaluate size hierarchy shifts. Our results showed that asymmetric competition resulted in a strong size hierarchy and that an increase in snail densities caused a decrease in growth. These results suggest that size hierarchies of populations of P. antipodarum might not be entirely based on age class and that asymmetric competition may affect its ecology.

AB Individual particle analysis (IPA) by scanning electron microscopy interfaced with automated image and X-ray analyses was used to characterize inorganic particles in five reservoirs and four tributaries located within the Catskill and Delaware systems of the New York City water supply. Individual particle analysis provides combined elemental and morphologic characterizations. Results are presented in terms of particle projected area per unit volume (PAV), consistent with optical impacts, and partitioned into seven generic particle types according to composition. Minerals of terrigenous origins, particularly clay minerals, dominated the inorganic particle populations of all the study systems except one downstream reservoir. Higher PAV levels were observed in the Catskill system. Particle dynamics represented by PAV were driven primarily by runoff, while the reservoirs were also greatly influenced by the timing of sediment resuspension promoted by drawdown of the surface and fall mixing. The benefit of the serial configuration of the reservoirs in decreasing inorganic particles with progression downstream towards the city is demonstrated. The patterns in PAV levels among the study systems generally tracked those of more common metrics of impacts of suspensoids, including mass concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Secchi disc transparency.

AB Aim Invasion of nitrogen-fixing non-native plant species may alter soil resources and impact native plant communities. Altered soils may be the driving mechanism that provides a suitable environment to facilitate future invasions and decrease native biodiversity. We hypothesized that Melilotus invasion would increase nitrogen availability and produce soil microclimate and biochemical changes, which could in turn alter plant species composition in a montane grassland community.
   Location Our research addressed the effects of white and yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis and M. alba) invasion on soil characteristics and nitrogen processes in the montane grasslands in Rocky Mountain National Park.
   Methods We sampled soil in replicate sites of Melilotus-invaded and control (non-invaded) patches within disturbed areas in montane grassland habitats. Soil composites were analysed for available nitrogen, net nitrogen mineralization, moisture, carbon/nitrogen (C : N ratio), texture, organic matter and pH. Data were recorded at three sample dates during the growing seasons of 1998 and 1999.
   Results Contrary to our expectations, we observed lower nitrogen availability and mineralization in invaded patches, and differences in soil moisture content and soil C : N. Soil C : N ratios were higher in invaded plots, in spite of the fact that Melilotus had the lowest C : N ratios of other plant tissue analysed in this study.
   Main conclusions These findings provide land managers of natural areas with a better perspective on the possibilities of nitrogen-fixing species impact on soil nutrient levels.

AB In the callianassid shrimp Nihonotrypaea harmandi (Bouvier 1901), the trichomycete fungus Enteromyces callianassae Lichtwardt 1961 occurs exclusively on the foregut lining. The enzymes from both the shrimp and the fungus apparently hydrolyze certain nitrogen and carbon compounds in detritus. The activities of various proteases and carbohydrases contained in the foregut juice were compared between fungus-infected shrimps collected from a sandflat in Kyushu, Japan (51 % infection rate) and uninfected shrimps from a nearby sandflat. The concentration of enzymatically hydrolyzable amino acids (EHAA) in sediment liberated by the foregut juice with fungi was slightly lower than that by 0.1 mg.ml(-1) proteinase-K and significantly higher than that by the foregut juice without fungi. In both foregut juices, substantial enzyme activities were recorded for proteinase(s), peptidases, amylase, cellulase and beta-1,3-glucanase, and minimal ones for maltase and cellobiase. Of the commercial substrates examined, only in the case of the mixture of 16 kinds of dipeptides was a significantly higher enzyme activity in the foregut juice with fungi observed. In the process of EHAA liberation from sediment, peptidases secreted by the fungus most probably act as a supplement to the endogenous secretion by the shrimp. This may explain the higher shrimp growth rate recorded for the population with fungi. However, the significantly higher sediment EHAA concentration of the sandflat inhabited by this population versus the population without fungi could be another crucial factor explaining the site difference in shrimp growth rate.

AB Some temporary pools in the Pollino National Park (1780-1900 m a.s.l) are inhabited by Chirocephalus ruffoi Cottarelli & Mura, 1984, an endemic Italian anostracan. These pools predictably fill by snowmelting in spring, but the timing and the duration of their flooding is unpredictable. Depending on climate, in some years, they also erratically fill by unpredictable rainfall in autumn. Field monitoring and continuous temperature data recordings were performed, in order to define habitat characteristics and related adaptive strategies of the resident population.
   The life cycle of C ruffoi begins in late spring after snow melt and is strongly affected by temperature regime and pool duration. Significant differences (F = 4.62, P < 0.01, df:= 1) in growth rate and maturation were found between pools P1 (or P3) and P4, differing in size, position and hydrological regime. Growth and maturation were faster in P1 (or P3) than in the longer lasting, colder P4. Differences were also recorded between years, within a pool, due to climatic conditions; 1998 was characterized by higher rainfall, lower temperatures (particularly from March on), and consequently the water phase lasted longer than in 1997. Hatching occurred as soon as mean water temperature attains 4-5&DEG;C and starts fluctuating. The extent of initial hatching could not be assessed in the field, but was low in the laboratory (cumulative hatching percentage < 30% over three hatching cycles) suggesting a risk spreading strategy in relation to habitat uncertainty, as in other anostracans in unpredictable environments. The same explanation appears to apply to the sex ratio, which was constantly and markedly female-biased, probably to maximize reproductive output.
   Unlike previously assumed, C. ruffoi is a eurythermic species. The adults can survive temperature values of 32degreesC and higher and are exposed during their lives to a wide temperature range (2-5degreesC/40degreesC) and to diurnal fluctuations as wide as 21 degrees. Multiple regression analysis showed that temperature was the most influential among the environmental variables supposed to affect anostracan life cycle.

AB The stomach contents of 533 bull-rout, Myoxocephalus scorpius (L.), were collected during February-March and October-November 1997 in the south-western Baltic Sea in order to study the feeding ecology and investigate diet changes between seasons and with the increasing size of the fish. The isopod Mesidotea entomon, and herring Clupea harengus, were the dominant species in the diet, accounting for 99% in weight of all bull-rout sampled in spring and autumn. Mysis mixta was frequent but less important in weight; analysis of the ontogenetic diet shift showed the presence of M, mixta essentially in the smaller size-classes. Herring was eaten almost exclusively by individuals larger than 21 cm total length; its importance increased with increasing size of bull-rout. The isopod M. entomon was abundant in all size-classes examined. Prey-size and the size of the principal prey, M. entomon, showed a significant increase with increasing bull-rout size. The diet shift from mysids to fish was followed by a change in the weight-length relationship. Cluster analysis confirmed two distinct size groups of > 26 cm and < 24 cm. In conclusion, the data indicate that the diet of bull-rout partially overlaps with that of herring in the first trophic stage, and with that of cod in the second part of the bull-rout life cycle.

AB Five microhabitat types with varying degrees of bird influence were examined. Soils were collected from open polygons, under mosses and bird nests on a nunatak with breeding snow petrels (Pagodroma nivea) and from open polygons and under mosses on a non-bird nunatak. Nutrient levels (total N and P, nitrate, nitrite and ammonia), moisture levels and delta(15)N values were determined and the organic processes of nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) and soil respiration (CO2 flux) were examined. Nests represented the most favourable microhabitat type for soil respiration having the highest nutrient levels and most favourable temperature and moisture regimes. The soils under mosses were also Favourable and appear to act as a nutrient sink for nutrients originating from the nests. The open polygons were the least favourable for biological activity. There was little nitrogen fixation in any of the soils except for the soils under mosses from the non-bird nunatak. Fixation is possibly limited in favourable microhabitat types on the bird nunatak by high nitrogen levels. These results were confirmed by the delta(15)N results, which had high values typical of a seabird signal in the soils from the bird nunatak and values near zero, typical of soils containing fixed nitrogen, on the non-bird nunatak.

AB The reproduction dynamics of Colophospermum mopane, including flowering, fruit bearing, the germination potential of the seed and seedling establishment were studied over a period of three years on six plots where the trees were thinned to the approximate equivalents of 75%, 50%, 35%, 20% and 10% of the tree density of the control plot (2 711 trees ha(-1)). Thinning of C. mopane reduced inter-tree competition which resulted in marked increases in the flowering and fruit bearing of the remaining trees. Though the percentage reproductive trees were higher in the low tree density plots, the greater number of trees in the high tree density plots ensured that the total number of trees that flowered and produced fruit were of the same order of those in the low tree density plots. The fruit (seed with and without their pod covers) from trees within the low tree density plots were larger and heavier than those from the plots with a high tree density, but this did not have a marked effect an their potential to germinate. Since the greatest germination was achieved from fresh seeds, no dormancy appears to exist in C. mopane seeds. Seedling numbers were low in all plots and a specific pattern of seedling establishment was lacking. At high tree densities severe competition from the established C. mopane trees could account for the low rate of seedling establishment. while in the low tree density plots competition from newly established herbaceous plants, mainly grasses, could account for the tree seedling absence in these plots.

AB The importance of figs as keystone resources depends partly on their year-round fruiting pattern. However, most non-equatorial fig species show seasonality in reproductive phenology. If fig and other species' fruiting peaks coincide, the importance of fgs as key resources during lean fruiting periods may be reduced. Fig and other forest tree phenology was studied in a deciduous and an evergreen site in the Western Chats, southern India, from January 1991 to May 1992. In the deciduous site, most non-fig flowering and leaf flushing occurred during the two dry seasons, while most fruiting occurred during the dry and early wet seasons. In the evergreen site, all non-tig tree phenological stages - flowering, fruiting and leaf flushing - were concentrated during the two dry seasons annually (dry and post-monsoon). Individual fig trees produced crops one to three times annually, at different times of the year for different trees. Fig community fruiting peaks in the evergreen site coincided with fruiting peaks of the other forest trees, but in the deciduous site occurred slightly offset from non-tig fruiting peaks. The role of figs as key resources is likely to differ among forests, and to depend on factors such as diversity of fruiting pattern among fig species, fig tree density and territoriality of frugivores.

AB Acacia saligna and Acacia cyclops are the dominant invasive alien plants of phosphorus-poor, sand-plain, lowland fynbos and the relatively phosphorus-rich strandveld vegetation of the southwestern Cape of South Africa, respectively, but their ranges overlap. Seedlings of the two species were grown in pots, in isolation and mixed, in up to seven treatments supplying a broad gradient in phosphorus (P) availability. Acacia saligna seedlings grew taller and had greater dry mass than those of A. cyclops at each level of P, but both peaked in response to the same relatively high soil P level and then tended to decline. Root: shoot ratios did nor differ in response to P, but were greater in A. saligna. In mixture, A. saligna had a higher dry mass than A. cyclops at each level of P, but the relative differences between species were no greater than in isolation. Depth penetration of the soil by the tap root of A. saligna seedlings was over three times as rapid as that of A. cyclops over a 30 day period. The higher absolute growth rates of A. saligna were not related to seed size or seed nitrogen and P contents, as these were greater in A. cyclops. The contrasting distributions of the acacias do not appear to be a response to P availability per se, but possibly to the interaction of P with other factors such as moisture availability.

AB In gape-limited predators, such as snakes, the availability of potential prey is partly determined by swallowing capacity, i.e., maximum ingestible prey size. Relative head size in snakes influences swallowing capacity and has been shown to vary among species, populations, and sexes. Here I examine individual variation in relative head size in a natural population of adders (Vipera berus) and test for an association between relative head size and two important fitness components, individual growth rate and survival. I found a linear relationship between head size and snout-vent length. Individual differences in relative head size, i.e., the residuals from the regression of head length on snout-vent length, were equivalent to that expected, on average, from snout-vent length differences of up to 90 mm. There was a close association between rates of head and body growth and no difference in variability between the two traits. Individual relative head size did not change as a result of different rates of body growth. Snout-vent growth rate increased significantly with increasing relative head size in males, but not in females. In small males, surviving individuals had significantly larger relative head size than those that died, but there was no association between survival and relative head size in large males or in females. I conclude that, by influencing survival and growth rate, relative head size may be associated with individual variation in lifetime reproductive success.

AB We investigated the plasticity of seedlings to shade in six shrub species common in subtropical thicket, in order to assess their microhabitat preferences for regeneration. Cassine peragua and Sideroxylon inerme, which also occur in adjacent forests, were the most shade tolerant and would be unlikely to require canopy gaps for recruitment: their relative reduction in growth in dense shade was slight, as was their increase in leaf weight ratio (LWR); leaf inclination was adjusted to near horizontal in dense shade and maximum net photosynthetic rate (A(max)) remained fairly low in sun-acclimated plants. Rhus glauca, which also occurs on forest margins, demonstrated the highest growth rates, especially in the open, and together with its high potential A(max) is well-equipped as a pioneer, and would benefit from canopy gaps for establishment. Cassine aethiopica, which is also common in coastal forests, was slower growing than Rhus, but less shade tolerant than C. peragua and Sideroxylon and would probably benefit from canopy gaps for establishment. Pappea capensis and Schotia afra, which also occur in open savanna vegetation, demonstrated a growth and morphological pattern indicative of species adapted to periodic drought, in having a high ratio of woody conductive tissue to leaf tissue with accompanying slow growth. Their relatively poor performance in deep shade suggests that canopy gaps would benefit their recruitment. We concluded that canopy gaps may be essential for recruitment of the full species complement in sub-tropical thickets.

SO JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PREDATION; VIRIDIS; RISK
AB Alsophis portoricensis can inject the secretion of its Duvernoy's gland (=venom) into its prey, constrict it, or swallow it alive. We studied the differences in prey-handling behavior of Alsophis portozicensis when feeding on two of its natural prey species, the lizard Anolis cristatellus and the frog Eleutherodactylus coqui. Subduing time was higher for lizards, but swallowing and handling times were longer for frogs. Alsophis struck Anolis most frequently on the trunk, whereas it attacked Eleutherodactylus preferentially on the head or the limbs. Alsophis portoricensis was equally successful in preventing both prey types from escaping after first seizing them. Snakes never constricted either prey type, but envenomated most Anolis and only one Eleutherodactylus. Alsophis always swallowed lizards head-first, but ingested frogs head-first or tail- or side-first indiscriminately. This diversity in Alsophis feeding behavior may result from differences in external morphology and retaliatory power between Anolis cristatellus and Eleutherodactylus coqui.

AB Cyst hatching, under standardized conditions, of the Anostracan species Thamnocephalus platyurus and Streptocephalus dichotomus was significantly accelerated but not increased by applying the morphogen retinoic acid (RA). Cyst hatching was enhanced but not accelerated by artificially increasing the inflow of Ca2+ to the embryonic cells, using Calcium Ionophore A 23 187. Cyst hatching was accelerated and amplified, to a level in excess of the summed effects of each treatment, by a combined application of RA and ionophore. It was inhibited almost quantitatively by the Calcium-channel blockers Nifedipine and Verapamil. The significance of these findings is discussed.

AB A possible predatory interaction was identified between two intertidal seastars, Patiriella exigua and Patiriella calcar. This interaction may also have been a factor limiting the lower distribution of P. exigua at the study site. Predation was observed in the field and laboratory. Significantly fewer P. exigua remained in cages containing P. calcar compared to those containing low or high densities of P. exigua. P. exigua showed a strong escape response upon contacting P. calcar but none was elicited by other common intertidal species. There was an inverse relationship between the numbers of P. calcar and P. exigua in the same rockpool, but competition for food or space was not suggested by field surveys. Experimental work showed that P. exigua was able to survive in the low intertidal zone at the site of sympatry and occurred naturally in this zone at an allopatric site.

TI GROWTH AND MATURATION OF A NORTH-AMERICAN FAIRY SHRIMP,

AB 1.  We evaluated survival, growth and time to maturation of the fairy shrimp, Streptocephalus seali Ryder, in the laboratory at various combinations of temperature and water hardness.
   2.  Both independent factors affected survival and growth of S. seali.  Multiple regression analysis and response surface modelling predict that after 4 days, over 80% survival is obtained at temperatures from 14 to 28-degrees-C and water hardnesses from 60 to 130 mg CaCO3 1-1.
   3.  Growth rates of larvae were often maximum at physicochemical conditions other than those which had promoted maximum rates of survival.  For example, after 12 days mean total body length was almost 12 mm in larvae which had been maintained at 34-degrees-C (80 mg CaCO3 1-1); the maximum survival rate had been obtained at 19-degrees-C.  Total length was directly correlated with temperature at the lowest hardness tested, but not at the other two hardnesses (100 and 120 mg CaCO3 1-1).  At the latter water hardnesses, total length was significantly less at 34-degrees-C than at 32-degrees-C on all three sampling occasions (4, 8 and 12 days post-hatch).
   4.  Similarly, developmental stage of larvae correlated well with temperature but larvae reared at 34-degrees-C did not develop more quickly than those reared at 32-degrees-C.  After 12 days, most larvae at the two highest temperature treatments had developed at least to Stage 14 and many were nearly mature; at 17-degrees-C most larvae were still at Stage 10.
   5.  During our study of maturation rate of females we noted that egg production was initiated after completion of fourteen or fifteen moults.  Mean time to maturation at 27-degrees-C (17.3 +/- 2.8 days) exceeded that at 32-degrees-C (12.3 +/- 2.6 days).  The minimum time to maturation of a shrimp was 9 days at 32-degrees-C.

AB We reviewed 140 papers to assess the ecological effectiveness of South Africa's marine protected areas (MPAs). Evidence was assessed for coverage and representivity, protection of important biodiversity areas, other recognised elements of effectiveness, connectivity, and ecological effects-from the scale of individual MPAs to the MPA network scale. We conducted complementary novel analyses to supplement the review and to objectively determine where and how the MPA network can be improved. Evidence shows that South Africa's MPAs now provide some protection to all ecoregions and 87% of ecosystem types but to less than 50% of assessed species groups. MPAs are generally well-sited, but gaps were revealed on the west coast and in estuaries, the deep sea, and two ecologically and biologically significant areas. Enforcement emerged as a key concern, and many MPAs could be improved through expansion or by increasing no-take areas. The majority of relevant papers recorded beneficial ecological effects, detectable as increases in parameters such as the abundance, biomass, sizes or reproductive output of species. Few papers examined whether ecological benefits translate into adjacent fisheries benefits, but all those that did recorded positive effects. Full protection was more effective than partial protection, with effectiveness most clearly demonstrated for vulnerable target taxa. Further research and monitoring to achieve evaluations of effectiveness are recommended, with greater focus on neglected MPAs and species. Understanding the ecological connectivity between MPAs, an important dimension for climate-change adaptation and hence for the persistence and resilience of South Africa's marine biodiversity, is identified as a key area for future research and inclusion in MPA planning.

AB Wildlife commodification can generate benefits for biodiversity conservation, but it also has negative impacts; overexploitation of wildlife is currently one of the biggest drivers of vertebrate extinction risk In the present article, we highlight 10 issues that in our experience impede sustainable and humane wildlife trade. Given humanity's increasing demands on the natural world we question whether many aspects of wildlife trade can be compatible with appropriate standards for biodiversity conservation and animal welfare, and suggest that too many elements of wildlife trade as it currently stands are not sustainable for wildlife or for the livelihoods that it supports. We suggest that the onus should be on traders to demonstrate that wildlife use is sustainable, humane, and safe (with respect to disease and invasion risk), rather than on conservationists to demonstrate it is not, that there is a need for a broad acceptance of responsibility and, ultimately, widespread behavior change. We urge conservationists, practitioners, and others to take bold, progressive steps to reach consensus and action.

AB Nature has the potential to provide wide-ranging economic contributions to society e from ecosystem services to providing income to communities via fair trade of resources. Unsustainable trade in wildlife, however, threatens biodiversity and its ability to support communities and a functioning planet. It is therefore important to have clear systems in place for tracing traded wildlife. Monitoring legal wildlife trade in all species is as important as it is for trade in protected species, since flows of the legal trade correlate with, and provide cover for, illegally traded wildlife. The majority of wildlife trade research is focused on species listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The concurrent, considerably larger legal wildlife trade in both CITES and non-CITES-listed species, however, remains unexamined e despite the fact that if mismanaged, it can lead to over-exploitation. Here we analyzed 20 years of data from the UN Comtrade database, aiming to detail the scale, composition, and trends across all taxa of wildlife traded legally, and to indicate opportunities for improvement. From 1997 to 2016 the value of this trade totaled between US$2.9 and 4.4 trillion. Of this, $2.9 trillion wildlife was traded under "specific" codes that specify taxonomic Order and below, while around $1.4 trillion was traded under "broad" codes that declare wildlife to taxonomic Class and above. The top 10 trading nations/territories accounted for 51.4% of the total value of wildlife traded. The top commercial categories for wildlife trade were seafood (82%), furniture (7%), and fashion (furs and hides) (6%). In these three major categories, vague commodity codes such as "Fish", "Tropical wood", and "Other furs" were used to declare 23%, 24% and 26% of items traded, respectively e despite encompassing thousands of species. This lack of granularity imperils biodiversity as trade cannot be comprehensively monitored. We recommend a review of what species are traded under these broad code descriptions, and a distillation of codes to taxonomic Family or Genus level in the next HS Code review period, particularly in the pet, traditional Chinese medicine and furniture categories. In addition, interdisciplinary research into legal wildlife trade should be increased to provide forensic, policy, economic and social solutions to improve trade management.

AB Urbanisation is a prominent and increasing form of land-use change, with the potential to disrupt the interactions between pollinators such as bees and the flowering plants that they visit. This in turn may cause cascading local extinctions and have consequences for pollination services. Network approaches go beyond simple metrics of abundance and species richness, enabling understanding of how the structure of plant-pollinator communities are affected by urbanisation. Here we compared pollination networks between native vegetation (bushland) remnants and residential gardens in the urbanised region of the southwest Australian biodiversity hotspot. Across fourteen sites, seven per habitat, plant-bee visitor networks were created from surveys conducted monthly during the spring-summer period over two years. Extinction slope (a measure of how extinctions cascade through the network), and network robustness and nestedness were higher for bushland remnants, suggesting that networks in bushland remnants had greater functional integrity, but if disrupted, more cascading extinctions could occur. In contrast, niche overlap between pollinators was higher in residential gardens, suggesting greater competition for resources. Most species-level properties did not differ between habitats, except for normalised degree, which was higher in bushland remnants. In conclusion, it appears that pollination networks in managed residential gardens are not structurally equivalent with those in bushland remnants. This has implications for conservation of wild bee assemblages in this biodiversity hotspot, and suggests removal of remnant native vegetation for residential development could disrupt the integrity of plant-pollinator assemblages.

AB While many initiatives, studies and projects are focusing only on modelling wildlife connectivity movement, coordinated efforts should help to deliver adaptative solutions for the on-the-ground needs, while helping the planners and involving communities in landscape protection. Multispecies spatial models and maps allow the generalisation of findings across more significant regions and provide insights to maintain, improve or restore landscape connectivity, while individual species could contribute in establishing regions of focus in conservation efforts. Given the challenge of multispecies connectivity, we chose to build single connectivity models through circuit theory for brown bear, wolf, red deer, wild boar and roe deer. Further, we combined best-supported models in a regional cumulative spatial map, on which we identified areas of high importance for connectivity conservation to investigate and mitigate the impact of linear infrastructure. Results for carnivores and their prey species were similar to those obtained from brown bear landscape genetics modelling. Eastern slope facing was a clear preference of multispecies, and we trust this is due to abundant vegetation, food resources, and lack of fragmentation of forest regions. A vital area called Cold River corridor was validated both functional (brown bear) and structural (for carnivores and prey species) by this study and the results from previous research. However, a highway is planned to bisect the Cold River for the first time, and we advocate that the remaining conservation potential of the area should be maintained whenever possible while planning for evolutionary resilience and prioritizing management actions and effective strategies for all the species. Conservation easements could provide protections against development considered together with coordinated efforts for "smart development", and maintenance of existing forest and wildlife management and land uses preservation.

AB Biofloc systems generate and accumulate microbial aggregates known as bioflocs. The presence of bioflocs has been shown to change gut bacterial diversity and stimulate innate immunity in shrimp. The microbial niche of bioflocs may therefore have the potential to drive shifts in the shrimp gut microbiota associated with stimulation of innate immunity. We performed shotgun metagenomic analysis and 16S rRNA-based amplicon sequencing to characterize complex bacterial members in bioflocs and the shrimp digestive tract, respectively. Moreover, we determined whether biofloc-grown shrimp with discrete gut microbiomes had an elevation in local immune-related gene expression and systemic immune activities. Our findings demonstrated that the bacterial community in bioflocs changed dynamically during Pacific white shrimp cultivation. Metagenomic analysis revealed that Vibrio comprised 90% of the biofloc population, while Pseualteromonas, Photobacterium, Shewanella, Alteromonas, Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Acinetobacter, Clostridium, Marinifilum, and Pseudomonas were also detected. In the digestive tract, biofloc-grown shrimp maintained the presence of commensal bacteria including Vibrio, Photobacterium, Shewanella, Granulosicoccus, and Ruegeria similar to control shrimp. However, Vibrio and Photobacterium were significantly enriched and declined, respectively, in biofloc-grown shrimp. The presence of bioflocs upregulated immune-related genes encoding serine proteinase and prophenoloxidase in digestive organs which are routinely exposed to gut microbiota. Biofloc-grown shrimp also demonstrated a significant increase in systemic immune status. As a result, the survival rate of biofloc-grown shrimp was substantially higher than that of the control shrimp. Our findings suggested that the high relative abundance of vibrios in bioflocs enriched the number of vibrios in the digestive tract of biofloc-grown shrimp. This shift in gut microbiota composition may be partially responsible for local upregulation of immune-related gene expression in digestive organs and systemic promotion of immune status in circulating hemolymph.

AB A controversial, multifaceted debate surrounds the trade in commercially captive-bred (farmed) lion skeletons. A prominent topic relates to relative preferences for tiger and lion bone in Asian consumer countries. To contribute preliminary information on this subject we conducted the first quantitative study to assess the consumer preferences of the urban public in China and Vietnam for lion versus tiger and wild versus farmed bone wine products. Using an online questionnaire we ranked respondents' stated preference for wild tiger, farmed tiger, wild lion, and farmed lion bone, and tested for the effect of demographic and attitudinal variables on product preferences. Our findings indicate that in both China and Vietnam tiger bone wine is greatly preferred over lion bone wine, and that respondents showed high levels of fidelity to their choice of farmed or wild designation across species. We emphasise the real-world complexity of lion and tiger bone product interactions and highlight opportunities for further in-depth study.

AB Context The key attributes of landscape pattern include composition and configuration, which can be depicted by landscape/spatial metrics. An emerging pathway is leveraging vertical data to advance three-dimensional (3-D) spatial metrics to interpret landscape attributes and quantify 3-D patterns. Objectives We introduced a suite of spatial metrics to recognize 3-D morphological characteristics of residential communities and examine their temporal changes. Methods Seventeen 3-D spatial metrics were designed and computed at patch-, class-, and landscape-levels based on building footprints and height information in geographic information system (GIS). These metrics characterized 3-D forms of residential communities, including number, area, height, shape, and diversity. These 3-D features were further used to recognize five typical built types based on the scheme of local climate zone (LCZ) and quantify their 3-D morphological changes with rapid urbanization. Results The 3-D spatial metrics performed well in describing vertical and volumetric characteristics of residential communities and distinguishing five typical built types in Xiamen, China. Our results indicated that architectural styles of residential communities changed from homo- to mixed-rise buildings and from compact to open arrangement with rapid urbanization. Conclusions Both 2-D and 3-D features are key attributes of the landscape. Our results showed that 3-D spatial metrics were not only useful tools for quantifying surface patterns but also key complements to vertical feature characterization, offering advantages in representing urbanization over the existing indexes. Growing 3-D datasets have great potential to develop more valuable metrics for characterizing spatial features, capturing ecological processes, and understanding drivers in various landscape contexts.

AB Urban resilience is increasingly considered a useful approach to accommodate uncertainties. As an important material basis of the urban system, the land is one of the most promising intermediaries to observe urban resilience and is useful to shape resilience potential through land use management. However, current research into the quantitative assessment of urban resilience on land is underexplored, leaving it largely unpracticed in contemporary planning and policy discourse. Here, we introduce an operational model for understanding citylevel resilience on land expansion that integrates economic, social and environmental dimensions of ecosystems. Using multi-source data and employing spatial analysis methods, urban resilience is assessed from 1995 to 2015 in Tianjin, China as an illustration following the phases of the operational model. The results indicate that land expansion has a great influence on urban resilience, given economic resilience increases but simultaneous social and environmental resilience decrease. The findings suggest (i) urban resilience should be incorporated into the planning process that helps to balance the multiple tradeoffs involved; (ii) land use regulations are necessary to manage land by controlling the quantity and quality of land uses; (iii) local governments should be involved to make tailor-made strategies to enhance a concerted action of successful practice.

AB Deoxygenation in coastal and open-ocean ecosystems rarely exists in isolation but occurs concomitantly with acidification. Here, we first combine meta-data of experimental assessments from across the globe to investigate the potential interactive impacts of deoxygenation and acidification on a broad range of marine taxa. We then characterize the differing degrees of deoxygenation and acidification tested in our dataset using a ratio between the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide (pO(2)/pCO(2)) to assess how biological processes change under an extensive, yet diverse range ofpO(2)andpCO(2)conditions. The dataset comprised 375 experimental comparisons and revealed predominantly additive but variable effects (91.7%, additive; 6.0%, synergistic; and 2.3%, antagonistic) of the dual stressors, yielding negative impacts across almost all responses examined. Our data indicate that thepO(2)/pCO(2)-ratio offers a simplified metric to characterize the extremity of the concurrent stressors and shows that more severe impacts occurred when ratios represented more extreme deoxygenation and acidification conditions. Importantly, our analysis highlights the need to assess the concurrent impacts of deoxygenation and acidification on marine taxa and that assessments considering the impact of O(2)depletion alone will likely underestimate the impacts of deoxygenation events and their ecosystem-wide consequences.

AB The link between spatio-temporal resource patterns and animal movement behaviour is a key ecological process, however, limited experimental support for this connection has been produced at the home range scale. In this study, we analysed the spatial responses of a resident large herbivore (roe deer Capreolus capreolus) using an in situ manipulation of a concentrated food resource. Specifically, we experimentally altered feeding site accessibility to roe deer and recorded (for 25 animal-years) individual responses by GPS tracking. We found that, following the loss of their preferred resource, roe deer actively tracked resource dynamics leading to more exploratory movements, and larger, spatially-shifted home ranges. Then, we showed, for the first time experimentally, the importance of site fidelity in the maintenance of large mammal home ranges by demonstrating the return of individuals to their familiar, preferred resource despite the presence of alternate, equally-valuable food resources. This behaviour was modulated at the individual level, where roe deer characterised by a high preference for feeding sites exhibited more pronounced behavioural adjustments during the manipulation. Together, our results establish the connections between herbivore movements, space-use, individual preference, and the spatio-temporal pattern of resources in home ranging behaviour.

AB Identification of centers of endemism is a crucial issue to improve the understanding on overall biodiversity distribution and related conservation actions. Despite the well-known distribution of global endemic areas, less effort has been devoted in defining local hotspots and their ecological determinants. In this study, we analyzed the distribution and the spatial pattern of endemic diversity of vascular plant in the south-eastern Italian Alps, aiming at identifying the occurrence of local hotspots and focusing on the relationships occurring between alpha (i.e. species richness) and beta diversity (i.e. Local Contributors of Beta Diversity) along with their ecological and spatial drivers. We observed that both alpha and beta diversity metrics have a strong negative relationship, showing a clear spatial pattern. Among the environmental drivers, geomorphological and climatic variables were the most influent, pointing out the importance of landscape heterogeneity and local oceanic climate conditions to favor endemic richness. We also found that historical factors (i.e. Last Glacial Maximum) significantly affected the pattern of endemic diversity. Interestingly, most of the variables showed contrasting effects on alpha and beta diversity.
   Our study proposes an approach for the identification of local hotspots of endemic species, which take into account both the spatially structured nature of ecological data and their associated environmental drivers. Our findings might provide new insights in the ecological process driving current endemic plant patterns and become pivotal for nature conservationist both to identify areas of high conservation value and to suggest appropriate management schemes also beyond existing protected areas.

AB Ecological indicators are foundational for holistic guidance toward thriving living systems, yet existing indicators are incomplete, fragmented, and do not fully integrate living systems principles. We suggest that thriving living systems (i.e., social-ecological or complex adaptive systems) can and should be the aim of sustainability and sustainable development. Thriving living systems, also called regenerative living systems, are those in which complexity, diversity, capacity to support all life, and the potential to change to provide future options increases. Holistic ecological and sustainability indicators and evaluation tools are needed. The emerging field of regenerative development (RD) offers theoretical and practical guidance for such indicators and tools. We integrate complex adaptive systems science, ecology, sustainability, and regenerative development to construct and pilot the first iteration of a holistic sustainable development evaluation tool-the Regenerative Development Evaluation Tool-in two river restoration projects. The tool identifies RD Principles and Core Characteristics of Regenerative Living Systems that provide general guidance for thinking and decision-making. From these general indicators, place-based quantitative and qualitative indicators are constructed through a cocreative community process. Our case studies reveal factors correlated with degrees of engagement with RD and potential place-based indicators for each project. We recommend continuing the development and expansion of the RD Evaluation Tool, adding RD indicators and strategies. We also recommend developing an RD process tool that can work explicitly across scales, integrating the neighborhood, city, landscape, and regional scales since they are pivotal for sustainability efforts and manifesting thriving living systems. Finally, we recommended integrated research and practice to test and adapt RD tools and processes.

AB The conservation and utilization of wild animals in China often raises public concerns. Thus, the Chinese government is increasingly exploring sustainable development of wildlife resources, and has implemented a series of measures, such as the modification of the Wildlife Protection Law (WPL), implementation of captive breeding licenses, an animal marking system, forest certification, and other actions to regulate captive breeding and utilization of wildlife. At the same time, the government tries to meet the Chinese traditional demand for wildlife products. We first introduce wildlife utilization as an internationally accepted conservation tool, and describe market-based wildlife farming as a legal substitute for wild-hunted animals. Second, we highlight the importance of wildlife products in Chinese culture and economy and review some successful examples of wildlife utilization in China, showing that the supply-side approach is a viable alternative to classical conservation. Subsequently, we outline benefits of, and drawbacks to, China's 'conservation through utilization' approach, resulting in the implementation of China's new, revised WPL. We discuss merits and shortcomings of China's revised WPL and respond to recent national and international criticism on China's supply-side approach to conservation. We strongly propose that captive breeding is a feasible approach to China's wildlife conservation-utilization dilemma, and much work is needed to promote the progress, such as legislation restructure, government attention, duties clarification, and so on.

AB Background and Aims Pollinator-mediated interactions between plant species may affect the composition of angiosperm communities. Floral colour signals should play a role in these interactions, but the role will arise from the visual perceptions and behavioural responses of multiple pollinators. Recent advances in the visual sciences can be used to inform our understanding of these perceptions and responses. We outline the application of appropriate visual principles to the analysis of the annual cycle of floral colour structure in two Australian herbaceous communities.
   Methods We used spectrographic measurements of petal reflectance to determine the location of flowers in a model of hymenopteran colour vision. These representations of colour perception were then translated to a behaviourally relevant metric of colour differences using empirically calibrated colour discrimination functions for four hymenopteran species. We then analysed the pattern of colour similarity in terms of this metric in samples of co-flowering plants over the course of a year. We used the same method to analyse the annual pattern of phylogenetic relatedness of co-flowering plants in order to compare colour structure and phylogenetic structure.
   Key Results Co-flowering communities at any given date seldom had colour assemblages significantly different from random. Non-random structure, both dispersion and clustering, occurred occasionally, but depended on which bee observer is considered. The degree of colour similarity was unrelated to phylogenetic similarity within a co-flowering community.
   Conclusions Perceived floral colour structure varied with the sensory capabilities of the observer. The lack of colour structure at most sample dates, particularly the rarity of strong dispersion, suggests that plants do not use chromatic signals primarily to enable bees to discriminate between co-flowering species. It is more likely that colours make plants detectable in a complex landscape.

AB Community participation is at the heart of environmental governance as it facilitates and promotes a sense of ownership in a society's decision making and social development issues. This paper, using both primary and secondary data collected through methods inspired by participatory research, set out to discuss a methodological approach aimed at understanding how common pool natural resources are managed by multi-actors and stakeholders in a developing country context in an effort to promote inclusive land reform-led outdoor tourism. It combines two 'soft-systems' schools of thought, systemic thinking and resilience thinking, to analyse the effectiveness and efficiency of collaborative management of natural resources in tribal communities established through land reform processes in South Africa. It is argued in the paper that the two schools of thought can play key roles in identifying and informing the development of appropriate intervening measures and strategies that can contribute towards the adoption of effective and sustainable systems of community natural resource management and bring about more meaningful community development through community-based tourism. These observations have been made within the broader and contemporary arguments of sustainable environmental management and community development.
   Management implications:
   The systemic-resilience approach appears to be critical for increasing stakeholder participation in conservation endeavours aimed at outdoor recreational activities and tourism.
   The intervention approach in complex tribal communities is key for establishing accommodations that will enable developing action plans to enhance stakeholder participation in co-managing common pool natural resources earmarked for community-based ecotourism.
   The systemic-resilience approach promotes strong and genuine grassroot-grown community participation in environmental management decision making, thereby promoting stakeholder participation of interested actors in outdoor recreation and tourism.
   Systemic-resilience facilitates the attainment of social capital elements which are key to the successful co-management of natural resources, i.e. participation, transparency, reciprocity and effective communication.

AB Wolbachia endosymbionts that are maternally inherited can spread rapidly in host populations through inducing sterility in uninfected females, but some Wolbachia infections do not influence host reproduction yet still persist. These infections are particularly interesting because they likely represent mutualistic endosymbionts, spreading by increasing host fitness. Here, we document such a spread in the wAu infection of Drosophila simulans. By establishing multiple replicate cage populations, we show that wAu consistently increased from an intermediate frequency to near fixation, representing an estimated fitness advantage of around 20% for infected females. The effective population size in the cages was estimated from SNP markers to be around a few thousand individuals, precluding large effects of genetic drift in the populations. The exact reasons for the fitness advantage are unclear but viral protection and nutritional benefits are two possibilities.

AB AimDarwin's naturalization hypothesis states that dissimilarity to native species may benefit alien species establishment due to empty niches and reduced competition. We here add a new dimension to large-scale tests of community invasibility, investigating the role that previously established alien species play in facilitating or hindering new invasions in plant communities.
   LocationPermanent grasslands across France (including mainland and Corsica), as a receding ecosystem of great conservation importance.
   MethodsFocusing on 121 alien plant species occurring in 7,215 vegetation plots, we quantified biotic similarity between new invaders and resident alien species (i.e., alien species with longer residence times) based on phylogenetic and trait distances. Additionally, we calculated distances to native species for each alien species and plot. Using multispecies distribution models, we analysed the influence of these biotic similarity measures and additional covariates on establishment success (presence/absence) of new invaders.
   ResultsWe found that biotic similarity to resident alien species consistently increased establishment success of more recently introduced species. Phylogenetic relatedness to previous invaders had an equally strong positive effect as relatedness to native species. Conversely, trait similarity to natives hindered alien establishment as predicted by Darwin's naturalization hypothesis. These results highlight that various mechanisms may act simultaneously to determine alien establishment success.
   Main conclusionsOur results suggest that, with greater similarity among alien species, invasion success increases. Such a pattern may arise either due to actual facilitation among invaders or as a result of weaker competitive interactions among invaders than between native and alien species, leading to an indirect facilitative effect. Alternatively, recent environmental changes (e.g., eutrophication, climate change) may have added new environmental filters. Determining how initial invasions might pave the road for subsequent invasions is crucial for effective multispecies management decisions and contributes a new aspect to our understanding of community assembly.

AB The functional diversity and composition of plant traits within communities are tightly linked to important ecosystem functions and processes. Whereas vegetative traits reflecting adaptations to environmental conditions are commonly assessed in community ecology, floral traits are often neglected despite their importance for the plants' life cycle. The consideration of floral traits covers important aspects such as sexual plant reproduction and pollinator diversity, which remain unobserved in studies focussing on vegetative traits only. To test whether vegetative and floral traits differ in their responses to elevation, we measured morphological and chemical traits of plant species occurring in pastures at seven elevations in the Austrian Alps. Variation in functional composition was examined using the concept of n-dimensional hypervolumes and vector analysis. Our data show that vegetative and floral traits vary differently with the elevational gradient. Whereas vegetative traits changed in a predictable manner with elevation, floral traits did not specifically respond to elevation. Overall variation in vegetative traits mainly resulted from phenotypical differences between plants in different elevations, whereas total variation in floral traits was a result from a high variation within communities. The assessment of functional changes in vegetative and floral traits along mountain slopes thus reveals different patterns in plant responses to elevation and may help to generate testable hypotheses on functional responses to current climate warming.

AB Institutions play a significant role in stabilising large-scale cooperation in common pool resource management. Without restrictions to govern human behaviour, most natural resources are vulnerable to overexploitation. This study used a sample size of 336 households and community-level data from 30 communities around Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe, to analyse the relationship between institutions and biodiversity outcomes in community-based wildlife conservation. Our results suggest a much stronger effect of institutions on biodiversity outcomes via the intermediacy of cooperation. Overall, the performance of most communities was below the desired level of institutional attributes that matter for conservation. Good institutions are an important ingredient for cooperation in the respective communities. Disaggregating the metric measure of institutions into its components shows that governance, monitoring and enforcement are more important for increased cooperation, while fairness of institutions seems to work against cooperation. Cooperation increases with trust and group size, and is also higher in communities that have endogenised punishment as opposed to communities that still rely on external enforcement of rules and regulations. Cooperation declines as we move from communal areas into the resettlement schemes and with increasing size of the resource system. A very strong positive relationship exists between cooperation and biodiversity outcomes implying that communities with elevated levels of cooperation are associated with a healthy wildlife population. Biodiversity outcomes are more successful in communities that either received wildlife management training, share information or those that are located far away from urban areas and are not very close to the boundary of the game park. Erecting an electric fence, the household head's age, the number of years in school and number of years living in the area negatively affect biodiversity outcomes. One policy implication of this study is to increase autonomy in CAMPFIRE communities so that they are able to invest in good institutions, which allows them to self-organise and to manage wildlife sustainably.

AB Plant fossils are most commonly preserved as isolated organs, making it difficult to determine plant life habit or ecosystem structure from fossils. In particular, paleoecologists have struggled to reconstruct forest canopy structure, a character that fundamentally influences hydrology, nutrient cycling, and plant and animal life. Analyses utilizing cellular morphology and leaf carbon isotope composition have been proposed to reconstruct light regime, itself a proxy for canopy structure, and we apply these proxies to exquisitely preserved leaf fossils from the early Miocene Mush Valley site in central Ethiopia. Epidermal cell wall undulation (undulation index, UI) and carbon isotope values (delta C-13) were measured for 21 fossil leaves of a legume morphospecies, "Legume 1". Five leaves of a second legume morphospecies were also analyzed using the same procedures. Carbon isotope ratios and total organic carbon content were measured for 85 additional fossil leaves belonging to at least nine morphospecies. A large range of both leaf delta C-13 and UI values were obtained for Legume 1, indicating that different leaves were exposed to different amounts of light, as would be expected in a closed-canopy forest. However, Legume 1 leaf UI values do not correlate with leaf delta C-13 values, implying that one or both of these variables is driven by factors other than light exposure. Additional modern calibrations are needed to determine the key environmental variables for each measure, as well as the influence of forest openings on preserved signatures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Facilitative interactions among co-evolved representatives of the endemic Ponto-Caspian fauna are regarded as a major factor of their invasion success. Nevertheless, the most renowned examples represent interactions between different trophic levels or functional groups, while ecologically similar species can be expected to show competition-based niche partitioning. Here, we test for differences in the realized niche of three invasive Dikerogammarus species (Crustacea: Gammaridae) in their co-occurring range. We sampled multiple habitats within sites distributed along the River Danube to test whether some environmental variables could reveal spatial niche differentiation among the three species of Dikerogammarus, and if so, to test a predictive model outside the zone of co-occurrence. Spatial niche differentiation was present among the species, primarily determined by current velocity (and associated substrate preference), likely reflecting a stress tolerance-competitive ability trade-off. Suspended matter concentration was also relevant, suggesting food resources (through filter feeding) might represent another important niche axis, somewhat loosening the terms of co-existence between D.haemobaphes and the other two species. Environmental variables could effectively explain the absence of D.bispinosus in the Lower Danube, implying that the co-existence of the three species is possible only along a sufficiently wide current velocity gradient, and the observed turnovers are the result of niche expansion in the absence of the stronger competitor. Hence, differences in invasion success may be attributed to a stress tolerance-competitive ability trade-off. Our results suggest the advantage of D.villosus is attributable to its competitive dominance, allowing it to monopolize lentic and/or structured habitats, which represents a fortunate pre-adaptation to anthropogenic alterations of aquatic ecosystems. The presence of D.villosus does not greatly affect the expansion of D.haemobaphes; however, the exclusion of D.bispinosus from lentic habitats by D.villosus probably strongly limits its potential to spread by active dispersal.

AB Of the many techniques tested to date to rehabilitate degraded ecosystems, topsoil transfer appears to offer the best results. However, this method is recent, and results achieved in the short term (months to years) may not provide a sound indication of long-term vegetation reestablishment. In the plain of La Crau in southeastern France, many dry alluvial quarries were exploited in the 1970s-1980s and are nearly all now abandoned. Various topsoil transfers were performed when operations ceased, for various rehabilitation purposes (aesthetic, security, agricultural, etc.) and now provide the opportunity to test their efficacy in the 30-year long-term. We used an ecological analysis of plant communities and soil carried out in 2015 to compare the reference ecosystem (the steppe of La Crau, positive control) with un-rehabilitated quarry pits (negative control) and with four different rehabilitation treatments: (1) soil transfer (40 cm) with no contact with the water table; (2) soil transfer (40 cm) in contact with the water table; (3) more than 40 cm of soil transfer and (4) anthropogenic material deposits (spoils) unrelated to the characteristics of the reference soil. Our results show that the treatment most favorable to restoration of the species richness, diversity and composition of the steppe vegetation is transferring soil with fine particles (clay, silt) (treatment 1), at least 40 cm thick and without contact with groundwater. However, even after thirty years, and the re-establishment of traditional sheep grazing, full restoration of the reference steppe is far from being achieved. The other treatments lead to the emergence of hybrid or novel ecosystems, such as temporary ponds, riparian woodlands or matorrals with new variables and common variables to the historical ecosystem. Additional techniques to enhance the effectiveness of topsoil transfer are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Growing trade among nations is globalizing economies and driving environmental change. As a consequence, trade affects ecosystems, but trade is not currently a major topic in ecosystem research based on a survey of ecological journals. This survey reveals trade is rarely a title word or topic except for studies considering the movement of species or sustainability. However, when trade is considered at large scales, ecosystem mass balances are significantly influenced by traded products such as the nitrogen and phosphorus in fertilizers and livestock feeds. Trade also depletes resource species leading to ecosystem alterations such as the elimination of large predators and filter feeders in aquatic ecosystems and landscape conversion with attendant changes in biogeochemistry and biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. Trade is a source of alien species introductions. Trade also creates telecouplings among distant locations that cause changes in ecosystems including changes that may affect whether an ecosystem is a source or sink in relation to atmospheric carbon dioxide. There is a need for improved data tracing traded products, understanding the linkages of trade between ecosystem sources and sinks, and developing new methods and models to analyze trade impacts. Studies of trade impacts in relation to questions about changing ecological processes and the trajectory of ecosystems represent an important frontier.

AB Identifying areas of high biodiversity is an established way to prioritize areas for conservation [1-3], but global approaches have been criticized for failing to render global biodiversity value at a scale suitable for local management [4-6]. We assembled 3.1 million species distribution records for 40,401 vascular plant species of tropical Africa from sources including plot data, herbarium databases, checklists, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and cleaned the records for geographic accuracy and taxonomic consistency. We summarized the global ranges of tropical African plant species into four weighted categories of global rarity called Stars. We applied the Star weights to summaries of species distribution data at fine resolutions to map the bioquality (range-restricted global endemism) of areas [7]. We generated confidence intervals around bioquality scores to account for the remaining uncertainty in the species inventory. We confirm the broad significance of the Horn of Africa, Guinean forests, coastal forests of East Africa, and Afromontane regions for plant biodiversity but also reveal the variation in bioquality within these broad regions and others, particularly at local scales. Our framework offers practitioners a quantitative, scalable, and replicable approach for measuring the irreplaceability of particular local areas for global biodiversity conservation and comparing those areas within their global and regional context.

AB The vertical and horizontal distribution of larval stages of the most common intertidal barnacle and mussel species were characterized in near-shore waters of central Chile. Paired day/night cruises were conducted on four spring-summer dates between December 2007 and November 2008, under contrasting wind, wave height, and near-shore stratification conditions. Regardless of variability in oceanographic conditions, the highest abundances of barnacle and mussel larvae were found within 1500 m from shore. Non-uniform vertical distributions were observed for chthamalids, balanids and mussel larvae, but patterns of diel variability differed among them. Chthamalid and balanid nauplii, as well as balanid cyprids were more abundant in the upper 20 m of the water column, while the density of chthamalid cyprids was highest near the bottom. Mussel larvae were only found within 20 m of the surface. The Mean Depth Distribution (MDD) of all nauplii (balanid and chthamalid) and chthamalid cyprids was deeper during day than night, suggesting typical diel vertical migration (DVM), but this difference was statistically significant only for nauplii. Mussels did not show diel differences in vertical distribution. The amplitude of DVM, measured as the difference between daytime and nighttime MDD, decreased with increasing wave height in chthamalid and balanid nauplii, but not with along-shore wind stress. Chthamalid nauplii, and to a lesser extent, balanid nauplii were found below the pycnocline during the day and above at night, suggesting that DVM involves daily crossing of this density barrier. In contrast, cyprids of all barnacle species were distributed across the pycnocline with no clear pattern. The results suggest that barnacle and bivalve larvae may exhibit a variety of behavioral responses to position themselves in the water column despite typically turbulent near-shore waters, and that such behavior varies between species and through ontogeny within species. Moreover, some stages of barnacle larvae perform DVM, but the amplitude decreased with increasing wave height- which may be either a plastic response to environmental cues or merely turbulent mixing impeding the ability of larvae to perform vertical migration.

AB Fire affects and is affected by plants. Vegetation varies in flammability, that is, its general ability to burn, at different levels of ecological organization. To scale from individual plant traits to community flammability states, understanding trait effects on species flammability variation and their interaction is important. Plant traits are the cumulative result of evolution and they show, to differing extents, phylogenetic conservatism. We asked whether phylogenetic distance between species predicts species mixture effects on litterbed flammability. We conducted controlled laboratory burns for 34 phylogenetically wide-ranging species and 34 random two-species mixtures from them. Generally, phylogenetic distance did not predict species mixture effects on flammability. Across the plant phylogeny, most species were flammable except those in the non-Pinus Pinaceae, which shed small needles producing dense, poorly ventilated litterbeds above the packing threshold and therefore nonflammable. Consistently, either positive or negative dominance effects on flammability of certain flammable or those non-flammable species were found in mixtures involving the non-Pinus Pinaceae. We demonstrate litter particle size is key to explaining species nonadditivity in fuelbed flammability. The potential of certain species to influence fire disproportionately to their abundance might increase the positive feedback effects of plant flammability on community flammability state if flammable species are favored by fire.

AB Accurate counts of animals are critical for prioritizing conservation efforts. Past research, however, suggests that observers on aerial surveys may fail to detect all individuals of the target species present in the survey area. Such errors could bias population estimates low and confound trend estimation. We used two approaches to assess the accuracy of aerial surveys for African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) in northern Botswana. First, we used double-observer sampling, in which two observers make observations on the same herds, to estimate detectability of elephants and determine what variables affect it. Second, we compared total counts, a complete survey of the entire study area, against sample counts, in which only a portion of the study area is sampled. Total counts are often considered a complete census, so comparing total counts against sample counts can help to determine if sample counts are underestimating elephant numbers. We estimated that observers detected only 76% +/- SE of 2% of elephant herds and 87 +/- 1% of individual elephants present in survey strips. Detectability increased strongly with elephant herd size. Out of the four observers used in total, one observer had a lower detection probability than the other three, and detectability was higher in the rear row of seats than the front. The habitat immediately adjacent to animals also affected detectability, with detection more likely in more open habitats. Total counts were not statistically distinguishable from sample counts. Because, however, the double-observer samples revealed that observers missed 13% of elephants, we conclude that total counts may be undercounting elephants as well. These results suggest that elephant population estimates from both sample and total counts are biased low. Because factors such as observer and habitat affected detectability of elephants, comparisons of elephant populations across time or space may be confounded. We encourage survey teams to incorporate detectability analysis in all aerial surveys for mammals.

AB Studying the isotopic composition of the hair of two rodent species trapped in the territories of Great Cormorant colonies, we aimed to show that Great Cormorants transfer biogens from aquatic ecosystems to terrestrial ecosystems, and that these substances reach small mammals through the trophic cascade, thus influencing the nutrient balance in the terrestrial ecosystem. Analysis of delta C-13 and delta N-15 was performed on two dominant species of small mammals, Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus, inhabiting the territories of the colonies. For both species, the values of delta C-13 and delta N-15 were higher in the animals trapped in the territories of the colonies than those in control territories. In the hair of A. flavicollis and M. glareolus, the highest values of delta N-15 (16.31 +/- 3.01% and 17.86 +/- 2.76%, respectively) were determined in those animals trapped in the biggest Great Cormorant colony. delta N-15 values were age dependent, highest in adult A. flavicollis and M. glareolus and lowest in juvenile animals. For delta C-13 values, age-dependent differences were not registered. delta N-15 values in both small mammal species from the biggest Great Cormorant colony show direct dependence on the intensity of influence. Biogenic pollution is at its strongest in the territories of the colonies with nests, significantly diminishing in the ecotones of the colonies and further in the control zones, where the influence of birds is negligible. Thus, Great Cormorant colonies alter ecosystem functioning by enrichment with biogens, with stable isotope values in small mammals significantly higher in the affected territories.

AB Ecohydrological models of savanna rangeland systems typically aggregate plant species to very broad plant functional types (PFTs), which are characterized by their trait combinations. However, neglecting trait variability within modelled PFTs may hamper our ability to understand the effects of climate or land use change on vegetation composition and thus on ecosystem processes.
   In this study we extended and parameterized the ecohydrological savanna model EcoHyD, which originally considered only three broad PFTs (perennial grasses, annuals and shrubs). We defined several sub-types of perennial grasses (sub-PFTs) to assess the effect of environmental conditions on vegetation composition and ecosystem functioning. These perennial sub-PFTs are defined by altering distinct trait values based on a trade-off approach for (i) the longevity of plants and (ii) grazing-resistance.
   We find that increasing grazing intensity leads to a dominance of the fast-growing and short-lived perennial grass type as well as a dominance of the poorly palatable grass type. Increasing precipitation dampens the magnitude of grazing-induced shifts between perennial grass types. The diversification of perennial grass PFTs generally increases the total perennial grass cover and ecosystem water use efficiency, but does not protect the community from shrub encroachment.
   We thus demonstrate that including trait heterogeneity into ecosystem models will allow for an improved representation of ecosystem responses to environmental change in savannas. This will help to better assess how ecosystem functions might be impacted under future conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The lion Panthera leo is Critically Endangered in West Africa and is known to occupy only four protected areas within the region. The largest population persists in the trans-boundary W-Arly-Pendjari (WAP) ecosystem, in the border region of Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger. WAP harbors an estimated 350 individuals, or 90% of West Africa's lions. We modeled lion occupancy across WAP using systematic, vehicle-based spoor counts to assess how landscape variables related to biotic factors, management, and human impact influence lion distribution across WAR We surveyed 1110 km of roads across WAP in 2012, obtaining 79 lion detections in 32 of our 167 15 x 15 km sampling units (naive occupancy = 0.41). Overall occupancy (Psi) was 0.71 (95% SE = 0.56-0.83) when accounting for imperfect detection (p = 0.22, 95% SE = 0.18-0.27). The best predictors of lion occupancy were numbers of permanent protected area staff and mean monthly dry season precipitation. Model-averaged estimates suggest greatest lion occupancy in the Arly and Pendjari management blocks, with lowest occupancy in the tri-national W National Park. Our results suggest that lions in WAP are equally limited by management and biotic factors, and demonstrate how unevenly distributed protection effort limits the distribution of an apex predator across a protected landscape. We strongly recommend increased funding and better protection to increase lion occupancy in WAP, most urgently in the W National Park.

AB Most of the 2500 industrial-size mines operating around the world dispose of their tailings on land. For technical, spatial, and chemical reasons this is not always feasible, and attention has shifted to submarine tailings placement (STP) and deep-sea tailings placement (DSTP). Marine disposal presents numerous challenges that can have significant environmental impacts across a range of ecosystems. This review describes the processes at the basis of the disposal rationale and how these can affect its outcome, and outlines the ecological impacts that are associated with or interact with these processes. Mine waste disposal on to the seafloor appears to be poorly understood given the extent of its implementation. The uncertainty surrounding this method extends to our understanding of both biophysical processes and ecological impacts. For example, the potential role of vertically migrating species in transporting mine-disposed trace elements from deeper environments into the shallower surface layers has been largely overlooked, and, similarly, the nature, extent, and impact of secondary plumes that develop off the main tailings current are poorly described and quantified, as is their interaction with migrating biota. Furthermore, the vulnerability of deep-sea environments to human impacts and their potential for recovery remains largely unknown. Given the large degree of uncertainty around the impacts of this practice on a wide range of ecological communities, coupled with the high connectivity of both deep-water and pelagic environments, it is imperative that participating countries, the global scientific community, and managing entities act urgently to bridge these knowledge gaps, improve management practices, and take a more precautionary approach to the implementation of STP and DSTP.

AB Extreme weather is becoming more pronounced, making phenological patterns less predictable. Among the potential consequences, extreme weather may alter relationships of migratory birds with their seasonal food resources and thus impact valuable ecosystem regulating services (e.g., bird predation of herbivorous insects). Our goal was to quantify the effect of an extremely warm spring on these relationships in a U.S Midwest oak savanna. Average regional temperatures in the spring of 2009 coupled with record highs in 2010 (8 degrees C warmer) were the basis of a natural experiment for addressing our goal. In both springs we documented tree flowering and leaf-out phenology, related these to arrival and foraging behavior of the three most abundant migratory wood-warbler species (Parulidae), and quantified the effects of migratory bird foraging on insect density, size, and herbivory using a branch exclosure experiment. In 2009, the dominant tree species at our study site, eastern black oak (Quercus velutina), flowered in mid-May and the wood warblers foraged heavily in the savanna during this time. Branches from which birds were excluded exhibited a trend toward higher insect density, larger Lepidopterans, and greater flower damage than control branches. In 2010, tree phenology was four weeks earlier than in 2009 and the wood warblers were nearly absent from the savanna (83% fewer), likely because peak food availability preceded their arrival in mid-May. Insect density was 83% greater in 2009 than 2010. However, in 2010, 81% of sampled leaves exhibited substantial damage (>25% of leaf-area removed) compared with 27% of leaves in 2009, presumably due to a lack of herbivorous insect regulation by birds. Our results suggest that the extremely warm spring of 2010 altered linkages between migratory birds and their invertebrate prey that are typical during years of average weather, which likely affected habitat use and the delivery of ecosystem regulating services.

AB Owing to the reinterpretation of its morphological synapomorphies, the taxonomic composition of the Ectateus generic group had been ambiguous. The present study scrutinized all existing taxonomic concepts of the group based on a cladistic analysis of the adult morphology of all of the Afrotropical platynotoid Platynotina genera. The phylogenetic relationships were reconstructed using parsimony and Bayesian inference. The results show that all previous taxonomic concepts of the Ectateus generic group concerned paraphyletic entities. The cladistic analysis revealed the following synapomorphies for the taxon: (1) presence of basal indentations of the pronotal disc, (2) ratio of prothorax width to its maximal height >6.0, and (3) ratio of maximal height of the prothorax to total height <0.3. Moreover, phylogenetic studies revealed the existence of the Upembarus generic group, a sister-taxon group to the Ectateus generic group, within the Afrotropical platynotoid Platynotina. Autapomorphic and synapomorphic character mapping show that several taxonomic and nomenclatural changes are needed to consider the particular generic-level entities traditionally assigned to Afrotropical platynotoid Platynotina as monophyletic lineages. The following taxonomic and nomenclatural adjustments are made in this paper: Pteroselinus gen. nov. is erected to accommodate a single species that was previously assigned to Zidalus: Pteroselinus insulariscomb. nov. Additionally, the following synonymies are proposed: Anchophthalmops (=Platykochiussyn. nov.), Angolositus (=Aberlencussyn. nov., =Platymedvedeviasyn. nov.), Glyptopteryx (=Microselinussyn. nov., =Quadrideressyn. nov., =Synquadrideressyn. nov.). In addition, Kochogaster is lowered in rank and is treated as one of the subgenera of Anchophthalmus. Moreover, Pseudoselinus is treated as a subgenus of Upembarus. An identification key to all Afrotropical platynotoid Platynotina genera and subgenera is presented. Zoogeographical analyses revealed the following dispersal barriers for the Ectateus generic group: (1) the Sahara (northern barrier); (2) the dry ecosystems of Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa (southern barrier); and (3) the Congolian rainforests (internal distributional gap). The ancestor of the taxon probably originated in East African ecoregions that predominantly contained wattletrees (acacias) and CommiphoraJacq. Moreover, past climate changes seem to have had a great impact on the observed generic distribution.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London

AB QuestionsHow has the vegetation of the major biomes (Grassland, Nama-karoo, Albany Thicket, Azonal) of southeastern South Africa changed over the course of the 20th century? How do changes in climate and land-use drivers relate to long-term changes in vegetation? What are the implications of these findings for land degradation hypotheses and future climate change projections for the region?
   LocationThe biogeographically complex semi-arid, Karoo Midlands region of the southeastern part of South Africa.
   MethodsWe re-photographed 65 historical landscape photographs, the majority of which dated from 1950 to 1970, to measure long-term changes in the cover of grasses, dwarf shrubs, tall shrubs and alien plants. The cover of each growth form as well as total vegetation cover was estimated from matched photograph pairs with the aid of detailed cover estimates recorded in the field. The change in cover was relativized between sites by dividing the difference in cover between the two time steps by the number of years between photographs, expressed as the percentage change in cover per decade. Significant changes in mean annual rainfall and the standardized precipitation index (SPI) from 27 climate stations were assessed using a Mann-Kendall test for trend. This non-parametric test was also used to assess the significance of long-term trends in the number of cattle, sheep and goats in each of the biomes over the period 1911-1996.
   ResultsGrass cover and total vegetation cover had increased by between 1.0% to 4.5% per decade and 2.0% to 4.5% per decade, respectively, in all biomes investigated. In contrast, the cover of dwarf shrubs had decreased significantly by between 0.25% and 3.0% per decade, although not significantly so in the Nama-karoo biome. The change in tall shrub cover varied between different biomes but had generally increased in the study area. Alien plants were absent in the historical photographs and had increased significantly but only in Azonal habitats, where increases of 1.5% per decade were recorded. For the majority of climate stations no significant trend in mean annual rainfall and SPI values was recorded, while stocking rate had declined significantly in all biomes by between 36% and 48% from 1911 to 1996.
   ConclusionsThe findings support the hypothesis that vegetation cover and condition has improved in the semi-arid regions of South Africa. These findings are discussed in light of future projections for the region.

AB 1. Starvation tolerance is an important trait for animals, as most will encounter starvation within their lifetime. Sit-and-wait predators are better adapted to starvation owing to their naturally low encounter rate with prey. 2. Starvation tolerance was studied under three levels of disturbance of wormlion larvae, a strict sit-and-wait predator that constructs pits. 3. Frequently disturbed wormlions constructed pits less often, and larger individuals continued to construct pits more frequently than smaller ones. It was expected that a high disturbance level would lead to a high rate of mass loss, however, surprisingly, the rate of mass loss was not higher for the frequently disturbed group. This suggests that the energetic cost of pit construction and maintenance is not as high as previously suggested for other pit-building predators. 4. Larger individuals tolerated starvation better, in losing a lower proportion of their initial body mass and having higher chances of survival throughout the experiment. 5. The effect of starvation on the distance to neighbours was also investigated, and starved individuals were expected to maximise this distance in order to avoid interference competition. However, wormlions were usually clumped, and starvation or feeding had no effect on the pits' spatial pattern, suggesting that interference competition plays a minor role in this species. 6. Generally, wormlion larvae demonstrated a high starvation tolerance and low mortality rates even after 9 weeks of starvation.

AB Landscape structure influences host-parasite-pathogen dynamics at multiple scales in space and time. Landscape epidemiology, which connects disease ecology and landscape ecology, is still an emerging field.
   We argue that landscape epidemiology must move beyond simply studying the influence of landscape configuration and composition on epidemiological processes and towards a more comparative, systems approach that better incorporates social-ecological complexity.
   We illustrate our argument with a detailed review, based on a single conceptual systems model, of geographic variation in drivers of avian influenza in Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and Southern Africa.
   Our three study regions are similar in some ways but quite different in others. The same underlying mechanisms apply in all cases, but differences in the attributes of key components and linkages (most notably avian diversity, the abiotic environment, land use and land cover, and food production systems) create significant differences in avian influenza virus prevalence and human risk between regions.
   Landscape approaches can connect local- and continental-scale elements of epidemiology. Adopting a landscape-focused systems perspective on the problem facilitates the identification of the most important commonalities and differences, guiding both science and policy, and helps to identify elements of the problem on which further research is needed. More generally, our review demonstrates the importance of social-ecological interactions and comparative approaches for landscape epidemiology.

AB QuestionsWhat is the relative importance of our methodological decisions concerning sampling (plot size) and data analysis (data transformation, resemblance coefficient, hierarchical clustering strategy and number of clusters) in vegetation classification? Are there differences between the conclusions when the full range or only a more practical narrow range of methodological choices is tested? What is the difference between results for actual and random data?
   LocationRock grassland in Hungary.
   MethodsThe full procedure of vegetation classification was simulated using actual and random data. Variation in classification results was partitioned using distance-based redundancy analysis. The RDA models were subjected to variation partitioning to determine the relative importance of methodological decisions.
   ResultsRDA models explained more variation in classifications of random than in real data. Classification algorithm, cluster level, data transformation and mean plot size were always included among the most significant variables, however, the other variables also had a considerable effect in certain situations.
   ConclusionsAs adjusted R-2 values suggest, the overall effect of methodological decisions on classifications is larger for randomly structured than actual data, due possibly to a stronger clustering tendency in the latter. The clustering algorithm, cluster level, data transformation and plot size should be chosen most carefully before classification analyses, but any of the examined decisions can significantly affect the result. In addition to the mean, the range of plot sizes should also be carefully delimited during releve selection for classification studies. The main decision about the classification algorithm is whether a chain-forming or group-forming method is used. The data transformation had a more significant effect on real data than on simulations with random variation, thus supporting the ability of the application of different abundance scales in revealing different facets of biologically relevant patterns in community composition. The resemblance measure had a relatively weak effect, suggesting that it is not as influential as previously thought.

AB Reduced grazing pressure is expected to promote recovery of degraded semi-arid savanna. Transformation of degraded livestock ranches to a wildlife reserve in 1982 created a system with about one-third of the grazing pressure, which was maintained until 2011. Herbaceous composition and condition were monitored on four occasions between 1982 and 2011. Baseline measurements were taken following eight years of above-average rainfall conditions. Palatable perennial grasses and sward condition deteriorated markedly in response to severe, sustained drought during the early 1990s. Perennial grasses did not respond to a single record high rainfall season (2000) but recovered following a sequence of four above-average years (2008-2011). This monitoring study illustrated that recovery of a degraded semi-arid savanna may require decades of reduced grazing pressure for some degree of recovery in the absence of intervention. An appropriate time frame for management of these systems is in the order of a century.

AB In the Arctic, areas close to seabird colonies are often characterized by exceptionally rich vegetation communities linked with the high nutrient subsidies transported by seabirds from the marine environment to the land. These areas also support soil invertebrate communities of which springtails (Collembola) often represent the most abundant and diverse group. Our study focused on springtail community composition in the vicinity of seabird (little auk, great skua and glaucous gull) nesting areas in different parts of Svalbard (Magdalenefjorden, Isfjorden and Bjornoya), and on their comparison with adjacent areas not impacted by seabirds. Out of a total of 35 springtail species recorded, seven were found only within the ornithogenically influenced sites. Although geographical location was the strongest factor differentiating these springtail communities, ornithogenic influence was also significant regardless of the location. When each location was considered separately, seabirds were responsible for a relatively small but strongly significant proportion (8.6, 5.2 and 3.9%, respectively, for each site) of total springtail community variability. Species whose occurrence was positively correlated with seabird presence were Folsomia coeruleogrisea, Friesea quinquespinosa, Lepidocyrtus lignorum and Oligaphorura groenlandica near Magdalenefjorden, Arrhopalites principalis, Folsomia bisetosella and Protaphorura macfadyeni in Isfjorden, and Folsomia quadrioculata on Bjornoya.

AB Background: African wildlife experienced a reduction in population size and geographical distribution over the last millennium, particularly since the 19th century as a result of human demographic expansion, wildlife overexploitation, habitat degradation and cattle-borne diseases. In many areas, ungulate populations are now largely confined within a network of loosely connected protected areas. These metapopulations face gene flow restriction and run the risk of genetic diversity erosion. In this context, we assessed the "genetic health" of free ranging southern African Cape buffalo populations (S.c. caffer) and investigated the origins of their current genetic structure. The analyses were based on 264 samples from 6 southern African countries that were genotyped for 14 autosomal and 3 Y-chromosomal microsatellites.
   Results: The analyses differentiated three significant genetic clusters, hereafter referred to as Northern (N), Central (C) and Southern (S) clusters. The results suggest that splitting of the N and C clusters occurred around 6000 to 8400 years ago. Both N and C clusters displayed high genetic diversity (mean allelic richness (A(r)) of 7.217, average genetic diversity over loci of 0.594, mean private alleles (P-a) of 11), low differentiation, and an absence of an inbreeding depression signal (mean F-IS = 0.037). The third (S) cluster, a tiny population enclosed within a small isolated protected area, likely originated from a more recent isolation and experienced genetic drift (F-IS = 0.062, mean A(r) = 6.160, P-a = 2). This study also highlighted the impact of translocations between clusters on the genetic structure of several African buffalo populations. Lower differentiation estimates were observed between C and N sampling localities that experienced translocation over the last century.
   Conclusions: We showed that the current genetic structure of southern African Cape buffalo populations results from both ancient and recent processes. The splitting time of N and C clusters suggests that the current pattern results from human-induced factors and/or from the aridification process that occurred during the Holocene period. The more recent S cluster genetic drift probably results of processes that occurred over the last centuries (habitat fragmentation, diseases). Management practices of African buffalo populations should consider the micro-evolutionary changes highlighted in the present study.

AB During the summers of 2008 and 2009, net methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were investigated from 4 tundra ecotopes: normal lowland tundra (LT), bird sanctuary tundra (BT), the tundra in an abandoned coal mine (CT) and the tundra in scientific bases (ST) in Ny-Alesund of the High Arctic. Tundra soils in CT (184.5 +/- 40.0 mu g CH4/(m(2).hr)) and ST (367.6 +/- 92.3 mu g CH4/(m(2).hr)) showed high CH4 emissions due to the effects of human activities, whereas high CH4 uptake or low emission occurred in the soils of LT and BT. The lowland tundra soils (mean, -4.4-4.3 mu g N2O/(m(2).hr)) were weak N2O sources and even sinks. Bird activity increased N2O emissions from BT with the mean flux of 7.9 mu g N2O/(m(2).hr). The mean N2O fluxes from CT (45.4 +/- 10.2 mu g N2O/(m(2).hr)) and ST (78.8 +/- 18.5 mu g N2O/(m(2).hr)) were one order of magnitude higher than those from LT and BT, indicating that human activities significantly increased N2O emissions from tundra soils. Soil total carbon and water regime were important factors affecting CH4 fluxes from tundra soils. The N2O fluxes showed a significant positive correlation with ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) contents (r = 0.66, p < 0.001) at all the observation sites, indicating that ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) content acted as a strong predictor for N2O emissions from tundra soils. The CH4 and N2O fluxes did not correspond to the temperature variations of soil at 0-15 cm depths. Overall our results implied that human activities might have greater effects on soil CH4 and N2O emissions than current climate warming in Ny-Alesund, High Arctic.

AB Questions
   How many vegetation classes and alliances are described in European countries? What are the main factors driving the number of these vegetation types? What would be the estimated number of vegetation types in so far under-explored regions outside Europe?
   Location
   Twenty-three countries and regions in Europe. Fourteen regions outside Europe.
   Methods
   We compiled lists of vegetation types (phytosociological classes as broader units and alliances as narrower ones) described in European countries with a well-developed vegetation classification. The delimitation and nomenclature of classes and alliances were standardized according to a unified classification system for Europe. Generalized linear models were used to test the influence of floristic richness, area, sampling effort, altitudinal range and geological diversity on the number of vegetation types. Best predictors were used to estimate the number of classes and alliances in selected regions over the world.
   Results
   In agreement with broadly recognized diversity patterns, we found the highest numbers of vegetation types in countries with a mediterranean climate. The numbers of classes and alliances per country did not depend on the country size, while country's floristic richness was identified as the main explanatory variable, accounting for up to 67% of explained deviance. The number of alliances increased in countries with broad altitudinal range and large geological diversity, but these variables did not influence the number of classes. Accordingly, estimates of the number of alliances for other (mostly non-European) regions were adjusted when including altitudinal range as an additional predictor.
   Conclusions
   At broad scales, the number of vegetation types can be predicted from floristic richness, which indirectly accounts for the effect of area, and from environmental heterogeneity. Furthermore, this overview demonstrates that the number of phytosociological alliances reflects biogeographic patterns in Europe better than the number of classes. We also estimate, for the first time, the number of vegetation types that may be expected in so far poorly surveyed regions worldwide, using procedures of vegetation classification analogous to those used in European phytosociology.

AB Pit-building antlion larvae are opportunistic predators that dig conical pits in loose soils, and prey on small arthropods that fall into their traps. We investigated different behavioral traits of second and third instar larvae selected for similar body masses, while also exploring the behavioral consistency and personalities of the third instar stage. Second instar larvae constructed smaller pits than third instar larvae. The former also responded more slowly to prey and exploited prey less efficiently. Notably, all these instar-based differences disappeared after molting into the third instar stage. In addition, third instar larvae exhibited consistent behavior in their pit size, response times to prey and to less extent in relocation distances. We detected two axes of behavior. The first axis included a correlation between pit size, response time and prey exploitation efficiency, thus reflecting investment in foraging activity. The second axis seemed to represent a trade-off between response time and relocation distance, implying that individuals that responded more slowly to prey, relocated over larger distances. These results point to coordinated behavior reflecting different levels of investment in foraging, while also emphasizing the importance of instar stage, in addition to body mass, when studying the behavior of such organisms characterized by a complex life cycle.

AB Understanding the mechanisms that affect larval dispersal is critical to management of marine populations. Rockfishes Sebastes spp. do not settle to benthic habitats immediately after metamorphosis, but instead remain in the water column for weeks to months. Movements of larvae and pelagic juveniles during their months at sea are largely unknown. It is traditionally thought that young rockfishes are planktonic, moving at the mercy of ocean currents, but this assumption is unverified. In this study, swimming capabilities (critical speed) of larval and pelagic juvenile stages of 6 rockfish species (blue [S. mystinus], yellowtail [S. flavidus], brown [S. auriculatus], kelp [S. atrovirens], gopher [S. carnatus], and splitnose [S. diploproa]) were evaluated to determine their ability to behaviorally influence dispersal. Rockfish larvae have critical speeds of 0.5 to 1.8 cm s(-1) (1 to 3 body lengths per second [bl s(-1)]) at parturition, whereas newly settled juveniles are capable of swimming 8.6 to 53.5 cm s(-1) (5 to 9 bl s(-1)). Swimming ability increases throughout ontogeny and postflexion rockfishes can swim faster than typical water motions in their natural habitat (i.e. mean ocean currents off central California). Critical speeds for Sebastes spp. are substantially lower than those for larvae and juveniles of tropical species at similar body sizes. Rockfishes, however, have swimming speeds at settlement comparable to some tropical species, as rockfishes settle at larger sizes. The increasing ability of rockfishes to outswim currents during their pelagic phase (acting as nekton rather than plankton) may promote individual survival as well as enhance retention and/or long-distance dispersal-thus swimming has important implications for population connectivity and sustainability.

AB In Antarctica, the marine ecosystem is dynamically interrelated with the terrestrial ecosystem. An example of the link between these two ecosystems is the biogeochemical cycle of phosphorus. Biovectors, such as penguins, transport phosphorus from sea to land, play a key role in this cycle. In this paper, we selected three colonies of penguins, the most important seabirds in Antarctica, and computed the annual quantity of phosphorus transferred from sea to land by these birds. Our results show that adult penguins from colonies at Ardley Island, the Vestfold Hills, and Ross Island could transfer phosphorus in the form of guano at up to 12 349, 167 036, and 97 841 kg/a, respectively, over their breeding period. These quantities are equivalent to an annual input of 3.96x10(9)-1.63x10(10) kg of seawater to the land of Antarctica. Finally, we discuss the impact of phosphorus on the ice-free areas of the Antarctica.

AB Climatic warming has induced marked shifts in the geographical distribution and seasonal phenology of many species, although the impacts of climatic changes on the interactions between species across trophic levels are far less well known. Freshwater microcosms were used to test the effect of temperature on the life history traits of a prey species, the fairy shrimp Chirocephalus diaphanus (Anostraca), the abundance of a predator, the microcrustacean Heterocypris incongruens (Ostracoda), and on the interaction between them. When reared in the absence of predators, C.diaphanus survival was low at the highest temperature (25 degrees C) and greatly reduced at the lowest temperature (5 degrees C). It was reproductively most successful at an intermediate temperature (20 degrees C), suggesting that it may benefit from the increase in temperature predicted under future climate change scenarios. In the absence of other species, temperature would have to increase dramatically to affect C.diaphanus adversely.Heterocypris incongruens was more abundant and its predation on C.diaphanus greatest at higher temperatures, partially offsetting the positive effect of raised temperature on prey observed when the predator was absent. The net effect was that the optimal temperature for C.diaphanus when coexisting with its predator was lower than when it was in isolation. This means that currently predicted increases in temperature ultimately may be detrimental to C.diaphanus. Predation rates were generally enhanced by high temperature, prey size and prey density, with significant interaction between them. Thus, the positive effects of raised temperature on predation rate were additionally dependent upon prey characteristics, being strongest when prey were large and at high density and weakest when prey were small and at low density. Interactions with a natural enemy, in this case a predator, may alter how species respond to raised temperatures; prey size and density further modify the outcome of this interaction. This context dependency in the response of both predators and prey to temperature suggests that the ecological impacts of future climate change on trophic interactions may be difficult to predict.

AB Functional redundancy of species sharing a feeding strategy and/or maximum size has been hypothesized to contribute to increased resilience of marine fish communities (the "portfolio effect"). A consistent time-series of survey data of fish in the North Sea was used to examine if trophic functional groups or maximum length of species (L-max) groups with larger numbers of species had lower coefficients of variation in abundance and biomass over time than did groupings with fewer species. Results supported this hypothesis. However, the stabilizing effect of numbers of species in a group on variation in abundance or biomass could be accounted for by the Law of Large Numbers, providing no evidence that specific ecological processes or co-adaptations are necessary to produce this effect. This implies that successful conservation policies to maintain the resilience of a marine fish community could be based on strategies to maintain the number of species in functional groups, without having to know the detailed ecological interactions between the species.

   TOP-DOWN; COMPETITION; RECOVERY
AB Grazing fishes and invertebrates are influential in marine ecosystems because they open space for benthic recruits, alter post-settlement recruit survival, and can often determine benthic community composition. On tropical reefs, grazing fishes and sea urchins can play key roles in limiting growth of fleshy macro-algae, thereby facilitating coral recruitment and maintaining coral-dominated communities. However, as grazer abundance increases, grazer influence on corals (or other settlers) may shift from being positive and indirect by reducing space competitors, to being negative and direct by damage or removal of coral recruits. Fishing can alter both the abundances and types of dominant grazers, with potential cascading effects on coral recruitment and subsequent community organization. In Kenya, sea urchins dominate grazing on heavily fished reefs, while herbivorous and omnivorous fishes dominate grazing within fisheries closures (marine protected areas). We used reefs under these 2 fishery management systems to investigate the effects of fish versus sea urchin grazing on the availability of settlement substrate for corals, subsequent coral settlement, and mortality of coral recruits. Fish and sea urchin grazers were equally effective at clearing benthic space for coral settlement. However, grazing associated with high densities of sea urchins on fished reefs removed many coral recruits after settlement. In contrast, fish grazing within fisheries closures enhanced coral survival compared to non-grazed treatments. We conclude that the effects of reduced abundance of grazing fishes (on available space for coral settlement) may be initially offset by increased sea urchin grazing, but that higher urchin abundances may ultimately reduce coral cover by their negative influence on post-settlement survival.

AB The monitoring of fisheries target species in three marine protected areas (MPAs) located in the NW Mediterranean provided important conclusions on management effects. The abundance, occurrence and biomass of large fish showed consistent and growing trends inside the MPAs. Fish diversity was also favoured by protection. Nevertheless, spatial variance of these indicators at a medium scale was often of the same order as that caused by time between different protection levels. The carrying capacity was determined for the first time in western Mediterranean MPAs in five out of six sites studied, and in all cases it was achieved within the first five years of protection. The observed values indicate that the system of the studied MPAs is representative of the general coastal environment of the Balearic Islands, but is far from the potential of other MPAs which are considered as hot spots in other localities. Likewise, this study shows that partially protected areas can also be fairly effective if their habitats fit with those required by target species and fishing modalities are suitably regulated or banned.

AB Vachellia karroo (Hayne) Banfi & Galasso, previously known as Acacia karroo Hayne, is a very common woody species in South Africa, and displays a large amount of morphological and architectural variation. Previous morphological studies have provided evidence to support the recognition of a number of segregate species, but this has not been supported by early protein electrophoresis studies. Genetic variability of the species throughout South Africa was examined by means of the Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) DNA "fingerprinting" to determine whether there is any genetic structure that correlates to the morphological diversity. Based upon 33 samples from across the South African distribution of this species, we found no evidence for any genetic structuring, suggesting the species is one panmictic entity. The existence of morphologically discrete varieties in light of this genetic finding is difficult to explain, and perhaps the species ought to be considered as an ochlospecies. A scenario whereby the various morphotypes evolved in refugia during previous climates followed by subsequent expansion and introgression during the current interglacial may explain this conundrum. Alternatively, the evolution of the morphotypes has been recent and rapid, and the genetic variation observed here represents the ancestral gene pool that has not yet undergone lineage sorting as a consequence of isolation.

AB Recent concern about declines in pollinating insects highlights the need for better understanding of plant-pollinator interactions. One promising approach at the community scale is network analysis, which allows actual interactions to be assessed, unlike biodiversity surveys, which only identify the potentially interacting organisms. We highlight useful network properties for conservation research and examples of their use in the study of rare species, invasive species, responses of communities to climate change, and habitat loss and restoration. We suggest that nestedness, degree, and interaction strength asymmetry are the most useful network properties for applied research on plant-pollinator interactions, but also highlight practical concerns regarding their measurement. We encourage the adoption of a network approach when an understanding of function within communities, rather than simple community composition, is useful for management.

AB To determine seasonal variability in mineralization dynamics of mussel biodeposits, we applied a multiple-element approach measuring mineralization rates of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and silicate (Si) during three periods (March, August and November). The results of this study showed that mineralization rates vary between seasons and between elements and that mineralization dynamics were influenced by both temperature and biodeposit nutrient composition. Mineralization rates were 3.2 +/- A 0.4 mmol C, 0.17 +/- A 0.04 mmol N, 0.06 +/- A 0.02 mmol P and 3.91 +/- A 3.75 mmol Si per gram biodeposit (DW) per day, which represented 24 % of the particulate organic C and 17 % of the particulate organic N in mussel biodeposits. Seasonal variability was largest for Si mineralization with 60-80-fold higher rates measured in March compared to August and November. This difference is most likely related to the difference in biodeposit nutrient composition. It was furthermore shown that the labile fraction of biodeposits became mineralized after, respectively, 18, 9 and 13 days during the experimental periods in March, August and November. This indicates that temperature enhances biodeposit decomposition with approximately 2-3 times faster turnover at a 10 A degrees C temperature interval (Q (10) ).

AB Competition for light has driven forest trees to grow exceedingly tall, but the lack of a single universal limit to tree height indicates multiple interacting environmental limitations. Because soil nutrient availability is determined by both nutrient concentrations and soil water, water and nutrient availabilities may interact in determining realised nutrient availability and consequently tree height. In SW Australia, which is characterised by nutrient impoverished soils that support some of the world's tallest forests, total [P] and water availability were independently correlated with tree height (r = 0.42 and 0.39, respectively). However, interactions between water availability and each of total [P], pH and [Mg] contributed to a multiple linear regression model of tree height (r = 0.72). A boosted regression tree model showed that maximum tree height was correlated with water availability (24%), followed by soil properties including total P (11%), Mg (10%) and total N (9%), amongst others, and that there was an interaction between water availability and total [P] in determining maximum tree height. These interactions indicated a trade-off between water and P availability in determining maximum tree height in SW Australia. This is enabled by a species assemblage capable of growing tall and surviving (some) disturbances. The mechanism for this trade-off is suggested to be through water enabling mass-flow and diffusive mobility of P, particularly of relatively mobile organic P, although water interactions with microbial activity could also play a role.

AB This study presents an application of analytical electron microscopy in biology to investigate the chemical composition of the spherites and to elucidate the importance of these methods in the life sciences. The structure of the spherites in the midgut cells of first, second, and third instar larvae Euroleon nostras was investigated by a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), and energy filtering TEM (EFTEM). The structure and chemical composition of the spherites changed during the metamorphosis. In first larvae, the spherites are composed of amorphous, flocculent material, containing C, N, and O. In second larvae and third ones, the spherites have concentric layers of alternating electron-dense and electron-lucent material. In second larvae, Si, P, Ca, and Fe are accumulated in the spherite organic matrix, composed of C, N, and O. In the spherites of third larvae, additionally Al was found. Therefore, the spherites are thought to store organic compounds in all three larval stages of E. nostras and additionally inorganic compounds in second and third ones. In first larvae, spherites are present in the midgut cells; in second and third larvae, they are present in the cells of the midgut and in its lumen. It could be suggested that the spherites might be involved in the regulation of the appropriate mineral composition of the internal environment and could serve as the accumulation site of nontoxic waste materials that cannot be metabolized.

AB Identifying environments where invasive plants are most invasive is key to understanding causes of invasion and developing effective management strategies. In mixed-grass prairie, invasive plants are often successful in relatively wet, nitrogen-rich areas, and areas protected from grazing. Dalmatian toadflax, a common invader of mixed-grass prairie, can also be favored by high water and nitrogen availability, but is thought to be relatively unpalatable to cattle, and therefore favored by grazing. We used spatially-adjusted model selection techniques to quantify relationships between toadflax cover (measured using very high-resolution aerial imagery), and relative snow deposition (estimated with a blowing snow model), slope, aspect, soil texture, and grazing intensity (estimated by proximity to water tanks). Toadflax was common throughout the 400 ha study site, occurring in 742 of 1,861 images. Toadflax cover was high on steeper slopes, particularly those with southern aspects. These two topographic variables were more effective in explaining toadflax distribution than modeled snow deposition, suggesting that factors other than snow deposition cause toadflax invasion on south-facing slopes. Toadflax cover was also high in areas further from water tanks, indicating that grazing may inhibit toadflax invasion. More broadly, this result suggests that grazing can reduce invasion of even relatively unpalatable species in ecosystems with long evolutionary histories of grazing.

ID EVOLUTION; AFRICA
AB Aim - This paper aims to provide the first exhaustive list of woody species present in the northern part of the Republic of Congo, describing the vegetation types, characterizing the ligneous forest stands and explaining the distribution range of characteristic species.
   Location - The 1.23 million ha of the logging concession of 'Congolaise Industrielle des Bois', situated in the North of the Republic of Congo (1.41 degrees N 16.32 degrees E), were prospected during six years. The study area is bordered by the Sangha River to the west and by the Likwala-aux-Herbes swamps to the east.
   Methods - The checklist, given as an electronic appendix, documents 702 woody species. Each species is annotated with the following headings when the information is known: scientific, pilot and local names, life-form, preferential habitat, distribution, seed dispersal type, human use, abundance and foliage phenology. Field observations have been augmented with existing bibliography.
   Results - A total of 392 genera and 79 families are presented. Ficus is the largest genus with seventeen species. 73% of taxa are endemic to the Guineo-Congolian Region centre. The sarcochorous functional diaspore type represents 71%. Eleven percent of the species are anemochorous and are mostly emergent trees. Forty-four species newly recorded for the Republic of Congo are especially commented.
   Main conclusions - Terra firma forests are characterized by deciduous, light-demanding and wind-dispersed emergent tree species. Evergreen stands are mainly found at the confluence of the Sangha River and Likwala-aux-Herbes swamps. This forest could be regarded as equivalent to the other interfluvial forest blocks of the Major Fluvial Refuge in the Congo basin.

AB Lake deposits of the Holsteinian (Mazovian) Interglacial from eastern Poland are characterised by a rich occurrence of mollusc shells. Mollusc assemblages from five sites: Ortel Krolewski, Szymanowo, Ossowka, Hrud II and Roskosz are presented. Populations of the snail Viviparus diluvianus (Kunth) are subjected to biometric analysis to verify how climatic changes in the Holsteinian Interglacial influenced the shell morphology. The pollen analysis allows assignment of sediments from different sites to the certain parts of the interglacial, characterised by influences of maritime or continental climates. A combination of palaeobotanical and mollusc data shows that variability in shell morphometry of V diluvianus is strongly connected with climate conditions. The strongest correlation with the climate shows slimness of the shell. It appears that during the periods with predominating oceanic climate the mean slimness of the shell increases, smaller and wider individuals are typical of the climate with continental features and lake shallowing. Thus V diluvianus shells from eastern Poland are used to reconstruct climate from Taxus zone up to the end of the climatic optimum of the Holsteinian (Mazovian) Interglacial = MIS 11 (Carpinus-Abies zone).

AB Using the freshwater annelid Lumbriculus variegatus (Oligochaeta), the presence of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes was investigated by analyzing metabolites of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pyrene in treatments with and without the CYP inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PBO). The results show a low biotransformation capability of L. variegatus (7% of total pyrene body burden as metabolites at 168h). Addition of PBO resulted in a significant reduction of metabolites, suggesting the presence of a CYP in L. variegatus. Besides 1-hydroxypyrene, three peaks representing unknown metabolites were detected in LC-FLD (liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection) chromatograms of L. variegatus. Deconjugations showed that sulfonation and glucosidation are involved in the formation of these unknowns. Further studies with the time of flight mass analyzer provided the identification of the glucose-sulfate conjugate of 1-hydroxypyrene. The same metabolites were detected in the solvent-nonextractable fraction by incubation of the tissue residues with proteinase K, suggesting that part of these metabolites are bound to proteins. Overall, the slow biotransformation of pyrene by L. variegatus (involving CYP) supports the use of this species in standard bioaccumulation tests; however, the tissue-bound metabolite fraction described in the current study deserves further investigation for its toxicity and availability to upper trophic levels through diet.

AB It is not clear if tree canopies in savanna ecosystems exert positive or negative effects on soil moisture, and how these might affect understory plant carbon balance. To address this, we quantified rooting-zone volumetric soil moisture (theta(25 cm)), plant size, leaf-level and whole-plant gas exchange of the bunchgrass, bush muhly (Muhlenbergia porteri), growing under and between mesquite (Prosopis velutina) in a southwestern US savanna. Across two contrasting monsoon seasons, bare soil theta(25 cm) was 1.0-2.5% lower in understory than in the intercanopy, and was consistently higher than in soils under grasses, where theta(25 cm) was similar between locations. Understory plants had smaller canopy areas and volumes with larger basal diameters than intercanopy plants. During an above-average monsoon, intercanopy and understory plants had similar seasonal light-saturated leaf-level photosynthesis (A (net-sat)), stomatal conductance (g (s-sat)), and whole-plant aboveground respiration (R (auto)), but with higher whole-plant photosynthesis (GEP(plant)) and transpiration (T (plant)) in intercanopy plants. During a below-average monsoon, intercanopy plants had higher diurnally integrated GEP(plant), R (auto), and T (plant). These findings showed little evidence of strong, direct positive canopy effects to soil moisture and attendant plant performance. Rather, it seems understory conditions foster competitive dominance by drought-tolerant species, and that positive and negative canopy effects on soil moisture and community and ecosystem processes depends on a suite of interacting biotic and abiotic factors.

AB Question
   Cocos nucifera, the coconut palm, has a pantropical distribution and reaches near monodominance in many atolls, low lying islands and coastal regions. This paper examines the ecological correlation between C. nucifera abundance and changes in forest structure, floristic diversity and forest soil characteristics.
   Location
   Palmyra Atoll NWR (USA), Central Pacific Ocean.
   Methods
   Plant surveys were conducted on 83 transects (each 100 m2). All plants >= 5 cm in height were identified and counted; large plants were also measured and ground cover was surveyed. Major macronutrients, pH, macro-elements/base cations, micronutrients and pedogenic elements, and thermodynamic stability levels were quantified from soil samples taken at each transect.
   Results
   Even in a low diversity atoll environment, we found that high abundances of C. nucifera corresponded with pronounced differences in forest communities including: lower diversity of established trees and regenerating understorey; higher stem density and stand basal area; lower abundance of major macronutrients; and differences in macro and trace elements and energy content of soil organic matter. Historical natural experiments document that the expansion of C. nucifera was the likely causative agent of these changes.
   Discussion
   Cumulatively, these data show that C. nucifera has important impacts on floristic, structural and soil characteristics of forests where it becomes dominant. Given the high proportion of tropical coastal areas in which C. nucifera is now naturalized and abundant, this likely has important implications for coastal forest diversity and structure.

AB The metacommunity approach is an adequate framework to study coexistence between interacting species at different spatial scales. However, empirical evidence from natural metacommunities necessary to evaluate the predictive power of theoretical models of species coexistence remains sparse. We use two African ant species, Cataulacus mckeyi and Petalomyrmex phylax, symbiotically associated with the myrmecophyte Leonardoxa africana africana, to examine spatio-temporal dynamics of species coexistence and to investigate which environmental and life-history parameters may contribute to the maintenance of species diversity in this guild of symbiotic ants. Using environmental niche partitioning as a conceptual framework, we combined data on habitat variation, social structure of colonies, and population genetics with data from a colonisation experiment and from observation of temporal dynamics. We propose that the dynamics of ant species colonisation and replacement at local and regional scales can be explained by a set of life history traits for which the two ants exhibit hierarchies, coupled with strong environmental differences between the different patches in the level of environmental disturbances. The role of the competition-colonisation tradeoff is discussed and we propose that interspecific tradeoffs for traits related to dispersal and to reproduction are also determinant for species coexistence. We therefore suggest that species-sorting mechanisms are predominant in the dynamics of this metacommunity, but we also emphasise that there may be many ways for two symbionts in competition for the same host to coexist. The results speak in favour of a more complete integration of the various metacommunity models in a single theoretical framework.

AB Caddisfly larvae secrete silk to line the inner walls of their portable cases to create smooth surfaces that enhance their respiratory efficiency. In this study, Goera japonica Banks larvae were allowed to repair their portable cases using artificial mineral particles with different surface textures to compare the conformation and quantity of silk secreted on the inner case surface. Three types of particles with different surface roughness were used in the experiments; surface roughness was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Particle selection experiments were conducted for every possible pairing of the three particle types. Thick silk layers were secreted on cases built using rough particles, hardly any silk layers on cases built using smooth particles and brindled thin silk layers were deposited over intermediate particles. The mean silk secretion rate was much higher (244%) with rough particles than with smooth ones, while the rate was somewhat higher (60%) with intermediate particles. In addition, smooth particles were strongly preferred to rough particles, while smooth particles were slightly more preferable than intermediate particles. These results suggest that G. japonica larvae preferred particles with smoother surfaces as case-building materials, because silk production can be decreased as surface texture becomes smoother. Also, there may be a trade-off between the costs of material selection and silk secretion for case construction by caddisfly larvae; saving energy by secreting less silk on smoother particles allows more energy to be spent on selecting smoother particles or on other activities.

AB A major challenge for ecologists has long been to develop a model to explain the coexistence of grasses and trees in the savanna. The recent shift in emphasis to non-equilibrium-based theories has resulted in a rethinking of this problem. As resource allocation models have been replaced by demographic ones, the focus has shifted to plant life histories. The tree/grass ratio is now conceptualized as a function of disturbance history. Empirical studies demonstrate that repeat fires trap tree sprouts in perpetual juvenile states. Ecologists suggest natural pathways for juveniles to escape, reach maturity, and maintain tree/grass ratios. This study documents how long-fallow agriculture serves as an anthropogenic pathway. The study compares tree cover on long-fallow and unfarmed savanna plots in southern Mali where burning is annual. Tree height, girth, and species were recorded for 29 quadrats. The results demonstrate a significant difference in the size, number, and species of trees; those on fallow plots were taller, more numerous, and more diverse.

AB Zooarchaeological analyses of animal remains from the Petexbatun sites in the Guatemalan lowlands provide proxy evidence to test a hypothesis of dietary insufficiency during the Maya "collapse." Ecological foraging theory and resource depression models are used to interpret animal use patterns before and after the disintegration of the Petexbatun polity at the end of the Late Classic period (around A.D. 800). Environmental failure models of the Maya "collapse" at the end of the Late Classic imply that a dietary insufficiency, and particularly a lack of animal resources, was associated with the political and social transitions of this period. However, the results of this zooarchaeological study do not support this hypothesis and point instead to very limited early reductions of only highest-ranked dietary species. The lack of evidence for specific resource depression associated directly with the period of political collapse does not support a model of environmental failure during political disintegration in the Petexbatun. Correlations are found between animal use patterns and the specifics of site size and periods of peak political activity, suggesting that small-scale resource depressions might have resulted at some sites during early periods of human population growth, site expansion, and increasing political activity.

AB Recovery of indigenous species subsequent to the clearing of invasive alien plants (IAPs) is crucial for ecosystem recovery to occur. However, cleared sites are often just left in the hope that revegetation will occur naturally. In riparian areas of Kruger National Park (KNP), the Working for Water (WfW) Programme has cleared IAPs on a regular basis, but little post-clearance monitoring has taken place. Thus investigating short-term effects of IAPs and IAP clearing on plant community diversity and vegetation recovery provided an ideal opportunity to assess feasible targets of natural ecosystem recovery in similar areas. Vegetation was sampled from twelve transects along the Sabie River in and adjacent to the KNP, before (March/April 2006) and after (March 2007) the annual clearing of IAPs by WfW. Rarefied species richness, alpha diversity and evenness of distribution of species all declined with increasing density of IAPs (P < 0.05). There was a mean reduction in IAP density of 80% (S.E +/- 6%) (P=0.002) through the clearing by WfW. After clearing of IAPs, indigenous vegetation densities increased, with herbaceous growth forms showing the largest increase in transects that were previously heavily invaded. Thus, in this system, which is relatively undisturbed by human activities, initial recovery of indigenous vegetation can occur without further restorative interventions. This process is more than likely aided by the continuous clearing of IAPs by WfW as this acts to deplete alien seed banks and maintain IAPs at acceptable and manageable levels. (C) 2008 SAAB.

AB Physical processes affecting the dispersion of passive particles (e.g., coral larvae, pollutants) in the Upper Florida Keys are investigated through in situ observations (acoustic Doppler current profilers and surface drifters) and numerical ocean circulation modeling (horizontal resolution: 800 m, vertical resolution: 0.1-1 m). During the study period in August 2006 (set to coincide with an annual coral spawning event), Lagrangian trajectories in the vicinity of the reef tract indicate that alongshelf advection was mainly poleward and due to the subtidal flow of the Florida Current, while cross-shelf advection was mainly onshore and due to wind-driven currents. Tidal currents resulted in predominantly alongshelf displacements, but did not contribute significantly to net passive particle transport on a weekly timescale. Typical advection distances were of the order of 10 to 50 km for pelagic durations of 1 week, with significant variability linked to geographical location. In contrast, the direction of transport from the offshore reefs remained essentially constant (i.e., potential dispersion pathways were limited). In addition, Lagrangian trajectories and progressive vector diagrams in the vicinity of the reef tract indicate that alongshelf variations in the cross-shelf velocity gradient associated with the FC are relatively weak on an alongshore scale of ca. 50 km. For August 2006, the highest particle concentrations typically occur inshore of the reef tract, thereby suggesting that onshore transport associated with wind-driven currents contributes significantly to the local retention of passive organisms (and other tracers) in the Upper Florida Keys. Overall, the results illustrate the necessity of conducting targeted in situ observations and numerical model predictions to quantify the physical processes affecting reef-scale advection, especially in an effort to understand local retention and dispersion mechanisms for larval marine organisms.

AB In tropical areas, annual rainfall and predation have been reported to drive population dynamics of most species of large herbivores studied so far, with little direct empirical evidence for density-dependent responses of life-history traits. We here investigated in a game ranch in Zimbabwe density-dependent responses of body condition and recruitment in an impala (Aepyceros melampus (Lichtenstein, 1812)) population that underwent an experimental drastic reduction of density within 2 years under similar rainfall and predation pressure. Body condition of all sex and age classes was lower during the high-density year than during the low-density year, suggesting increased competition for restricted resources at high density. In addition, we observed a significant increase in population recruitment (from 0.47 to 0.80 juveniles/female) as population density declined. Our study provides a rare example of a direct density-dependent response of body condition at the individual level in a tropical ungulate species, and indicates that food resource variation controls population dynamics of impala under constant and moderate predation pressure: as is commonly reported in temperate populations of large herbivores.

AB Invasive exotic plants threaten nature reserves and wildlands, where eradication may be neither a cost-effective nor an obtainable objective for controlling widespread weeds. In such cases, long-term management objectives should address the maintenance of desirable community and ecosystem processes through reduction in invasive plant abundance and distribution to acceptable levels. Strategic approaches to invasive plant control should include restoration of critical functional groups, mitigation of environmental stressors and reduction in exotic sources of disturbance to improve biotic resistance of the native community and reduction in invasive plant dominance. Monitoring to assess progress toward management goals is essential to identify needed changes in protocol as more is learned about drivers of community processes.

AB Much of the western Indian Ocean suffered widespread loss of live coral in 1998 and interest is now focussed on the indirect effects of this coral loss on other components of the ecosystem, in particular fishes. However, it is just as important to identify changes in fish assemblages at locations that did not suffer coral mortality to understand local versus regional drivers. We surveyed benthic and fish communities on a reef flat in Mauritius five times between 1994 and 2005. The design allowed for comparison through time, along the coast and between inshore and offshore reef locations. The benthic community demonstrates a clear trend along the coast, likely in response to a dredged water ski lane, but little change through time. Branching Acropora colonies dominate much of the live coral and best explain patterns in the fish assemblage (P < 0.01). Few changes in overall fish species richness through time were identified, and observed changes were within fishery target families rather than species reliant on live coral. Departure from expected levels of taxonomic distinctness suggests degradation in the community associated with the dredged ski lane. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling of the fish assemblage demonstrates a similar pattern to that seen in the benthos; greater differences along the coast (Global R = 0.34) than through time (Global R = 0.17) and no trend between reef positions. SIMPER analysis identified two species of Stegastes as the main drivers of trends in the MDS plot and the most dominant of these, S. lividus, appears to be reducing species richness of the remaining fish community. The study highlights Mauritius as a regional refugia of thermally-sensitive corals and specialised fish, suggesting a need for careful management.

AB Three patterns of target-neighbor plant defoliation were imposed on a late-seral, perennial, C-4-grass, Bouteloua curtipendula, in three long-term grazing regimes to determine the influence of selective defoliation on competitive interactions and species replacement in a semiarid savanna on the Edwards Plateau, Texas, USA. Short-term (3-yr) target plant defoliation did not significantly affect either tiller or plant responses in any of the three grazing regimes. Neighbor plant defoliation, either alone or in combination with target plants, produced a significant defoliation interaction with time for tiller number and basal area per plant, but not for tiller recruitment or mortality. The minimal effect of selective defoliation on the intensity of competitive interactions in this semiarid community indicates that selective grazing has a less definitive role in mediating herbivore-induced species replacement than it does in mesic grasslands and savannas. This interpretation is discussed within the context of long-term (45-yr) change in herbaceous vegetation associated with grazing in this community.
   Cumulative tiller recruitment in the intensively grazed regime was only 44 % of that in the ungrazed regime because of greater plant mortality and fewer surviving plants that recruited; tillers. Target plant mortality (50 %) only occurred in the intensively grazed regime and the proportion of target plants that initiated tillers decreased by 70, 48 and 32 % in the ungrazed, moderately and intensively grazed regimes, respectively, during the final two years of the investigation. The decrease in cumulative tiller recruitment in all grazing regimes was probably mediated by a drought-induced increase in median tiller age the second year of the study. However, tiller per tiller recruitment rate among plants that recruited at least one tiller remained relatively constant among grazing regimes and years. Intensive, long-term grazing has modified the population structure of this late-seral perennial grass to the extent that population responses to both herbivory and periodic drought have been altered in comparison with those of ungrazed and moderately grazed populations. Ecological consequences of a herbivore-induced transition in population structure may be to minimize the effect of selective herbivory on competitive interactions and to function as an avoidance mechanism to reduce the probability of localized population extinction in response to intensive long-term herbivory.

AB Shellfish collection by humans is a form of selective predation, with the larger individuals of a few target species being taken, and can have direct and indirect effects. We investigated the indirect effects of collection by experimental removals of two target species, Cellana tramorerica (Sowerby) and Nerita atramentosa (Reeve) from a rocky shore in south eastern Australia. Removals of single species were compared with the removal of both species and frequent removals were compared against once-off removal events.
   The removal of Cellana resulted in an increase in micro-algal abundance. This increase was greater where Cellana were frequently removed than where once-off removal of the species occurred. The removal of Cellana also promoted the immigration of adult Cellana, but the overall population was dominated by juveniles. Immigration of juvenile Cellana was high in all cases and was not affected by removals of either target species. The removal of Nerita, whether once-off or frequent, resulted in a decrease in micro-algae, but did not affect the migration of other species. The combined removal of Cellana and Nerita did not affect microalgal abundance, a result that was successfully predicted from the summed effect of the single species removals. In addition, the combined removal had no effect on the abundance of other species. The single and combined removal of these two gastropod species did not influence the species richness at this study site. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Plant communities of trampled soil dominated by plants characterized by the C4-assimilation syndrome were investigated in Europe. These species, belonging to genera such as Chamaesyce, Amaranthus, Eleusine, Eragrostis and Setaria, are thermophilous, late-germinating, prostrate herbs or grasses. The centre of their distribution is in the (Sub)Tropics. A syntaxonomic revision of the phytosociological material from Europe (incl. the Macaronesian Archipelago) revealed three alliances: the Euphorbion prostratae from Spain, the Polycarpo-Eleusinion indicae from Italy, and Slovenian and Croatian Istria, and the Eragrostio-Polygonion arenastri from temperate regions of Europe. The latter two syntaxa are described as new. All three alliances belong to the order Eragrostietalia (class Stellarietea mediae). Vicarious (ecologically analogous) communities occur also in southern Africa, eastern Asia and North America. The communities studied in the present paper are considered to be an impoverished form of highly diversified trampled plant communities typical of (sub)tropical areas.

AB Freshwater Anostraca offer a potential for a variety of technical applications. These include production in aquaculture facilities or harvesting from natural reserves of cysts or biomass. However, economical realism limits the number of viable options to either subsidized, or to well-focussed activities aimed at end-products with a high added value.

AB The importance of interspecific competition for nest sites between the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus noveboracensis) and the cloudland deermouse (P. maniculatus nubiterrae) were investigated in the montane forests of southwestern Virginia over 3 years. Trials were conducted for both species using large, outdoor enclosures in order to examine: (i) nest site preference in isolation and (ii) nest site selection made in the presence of potential competitors. Both species demonstrated a strong preference for arboreal nest sites when tested without competitors present. After the introduction of a heterospecific intruder, Fl leucopus often shifted to a non-arboreal nest while P. maniculatus continued to use arboreal nests. Intruding P. maniculatus displaced resident P. leucopus from P. leucopus' preferred nest sites in all 3 years while intruding P. leucopus never displaced P. maniculatus. Neither species was routinely displaced in conspecific trials. Resident P. maniculatus also excluded P. leucopus from access to preferred nesting sites in all three years while P. leucopus were only able to exclude P. maniculatus in the 3rd year. Both species exhibite relatively low frequencies of exclusion in conspecific trials with the exception of P. maniculatus which excluded high proportions of conspecific intruders in the second year. We suggest that the asymmetrical advantage enjoyed by P. maniculatus in nest site selection may result from both site-specific effects and a species-specific influence on P. leucopus. Nonetheless, the intensity of such influence varied between years, perhaps as a function of population density, and did not appear to drastically influence continued coexistence of these congeners.

Post-metanauplii consumed at maximum 66 +/- 9 rotifers ind.-1 min.-1 (mean +/- S.D.) while the largest adult females maximally ingested 347 +/- 37 rotifers min.-1.
   Regardless of predator size and sex, prey consumption was dependent on prey density.  Functional response curves either plateaued or declined at 320 prey ml-1 in post-metanauplii, juveniles and adults I, and at 640 ml-1 in adults II.  Females consumed c. 40% more prey than males.  On a daily basis, adult II females consumed up to 1.05 mg rotifer dry weight (10% of their own body weight) while post-metanauplii consumed up to 0.2 mg DW (100% of their body weight).  Intermediate stages had intermediate consumption rates.  Filtration rates indicated that a fully grown S. proboscideus may filter as much as 2 1 of water per day, suggesting that fairy shrimps, in their natural environment, may often be food-limited.

AB The addition of clay (20 and 50 mg/L) to large (850 L) enclosures containing a complete plankton community from Star Lake (Norwich, VT, USA) caused pronounced changes in zooplankton community structure. Cladocerans were greatly suppressed and copepods and some rotifers were also suppressed, though not as severely as the cladocerans. The dominant ciliate, the oligotrich Strobilidium gyrans, was greatly inhibited, but two other oligotrichs were unaffected. Most of the less common ciliates were unaffected as well. There were no clay effects on algal or bacterial densities or on the physical parameters measured (excepting Secchi depth). Therefore, the suppressive effects of the clay on ciliates are probably due to direct effects on the zooplankton. The presence of suspended particles such as clays may be an important factor affecting the species structure of ciliates and metazoan zooplankton in plankton communities.

AB The study provides a 2.5 year record of Rhenosterkop Dam (KwaNdebele, South Africa) plankton population dynamics and production in relation to physical and chemical changes which occurred during the trophic depression and stabilization phases of the reservoir. The mean volume of the reservoir was 4% of full storage capacity. Water temperatures ranged from 14-degrees-C to 27-degrees-C. Due to inorganic suspensoids, the euphotic zone averaged 2.6 m. An anaerobic zone developed each summer. The nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and silica concentrations did not display a seasonal pattern, but the latter two nutrients declined over the study. The dominant phytoplankton group was the cryptophytes while the zooplankton population was dominated by crustaceans. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 27 mg m-3 and were positively correlated to silica and SRP concentrations and inversely with NH4-N concentrations. Primary production ranged from 22.6 to 375 mgC m-2 h-1; changes in A(max) were positively correlated to silica and SRP concentrations. Total zooplankton dry weight biomass varied from < 0.5 to > 4 mg l-1. Annual zooplankton (secondary) production was 8 to approximately 15 gC m-3 a-1; both primary and secondary production were greatest in the first 12 months of study and remained at low levels for the remainder, similar to the trends for silica and SRP. The data indicate that the reservoir shifted from eutrophic to mesotrophic during the study, typical of events in new reservoirs, and that changes in the plankton populations were largely the result of changing nutrient concentrations.

AB Despite voluminous literature identifying the impacts of invasive species, summaries of monetary costs for some taxonomic groups remain limited. Invasive alien crustaceans often have profound impacts on recipient ecosystems, but there may be great unknowns related to their economic costs. Using the InvaCost database, we quantify and analyse reported costs associated with invasive crustaceans globally across taxonomic, spatial, and temporal descriptors. Specifically, we quantify the costs of prominent aquatic crustaceans - crayfish, crabs, amphipods, and lobsters. Between 2000 and 2020, crayfish caused US$ 120.5 million in reported costs; the vast majority (99%) being attributed to representatives of Astacidae and Cambaridae. Crayfish-related costs were unevenly distributed across countries, with a strong bias towards European economies (US$ 116.4 million; mainly due to the signal crayfish in Sweden), followed by costs reported from North America , Asia. The costs were also largely predicted or extrapolated , thus not based on empirical observations. Despite these limitations, the costs of invasive crayfish have increased considerably over the past two decades, averaging US$ 5.7 million per year. Invasive crabs have caused costs of US$ 150.2 million since 1960 and the ratios were again uneven (57% in North America and 42% in Europe). Damage-related costs dom-inated for both crayfish (80%) and crabs (99%), with management costs lacking or even more under-reported. Re-ported costs for invasive amphipods (US$ 178.8 thousand) and lobsters (US$ 44.6 thousand) were considerably lower, suggesting a lack of effort in reporting costs for these groups or effects that are largely non-monetised. Despite the well-known damage caused by invasive crustaceans, we identify data limitations that prevent a full accounting of the economic costs of these invasive groups, while highlighting the increasing costs at several scales based on the avail-able literature. Further cost reports are needed to better assess the true magnitude of monetary costs caused by invasive aquatic crustaceans.

AB The present study aimed to investigate the role of propagule pressure (P), abiotic (A), and biotic (B) factors (collectively indicated as PAB) on the suitability of the Mediterranean island of Sardinia (Italy) to be invaded by the tree Acacia saligna, recently included in the list of invasive alien species of European Union concern.
   To this aim, a binomial Generalized Linear Model was applied for disentangling the relationship between 432 A. saligna occurrence records and 10 thematic layers, at high-resolution (10 x10 m), used as proxies for the 3 categories of PAB variables. The 432 occurrence records of A. saligna were periodically monitored (period 20002018) to check the persistence of the populations and their invasive status. The predictive power of the model was evaluated by computing the mean of the AUC scores, through cross-fold validation. The model adequately described how the PAB factors influence the presence of A. saligna which is mainly shaped by abiotic factors such as topography, and biotic factors such as the presence of woody dune vegetation, and to a lesser extent by other predictors. The projection of the model to the whole island clearly shows that suitability varies at the landscape level due to the variation of the PAB across the territory. The probability of A. saligna occurrence near the coast is higher in sand dunes. In the internal areas of the island it occurs close to the roads and urban areas. This study and the tested methodology could represent a suitable tool to prioritize areas for the monitoring of A. saligna to meet the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No. 1143/2014 on Invasive Alien Species (the IAS Regulation).

AB Grassland degradation has become a global environmental concern. Livestock grazing under inappropriate grassland management and climate change contribute to this. Mitigating grassland degradation through revising the management pattern is needed to improve livestock production sustainability. The current study explores if a multi-household management pattern (M-pattern) is a better approach than single-household pattern (S-pattern) from the perspective of ecological efficiency (EE). EE reflects the ability of a household to gain economic output with less inputs and undesirable environmental conditions. We divided the sample households into multi-group (M group), single-renting group (S-R group) and single-no-renting group (S-NR group). The M group households graze livestock on their merged contracted grasslands; the S-R group households graze on contracted grasslands individually; and the S-NR group households graze on contracted and rented grasslands individually. A slack-based model was used to estimate the EE of 413 herders surveyed from three grassland types of two major areas in Inner Mongolia. The EE of the M group was 0.38, significantly higher than that of the S-R group (0.31) and the S-NR group (0.24). The higher EE of the M group was due to better environmental, economic, and input performances when compared with the S-R group and due to better environmental performance and input performances when compared with the S-NR group. The findings indicate that the M-pattem is a better fit for grassland management from the perspective of EE. This suggests that under the private grassland tenure arrangement, the M-pattern should be promoted to reduce grassland degradation and improve economic sustainability.

AB Background Giant clams and scleractinian (reef-building) corals are keystone species of coral reef ecosystems. The basis of their ecological success is a complex and fine-tuned symbiotic relationship with microbes. While the effect of environmental change on the composition of the coral microbiome has been heavily studied, we know very little about the composition and sensitivity of the microbiome associated with clams. Here, we explore the influence of increasing temperature on the microbial community (bacteria and dinoflagellates from the family Symbiodiniaceae) harbored by giant clams, maintained either in isolation or exposed to other reef species. We created artificial benthic assemblages using two coral species (Pocillopora damicornis and Acropora cytherea) and one giant clam species (Tridacna maxima) and studied the microbial community in the latter using metagenomics. Results Our results led to three major conclusions. First, the health status of giant clams depended on the composition of the benthic species assemblages. Second, we discovered distinct microbiotypes in the studied T. maxima population, one of which was disproportionately dominated by Vibrionaceae and directly linked to clam mortality. Third, neither the increase in water temperature nor the composition of the benthic assemblage had a significant effect on the composition of the Symbiodiniaceae and bacterial communities of T. maxima. Conclusions Altogether, our results suggest that at least three microbiotypes naturally exist in the studied clam populations, regardless of water temperature. These microbiotypes plausibly provide similar functions to the clam host via alternate molecular pathways as well as microbiotype-specific functions. This redundancy in functions among microbiotypes together with their specificities provides hope that giant clam populations can tolerate some levels of environmental variation such as increased temperature. Importantly, the composition of the benthic assemblage could make clams susceptible to infections by Vibrionaceae, especially when water temperature increases.

AB Apex carnivores are wide-ranging, low-density, hard to detect, and declining throughout most of their range, making population monitoring both critical and challenging. Rapid and inexpensive index calibration survey (ICS) methods have been developed to monitor large African carnivores. ICS methods assume constant detection probability and a predictable relationship between the index and the actual population of interest. The precision and utility of the resulting estimates from ICS methods have been questioned. We assessed the performance of one ICS method for large carnivores-track counts-with data from two long-term studies of African lion populations. We conducted Monte Carlo simulation of intersections between transects (road segments) and lion movement paths (from GPS collar data) at varying survey intensities. Then, using the track count method we estimated population size and its confidence limits. We found that estimates either overstate precision or are too imprecise to be meaningful. Overstated precision stemmed from discarding the variance from population estimates when developing the method and from treating the conversion from tracks counts to population density as a back-transformation, rather than applying the equation for the variance of a linear function. To effectively assess the status of species, the IUCN has set guidelines, and these should be integrated in survey designs. We propose reporting the half relative confidence interval width (HRCIW) as an easily calculable and interpretable measure of precision. We show that track counts do not adhere to IUCN criteria, and we argue that ICS methods for wide-ranging low-density species are unlikely to meet those criteria. Established, intensive methods lead to precise estimates, but some new approaches, like short, intensive, (spatial) capture-mark-recapture (CMR/SECR) studies, aided by camera trapping and/or genetic identification of individuals, hold promise. A handbook of best practices in monitoring populations of apex carnivores is strongly recommended.

AB The thinking of landscape sustainability discussed thewin-win goal of landscape management for both ecological conservation and social development. The China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative has a pathway of green development towards sustainability, which could be benefited from a corporation on transnational landscape management. Although previous remote sensing observations showed that the ecosystem improvement and social development can coexist in most of the Belt and Road region, whether the change tendencies can be sustained have been neglected. Based on the continuous vegetation index, nighttime light and landcover datasets between 1980s-2010s, a detailed observation of the landscape evolution was obtained in this study. Depending on the identifications of temporal breakpoints, the time series was separated to identify the former and latter tendencies, and the evolution score were evaluated. The results showed that the vegetation greening trend weakened in nearly half of the region, and the arid region mostly experienced vegetation browning lately. The evolution patterns of ecological landscape and social landscape were coincided distributed in China and India, and in Southeast Asia was not scored high for both ecological conservation and social development. Consequently, we should not be overly optimistic about the synergy between ecosystem improvement and social development. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many dryland regions, traditional pastoral land use strategies are exposed to various drivers such as demographic or socio-economic change. This may lead to an adjustment of livelihood strategies and behavior of pastoral households, involving a change in attitudes toward livestock, pasture condition and social norms. We use an agent-based model to examine long-term social-ecological consequences and implications for system resilience of such behavioral changes (e.g., giving up a social norm). The model captures feedback between pastures, livestock and household livelihood in a common property grazing system. We systematically compare three stylized household behavioral types (traditional, maximizer and satisficer) that differ in their preferences for livestock, their compliance with social norms on pasture resting and how they are influenced by the behavior of others. Simulation results show that the traditional, norm-abiding household type maintains the pasture condition, provided that overall household numbers do not exceed a critical threshold. In contrast, a switch to a maximizer type that ignores norms may lead to long-term pasture degradation and livestock loss, pushing the system to an undesirable state. A change toward a new satisficing household type that constrains its herd size while diversifying its income sources can lead to improved pasture conditions and higher total livestock numbers, even with increased household numbers. We conclude that changes in household behavior have strong implications for long-term social-ecological system dynamics and have to be considered to assess the resilience of pastoral common property systems.

AB Species diversity patterns are governed by complex interactions among biotic and abiotic factors over time and space, but are essentially the result of the diversification dynamics (differential speciation and extinction rates) over the long-term evolutionary history of a clade. Previous studies have suggested that temporal variation in global temperature drove long-term diversity changes in Crocodylia, a monophyletic group of large ectothermic organisms. We use a large database of crocodylian fossil occurrences (192 spp.) and body mass estimations, under a taxic approach, to characterize the global diversification dynamics of crocodylians since the Cretaceous, and their correlation with multiple biotic and abiotic factors in a Bayesian framework. The diversification dynamic of crocodylians, which appears to have originated in the Turonian (c. 92.5 Ma), is characterized by several phases with high extinction and speciation rates within a predominantly low long-term mean rate. Our results reveal long-term diversification dynamics of Crocodylia to be a highly complex process driven by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors which influenced the speciation and extinction rates in dissimilar ways. Higher crocodylian extinction rates are related to low body mass disparity, indicating selective extinctions of taxa at both ends of the body mass spectrum. Speciation rate slowdowns are noted when the diversity of the clade is high and the warm temperate climatic belt is reduced. Our finding supports the idea that temporal variations of body mass disparity, self-diversity, and the warm climate belt size provided more direct mechanistic explanations for crocodylian diversification than do proxies of global temperature.

AB The interaction between science and policy is often iterative: policy defines the need for scientific information, and the resulting science shapes future policy. This evolution is exemplified by the history of marine protected areas (MPAs). We describe how some policy applications of MPAs have changed through time from focusing on fisheries to becoming an ecosystem-based conservation tool, and then back to a more integrated fisheries-conservation approach. We show that changing applications of MPAs shaped the kind of research conducted to inform policies and also that the research results influenced those policies (e.g., from fisheries to conservation, and from standalone MPAs to MPA networks). We use California's MPA experience within the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem as a case study to illustrate this process.

AB Background Invasive plant species pose a global threat because they alter ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. The majority of plants form mutualistic mycorrhizal associations with mycorrhizal fungi, which contribute to the nutrient and water supply as well as diversity, competitive ability, and ecosystem productivity. In addition, the role of mycorrhizal interactions in plant invasiveness and the susceptibility or resistance of a habitat to invasion is increasingly recognized. However, the mechanisms by which mycorrhizae contribute to invasion remain unresolved. Scope Here, we provide an overview of the empirical evidence and discuss the prospects for mycorrhizaemediated plant invasion. Overall, mycorrhizal fungi appear to have impacts on plant invasion that depend on the similarities between the mycorrhizal associations of the alien and native plants. We introduce plant mycorrhizal niche space (PMNS) as a plant's ability to exploit and shape the mycorrhizal fungi pool of a habitat based on its dependency on mycorrhizal fungi, traits and priority effects. Conclusions Collectively, the available evidence supports the idea that PMNS is independent of place of origin (invasive status). Understanding the drivers of the PMNS of both native and alien plant species may help to predict the potential invasiveness of plants and the invasibility of a habitat, to elucidate the role of the mycorrhizal fungal community in plant invasion and the impact of plant invasion on the structure of the mycorrhizal fungal community in new habitats (i.e., neighbour effect) and to improve restoration planning. In this regard, we highlight a number of knowledge gaps and discuss future research directions.

AB Neotropical seasonally dry forests (NSDFs) are widely distributed and possess high levels of species richness and endemism; however, their biogeography remains only partially understood. Using species distribution modelling and parsimony analysis of endemicity, we analysed the distributional patterns of the NSDF avifauna in order to identify their areas of endemism and provide a better understanding of the historical relationships among those areas. The strict consensus trees revealed 17 areas of endemism for NSDFs, which involve four large regions: Baja California, Caribbean-Antilles islands, Mesoamerica and South America. These well-resolved clades are circumscribed by geographical and ecological barriers associated with the Gulf of California, the leading edge of the Caribbean plate, the Tehuantepec Isthmus, the Polochic-Motagua fault, the Nicaragua Depression, the Choco forest, the Amazon basin and the Andean Cordillera. Relationships among groups of NSDFs found here suggest that evolution of their avifauna involved a mixture of vicariance and dispersal events. Our results support the idea of independent diversification patterns and biogeographical processes in each region, including those previously associated with the Pleistocene Arc Hypothesis for NSDFs of south-eastern South America. This study provides a biogeographical framework to open new lines of research related to the biotic diversification of NSDFs.

AB Coral reefs of the North Indo-West Pacific provide important ecosystem services to the region but are subjected to multiple local and global threats. Strengthening management measures necessitate understanding the variability of larval connectivity and bridging global connectivity models to local scales. An individual-based Lagrangian biophysical model was used to simulate connectivity between coral reefs for three organisms with different early life history characteristics: a coral (Acropora millepora), a sea urchin (Tripneustes gratilla), and a reef fish (Epinephelussp). Connectivity metrics and reef clusters were computed from the settlement probability matrices. Fitted power law functions derived from the dispersal kernels provided relative probabilities of connection given only the distance between reefs, and demonstrated that 95% of the larvae across organisms settled within a third of their maximum settlement distances. The magnitude of the connectivity metric values of reef cells were sensitive to differences both in the type of organism and temporal variability. Seasonal variability of connections was more dominant than interannual variability. However, despite these differences, the moderate to high correlation of metrics between organisms and seasonal matrices suggest that the spatial patterns are relatively similar between reefs. A cluster analysis based on the Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity of sink and source connections synthesized the inherent variability of these multiple large connectivity matrices. Through this, similarities in regional connectivity patterns were determined at various cluster sizes depending on the scale of interest. The validity of the model is supported by 1) the simulated dispersal kernels being within the range of reported parentage analysis estimates; and, 2) the clusters that emerged reflect the dispersal barriers implied by previously published population genetics studies. The tools presented here (dispersal kernels, temporal variability maps and reef clustering) can be used to include regional patterns of connectivity into the spatial management of coral reefs.

AB Vachellia karroo (formerly Acacia karroo) is a wide-spread legume species indigenous to southern Africa. Little is known regarding the identity or diversity of rhizobia that associate with this plant in its native range in South Africa. The aims of this study were therefore: (i) to gather a collection of rhizobia associated with V. karroo from a wide range of geographic locations and biomes; (ii) to identify the isolates and infer their evolutionary relationships with known rhizobia; (iii) to confirm their nodulation abilities by using them in inoculation assays to induce nodules under glasshouse conditions. To achieve these aims, soil samples were collected from 28 locations in seven biomes throughout South Africa, which were then used to grow V. karroo seedlings under nitrogen-free conditions. The resulting 88 bacterial isolates were identified to genus-level using 16S rRNA sequence analysis and to putative species-level using recA-based phylogenetic analyses. Our results showed that the rhizobial isolates represented members of several genera of Alphaproteobacteria (Bradyrhizobium, Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, and Rhizobium), as well as Paraburkholderia from the Betaproteobacteria. Our study therefore greatly increases the known number of Paraburkholderia isolates which can associate with this southern African mimosoid host. We also show for the first time that members of this genus can associate with legumes, not only in the Fynbos biome, but also in the Albany Thicket and Succulent Karoo biomes. Twenty-six putative species were delineated among the 88 isolates, many of which appeared to be new to Science with other likely being conspecific or closely related to E. alkalisoli, M. abyssinicae, M. shonense, and P. tropica. We encountered only a single isolate of Bradyrhizobium, which is in contrast to the dominant association of this genus with Australian Acacia. V. karroo also associates with diverse genera in the Grassland biome where it is quite invasive and involved in bush encroachment. Our findings therefore suggest that V. karroo is a promiscuous host capable of forming effective nodules with both alphaand beta-rhizobia, which could be a driving force behind the ecological success of this tree species.

AB Plantations of Eucalyptus globulus Labill. have expanded rapidly over the last four decades across temperate parts of the globe. There has been growing concern about the potential invasiveness of this species. Portugal grows more E. globulus than any other country (by area). This study investigates poorly understood factors that may influence wilding establishment and spread from Portuguese plantations. We assessed: site-scale factors influencing the presence and abundance of E. globulus wildlings along plantation edges, as well as the size and reproductive state of these wildlings; and the dispersal distances and developmental state of wildlings away from the plantations edge. We found 1630 E. globulus wildlings in 129 survey plots (10x10m) established along the edge of 67 plantations. Half of the surveyed wildlings were taller than 1.3m. The presence and abundance of E. globulus wildlings was mainly influenced by factors such as soil cover, the age of mother-trees and their reproductive output. Around 8% of the surveyed wildlings were reproductive, including wildlings less than 1.3m tall. The proportion of reproductive wildlings was mainly influenced by wildling size, the location relative to the plantation edge and the annual number of frost days. In 49 survey transects outside plantations we found 641 E. globulus wildlings up to a distance of 76m. Establishment distance was associated with natural drainage lines and the dominant wind direction. We discuss the relevance of the results in terms of the potential invasiveness of E. globulus.

AB Fire is a major disturbance factor in many terrestrial ecosystems, leading to landscape transformation in fire-prone areas. Species in mutualistic interactions are often highly sensitive to disturbances like fire events, but the degree and complexity of their responses are unclear. We use bipartite insect-flower interaction networks across a recently burned landscape to explore how plant-pollinator interaction networks respond to a recent major fire event at the landscape level, and where fire refuges were present. We also investigate the effectiveness of these refuges at different elevations (valley to hilltop) for the conservation of displaced flower-visiting insects during fire events. Then, we explore how the degree of specialization of flower-visiting insects changes across habitats with different levels of fire impact. We did this in natural areas in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) biodiversity hotspot, which is species rich in plants and pollinators. Bees and beetles were the most frequent pollinators in interactions, followed by wasps and flies. Highest interaction activity was in the fire refuges and least in burned areas. Interactions also tracked flower abundance, which was highest in fire refuges in the valley and lowest in burned areas. Interactions consisted mostly of specialized flower visitors, especially in refuge areas. The interaction network and species specialization were lowest in burned areas. However, species common to at least two fire classes showed no significant difference in species specialization. We conclude that flower-rich fire refuges sustain plant-pollinator interactions, especially those involving specialized species, in fire-disturbed landscape. This may be an important shelter for specialized pollinator species at the time that the burned landscape goes through regrowth and succession as part of ecosystem recovery process after a major fire event.

AB Conservation biologists often use sophisticated models of population functioning to predict the levels at which harvesting of wild populations will be sustainable. We argue that this approach is not useful for species that, although abundant, are near impossible to survey cost-effectively with enough precision to gather key data to input as model parameters. Our examination of > 7000 Reticulated Pythons (Malayopython reticulates), collected for the commercial skin industry, provides extensive information on life-history traits, population size structure, sex ratio and diets across sites in Kalimantan, Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Our data reveal many interesting divergences between populations from north vs south of the equator (e.g., in body sizes, reproductive frequencies, seasonal timing of reproduction), and a trend for snakes to be smaller from more intensively harvested sites. In combination with earlier analyses, > 10,000 individuals of M. reticulatus have been dissected for information on ecological attributes (more than for any other snake species worldwide). Nonetheless, in the absence of demographic data (e.g., on underlying abundances and rates of survival and growth of free-ranging snakes), the most robust estimate of sustainability of the harvest comes from long-term trends in mean body sizes, life history traits, and offtake rates. Because mathematical models depend upon accurate estimation of abundance and demography, parameters unobtainable for these secretive, well-camouflaged reptiles, managers should prioritise gathering long term data on harvest trends instead.

AB Changes in savanna tree species composition, both within landscapes and across climatic gradients, suggest that species differ in their ability to utilize resources and cope with grass competition. Linking trait variation among species to their relative performance under resource limitation and competition treatments could provide mechanistic understanding of species' turnover across environmental gradients in savannas. We investigated how tree species differ in response to competition from grasses and nutrient supply, and whether these responses can be related to plant traits. As humid savannas are often associated with low fertility, species of humid savannas may grow more efficiently under nutrient suppression than species from semi-arid savannas. In heterogeneous grass swards, fast-growing, resource-wasteful species may be found in low grass biomass patches and slow-growing, conservative species in high biomass patches. We compared seedlings of 40 tree species sampled from humid and semi-arid savannas of three continents (Africa, Australia, South America) with and without grass competition and with high and low nutrient supply. We measured traits related to soil resource capture, light capture, and growth, and tested whether these traits were related to performance under the four treatments. All tree species were suppressed by grass competition and most by nutrient limitation. Only species from humid savannas in Australia grew better under nutrient limitation than their semi-arid counterparts. Deciduous species from semi-arid climates were more negatively impacted by grass competition than deciduous species from humid climates whereas the reverse pattern was observed among evergreen species. Faster growing species were more severely suppressed by grass competition and low nutrients than slower growing species. Traits associated with soil resource capture and seed mass supported growth under grass competition and nutrient limitation, but the traits differed by continent and by leaf habit. Synthesis. We found limited evidence that tree seedlings from humid savannas grow better under nutrient limitation than species of semi-arid savannas. We confirmed that fast-growing species may be advantaged in low grass biomass patches and conservative species in high biomass patches. Traits that improved performance under grass competition differed by continent, which may relate to differences in leaf habit and constraints on seed size.

AB Ecological modeling that includes plant population processes as a critical determinant of vegetation dynamics is useful for sustainable rangeland management. However, we know little about how long-term sheep grazing pressure drives the plant community structure through changes in different native grass species at both individual and population levels. In this study, we hypothesized that plant populations perform differently under different grazing management due to their specified preference by livestock animals. We also tested whether grazing-rest management, aimed at increasing long-term rangeland sustainability, improves the plant growth of forage grass species. We evaluated plant density, individual morphology and plant-size distribution of dominant grass populations in permanent exclosures and open fields under moderate and intensive grazing pressures in Patagonian steppes (South America). We also examined the effects of seasonal grazing-rest managements on the growth and tillering (asexual reproduction) of forage species plants, using temporary mobile exclosures. Grazing intensity changed population density and structure according to species. Compared to permanent exclosures, moderate grazing maintained the plant density of palatable species highly preferred by sheep, reduced the standing-dead biomass proportion of individual plants, and promoted the green biomass of tussocks. Conversely, intensive grazing (double stocking rates) decreased the plant density and individual size of species highly preferred by sheep, and increased the plant density of non-preferred species. Grazing-rest enhanced forage grass species growth and reproduction compared with year-round grazing management, especially during the growing season of a wet year. Our studies support that sheep can be managed to control the plant-size distribution of dominant grass species, their population dynamics, and thereby the overall forage availability at the community level. Both moderate grazing and grazing-rest management can improve the forage availability and preserve the dominant native grasses. We suggest applying a plant population dynamics perspective to facilitate sustainable management of global rangelands.

AB Stand production, a common indicator of site productivity, is often low in flooded wetland forests. However, it remains unclear whether the low production reflects flood stress limiting tree growth, flood disturbance limiting tree density, or both. Here, we investigate how tree growth and stand density vary in baldcypress forests, across gradients of flooding by both fresh and saline waters. We used three investigations to conduct this analysis: (a) a meta-analysis of previously reported tree- and stand-production measurements; (b) an analysis of tree cores from 204 baldcypress trees in 16 sites; and (c) intensive stand surveys and growth measurements across two freshwater flooding gradients in southern Louisiana. The meta-analysis (a) showed that stand production generally varies linearly with stand density, and that detrimental effects of flooding on tree-level growth are only consistently evident in saline systems. The tree-core investigation (b) showed that tree basal area growth was largely a function of tree sapwood area, but basal area growth per sapwood area (i.e. sapwood efficiency, a measure of how efficiently trees grow per growing space occupied) was higher in the more flooded sites of freshwater gradients and lower in the more saline sites of salinity gradients. The intensively studied sites (c) showed that deeper flooding was associated with sparse stands with lower production; however, trees in those sparser sites had higher sapwood efficiency, implying that the benefits of reduced competition were greater than any potential physiological limitations caused by that deeper flooding. Our findings generally show that sparser stands with saline flooding contained poorly growing trees, but sparser stands with freshwater flooding generally did not. These dichotomous effects of freshwater flooding on tree growth versus stand density demonstrate the need to conceptualize production as a dual function of disturbance effects on stand structure and environmental limitations on individual trees, each with potentially different limiting factors.

AB ContextPredicting ecosystem resilience is a challenge, especially as climate change alters disturbance regimes and conditions for recovery. Recent research has highlighted the importance of spatially-explicit disturbance and resilience processes to long-term ecosystem dynamics. Neoecological approaches characterize resilience mechanisms at relatively fine spatio-temporal resolutions, but results are difficult to extrapolate across broad temporal scales or climatic ranges. Paleoecological methodologies can consider the effects of climates that differ from today. However, they are often limited to coarse-grained spatio-temporal resolutions.MethodsIn this synthesis, we describe implicit and explicit examples of studies that incorporate both neo- and paleoecological approaches. We propose ways to build on the strengths of both approaches in an explicit and proactive fashion.ResultsLinking the two approaches is a powerful way to surpass their respective limitations. Aligning spatial scales is critical: Paleoecological sampling design should incorporate knowledge of the spatial characteristics of the disturbance process, and neoecological studies benefit from a longer-term context to their conclusions. In some cases, modeling can incorporate non-spatial data from paleoecological records or emerging spatial paleo-data networks with mechanistic disturbance/recovery processes that operate at fine spatiotemporal scales.ConclusionsLinking these two complementary approaches is a powerful way to build a complete understanding of ecosystem disturbance and resilience.

AB The degradation of soil and vegetation substantially damages ecosystem functions. Litter crusts play an active role in the vegetation restoration and management in desert ecosystems. In this study, the effects of litter crusts on surface microhabitats and species formation on sandy land were studied in the wind-water erosion crisscross region in the Mu Us Desert, northwest China. Soil microhabitat features including moisture, temperature, and organic matter content were measured in different positions of litter crusts and bare sand, seedling species richness, and total seedling number of all species were recorded in litter crusts on the sand's surface. The results showed that there were significant differences between litter crusts and bare sand in terms of soil moisture, temperature, organic matter content, and light intensity. Compared with that of bare sand, soil moisture below litter crusts was increased by an average of 17.0% overall, soil organic matter content was increased by 77.5% at the 0-5 cm depth and by 80.8% at the 5-10 cm depth. Litter crusts decreased soil temperature and light intensity by an average of 16.6% and 31.6%, respectively. Seedling species richness and total seedling number of all species were significantly higher in litter crusts than those in bare sand. Our findings revealed that litter crusts modify the surface microhabitats of sand by maintaining soil moisture, regulating soil temperature, increasing soil nutrients, and reducing light intensity, thus promoting species establishment in the wind-water erosion crisscross region.

AB Rehabilitation of tailing dams poses important challenges because sterile materials and poor or even toxic soils hinder plant development and the regeneration of the pre-mining-activity biota. In this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of rehabilitating a 14-year-old manganese tailing dam by comparing three different regeneration treatments (topsoil application, seedling plantation and spontaneous regeneration) with undisturbed reference sites. We used soil chemical composition, taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and the above-ground tree biomass as indicators of rehabilitation success. In terms of soil chemical composition, we showed that the seedling and natural regeneration treatments were similar to one another but different from the reference sites. Topsoil application presented an intermediate chemical composition between the reference site and the other two treatments. Moreover, the species richness, Shannon diversity index and phylogenetic diversity indicated faster rehabilitation of ecosystem biodiversity with the topsoil treatment, although levels from reference are not yet achieved. We also observed higher basal area and biomass production in the topsoil treatment. However, these patterns were not observed for functional diversity, for which no differences among treatments were observed. We concluded that topsoil application provided the best results; however, we must emphasize that even this approach was not sufficient to rehabilitate the system to the similar level of biodiversity found in the surrounding ecosystem up to the present.

AB Understanding the role of ocean currents in the recruitment of commercially and ecologically important fish is an important step toward developing sustainable resource management guidelines. To this end, we attempt to elucidate the role of surface ocean transport in supplying recruits of European sardine (Sardina pilchardus) to the Gulf of Manfredonia, a known recruitment area in the Adriatic Sea. Sardine early life history stages (ELHSs) were collected during two cruises to provide observational estimates of their age-size relationship and their passive pelagic larval duration (PPLD). We combine these PPLDs with observations of surface ocean currents to test two hypotheses: (1) ELHSs are transported from remote spawning areas (SAs) by ocean currents to the Gulf of Manfredonia; (2) sardines spawn locally and ELHSs are retained by eddies. A historical surface drifter database is used to test hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 is tested by estimating residence times in the Gulf of Manfredonia using surface drifters and virtual particles trajectories that were computed from high-resolution observations of surface currents measured by a high-frequency (HF) radar network. Transport to the Gulf of Manfredonia from remote SAs seems more likely than local spawning and retention given a mismatch between observed PPLDs of 30-50 days and relatively short (<10-day) average residence times. The number and strength of connections between the gulf and remote SAs exhibit a strong dependence on PPLD. For PPLDs of 20 days or less, the gulf is connected to SAs on the western Adriatic coast through transport in the Western Adriatic Current (WAC). SAs on the east coast are more important at longer PPLDs. SAs in the northern and central Adriatic exhibit weak connections at all PPLD ranges considered. These results agree with otolith microstructure analysis, suggesting that the arrival of larvae in the gulf is characterized by repeated pulses from remote SAs. This is the first attempt to describe the processes related to Lagrangian connection to, and retention in, the Gulf of Manfredonia that will be complemented in the future using validated numerical ocean models and biophysical models.

AB Background: Hunting wildlife for medicinal purposes is a widespread practice throughout Brazil; however, studies about the animals used for zootherapeutic practices have been performed almost exclusively with traders (herbalists) and end consumers, and not hunters. This makes it difficult to completely understand the market chain, trade strategies, and drivers of this practice. The present study investigated the species hunted or trapped for traditional medicinal uses by collecting data about the use and trade of the zootheurapeutic species.
   Methods: We collected data through semi-structured questionnaires complemented by free interviews and informal conversations with hunters in five municipalities of semiarid region of the NE Brazil. We calculated the Use-Value (UV) index to determine the relative importance of each species reported by interviewees. The Multiple Linear Regression model was used to assess the influence of socioeconomic factors (age, schooling, residence zone, trade of zootherapeutic species) on species richness exploited by hunters.
   Results: Hunters reported a significant richness of species (n = 39) intentionally or opportunistically captured for use as remedies for treatment of 92 diseases or conditions in humans or livestock. Respondents also reported trade strategies that were well-organized and quickly directed the selling of wild animals or byproducts via modern technology. We found a weak positive relationship only between species richness and hunters' age via MLR model.
   Conclusions: The hunting and use of wild species for medicinal purposes are culturally disseminated activities among hunters. Our results demonstrate the importance of studying hunters in order to understanding the dynamics of bushmeat exploitation and to develop more efficient strategies for wildlife use and conservation.

AB Tree plantations are an important cause of plant invasions worldwide, being a serious concern for biodiversity conservation. Pinus and Eucalyptus are the two most important genera for the forestry industry worldwide, with Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus radiata among the most widespread and invasive. In this study we analyse the establishment of wildlings of these two species in native eucalypt forests (karri and jarrah forests) of SW Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot. We selected boundaries between plantations and adjoining native forests (26 for E. globulus and 25 for P. radiata) and established in each a plot 100 m long (aligned to outer edge of forest) x 100 m or 50 m deep into the native forest (for boundaries with P. radiata and E. globulus plantations, respectively), that was thoroughly searched for wildlings.
   Eucalyptus globulus wildlings were only found in 3 of the 26 boundaries studied, 6 individuals in total, all within first 10 m from the forest edge. Pinus radiata wildlings were found in all boundaries and at all distances inspected. Wildling density was greater in jarrah forest compared to karri forest (mean 70.7 and 24.7 wildlings ha(-1); respectively); it was negatively correlated with understorey cover (r = -0.501, F = 7.72, p = 0.011) and the density of older wildlings (20 + years) was positively correlated with time since plantation establishment (r = 0.512; F = 8.16; P = 0.009).
   Invasion of native eucalypt forests by alien E. globulus does not seem currently of concern in SW Australia. The scheduled short rotations (8-10 years), which means that trees are mostly harvested before reaching their full reproductive potential, lower dispersal ability than P. radiata and the customary establishment of cleared margins around plantations (10 m wide on average) all contribute to reduce the propagule pressure in native forests and with it the invasion potential. Nevertheless, attention should be paid to abandoned plantations left unharvested for longer, which may increase the invasion risks. In contrast, P. radiata plantations do constitute a threat to native vegetation for the invasion capacity of this species, as indicated by the presence of wildlings in all native forests studied, together with the relatively high density of old trees with high reproductive capacity in the forests interior. Awareness about wilding pine spread is urgently needed in SW Australia, in order to minimise the risks.

AB In invertebrate fisheries, sea urchin harvesting continues to grow with dramatic consequences for benthic ecosystems. The identification of areas with a marked natural recruitment and the mechanisms regulating it is crucial for the conservation of benthic communities and for planning the sustainable harvesting. This study evaluates the spatial distribution and density of recruits of the edible sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus along the Sinis + Peninsula (Sardinia) and explores its significant relationships with the local oceanographic features. Our results reveal that recruitment is favoured in areas with slow currents and high levels of confinement and trapping of the water masses. Analysis of the residual circulation indicates that the presence of local standing circulation structures promotes the sea urchin recruitment process. Our findings emphasize the importance of managing local sea urchin harvesting as a system of populations with their demographic influence mainly dependent on the most important ecological driver that is the recruitment.

AB We determined the dietary composition and trophic position (TP) of walleye pollock in the western East Sea (Japan Sea), based on the delta C-13 and delta N-13 values of this species, sympatric dominant fish and invertebrates, and their putative food sources in winter. A broad range of the consumer delta C-13' (lipid-corrected) values reflected clear distinctions between benthic and pelagic feeders, differentiating benthic vs. pelagic trophic pathways. The intermediate delta C-13' and delta N-15 values of pollock fell between those of benthic and pelagic feeders, indicating their trophic links through both pathways. Increases of their isotopic values with increasing body length suggest an ontogenetic change in dominant diets from pelagic to benthic prey as confirmed by stomach content analysis. Their ontogenetic pattern in resource utilization might be associated with deeper migration range with size, increasing TP during ontogeny.

AB The goal of this study was to assess the goodness-of-fit of theoretical models of population dynamics of Aedes aegypti to trap data collected by a long term entomological surveillance program. The carrying capacity K of this vector was estimated at city and neighborhood level. Adult mosquito abundance was measured via adults collected weekly by a network of sticky traps (Mosquitraps) from January 2008 to December 2011 in Vitoria, Espirito Santo, Brazil. K was the only free parameter estimated by the model. At the city level, the model with temperature as a driver captured the seasonal pattern of mosquito abundance. At the local level, we observed a spatial heterogeneity in the estimated carrying capacity between neighborhoods, weakly associated with environmental variables related to poor infrastructure. Model goodness-of-fit was influenced by the number of sticky traps, and suggests a minimum of 16 traps at the neighborhood level for surveillance.

AB 1. Understanding how bottom-up and top-down forces affect resource selection can inform restoration efforts. With a global population size of < 500 individuals, the hirola Beatragus hunteri is the world's most endangered antelope, with a declining population since the 1970s. While the underlying mechanisms are unclear, some combination of habitat loss and predation are thought to be responsible for low abundances of contemporary populations.
   2. Efforts to conserve hirola are hindered by a lack of understanding as to why population density remains low, despite eradication of the viral disease, rinderpest. To elucidate factors underlying chronically low numbers, we examined resource selection and landscape change within the hirola's native range. Because hirola are grazers, we hypothesized that the availability of open areas would be linked both to forage and safety from predators. We quantified: (i) changes in tree cover across the hirola's historical range in eastern Kenya over the past 27 years; (ii) how tree cover has influenced resource selection by hirola; and (iii) interactions between tree cover and predation.
   3. Between 1985 and 2012, tree cover increased by 251% across the historical range of hirola. Tree encroachment was associated with a 98% decline of hirola and elephant Loxodonta africana populations, a 74% decline in cattle Bos indicus, an increase in browsing livestock by 327%, and a reduction in rainfall.
   4. Although hirola avoided tree cover, we found no evidence that predation on hirola increased with increasing tree cover.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Hirola may qualify as a refugee species, in which contemporary populations are restricted to suboptimal habitat and exhibit low survival, reproduction or both. The extinction of hirola would be the first of a mammalian genus on the African continent in modern history. We conclude that contemporary low numbers of hirola are due at least partly to habitat loss via tree encroachment, triggered by some combination of elephant extirpation, overgrazing, drought and perhaps fire suppression. We recommend a combination of rangeland restoration efforts (including conservation of elephants, manual clearing of trees, and grass seeding), increased enforcement of an existing protected area (Arawale National Reserve), and reintroductions to enhance recovery for this endangered species. These efforts will rely on enhanced support from the international conservation community and the cooperation of pastoralist communities with which the hirola coexist.

TI Potential connectivity among American lobster fisheries as a result of
   larval drift across the species' range in eastern North America

DT Article

AB We used a biophysical model to estimate for the first time the effect of larval drift on potential connectivity among American lobster (Homarus americanus) fisheries management areas over the geographic range of the species. The model predicted drift of larvae over distances of 50-805 km (mean = 129 km), which connected many management areas and caused marked spatial heterogeneity in retention and self-seeding versus export and import of larvae by different fisheries areas. Including mortality functions in the model resulted in less drift and settlement and had complex effects on the amount, but not the incidence, of potential connectivity among fisheries. The model's predictions received support from comparison of predicted settlement to landings 6 or 7 years later in some, but not all, parts of the model domain. Although improvements are still needed to capture larval behaviours and spatial variability in larval release and mortality across the species' range, this information is important to lobster fisheries management because the amount and direction of connectivity among fisheries can inform cooperative management strategies to sustain interconnected fisheries.

AB Critical transition, a phenomenon that a system shifts suddenly from one state to another, occurs in many real-world complex networks. We propose an analytical framework for exactly predicting the critical transition in a complex networked system subjected to noise effects. Our prediction is based on the characteristic return time of a simple one-dimensional system derived from the original higher-dimensional system. This characteristic time, which can be easily calculated using network data, allows us to systematically separate the respective roles of dynamics, noise and topology of the underlying networked system. We find that the noise can either prevent or enhance critical transitions, playing a key role in compensating the network structural defect which suffers from either internal failures or environmental changes, or both. Our analysis of realistic or artificial examples reveals that the characteristic return time is an effective indicator for forecasting the sudden deterioration of complex networks.

AB Background. The range, population size and trend of large carnivores are important parameters to assess their status globally and to plan conservation strategies. One can use linear models to assess population size and trends of large carnivores from track based surveys on suitable substrates. The conventional approach of a linear model with intercept may not intercept at zero, but may fit the data better than linear model through the origin. We assess whether a linear regression through the origin is more appropriate than a linear regression with intercept to model large African carnivore densities and track indices.
   Methods. We did simple linear regression with intercept analysis and simple linear regression through the origin and used the confidence interval for 8 in the linear model y = alpha x + beta, Standard Error of Estimate, Mean Squares Residual and Akaike Information Criteria to evaluate the models.
   Results. The Lion on Clay and Low Density on Sand models with intercept were not significant (P > 0.05). The other four models with intercept and the six models thorough origin were all significant (P < 0.05). The models using linear regression with intercept all included zero in the confidence interval for 6 and the null hypothesis that beta = 0 could not be rejected, All models showed that the linear model through the origin provided a better fit than the linear model with intercept, as indicated by the Standard Error of Estimate and Mean Square Residuals, Akaike Information Criteria showed that linear models through the origin were better and that none of the linear models with intercept had substantial support,
   Discussion. Our results showed that linear regression through the origin is justified over the more typical linear regression with intercept for all models we tested, A general model can be used to estimate large carnivore densities from track densities across species and study areas. The formula observed track density = 3.26 x carnivore density can be used to estimate densities of large African carnivores using track counts on sandy substrates in areas where carnivore densities are 0.27 carnivores/100 km(2) or higher. To improve the current models, we need independent data to validate the models and data to test for non-linear relationship between track indices and true density at low densities.

AB Seabirds and coral reefs are two of the most threatened marine communities on earth, and they co-occur on many tropical islands and subtropical islands and atolls. Seabirds concentrate marine-derived nutrients on breeding islands in the form of feces (guano), and these nutrients dramatically alter terrestrial ecosystem ecology. Recent work in the remote Pacific indicates seabird-derived nutrients may also subsidize nearshore coral reefs, but the consequences of guano on complex, anthropogenically modified coral reefs are unknown. The impact of seabird guano on nearshore coral reefs around Moku Nui, an islet with a large seabird colony in Oahu, Hawaii, was investigated in comparison with coral reefs around three islets with lower seabird abundance. Reefs in close proximity to Moku Nui (where thousands of wedge-tailed shearwaters, Puffinus pacificus, breed) had greater concentrations of dissolved phosphate in seawater and greater delta N-15 in adjacent subtidal macroalgae relative to reefs next to smaller breeding colonies. However, dissolved nitrate was not different among islets. These results indicate that seabirds may be a source of nutrients for the waters surrounding Moku Nui that are already inundated with local and global stressors.

AB The principal aim of this study was to establish biogeographical patterns in the legume flora of southern Africa so as to facilitate the selection of species with agricultural potential. Plant collection data from the National Herbarium, South Africa, were analysed to establish the diversity and areas covered by legumes (Leguminosae/Fabaceae) indigenous to South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. A total of 27,322 records from 1,619 quarter degree grid cells, representing 1,580 species, 122 genera and 24 tribes were included in the analyses. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was applied to the presence or absence of legume species in quarter degree grid cells, the resultant natural biogeographical regions (choria) being referred to as leguminochoria. The description of the 16 uniquely formed leguminochoria focuses on defining the associated bioregions and biomes, as well as on the key climate and soil properties. Legume species with a high occurrence in a leguminochorion are listed as key species. The dominant growth form of key species, species richness and range within each leguminochorion is discussed. Floristic links between the leguminochoria are established, by examining and comparing key species common to clusters, using a vegetation classification program. Soil pH and mean annual minimum temperature were found to be the main drivers for distinguishing among legume assemblages. This is the first time that distribution data for legumes has been used to identify biogeographical areas covered by leguminochoria on the subcontinent. One potential application of the results of this study is to assist in the selection of legumes for pasture breeding and soil conservation programs, especially in arid and semi-arid environments.

AB This study set out to test three hypotheses explaining the existence of closed canopied versus open ecosystems in the same landscape and on the same parent rocks. Our data lent no support to the first hypothesis that forests are ancient and grasslands are anthropogenically derived through deforestation. Carbon isotope data suggests the opposite; both open and closed vegetation had C-4 isotope signals in deeper soils, indicating that grasslands are the ancient system. The second hypothesis is that closed forests require nutrient rich soils and are replaced by open vegetation on nutrient poor soils. Despite open vegetation frequently having lower nutrient concentrations than closed vegetation in our study area, nutrient stocks to 1 m far exceeded threshold requirements to build a forest at all our sites. We suggest that vegetation patterns in our study area are a result of a third hypothesis, that forests and savannas are alternative stable states each subject to different ecological processes with positive feedbacks maintaining each state. Fire in open grassy vegetation is a key disturbance maintaining the boundaries between the two states. Frequent fires may deplete nutrients in the surface layers of the soil, thereby slowing tree growth and further maintaining the open state of the vegetation. However, our data on the vertical distribution of nutrients show strikingly similar nutrient patterns in the alternative biome states, with high nutrient concentrations in the open sites, suggesting that nutrient limitation is not an important feedback helping to maintain open ecosystems in our study area. Our results suggest that, rather than being drivers of vegetation patterns in our study area, soil nutrients are responding to dynamic vegetation changes caused by other factors. (C) 2015 SAAB.

AB Understanding how spatial and temporal heterogeneity influence ecological processes forms a central challenge in ecology. Individual responses to heterogeneity shape population dynamics, therefore understanding these responses is central to sustainable population management. Emerging evidence has shown that herbivores track heterogeneity in nutritional quality of vegetation by responding to phenological differences in plants. We quantified the benefits mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) accrue from accessing habitats with asynchronous plant phenology in northwest Colorado over 3 years. Our analysis examined both the direct physiological and indirect environmental effects of weather and vegetation phenology on mule deer winter body condition. We identified several important effects of annual weather patterns and topographical variables on vegetation phenology in the home ranges of mule deer. Crucially, temporal patterns of vegetation phenology were linked with differences in body condition, with deer tending to show poorer body condition in areas with less asynchronous vegetation green-up and later vegetation onset. The direct physiological effect of previous winter precipitation on mule deer body condition was much less important than the indirect effect mediated by vegetation phenology. Additionally, the influence of vegetation phenology on body fat was much stronger than that of overall vegetation productivity. In summary, changing annual weather patterns, particularly in relation to seasonal precipitation, have the potential to alter body condition of this important ungulate species during the critical winter period. This finding highlights the importance of maintaining large contiguous areas of spatially and temporally variable resources to allow animals to compensate behaviourally for changing climate-driven resource patterns.

AB Prey availability and human-carnivore conflict are strong determinants that govern the spatial distribution and abundance of large carnivore species and determine the suitability of areas for their conservation. For wide-ranging large carnivores such as cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), additional conservation areas beyond protected area boundaries are crucial to effectively conserve them both inside and outside protected areas. Although cheetahs prefer preying on wild prey, they also cause conflict with people by predating on especially small livestock. We investigated whether the distribution of cheetahs' preferred prey and small livestock biomass could be used to explore the potential suitability of agricultural areas in Botswana for the long-term persistence of its cheetah population. We found it gave a good point of departure for identifying priority areas for land management, the threat to connectivity between cheetah populations, and areas where the reduction and mitigation of human-cheetah conflict is critical. Our analysis showed the existence of a wide prey base for cheetahs across large parts of Botswana's agricultural areas, which provide additional large areas with high conservation potential. Twenty percent of wild prey biomass appears to be the critical point to distinguish between high and low probable levels of human-cheetah conflict. We identified focal areas in the agricultural zones where restoring wild prey numbers in concurrence with effective human-cheetah conflict mitigation efforts are the most immediate conservation strategies needed to maintain Botswana's still large and contiguous cheetah population.

AB The acquisition and maintenance of symbiont-host associations is considered an important prerequisite for the successful colonisation of land by animals because symbionts allowed the hosts to dwell on low-quality food sources. Digestive tract symbionts are suggested to either enhance digestive efficiency of cellulose or supply the host with nutrients otherwise limited in the food. Terrestrial isopods are the most successful land colonisers among the Crustacea, and although symbiotic bacteria have been identified in digestive tract, the mechanism of transmission and the nutritional role of the symbionts are at present poorly understood.
   We used a novel in vitro approach to isolate and culture juveniles of Porcellio scaber at a time when only the vertical mode of symbiont acquisition could have occurred, which allowed us to follow juvenile growth and to simulate alternative modes of symbiont acquisition through feeding manipulations. Thus, we experimentally obtained groups of juveniles that could have acquired symbionts only through vertical transfer (mother-offspring), or additionally, through horizontal (through faeces or contact with conspecifics) and environmental (through leaves) transfer. We quantified survival and growth rates over two months for the different experimental acquisition modes, and significantly different growth rates were observed (p < 0.001). Growth of juveniles suggests that first, symbiont inoculation is mediated through horizontal and environmental transfer and second, the symbionts may in fact serve as a source for fatty acids and vitamins. The growth rates further question that vertical transfer occurs in woodlice. Although survival did not differ significantly between different acquisition modes (p = 0.051), juveniles supplemented with potential sources of symbionts showed a tendency towards increased survival. The successful invasion of land may thus have been facilitated through the uptake of symbionts from the surroundings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Extensive livestock grazing is one of the most common and widespread forms of land uses in sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Studies assessing the effects of extensive livestock grazing on vegetation and soils in SSA are inconsistent in the direction and magnitude of study outcomes. We applied meta-analysis to identify whether studies so far conducted in the rangeland systems of SSA have detected significant rangeland degradation as approximated by changes in vegetation attributes (reduction in species diversity and richness; decreased biomass and ground cover; increased woody species density and canopy cover) and soil properties (Decreased soil OC, N and P). We quantified results of the included studies using the response ratio, which is the log proportional change in the means of a treatment and a control group. Four moderator variables (elevation (<1500 and >= 1500 m above sea level); plant life form (herbaceous and woody), rainfall amount (<600 mm and >= 600 mm), rainfall modality (mono and bimodal), and soil texture (Loam, sandy, sandy loam)) appeared to affect the response of species diversity and richness patterns to different grazing regimes, i.e., communal grazing systems, exclosures, livestock ranches and game reserves. Species diversity and richness values were generally lower in the communal grazing systems compared to the other grazing regimes. Only three moderator variables (rainfall amount and modality, and soil texture) affected the herbaceous basal cover response. Differences in soil OC were highest between communal and exclosure areas, visible at high elevations and under high rainfall. Soil N was influenced by rainfall modality and soil texture. We conclude that the effects of grazing regimes onto the environment cannot be generalized but are specific across vegetation and soil variables and differ considerably with rainfall and elevation.

AB Questions(1) Do woody species flourish and fructify according to environmental seasonality? (2) Is there a positive correlation with dry/rainy season? (3) Are the flowering and fruiting of woody species positively correlated with rainfall, temperature and photoperiod? (4) Do anemochorous, autochorous and zoochorous species fructify according to environmental seasonality, i.e. dry or rainy season?
   LocationThorn forest, southern Midwest Brazil.
   MethodsQualitative data collection included the presence or absence of flowers and/or fruits of each species, independently of the development phase of their reproductive organs. A Rayleigh test was used to determine if flowering and fructification were seasonal throughout the year and to detect possible significant seasonal patterns. Spearman's rank correlation and Bonferroni correction were used to determine possible correlations between phenological events and rainfall, temperature and photoperiod.
   ResultsFlowering and fruiting of the woody community showed a low degree of seasonality. No significant correlations were found between flowering and fructification and the climatic variables studied: temperature, photoperiod and rainfall. Approximately 60% of the zoochorous species bore fruit during the rainy season, but with a low degree of seasonality. The fruiting of anemochorous species presented two opposite points of higher frequency, corresponding to the transition period between rainfall and drought and the rainy season. No seasonality was found. Autochorous species showed no pattern of seasonal fruiting.
   ConclusionsThe data on flowering and fruiting in the community studied are unexpected and contrast with studies performed in seasonal environments. Seed dispersal syndromes showed no significant seasonal events. These results differ from those usually found in markedly seasonal environments. The Brazilian Chaco can be considered an arid environment in which abiotic syndromes prevail in a manner similar to that seen in tropical dry forests.

AB Herbivory by both grazing and browsing ungulates shapes the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, and both types of herbivory have been implicated in major ecosystem state changes. Despite the ecological consequences of differences in diets and feeding habits among herbivores, studies that experimentally distinguish effects of grazing from spatially co-occurring, but temporally segregated browsing are extremely rare. Here we use a set of long-term exclosures in northern Utah, USA, to determine how domestic grazers vs. wild ungulate herbivores (including browsers and mixed feeders) affect sagebrush-dominated plant communities that historically covered similar to 62 million ha in North America. We sampled plant community properties and found that after 22 years grazing and browsing elicited perceptible changes in overall plant community composition and distinct responses by individual plant species. In the woody layer of the plant community, release from winter and spring wild ungulate herbivory increased densities of larger Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata, ssp. wyomingensis) at the expense of small sagebrush, while disturbance associated with either cattle or wild ungulate activity alone was sufficient to increase bare ground and reduce cover of biological soil crusts. The perennial bunchgrass, bottlebrush squirretail (Elymus elymoides), responded positively to release from summer cattle grazing, and in turn appeared to competitively suppress another more grazing tolerant perennial grass, Sandberg's blue grass (Poa secunda). Grazing by domestic cattle also was associated with increased non-native species biomass. Together, these results illustrate that ungulate herbivory has not caused sagebrush plant communities to undergo dramatic state shifts; however clear, herbivore-driven shifts are evident. In a dry, perennial- dominated system where plant community changes can occur very slowly, our results provide insights into potential long-term trajectories of these plant communities under different large herbivore regimes. Our results can be used to guide long-term management strategies for sagebrush systems and improve habitat for endemic wildlife species such as sage-grouse (Centrocercus spp.).

AB Vegetation in and around freshwater ecosystems can affect aquatic organisms through the production of secondary compounds, which are retained in leaves after senescence and are biologically active. Tannins can be toxic to tadpoles, but the plant source of tannins and tannin concentration have been confounded in experimental designs in previous studies. To examine the effects of the concentration and source of tannins (tree species), we examined the effects of 4 factors on tadpole survival, growth, and development: tannin source (red oak [Quercus rubra], white oak [Quercus alba], or sugar maple [Acer saccharum]); tannin concentration (including a control); diet protein level; and tadpole species (American toad [Anaxyrus americanus] and spring peepers [Pseudacris crucifer]). Tannin source and concentration affected spring peeper survival, but American toads had uniformly high survival. Spring peepers had a lower survival rate in high tannin concentrations of oak leachate but a high survival rate in both concentrations of sugar maple leachate. These differences in survival did not correspond with changes in dissolved oxygen, and no effect of dietary protein level on tadpole performance was observed. The presence of plant leachate resulted in increased tadpole growth in both species, but the mechanism for this finding is unclear. The results of the present study show that tannin concentration and source are important factors for tadpole performance, adding further evidence that plant chemistry can affect aquatic organisms.

AB Urban mangrove systems are increasingly common in SE Asia but little is known about the potential changes in pollinator ecology in highly urbanized and fragmented landscapes. We detected pollen limitation across four Bruguiera gymnorrhiza populations in Singapore with a pollen limitation index (compromised seed production due to insufficient pollen receipt) ranging from 0.633 to 0.878. Trees in larger patches had higher pollinator visitation rates than in smaller patches, and lower pollinator visitation rates resulted in reduced fruit sets. These results suggest a cascading link between habitat patch size, pollinator visitation rate, and reproductive outcomes in B. gymnorrhiza. Mating system analysis indicated that B. gymnorrhiza may have an internal mechanism acting against inbreeding depression, leading to reduced fruit set under circumstances of reduced pollinator visitation. Our results underscore the importance of pollinator service in mangroves and highlight the need for an in-depth understanding of changing plant-pollinator relationships in urban mangroves systems.

AB The dispersal stages of organisms with sessile adults must be able to select habitats with suitable environmental conditions for establishment and survival, and also must be able to reach those locations. For marine planktonic larvae, movement due to currents is often orders of magnitude greater than movement due to swimming behaviour. Current patterns are determined by interactions between underlying geography and tidal forces, modified by meteorological conditions. These linkages impose an area-specific focus to connectivity studies. Yet, how geographical features and meteorological forcing combine to produce specific current patterns and resultant connectivity among populations remains unclear. In this study of a complex fjordic region (the Firth of Lorn, Scotland), we followed tracks of generic particles driven by modelled hydrodynamic currents to investigate how connectivity between evenly spaced habitat sites varies in relation to coastal topography. We studied a range of larval durations (1-28 d), and two different but typical meteorological forcing scenarios. Particles released from regions of high current velocity, open coastline and low local habitat availability travelled furthest but were less likely to disperse successfully to other coastal sites. Extensive natal habitat in the vicinity of a site generally had a positive impact on the number of arriving particles, as did low current velocities. However, relationships between numbers of arriving particles and local geographical indices were complex, particularly at longer larval durations. Local geography alone explained up to 50% of the variance in success of particles released and closer to 10% of the variation in the number of particles arriving at each site. General patterns are evident, but coastline properties fall short of predicting dispersal measures for particular locations. The study shows that meteorological variation and broad scale current patterns interact strongly with local geography to determine connectivity in coastal areas.

TI Demographic Processes Drive Increases in Wildlife Disease following

AB Population reduction is often used as a control strategy when managing infectious diseases in wildlife populations in order to reduce host density below a critical threshold. However, population reduction can disrupt existing social and demographic structures leading to changes in observed host behaviour that may result in enhanced disease transmission. Such effects have been observed in several disease systems, notably badgers and bovine tuberculosis. Here we characterise the fundamental properties of disease systems for which such effects undermine the disease control benefits of population reduction. By quantifying the size of response to population reduction in terms of enhanced transmission within a generic non-spatial model, the properties of disease systems in which such effects reduce or even reverse the disease control benefits of population reduction are identified. If population reduction is not sufficiently severe, then enhanced transmission can lead to the counter intuitive perturbation effect, whereby disease levels increase or persist where they would otherwise die out. Perturbation effects are largest for systems with low levels of disease, e. g. low levels of endemicity or emerging disease. Analysis of a stochastic spatial meta-population model of demography and disease dynamics leads to qualitatively similar conclusions. Moreover, enhanced transmission itself is found to arise as an emergent property of density dependent dispersal in such systems. This spatial analysis also shows that, below some threshold, population reduction can rapidly increase the area affected by disease, potentially expanding risks to sympatric species. Our results suggest that the impact of population reduction on social and demographic structures is likely to undermine disease control in many systems, and in severe cases leads to the perturbation effect. Social and demographic mechanisms that enhance transmission following population reduction should therefore be routinely considered when designing control programmes.

AB In this study, historical data available since 1954 were used to get new insight to ontogenetic and spatiotemporal variability in Peruvian anchovy or anchoveta Engraulis ringens diet. Whatever the period, E. ringens foraged mainly on macrozooplankton and the importance of euphausiids in E. ringens diet appears directly related to euphausiids abundance. This bottom-up effect is also observed at smaller scale because the euphausiids fraction increased with E. ringens total length and euphausiids accessibility. Selecting the largest prey, the euphausiids, provides an energetic advantage for E. ringens in its ecosystem where oxygen depletion imposes strong metabolic constraints on pelagic fishes. This study illustrates the plasticity of E. ringens that allows it to cope with its highly variable environment. (C) 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB We analyse the diet and prey selection of puma Puma concolor and describe opportunistically the diet of jaguar Panthera onca in montane forest in the Sierra Nanchititla Natural Park, central Mexico. We analysed prey selection in relation to energy content and population abundance, inferred through camera trapping. Analysis of 209 puma scats showed that their main prey was nine-banded armadillo Dasypus novemcinctus followed by white-nosed coati Nasua narica and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. Pumas did not take prey in proportion to their relative abundance, but selected energetically profitable prey such as nine-banded armadillo, which formed the bulk of their diet. In 13 scats of jaguar, nine-banded armadillo was also the most important prey followed by domestic goat Capra hircus. We discuss the implications for management of predators and prey.

AB The genetic structure of present-day populations has been highly affected by glacial periods and physical oceanographic forcing, particularly with respect to species distributions and population gene-flow patterns. We assessed the current genetic composition of the Jasus frontalis population in the southeastern Pacific Islands off the coast of Chile to evaluate their connectivity modulated by contemporary and historic oceanographic processes. Population structure and demographical history for this species were assessed based on classic and Bayesian approaches using 84 sequences of cytochrome oxidase subunit I. In addition, we estimated the time of origin of J. frontalis in the different geographic zones. The analyses show a panmictic population with high gene flow between subcomponents and a lack of genetic structure (F-ST < 0.008). This high gene flow is mainly modulated by mesoscale oceanographic factors such as eddies and meanders. In a historical spatial context, the most probable common ancestor of J. frontalis could have colonized the region around 0.258 million years before present (MYBP), first becoming established in the Juan Fernndez Archipelago and then expanding toward the Desventuradas Islands. The demographic history shows a consistent increase in the effective population size (N-e) starting approximately 0.130 MYBP, which is highly correlated with sea-level changes during the last glacial maximum.

AB Grazing intensification and abandonment are increasing the risk of degradation of Mediterranean grasslands. The development of techniques for monitoring grazing effects on herbaceous vegetation is an essential need for the management of these rangelands. However, the high variability of these systems make physiographical and management effects hard to disentangle and quantify. We present a methodology to support rangeland management and assess grazing effects on environmentally heterogeneous areas, and provide an example of its application in a Mediterranean rangeland in central Spain. We evaluated the difference in photosynthetically active vegetation cover between spring and summer using Spectral Mixture Analysis of very high spatial resolution (2.4 m) Quickbird images. To analyze this difference, we developed Boosted Regression Trees models using grazing management (accumulated cost distance to points of livestock concentration and water points) and physiographical variables (slope, wetness, proximity to the closest tree and orientation). Results show that the main factor determining changes in vegetation cover is habitat type. The magnitude of this change was maximized at intermediate grazing pressures for humid habitats, suggesting the existence of an optimal level of grazing in this zones, while in dry habitats differences in vegetation cover increased consistently along with grazing pressure. Our models provided a valuable insight into how different variables and its interactions affect the observed recovery capacity of vegetation. Moreover, by identifying areas in which grazing-induced land degradation could be taken place, our methodology can be used as a powerful tool in the management of highly heterogeneous rangelands.

AB Predicting the spatial and temporal patterns of marine larval dispersal and supply is a challenging task, requiring the use of novel approaches capable of capturing the inherent variability in the mechanisms involved. Biophysical models are emerging as important tools used to understand dispersal and recruitment of marine larvae on several scales, and are used here to investigate these problems in the Northeast Atlantic Iberian Upwelling system. We used a Regional Ocean Modelling System configuration coupled with an individual-based model in order to simulate diel vertical migration and estuary-reinvasion behaviours, growth and mortality of larvae of the common shore crab Carcinus maenas. With this simulation we aimed to hindcast coast-wide connectivity patterns under the atmospheric and river flow forcings of the years 2001 to 2009. In a previous study, this model had been shown to produce time series of larval supply to a single population, at daily frequencies, that were strongly correlated with observed time series. In the current application, the model predicts that along-shore advection of larvae is variable from year to year; is correlated with the annual North Atlantic Oscillation index, which reflects the strength and persistence of equatorward winds; and is usually asymmetric, with a predominant equatorward transport. The model also predicts a source-sink cell located between the Muros-Noia and Mondego estuaries, where populations in the north consistently act as net sources of larvae supplying net sink populations to the south. This source-sink cell appears to be related to the existence of habitat gaps, coast geometry and an oceanographic retention effect associated with upwelling dynamics.

   POPULATIONS; EXTINCTION
AB Context In metapopulations, colonisation is the result of dispersal from neighbouring occupied patches, typically juveniles dispersing from natal to breeding sites. When occupancy dynamics are dispersal driven, occupancy should refer to the presence of established, breeding populations. The detection of transient individuals at sites that are, by definition, unoccupied (i.e. false positive detections), may result in misleading conclusions about metapopulation dynamics. Until recently, the issue of false positives has been considered negligible and current efforts to account for such error have been restricted to the context of species misidentification. However, the detection of transient individuals visiting multiple sites while dispersing is a distinct source of false positives that can bias estimates of occupancy because visited sites do not contribute to metapopulation dynamics in the same way as do sites occupied by established, reproducing populations. Although transient-induced false positive error presents a challenge to occupancy studies aiming to account for all sources of detection error and estimate occupancy without bias, accounting for it has received little attention.
   Aims Using a novel application of an existing occupancy model, we sought to account for false positives that result from transient individuals being observed at truly unoccupied sites (i.e. where no establishment has occurred).
   Methods We applied a Bayesian multi-season occupancy model correcting for false negative and false positive errors, to 3 years of detection or non-detection data from a metapopulation of water voles, Arvicola amphibious, in which both types of patch-state misclassification are suspected.
   Key results We provide evidence that transient individuals can cause false positive detection errors. We then demonstrate the flexibility of the occupancy model to account for both false negative and false positive detection errors beyond the typical application to species misidentification. Accounting for both types of observation error reduces the bias in estimates of occupancy and avoids misleading conclusions about the status of (meta) populations by allowing for the distinction to be made between resident and transient occupancy.
   Conclusion In many species, transience may result in patch-state misclassification which needs to be accounted for so as to draw correct inference about metapopulation status. Making the distinction between occupancy by established populations and visitation by transients will influence how we interpret patch occupancy dynamics, with important implications for the management of wildlife.
   Implications The ability to estimate occupancy free of bias induced by false positive detections can help ensure that downward trends in occupancy are detected despite such declines being accompanied by increasing frequency of transients associated with, for example, reductions in mate availability or failure to establish. Our approach can be applied to any occupancy study in which false positive detections are suspected because of the behaviour of the focal species.

AB As the interest in plantations of fast-growing tree species increases, concerns regarding the possibility of gene flow between plantations of exotic trees and their wild relatives are being raised. In Canada, the Prairie ecozone provides a unique opportunity to examine spontaneous hybridization and the spread of exotic genetic material because of the historical introduction of large numbers of exotic poplar species and their hybrids. In this region, poplar shelterbelts bearing exotic components such as Populus laurifolia Ledeb. and Populus nigra L have been in contact with the native populations of Populus balsamifera L since the 19th century. Given the ability for poplar species to hybridize, the objective of this study was to estimate the rates of spontaneous hybridization between one common poplar cultivar planted in shelterbelts, male'Assiniboine' (female'Walker' [female Populus deltoides Marsh. x male(P. laurifolia x P. nigra)] x male P. deltoides), and its neighbouring native congener, female P. balsamilera, on two study sites. To distinguish the genetic contributions of the species under study, a set of 26 diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) representative of 23 genes was used. We genotyped 2116 seeds sampled from P. balsamifera and identified paternal alleles specific to P. laurifolia, P. nigra and P. deltoides, which are typical genetic components of poplar shelterbelts. Surprisingly, the highest hybridization rate (2.3%) was observed at the site where 100-year-old Russian poplar shelterbelts (P. laurifolia x P. nigra) were found. A preliminary study of the P. balsamifera stands established in an 8 km radius around the study site confirmed introgression of P. laurifolia and P. nigra alleles at a rate of 4.6%. These results indicate that spontaneous hybridization between shelterbelts of exotic cultivars and native P. balsamifera does occur in the Canadian Prairies and that interspecific hybrids can establish and survive in this landscape. This study suggests that biological factors such as the genetic composition of the native population and the gender of the exotic cultivars should be taken into consideration in the management strategies of this ecozone.

AB Classifying species into functional groups is a way to understand the functioning of species-rich ecosystems, or to model the dynamics of such ecosystems. Many statistical techniques have been defined to classify species into groups, and a question is whether different techniques bring consistent classifications. In a tropical rain forest in French Guiana, five species classifications have been defined by different authors for the purpose of forest growth modelling but using different data sets and different statistical techniques. The correspondence between the five classifications was measured using four indices that are generalizations of existing indices to compare two classifications. A multiple correspondence analysis was used to identify associations between groups of different classifications. In a second step, two-table multivariate analyses were used to characterize the relationships between species classifications and eight species traits (consisting of seven populational traits and one functional trait). We evidenced a consensus on the potential size of trees: species were similarly clustered by the five classifications along this trait that is correlated to turnover rate. More surprisingly, no consensus was found for growth rate, nor wood density, traits that are correlated with light requirement. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce a mathematical model of symbiosis between different species by taking into account the influence of each species on the carrying capacities of the others. The modeled entities can pertain to biological and ecological societies or to social, economic and financial societies. Our model includes three basic types: symbiosis with direct mutual interactions, symbiosis with asymmetric interactions, and symbiosis without direct interactions. In all cases, we provide a complete classification of all admissible dynamical regimes. The proposed model of symbiosis turned out to be very rich, as it exhibits four qualitatively different regimes: convergence to stationary states, unbounded exponential growth, finite-time singularity, and finite-time death or extinction of species.

AB This study examined monthly feeding rates and grazing impact on phytoplankton biomass, as well as diel feeding rhythms of four key copepod species in a tidally well mixed estuary (Asan Bay, Korean Peninsula). Monthly ingestion rates estimated based on gut pigment analysis were closely associated with their peak densities, but not with phytoplankton biomass, implying high ingestion may be related to reproductive output for population growth. The three smaller copepods, Acartia hongi, Acartia pacifica and Paracalanus parvus, showed feeding preference for smaller phytoplankton (<20 mu m) with higher clearance rates, whereas the larger Calanus sinicus preferred larger phytoplankton. Acartia pacifica and P. parvus showed distinct increased nocturnal feeding rates as measured with gut fluorescence, whereas A. hongi showed no significant day-night differences. Copepod diel feeding patterns were not associated with food quantity, and endogenous physiological rhythm might be hypothesized as responsible for the observed diel feeding patterns. Grazing impact on phytoplankton biomass by the four copepods in the estuary was on average 8% (range 0.2-29.8%) of the phytoplankton standing stock, similar to values reported in other coastal waters. Very high copepod abundances but low daily carbon ration (<20% for all copepods) provided by feeding on phytoplankton indicate that copepods also grazed on other non-phytoplankton foods in Asan Bay.

AB From seawater and the intestines of benthonic organisms collected from the Beagle Channel, Argentina, 230 marine bacteria were isolated. Cultivable bacteria were characterized and classified as psychrotolerant, whereas few isolates were psychrophiles. These isolates were capable of producing proteases at 4 and 15 degrees C under neutral (pH 7.0), alkaline (pH 10.0) and acidic (pH 4.5) conditions on different media, revealing 62, 33 and 22% producers at cold and 84, 47 and 33% producers at low temperatures, respectively. More protease-producing strains (67%) were detected when isolated from benthic invertebrates as compared to seawater (33%), with protease production under neutral conditions resulting in milk protein hydrolysis halos between 27 and 30 +/- 2 mm in diameter. Using sterile 0.22 mu m membrane filters, 29 isolates exhibiting extracellular protease activity were detected. These were grouped into six operational taxonomic units by restriction analysis and identified based on 16S rDNA as ?-proteobacteria of the genera Pseudoalteromonas, Pseudomonas, Shewanella, Alteromonas, Aeromonas, and Serratia. Plasmids were found to be harbored by eight strains, mainly within the isolates from benthonic organisms. ((c) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)

AB Invasive ant species have general diet and nest requirements, which facilitate their establishment in novel habitats and their dominance over many native ants. The Asian needle ant, Pachycondyla chinensis, native throughout Australasia was introduced to the southeastern US where it has become established in woodland habitats, nests in close proximity to and consumes subterranean termites (Rhinotermitidae). P. chinensis do not occur in habitats lacking Rhinotermitidae. We suggest that subterranean termites are critical for P. chinensis success in new habitats. We demonstrate that P. chinensis is a general termite feeder, retrieving Reticulitermes virginicus five times more often than other potential prey near P. chinensis colonies. Odors produced by R. virginicus workers, as well as other potential prey, attract P. chinensis. Furthermore, P. chinensis occupy R. virginicus nests in the lab and field and display behaviors that facilitate capture of R. virginicus workers and soldiers. Termites are an abundant, high quality, renewable food supply, in many ways similar to the hemipteran honeydew exploited by most other invasive ant species. We conclude that the behavior of P. chinensis in the presence of termites increases their competitive abilities in natural areas where they have been introduced.

AB Interspecific competition has been shown to play a role in the structure of ant communities. However, the role of foraging behavior and the type of competition that results from this behavior has been less investigated. Here we present results from baiting experiments at various scales to determine the degree of exploitative and interference competition between two Neotropical ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in pastures in the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua. Results suggest that the coexistence of Solenopsis geminate (Fabricius) and Pheidole subarmata (Mayrs) in Neotropical pastures is the result of a discovery/dominance tradeoff between these two species. Although S. geminata is a good interference competitor and can defend large resources, P. subarmata is a good exploitative competitor and arrives at resources faster than S. geminate. In an environment with mixed resources (large and small), these two species can co-exist. We discuss the implication of this for the invasion potential of S. geminata.

AB We analyzed the distributional patterns of 66 species of leptosporangiate ferns inhabiting in the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO), Mexico, using grid-cells and endemism index values, parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) and track analysis. The strict consensus area cladogram obtained with PAE showed a polytomy and four main groups or clades, two of them including only two or three grid-cells. The largest group included grid-cells located along the SMO, mainly in the central-southern portions of the SMO; a second group was located at the southern portion of the SMO in the leeward zone of this mountain chain. The track analysis of the fern taxa allowed us to recognize five generalized tracks in the SMO and their convergence showed five nodes. With endemism index values, 11 grid-cells were identified as important areas for ferns, seven of them corresponding to the group 1 of PAE (from montane environments), and four grid-cells to the group 2 of PAE (from leeward areas of the Sierra Madre Oriental). The results obtained herein slightly agree with other published works using other kinds of organisms. The analyses used herein serve to generate useful information about the biogeographic history of this complex area, and led us to support, detect, test and propose areas, important from biogeographic viewpoint, for ferns.

AB P>1. Visually foraging fish typically exclude large zooplankton from clear-water lakes and reservoirs. Do fish have the same effect in turbid waters, or does turbidity provide a refuge from visual predation?
   2. To test the hypothesis that fish exclude large zooplankton species from turbid sites, I searched for populations of medium or large Daphnia species in turbid, fish-containing reservoirs of south-central Oklahoma and north-central Texas, U.S.A., and surveyed the literature for accounts of Daphnia species in turbid habitats worldwide.
   3. Only small Daphnia species and the exuberantly spined Daphnia lumholtzi were detected in the turbid reservoirs. The Daphnia species in the reservoirs are smaller than other Daphnia species that occur in the area but were not detected. An extensive survey of the literature suggests that large Daphnia may be found in the lakes of extreme turbidity [Secchi disk depth (SD) < 0.2 m] but that only small and spiny Daphnia are likely to occur in more typical turbid locations (1.0 m > SD > 0.2 m) unless some additional factor reduces the influence of fish predation in such sites.
   4. The field samples from Texas and Oklahoma together with the literature review suggest that the effect of visually foraging planktivorous fish on the size structure of turbid-water zooplankton communities may often be as strong or even stronger than the effect of fish on clear-water zooplankton communities.

AB Previous studies in the fynbos biome of the Western Cape, South Africa, have suggested that biological decomposition rates in the fynbos vegetation type, on poor soils, may be so low that fire is the main factor contributing to litter breakdown and nutrient release. However, the fynbos biome also comprises vegetation types on more fertile soils, such as the renosterveld. The latter is defined by the shrub Elytropappus rhinocerotis, while the shrub Galenia africana may become dominant in overgrazed areas. We examined decomposition of litter of these two species and the geophyte Watsonia borbonica in patches of renosterveld in an agricultural landscape. In particular, we sought to understand how plant species identity affects litter decomposition rates, especially through variation in litter stoichiometry. Decomposition (organic matter mass loss) varied greatly among the species, and was related to litter N and P content. G. africana, with highest nutrient content, lost 65% of its original mass after 180 days, while E. rhinocerotis had lost ca. 30%, and the very nutrient poor W. borbonica < 10%. Litter placed under G. africana decomposed slightly faster than when placed under E. rhinocerotis. Over the course of the experiment, G. africana and E. rhinocerotis lost N and P, while W. borbonica showed strong accumulation of these elements. Decomposition rates of G. africana and E. rhinocerotis were substantially higher than those previously reported from fynbos vegetation, and variation among the species investigated was considerable. Our results suggest that fire may not always be the main factor contributing to litter breakdown and nutrient release in the fynbos biome. Thus, biological decomposition has likely been underestimated and, along with small-scale variation in ecosystem processes, would repay further study.

AB Background. European hake, Merluccius merluccius, is a major predator in demersal ecosystem, and of great importance for the fishery. Knowledge of the feeding ecology of fish species is essential for implementing a multispecies approach to fishery management. Therefore this work was intended to analyse stomach contents and dietary changes according to fish size, season, sex, and depth to better understanding the ecological role of this species in Adriatic demersal marine communities.
   Materials and methods. A total of 1646 specimens of hake were collected in the Adriatic Sea by oceanographic bottom trawl surveys carried out from 2005 to 2006 during summer-and winter seasons. Principal feeding indices, species diversity Bray-Curtis similarity index, feeding strategy plot, barplot on numeric, and weight abundance data were obtained in order to increase knowledge on the diet of hake.
   Results. The hake diet mainly consisted of crustaceans (particularly Decapoda) and teleosts (particularly European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, and red bandfish, Cepola macrophthalma). Cluster analysis of %N (numeric prey abundance percent) showed different feeding habits of three mainly groups: small hakes (<150 mm), medium sized hakes (from 150 to 300 mm) and large hake (>300 mm) from crustaceans (small specimens) to teleost fishes (medium and large specimens).
   Conclusion. Feeding habits were size-dependant with fish diet being higher in stomachs of larger specimens. Feeding activity seemed to increase during growth, being smaller in immature individuals compared to adults, while no differences were found between females and males diet. Seasonal variation in diet showed an increase of teleost fishes in winter and crustaceans in summer.

AB Little is known about egg dormancy in tardigrades, except for their ability to survive desiccated for a long time. Our previous analyses of the life-history traits of a reared strain of the leaf litter-dwelling eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus richtersi revealed a variation in hatching phenology, suggesting the presence of diapause (resting) eggs in tardigrades. To study adaptive strategies in an unpredictable environment subject to stochastic variability, such as that colonized by tardigrades, we have analysed the hatching phenology of an apomictic triploid cytotype of P. richtersi. The first lab oviposition of mature females collected in the field in the spring and fall as well as cohorts of eggs laid by females born in the laboratory were used. The eggs of all samples, maintained under the same constant experimental conditions, had a high hatching percentage (from 75 to 93%) but a high variability occurred in the hatching time. Four patterns were identified. First, subitaneous eggs hatched within 30-40 days from oviposition. Second, delayed-hatching eggs hatched gradually over 41-62 days. Some eggs did not hatch within 90 days from oviposition when water was maintained in the culture. Within this group, 13% of eggs (diapause resting eggs; third category) do not hatch until they are subjected to desiccation, followed by rehydration, while 87% never complete their development (abortive eggs; fourth category). The four categories of eggs had no morphological differences. The high variability in the hatching time of tardigrade eggs might be considered a form of bet-hedging.

AB The impact of a mass bleaching event on temporal and spatial population genetic structure in 4 scleractinian coral species in the Acropora aspera group was studied around the Palm Islands in the central Great Barrier Reef. Species status of sympatric populations of 2 of the 4 species, A. millepora and A. spathulata, was confirmed by the population genetic data; these species have recently been separated based on morphological and breeding characters. Spatial analyses of population samples from 2004 detected differences in the level of gene flow among locations. No significant genetic differentiation was inferred between conspecific populations at Orpheus and Pelorus Islands, which are both located in the northern part of the island group and separated by similar to 1000 m. In contrast, all populations at Fantome Island were genetically differentiated, despite this island being located only 11 km south. Sampling of A. millepora and A. pulchra in the year prior to the 1998 mass bleaching event enabled a temporal comparison across this event. The genetic composition of these populations changed between 1997 and 2004, but patterns of genetic differentiation among locations were similar in 1997 and 2004. Extensive mortality of these species following the 1998 bleaching event did not cause an apparent reduction in genetic diversity and identical multi-locus genotypes were encountered in both temporal samples, suggesting that re-growth of surviving genotypes contributed to the recovery of these populations. Comparisons among the 4 study species revealed lower genetic diversity in A. papillare, consistent with its low abundance throughout its distributional range.

AB The role of state forests in the conservation of the savannah environment of western Burkina Faso (West Africa) was assessed by considering the customary and fundamental biological components of plant diversity. The focus is on the "ordinary biodiversity" which constitutes the current environment of human populations and which generates their resources. Overall floristic composition, alpha, beta, gamma diversities and species accumulation curves of landscape units were compared inside and outside protected areas. Common species were identified according to their frequencies in landscape units and their local abundance. The occurrences of functional (life form, dispersion, etc.) and human-valued (current uses, potential threats, etc.) traits were compared. Current land uses outside protected areas have an unequal effect on the various components of plant diversity. Species richnesses and specific structures were all the more altered for woody species as agricultural pressure is high; conversely, they were maintained for herbaceous communities for which the proportion of wide-ranging species increased. The preservation of useful plant species on cultivated lands was obvious for woody species with edible fruits but less tangible for timber and service wood. It was deficient for species that furnish other non-wood products (e.g. leaves used as food or fodder), the conservation of which may be jeopardized where anthropic pressure is high. Given current land uses and dynamics, maintaining conservation areas in land use planning is crucial in order to preserve ordinary biodiversity.

AB A small-scale model of the Southern California-Northern Baja California coastline has been developed to explore dispersion over the continental shelf, with specific attention to physical parameters pertinent to simulations of larval dispersal and population connectivity. The ROMS simulation employs a nested grid system, with an inner domain resolution of 600 m and an outer domain resolution of 1.5 km. Realistic bathymetry and forcing were employed to investigate the effects of passive transport of tracers introduced at locations with known communities of mytilid mussels along the coastline. The effects of topographic resolution, boundary conditions, and choice of meteorological forcing products on dispersion rates, tracer trajectories, and the subsequent measures of population connectivity were examined. In particular, the choice of wind forcing product resulted in different circulation patterns and tracer trajectories and had especially important consequences on measures of larval connectivity such as self-seeding, potential for larval settlement ( import), and contribution to the pool of available larvae ( export). While some forcing products performed better when model data were compared to field measurements, no product was clearly superior. The uncertainty in results, which may appear minor in larger-scale temperature or surface velocity fields, is significant when examining a sensitive passive tracer. This modeling uncertainty needs to be addressed when interpreting connectivity results.

AB Many species of the genus Pinus are important forestry trees that escape from plantations and invade natural and seminatural habitats. This study compares the native Pinus sylvestris with an invasive alien P. strobus in the Czech Republic in terms of their radial growth response to climate. Pinus strobus invades sandstone regions, while in areas with another bedrock and soil type it regenerates only sparsely. The research was conducted in six areas differing in abiotic characteristics and the degree of P. strobus regeneration. The effect of climate on the diameter growth was studied using moving and evolutionary correlation and response function analyses. Climatic factors affect radial growth of both species' some reactions are species-specific, others are the same for both species but differ in their intensity. Pinus sylvestris responded positively to high February/March temperatures, P. strobus negatively to high temperatures and low precipitation in the previous September in all study sites. Both species responded to summer rainfall in warm and dry areas, but the response of P. strobus was stronger than that of P. sylvestris. In sandstone areas, both species responded to specific microsite conditions. The study (lid not find it clear link between dendroclimatological response of P. strobus and its invasive behaviour in sandstone areas of the Czech Republic.

AB Distribution records of 152 adult helminth taxa parasites of freshwater fishes in Mexico were analysed to determine areas of high richness and endemism. Distribution maps were prepared for each taxon and overlaid onto a map of Mexico divided into 1 x 1 degree grid-cells. Richness was determined by counting recorded helminth species in each grid-cell. A corrected weighted endemism index was calculated for each grid-cell, and the relationship between richness and endemicity was analysed with an Olmstead-Tukey corner test of association. Five areas of high richness and endemism were identified: (1) Los Tuxtlas and the Papaloapan river basin, on the Gulf of Mexico; (2) the Grijalva-Usumacinta basin near the Gulf of Mexico coastal plain; (3) the Yucatan Peninsula; (4) the Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve in western Mexico; and (5) the Patzcuaro lake, in central Mexico. The distribution of richness and endemism of helminth parasites of freshwater fishes in Mexico is congruent with distributional patterns described for other freshwater taxa in Mexico. Patterns of richness and/or endemism in the studied areas can be explained by the ichthyological composition of their bodies of water. The present study establishes an objective way of analysing the relationship between richness and endemicity, and suggests that helminths can make valuable contributions to regionalization of geographical areas and for identification of rich and biologically complex areas with potential for conservation of aquatic systems.

AB A botanical inventory and diversity of trees, shrubs (>= 5 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]), herbs, climbers and lianas was assessed in plots (154) of 20 x 5 m in Mt. Marsabit forest, northern Kenya. We recorded 52 species of trees and shrubs, twelve species of herbs and six species of climbers and lianas. They belonged to 35 families and 64 genera. Rubiaceae was the richest family with nine species followed by Euphorbiaceae (six), Oleaceae (five), Rutaceae (four), Capparaceae, Labiatae and Leguminosae (three each). The rest of the families were represented by one or two species. Rinorea convallarioides (Bak.f.) Eyles ssp. marsabitensis Grey-Wilson (Violaceae), an endemic species, and Drypetes gerrardii Hutch. (Euphorbiaceae), were the two most important species, accounting for more than third of the combined importance value. Species diversity indices were 2.735 (Shannon-Wiener), 0.88 (Simpson's) and 0.296 (Evenness). There was a strong evidence of disturbance arising from anthropogenic and wildlife foraging activities.

AB When populations of native predators are subsidized by numerically dominant introduced species, the structure of food webs can be greatly altered. Surprisingly little is known, however, about the general factors that influence whether or not native predators consume introduced species. To learn more about this issue, we examined how native pit-building ant lions (Myrmeleon) are affected by Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) invasions in coastal southern California. Compared to areas without L. humile, invaded areas contained few native ant species and were deficient in medium-sized and large bodied native ants. Based on these differences, we predicted that Argentine ants would negatively affect ant lion larvae. Contrary to this expectation, observational surveys and laboratory growth rate experiments revealed that Myrmeleon were heavier, had longer mandibles, and grew more quickly when their main ant prey were Argentine ants rather than native ants. Moreover, a field transplant experiment indicated that growth rates and pupal weights were not statistically different for larval ant lions reared in invaded areas compared to those reared in uninvaded areas. Argentine ants were also highly susceptible to capture by larval Myrmeleon. The species-level traits that presumably make Argentine ant workers susceptible to capture by larval ant lions-small size and high activity levels-appear to be the same characteristics that make them unsuitable prey for vertebrate predators, such as horned lizards. These results underscore the difficulties in predicting whether or not numerically dominant introduced species serve as prey for native predators.

AB The present work aimed at studying the effect of Oxalis pes-caprae invasion in the herbaceous understory of olive groves in the island of Lesvos, Greece. The number of species, their biomass and dead plant material production was followed throughout the vegetative period in invaded and non-invaded plots. Species richness in the area invaded by O. pes-caprae gradually declined and was significantly smaller in comparison with the natural vegetation. Although biomass was equal in the invaded and non-invaded areas 1 month after germination, annual net primary production (NPP) was three times smaller in the invaded than the non-invaded area. Moreover, aboveground dead plant material of O. pes-caprae decomposed faster than a mixture of litter species of the natural vegetation. Lower biomass production in combination with increased decomposition rates of O. pes-caprae is expected to lead to reduced soil C sequestration in invaded areas. It was concluded that although O. pes-caprae does not add a new life form or functional type to the invaded herbaceous system it has considerable impacts on the diversity and ecosystem functions in olive groves.

AB Expansion of the nature conservation estate in northeastern New South Wales, Australia, has captured weed-infested timber plantations amid a mosaic of high conservation value lands. We adopted a state-and-transition approach to test the hypothesis that restoration barriers restrict the natural regeneration of native species in Eucalyptus grandis plantations infested by Lantana camara in Bongil Bongil National Park, New South Wales. Plantation tree thinning and weed control were applied in factorial combination at three sites (totaling to 4.5 ha). Topsoil chemistry responses to these interventions were attributable to the "ash bed" effect, with temporary increases in topsoil pH(W) and nitrate, particularly where canopy reduction was greatest. Other soil changes were minor, indicating that thinning and burning did not risk soil degradation. Plant species richness and functional group representation in the regenerating understorey were improved by the interventions. Regeneration of native potential canopy trees, understorey trees, shrubs and woody climbers, and perennial forbs all increased with canopy retention. Grass cover dominated the regeneration where canopy cover was less than 50%. In the absence of weed control, the cover of introduced shrubs increased with reduction in canopy cover, as did the rate of understorey regeneration generally. These responses indicate that thinning and weed control can reinstate succession, leading to structurally and compositionally diverse forest. Given the abundance of native woody regeneration under retained canopy, the lantana understorey was more important in inhibiting native regeneration. The experimental approach will promote efficient use of resources across the remaining 200 ha of low conservation value plantations in this national park.

AB An overview of prospects and limitations for the application of 'classical' top-down biomanipulation as a management tool to ameliorate the consequences of eutrophication under the conditions applicable to reservoirs in South Africa is presented. This is structured by considering successive stages in reservoir food-web structure and function as far as can be generalised for South African biophysical conditions. Features and conditions that influence the potential vulnerability of local reservoirs to the effects of eutrophication, and prospects for its amelioration by biomanipulation intervention are examined. Physical factors linked to latitude (irradiation pattern and water-column stability) enhance the potential severity of eutrophication consequences in local reservoirs, although conversely, these are offset by suspended-clay turbidity. The predominance of Microcystis in local eutrophic waters is perceived as a primary major constraint in implementing 'classical' food-web manipulation. Intrinsic limitations on the ability of zooplankton grazers to control this cyanobacterium, and subsequent food-web linkages widely applicable in local reservoirs are discussed and evaluated accordingly. On balance, available evidence indicates a range of limitations that are likely to apply in respect of familiar contemporary approaches to biomanipulation in use today, although the uniqueness of each reservoir ecosystem is recognised. Some novel alternative management approaches are suggested, and a range of associated research requirements necessary to advance locally relevant scientific comprehension of 'biomanipulation' and its application are itemised. National revitalisation of reservoir limnology remains paramount.

AB Fertilization of secondary successional communities generally increases biomass but reduces diversity; its impact on primary successional communities is less well understood. Following applications of a balanced fertilizer to naturally established vegetation on slate quarry waste, effects on tree growth, ground flora species and foliar invertebrates were monitored over two years. Fertilization increased tree growth, with stem basal area increasing by 130% over two growing seasons compared with a 50% increase in unfertilized trees. Several dominant ground flora species increased in cover as a result of fertilization. In contrast, cover of bryophytes was not increased. Fertilization favoured plant species associated with drier habitats, but disadvantaged less-competitive ruderal species. Tree foliar invertebrates were less abundant on the trees on slate waste than on trees in established woodland. Fertilization made tree leaves more palatable by increasing nitrogen and reducing soluble polyphenol concentrations, and increased the abundance of sap-sucking invertebrates, without changing foliar invertebrate diversity. overall, fertilizing this primary successional site was beneficial for biodiversity; it increased abundance of dominant plant species and foliar invertebrate herbivores, yet few taxa were adversely affected during this period. Increases in tree biomass and invertebrate abundance are likely to favour the establishment of other taxa. Where the biodiversity conservation interest is principally in closed-canopy vegetation, applying fertilizer is a cheap, comparatively non-intrusive and effective way to increase biodiversity on denuded sites. However, plant species characteristic of open and infertile habitats (particularly bryophytes) and their obligate herbivorous invertebrates are likely to decrease in abundance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A reciprocal transplant experiment was conducted to uncouple genetic and environmental effects on plant fitness of a range-expanding indigenous shrub, Leptospermum scoparium. Patterns of encroachment differed significantly between three regions of Encalyptus camaldulensis woodland in the Grampians National Park, south-eastern Australia, with greater shrub densities found in the Victoria Valley region. Higher shrub densities in this region are likely due to greater fruit production/shrub, increased field germination and increased early seedling survival. The results of the reciprocal transplant experiment showed increased fitness appears to be due to phenotypic plasticity in response to favourable environmental conditions rather than genotypic variation. Field germination and seedling survival were influenced by region of planting and not seed origin. However, differences in shoot length and biomass of seedlings between the regions were detected after five months of growth in uniform conditions which may indicate genetic differentiation. The results, however, suggest range expansion is partly due to increased plant fitness which is likely a plastic response to favourable environmental conditions, especially soil moisture.

AB To test the hypothesis that sediment would have a synergistic effect on the toxicity of lead to cladocerans, we performed life table demography experiments with two pelagic (Diaphanosoma birgei and Moina micrura) and one littoral (Alona rectangula) cladoceran species. Life table demography experiments were conducted at three levels of turbidity (0, 17 and 170 NTU) and six concentrations of lead (as PbCl2) from 0 to 0.71 mg l(-1). Median lethal concentrations (LC50) for A. rectangula, D. birgei and M. micrura were 7.06 +/- 0.39, 3.16 +/- 0.25 and 3.24 +/- 0.69 mg l(-1) of Pb. Life table study showed that in general, the presence of sediments in test jars allowed an overall increase of 20-75% in both survivorship and reproduction of the cladoceran species exposed to different concentrations of Pb. At 0.04 mg l(-1) of Pb, the population growth rates were 0.127 for A. rectangula, 0.037 for D. birgei and 0.471 d(-1) for M. micrura in the absence of sediments but were elevated in their presence (0.309, 0.141 and 0.722 d(-1), respectively). The data have been discussed in relation to their importance in shallow, turbid Mexican waterbodies.

AB For more than 100 years, non-native conifers have been introduced into habitats in the USA that already support native conifers. These introductions have yielded few naturalizations and even less evidence of invasions. We investigated the specific fates of nine non-native conifers in an array of introduction sites across the USA (Priest River, Idaho, Wind River, Washington, Cedar Creek, Minnesota, and Nantucket Is. and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts) through tree-ring analyses, comparisons of growth with adjacent native conifer populations, and surveys for regeneration and spread. Most of the original non-native tree plantings have died (e.g. Abies veitchii, Pinus densiflora, and Pinus halepensis at Wind River, WA); a few have survived but display low vigour and are not regenerating (e.g. Larix decidua, Pinus mugo, and Picea abies stands at Priest River, ID). Pinus sylvestris recruitment is apparent at all sites examined. Pinus thunbergii appears to be invasive on Nantucket Is., although the native Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (pinewood nematode) causes high mortality in mature trees. Non-native Pinus spp. at the Eddy Arboretum, California and Pack Forest, Washington also experienced high mortality. Dendroclimatic analyses revealed no difference in the effect of climate on the annual growth of native and non-native conifers. Plantations of introduced conifers in the south-eastern USA have died en masse (e.g. Harrison Experimental Forest, Mississippi, Olustee Arboretum, Florida). Such widespread extirpations are in sharp contrast to the fate of native conifers in adjacent stands as well as the multiple cases of large-scale conifer invasions in the Southern Hemisphere. Given the diversity of alien plant species that have invaded the USA, the circumstances surrounding the lack of persistence of introduced conifers becomes an important line of inquiry for understanding the factors and circumstances that facilitate or thwart biological invasions.

AB This article examines the utilization characteristics and importance of woody biomass resources in the rural-urban fringe zones of Botswana. In the literature for Africa, attention has been given to the availability and utilization of biomass in either urban or rural environments, but the rural-urban fringe has been neglected. Within southern Africa, this neglect is not justified; the rural-urban fringe, not getting the full benefits available in urban environments in Botswana, has developed problems in woody biomass availability and utilization that require close attention. In this article, socioeconomic data on the importance of woody biomass in the Batlokwa Tribal Territory, on the rural-urban fringe of Gaborone, Botswana, were collected together with ecologic data that reveal the utilization characteristics and potential for regrowth of woody biomass. The analysis of these results show that local woody biomass is very important in the daily lives of communities in the rural-urban fringe zones and that there is a high level of harvesting. However, there is no effort in planning land use in the tribal territory to either conserve this resource or provide alternatives to its utilization. The future of woody biomass resources in Botswana's rural-urban fringe is uncertain. The investigators recommend that a comprehensive policy for the development of the rural-urban fringe consider the importance of this resource. The neglect of this resource will have far-reaching implications on the livelihoods of residents as well as the environment in this zone.

AB Marine assemblages on natural hard substrata are generally different from those on artificial habitats. There is, however, the potential for certain ecological processes to operate on both types of structures. On the sides of floating pontoons in Sydney Harbour, there were strong patterns of vertical distribution of sessile epibiotic organisms and molluscan grazers across relatively small spatial scales (in three defined zones, namely splash, shallow and deep). Patterns of vertical distribution of the tubeworms Hydroides spp. were reversed depending on the cover of mussels. A manipulative experiment was done to test if patterns of vertical distribution of Hydroides spp. were due to (1) the functioning of mussels or (2) the structure provided by mussels. Neither the functioning nor structure of mussels accounted for the patterns of distribution of Hydroides spp. Mussels increased recruitment of Hydroides spp., in the shallow and deep zones, and this was not due to increased surface area of the mussel shells. Manipulation of numbers of grazers and covers of sessile epibiota showed that the observed negative relationship between grazers and epibiota was due to grazers reducing recruitment of epibiota and epibiota decreasing survival of grazers. Most importantly, processes that accounted for patterns of distribution of mobile and sessile organisms on artificial floating structures were similar to those repeatedly shown to create such patterns on natural rocky shores.

AB Faecal analyses were used to investigate the diets of the endangered frogs Litoria nannotis, L. rheocola and Nyctimystes dayi in Tully Gorge, North Queensland. Comparisons of diet and food availability indicate that these species feed indiscriminately on a range of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates. Changes in morphology and foraging behaviour significantly influenced diet composition and created subtle shifts in the degree of selectivity displayed in prey choice. Interspecific differences in numeric and volumetric diet composition were attributed to variations in gape size and microhabitat selection. Within the diets of L. nannotis and L. rheocola, a decline in prey selectivity observed during the dry season reflected a reduction in foraging activity. Differences in the gape size and foraging behaviour of males and females of L. nannotis were responsible for sex-specific differences in diet composition. L. nannotis also diplayed an ontogenetic shift in prey size and type. As snout - vent length increased, L. nannotis consumed fewer, but larger prey and increasingly discriminated against dipterans, dipteran larvae and hemipterans. Importantly, L. nannotis, L. rheocola and N. dayi demonstrated the capacity to compensate for fluctuations in food availability by feeding on less lucrative prey.

AB Seabirds are high trophic predators in marine ecosystems and are sensitive to change in food supply and thus seabirds can be used as monitors of the marine environment. In order to study the foraging responses of Japanese cormorants Phalacrocorax filamentosus breeding at Teuri Island, Hokkaido to changes in fish availability, the diet was assessed from the regurgitations of parents and chicks, and diving behavior was measured by using time-depth recorders. Breeding performance (brood size, chick growth, breeding success) was monitored busing conventional methods to study their breeding responses. Japanese cormorants changed the diet and foraging behavior over four summers. The birds fed mainly on epipelagic schooling fish when they were available and on demersal fish when pelagic fish availability was low. They tended to dive deeper and longer in a year when they fed mainly on demersal fish than the other years, reflecting the change in the depth distribution of prey fish. Chick growth rate did riot differ among years, but fledging success was lower in the years of demersal fish as their meal delivery rate was low. When epipelagic schooling fish were considered scare, parents maintained chick growth by reducing brood size. High variability and unpredictability in pelagic fish abundance are key factors affecting the foraging and breeding performance of Japanese cormorants, which could potentially be used to monitor fish resources.

ID TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; RESERVES; DESIGN
AB Atlantic forests of Brazil exist largely as remnants in an agricultural landscape, but they are still key reservoirs of biological diversity, Forest fragments are often the only remaining repositories of the biological information needed to guide successful restoration of this endangered ecosystem. These fragments also support the last wild populations of the black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus [Mikan]), one of the most endangered primates in the world, as well as other vulnerable and valuable plant species. Activities of local landless people who reside adjacent to the forest are currently depleting the biodiversity of forest fragments. Fires, cattle grazing, and spread of invasive grasses have caused a gradual but continuous erosion of forest biodiversity. Human encroachment affects forest structure and causes loss of many plant and animal species, mainly through edge effects. We present an approach to establish agroforestry benefit zones around forest fragments as a tool for the conservation of Atlantic forest remnants. Both the remaining forests and local farmers benefit from the establishment of agroforestry green belts. A vital aspect of these benefit zones is the use of multipurpose trees and shrubs to provide an insulative/protective zone around fragments, mitigating edge effects. Implicit in this conservation approach are the assumptions that stimulating planting and use of multipurpose trees and shrubs in edge areas places a value on these resources, and that this value will help pave the way to the conservation of forests and wildlife in the Atlantic forest region.

ID EASTERN WEDDELL SEA; ICE CORE; AEROSOL
AB Snow samples taken at various distances from the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) colony near Halley station were analysed by ion chromatography. Extremely high ammonium concentrations were encountered at the colony itself, but fell off sharply with distance from the colony, reaching background levels within a few kilometres of the colony. A seasonal effect was also seen, with the highest concentrations found in spring when the colony was at its most active. Levels of potassium and other sea-salt ions were also elevated near the colony. The ratio of sodium to potassium was lower than that found in bulk seawater, and closer to that found in the penguin's food source, indicating that the increased concentrations are due to emissions from the penguins and not merely to the proximity of open seawater to the site. The colony thus has a significant effect on the composition of the nearby snow, but this effect is strongly localised and is not likely to significantly influence snow chemistry at inland ice core drilling sites.

AB Between October 1990 and August 1991 colony-forming unit (CFU) bacteria at the centre of the Ria de Vigo, Spain, comprised on average 1% of total bacterioplankton, with a maximum of 6.8% in mid-April. In contrast to relatively small fluctuations in total bacterioplankton, fluctuations in CFUs were considerable, with the coefficient of variation ranging from 112 to 233%. Over 40% of the variance in CFU abundance in the surface layer during the whole period of observations (winter and summer) could be explained through an equation relating logCFU to incoming solar radiation, and during the summer months through another equation relating logCFU to upwelling. Both physical factors enhanced CFU concentrations. Biological variables, such as total bacterioplankton, chlorophyll and heterotrophic flagellates, had no further effect on the explained variance. At the bottom of the photic zone, runoff and upwelling accounted for between 29 and 50% of the variance in CFU counts. In this layer, biological variables had a great influence on CFU abundance, increasing the explained variance to 61% for the whole period studied. In this case, chlorophyll was negatively related to logCFU suggesting that the CFU bacterial fraction was more abundant in the water column after the decline of the phytoplankton blooms and after the corresponding release of bacteria attached to particles. At the bottom of the water column, seawater temperature was the only important factor in explaining the variance in CFU counts (36%), with logCFU and temperature being positively related. We hypothesise that 3 factors are prominent in controlling the CFU standing stock: solar radiation and upwelling stimulate the synthesis of particulate organic matter in surface waters, providing a food source for CFU bacteria, and terrestrial runoff which dilutes bacterial numbers. Based on cluster analyses of physiological tests, on pure bacterial isolates from 2 contrasting sampling dates, we show that prevailing hydro- and meteorological conditions select for different bacterial species in the CFU community. Lower CFU counts and diversity within the population, plus lower frequencies of positive responses in physiological tests arose through very high upwelling and NW winds which introduced CFU-poor water masses from the Atlantic Ocean into the Ria de Vigo. Conversely, terrestrial runoff and NE winds enhanced diversity within this population at the centre of the estuary, through the introduction of terrestrial bacteria or those from shallow waters; these were characterised by higher numbers of positive responses in physiological tests.

Oxygen levels were found to be below the limit of detection for the oxygen microelectrode (0.38 mg DO.L-1), suggesting either microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions. The pH profile of the gut revealed a decrease from the external environment (pH = 8.20) to pH 5.31 within the crop. increasing through the intestine to 6.64 in the rectum. Enrichment cultures of bacteria from within the abalone gut revealed mostly isolates from the family Enterobacteriaceae. These isolates occurred throughout all regions of the abalone gut, and almost all showed hydrolytic ability for one or more carbohydrates. Cytophaga spp. isolates appeared from esophageal and intestinal enrichments of the digestive tract and were all capable of both carboxymethylcellulose and agar hydrolysis. A decrease in diversity of bacterial types in the stomach, crop, and style sac corresponded with reduced pH.

AB A total of 51 bacterial strains were isolated from fairy shrimps [Branchipus schnefferi (Fisher), Chirocephalus diaphanus (Prevost) and Streptocephalus torvicornis (Waga)] showing signs of 'black disease'. The fairy shrimps showed black nodules on the thoracic appendages, the cercopods, the antennae and sometimes at the back of the head. The infection sires on the thoracic appendages were restricted to the proximal parts of the endopodite, the exopodite and endite I. In order to check Koch's postulates, pure bacterial cultures were administered to healthy fairy shrimps. One bacterial pathogen was identified as Aeromonas hydrophila using BIOLOG and the genotypic fingerprinting technique AFLP.

   SIZE
AB We Studied the reproductive behavior of Swallow-tailed Kites (Elanoides forficatus) in northern Guatemala. Modal clutch size was two (range 1-2), but no nests succeeded in fledging more than one young. Eggs were laid at intervals of three to four days and hatched at intervals of three to Ave days. Second eggs weighed significantly less than first eggs. Second chicks either received no fond or obtained so little that they did not grow. First chicks vigorously attacked their nestmates, and all second chicks died within five days of hatching. Food stress was not found to be a proximate cause of this behavior. Siblicide appears to be innate in this population of Swallow-tailed Kites, even though the northern subspecies does not exhibit this behavior. Swallow-tailed Kites are, in certain aspects, an anomaly among species within the order Falconiformes that exhibit obligate siblicide.

AB The ability of an unidentified mycobiont from Pisonia grandis mycorrhizas to utilize organic nitrogen and phosphorus sources was determined in axenic liquid cultures. The fungus utilized inorganic phosphate and both freely- and poorly-soluble salts of inositol hexaphosphate as sole phosphorus sources. With the exception of uric acid which did not support growth, the yield of the mycobiont on all organic nitrogen sources tested was significantly greater than the yield on either NH4+ or NO3-. It is suggested that the major ecological role of the Pisonia mycobiont in stands of P. grandis on coral cays may be rapid absorption of allantoin and urea produced during degradation of uric acid by the soil microflora. This may be important in retaining nitrogen in the soil:plant system prior to loss from the coral cay by further degradation, volatilization and/or leaching.

AB We investigated the existence and kind of intraspecific competition among larvae of Myrmemeleon uniformis (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae), a pit-trapping antlion, in southeast Brazil. The population occupied an area of about 120 m(2) in a shallow cave, where we demarcated a 1 x 1 m permanent plot.
   Larval pits were mapped once a week for two months, and the time each individual remained in the same location was estimated. Disappearance represents death or movement in search of a better site.
   Pit diameter was significantly correlated with larva size. Weekly residence probability increases with pit diameter and decreases with the relative size of the nearest neighbor (neighbor pit radius/neighbor distance). A logistic model also indicates that these competitive asymmetries are smaller for the part of the plot closer to the cave entrance, suggesting that microhabitat influences the magnitude of differences among competitive abilities.
   Pit size frequency distributions were positively skewed during the whole study period. Low transition probabilities to larger pit diameter classes and a high proportion of pits which diminish in size weekly suggest that food is limiting. The population declined over the study period, and increased in spatial regularity, further evidence of intraspecific competition.

AB Age-related changes in lipid, water, and non-lipid content and energy density of four major body parts (integument, viscera, leg and pectoral muscles, and carcass) of Cape Gannet chicks, juveniles, and adults were studied. The proportion of water was typically high for neonates and decreased during development to near adult levels at fledging. The percentage of lean dry matter remained almost constant for muscles and carcass but decreased in viscera and integument due to fat deposited during growth. Energy density was linearly related to age (kJ/g = 4.46 + 0.076 Age (days), r2 = 0.845, P < 0.001). Fasting capability (FC) of chicks (survival time when using only their lipid reserves, calculated from lipid mass and field metabolic rate) increased exponentially up to 70 days of age (FC = 0.6e0.05 Age, r2 = 0. 815, P < 0.001). Newly fledged birds have a fasting capability between 8-16 days and adults only 1-2 days. Time between consecutive feeds, from field observations at the nest, for chicks 21-40, 41-60 and 61-80 days old were 11.9 +/- 0.7 h, N = 74; 16 +/- 1.1 h, N = 50; and 20 +/- 0.6 h, N = 35, respectively. The results are contrary to the hypothesis that fat deposits are an insurance against an unpredictable fast, although they may serve for this purpose. Fat deposits may be the physiological consequence of the temporal pattern of feeding by adults, or they may serve as energy sinks to increase energy requirements relative to the nutrient and protein requirements of chicks.

AB The cyclopoid copepod Metacyclops minutus, a typical species of temporary pools, shows an unusual life cycle in a small pond in South Germany. The species is present from April/May to December during which period it forms at least 8 generations. Winter and early spring, when the pond is frozen to the bottom, are spent in the bottom mud as C4 or C5 instars. M. minutus shows an extraordinarily low degree of sex size dimorphism (female: male body length ratio) and no significant differences in copepodite development time between the two sexes. This, together with the exceptionally short durations of embryonic- and postembryonic development enables reproduction to start without delay and rapid population growth after harsh conditions. By these means M. minutus is the first species to reproduce after periods of extremely low water level; later, when conditions in the pond become more stable, M. minutus is surpassed in numbers by a coexisting, filterfeeding and parthenogenetically reproducing cladoceran Moina brachiata.

AB The effect of food availability on fat content was investigated in two species of pit digging ant-lion larvae in Tanzania.  Macroleon quinquemaculatus (Hagen), a large species living in a crowded food poor habitat, is subject to strong intraspecific competition.  The much smaller Morter sp. occurs in both food poor and food rich habitats.  In the food poor habitat small Morter individuals are frequently food stressed while in the food rich habitat all sizes of individuals are occasionally subject to starvation during rainy periods.  Rates of mass loss in starved larvae stabilised after a few days at -0.44%. larva-1 day-1.  This rate did not differ across instar or species.  Larvae used fat during starvation.
   Fed third instar Macroleon larvae had steeper growth rate-body size regression slopes than the first two instars because of increased allocation to fat stores:  the slopes varied with hunger level.  Growth rate slopes did not vary with instar in Morter.  The proportion of fat in Macroleon and Morter from the food poor habitat increased rapidly in the third instar but in Morter from the food rich habitat the proportion was higher and less size dependent.  The species showed similar percentages of fat at pupation.  On two occasions, during 316 d surveyed during the dry season, rain-induced starvation was sufficient to kill > 65% of the first two instars of Morter.

AB Many systems on our planet shift abruptly and irreversibly from the desired state to an undesired state when forced across a "tipping point". Some examples are mass extinctions within ecosystems, cascading failures in infrastructure systems, and changes in human and animal social networks. The ability to avoid such regime shifts or to recover quickly from such a non-resilient state demonstrates a system's resilience; system resilience is a quality that enables a system to adjust its activities to retain its basic functionality when errors and failures occur. In the past 50 years, attention has been paid almost exclusively to low-dimensional systems; scholars have focused on the calibration of the resilience functions of such systems and the identification of indicators of early warning signals based on two to three connected components. In recent years, taking advantage of network theory and the availability of lavish real datasets, network scientists have begun to explore real-world complex networked multidimensional systems, as well as their resilience functions and early warning indicators. This report presents a comprehensive review of resilience functions and regime shifts in complex systems in domains such as ecology, biology, society, and infrastructure. The research approach includes empirical observations, experimental studies, mathematical modeling, and theoretical analysis. We also review the definitions of some ambiguous terms, including robustness, resilience, and stability.

Thus, the history of climate and environments in this basin contributes significantly to our understanding of the conditions under which early humans spread into Europe during the Early Pleistocene. Here we present estimates of precipitation and primary productivity in the GBB from the Pliocene to the Middle Pleistocene based on dental ecometrics in fossil communities of large herbivorous mammals, and perform an ecometrics-based distribution modelling to analyse the environmental conditions of Early and Middle Pleistocene human sites in Europe. Our results show that Early Pleistocene humans generally occupied on average relatively diverse habitats with ecotones, such as woodlands and savannas, but avoided very open and harsh (cool or dry) environments. During the Middle Pleistocene in Europe, humans occupied a comparatively much broader range of environments than during the Early Pleistocene, but were on average more concentrated in environments where the dental ecometric of mammals indicate wooded palaeoenvironments. In the earliest human occupation sites of the GBB, Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva 3, the mean annual precipitation and net primary production estimates indicate climatic conditions close to modern Mediterranean sclerophyllous woodland environments, but with slightly higher primary productivity, indicating some similarity with East African woodlands. On the other hand, the environments did not resemble African grassland savannas. The browse-dominated diets of ungulates from Barranco Leon and Fuente Nueva 3 further suggest palaeoenvironments where grasses were a minor component of the vegetation. In the slightly older site of Venta Micena that has no evidence for the presence of hominins, dental ecometric estimates indicate climate and environments similar to Mediterranean "forest steppe" environments existing in the surroundings of Baza today. Grasses were prevalent in the diet of some taxa, especially equids, in Venta Micena, but most of the species show browse-dominated diets even there. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The spread of non-native species results in novel and often unexpected assemblages. Using stable isotopes, we disentangled the trophic relationships between three invasive crayfish species at two sites of a small thermal tributary of the Barat stream, Hungary. We studied Procambarus virginalis and Faxonius limosus living in sympatry in the upper section of this thermal tributary, and then an assemblage in a lower section also containing P. clarkii. The two species in the upper section largely shared trophic niches, although P. virginalis was more carnivorous than F. limosus, which fed more on detritus and aquatic plants. In the lower section, P. clarkii had a distinctive trophic niche, being more carnivorous than the other species and also preying on other crayfish and fish. The trophic niches of the other two species shifted slightly, being narrower and more overlapping in the presence of P. clarkii. It seems that the presence of P. clarkii affects the feeding habits and trophic niches of the other two crayfish. Our results also indicate that the species have somewhat distinctive feeding niches, which suggests that the ecosystem effects of these species are likely to be at least partially additive in the shared localities.

AB An important element of the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 15 - i.e. to enhance "ecosystem resilience ... through conservation and restoration" - remains largely unaddressed by existing indicators. We here develop an indicator addressing just one of many possible dimensions of ecosystem resilience, by focusing on the capacity of ecosystems to retain biological diversity in the face of ongoing, and uncertain, climate change. The Bioclimatic Ecosystem Resilience Index (BERI) assesses the extent to which a given spatial configuration of natural habitat will promote or hinder climate-induced shifts in biological distributions. The approach uses existing global modelling of spatial turnover in species composition within three broad biological groups (plants, invertebrates and vertebrates) to scale projected changes in composition under a plausible range of climate scenarios. These projections serve as filters through which to analyse the configuration of habitat observed at a given point in time (e.g. for a particular year) - represented as a grid in which cells are scored in terms of habitat condition. BERI is then calculated, for each cell in this grid, as a function of the connectedness of that cell to areas of natural habitat in the surrounding landscape which are projected to support a similar composition of species under climate change to that currently associated with the focal cell. All analyses are performed at 30-arcsecond grid resolution (approximately 1 km cells at the equator). Results can then be aggregated to report on status and trends for any desired set of reporting units - e.g. ecoregions, countries, or ecosystem types. We present example outputs for the Moist Tropical Forest Biome, based on a habitat-condition time series derived from the Global Forest Change dataset. We also describe how BERI is now being extended to cover all biomes (forest and non-forest) across the entire terrestrial surface of the planet.

AB Climatic impacts are especially pronounced in the Arctic, which as a region is warming twice as fast as the rest of the globe. Here, we investigate how mean climatic conditions and rates of climatic change impact parasitoid insect communities in 16 localities across the Arctic. We focus on parasitoids in a widespread habitat,Dryasheathlands, and describe parasitoid community composition in terms of larval host use (i.e., parasitoid use of herbivorous Lepidoptera vs. pollinating Diptera) and functional groups differing in their closeness of host associations (koinobionts vs. idiobionts). Of the latter, we expect idiobionts-as being less fine-tuned to host development-to be generally less tolerant to cold temperatures, since they are confined to attacking hosts pupating and overwintering in relatively exposed locations. To further test our findings, we assess whether similar climatic variables are associated with host abundances in a 22 year time series from Northeast Greenland. We find sites which have experienced a temperature rise in summer while retaining cold winters to be dominated by parasitoids of Lepidoptera, with the reverse being true for the parasitoids of Diptera. The rate of summer temperature rise is further associated with higher levels of herbivory, suggesting higher availability of lepidopteran hosts and changes in ecosystem functioning. We also detect a matching signal over time, as higher summer temperatures, coupled with cold early winter soils, are related to high herbivory by lepidopteran larvae, and to declines in the abundance of dipteran pollinators. Collectively, our results suggest that in parts of the warming Arctic,Dryasis being simultaneously exposed to increased herbivory and reduced pollination. Our findings point to potential drastic and rapid consequences of climate change on multitrophic-level community structure and on ecosystem functioning and highlight the value of collaborative, systematic sampling effort.

AB Ocean warming has predictably driven some marine species to migrate polewards or to deeper water, matching rates of environmental temperature change (climate velocity) to remain at tolerable temperatures. Most species conforming to expectations are fish and other strong swimmers that can respond to temperature change by migrating as adults. On the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf, however, many benthic invertebrates' ranges have instead shifted southwards and into shallower, warmer water. We tested whether these 'wrong-way' migrations could arise from warming-induced changes in the timing of spawning (phenology) and transport of drifting larvae. The results showed that larvae spawned earlier in the year encounter more downwelling-favourable winds and river discharge that drive transport onshore and southwards. Phenology and transport explained most observed range shifts, whereas climate velocity was a poor predictor. This study reveals a physical mechanism that counterintuitively pushes benthic species, including commercial shellfish, into warmer regions with higher mortality.
   Many marine species have migrated towards the poles as water temperatures warm. In contrast, due to changes in the timing of spawning and transport, benthic invertebrates on the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf are pushed into warmer waters where mortality could be higher.

AB In savannas, partitioning of below-ground resources by depth could facilitate tree-grass coexistence and shape vegetation responses to changing rainfall patterns. However, most studies assessing tree versus grass root-niche partitioning have focused on one or two sites, limiting generalization about how rainfall and soil conditions influence the degree of rooting overlap across environmental gradients. We used two complementary stable isotope techniques to quantify variation (a) in water uptake depths and (b) in fine-root biomass distributions among dominant trees and grasses at eight semi-arid savanna sites in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Sites were located on contrasting soil textures (clayey basaltic soils vs. sandy granitic soils) and paired along a gradient of mean annual rainfall. Soil texture predicted variation in mean water uptake depths and fine-root allocation. While grasses maintained roots close to the surface and consistently used shallow water, trees on sandy soils distributed roots more evenly across soil depths and used deeper soil water, resulting in greater divergence between tree and grass rooting on sandy soils. Mean annual rainfall predicted some variation among sites in tree water uptake depth, but had a weaker influence on fine-root allocation. Synthesis. Savanna trees overlapped more with shallow-rooted grasses on clayey soils and were more distinct in their use of deeper soil layers on sandy soils, consistent with expected differences in infiltration and percolation. These differences, which could allow trees to escape grass competition more effectively on sandy soils, may explain observed differences in tree densities and rates of woody encroachment with soil texture. Differences in the degree of root-niche separation could also drive heterogeneous responses of savanna vegetation to predicted shifts in the frequency and intensity of rainfall.

AB Digestive microbiota provide a wide range of beneficial effects on host physiology and are therefore likely to play a key role in marine intertidal bivalve ability to acclimatize to the intertidal zone. This study investigated the effect of intertidal levels on the digestive bacterial microbiota of oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and clams (Ruditapes philippinarum), two bivalves with different ecological niches. Based on 16S rRNA region sequencing, digestive glands, seawater and sediments harbored specific bacterial communities, dominated by operational taxonomic units assigned to the Mycoplasmatales, Desulfobacterales and Rhodobacterales orders, respectively. Field implantation modified digestive bacterial microbiota of both bivalve species according to their intertidal position. Rhodospirillales and Legionellales abundances increased in oysters and clams from the low intertidal level, respectively. After a 14-day depuration process, these effects were still observed, especially for clams, while digestive bacterial microbiota of oysters were subjected to more short-term environmental changes. Nevertheless, 3.5 months stay on an intertidal zone was enough to leave an environmental footprint on the digestive bacterial microbiota, suggesting the existence of autochthonous bivalve bacteria. When comparing clams from the three intertidal levels, 20% of the bacterial assemblage was shared among the levels and it was dominated by an operational taxonomic unit affiliated to the Mycoplasmataceae and Spirochaetaceae families.

AB Food-web investigations inform management strategies by exposing potential interactions between native and nonnative species and anticipating likely outcomes associated with species removal efforts. We leveraged a natural gradient of compositional turnover from native-only to nonnative-only fish assemblages, combined with an intensive removal effort, to investigate underlying food-web changes in response to invasive species expansion in a Lower Colorado River tributary. Nonnative fishes caused coordinated isotopic niche displacement in native fishes by inducing resource shifts toward lower trophic positions and enriched carbon sources. By contrast, nonnative fishes did not experience reciprocal shifts when native fishes were present. Asymmetrical outcomes between native and nonnative fishes indicated species displacement may result from competitive or consumptive interactions. Native species' isotopic niches returned to higher trophic levels after nonnative green sunfish (Lepomis cyaneilus) removal, indicating removal efforts can support trophic recovery of native fishes like desert suckers (Catostomus cluricii) and roundtail chub (Gila robusta). Using stable isotope analysis in preremoval assessments provides opportunities to identify asymmetric interactions, whereas postremoval assessments could identify unintended consequences, like mesopredator release, as part of adaptive decision linking to recover native fishes.

AB Fungal endophyte associations have been suggested as a possible strategy of Antarctic vascular plants for surviving the extreme environmental conditions of Antarctica. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are still poorly understood. The role of root fungal endophytes in nitrogen mineralization and nutrient uptake, as well as their impact on the performance of Antarctic plants, were studied. We tested root endophytes, isolated fromColobanthus quitensisandDeschampsia antarctica, for lignocellulolytic enzyme production, nitrogen mineralization, and growth enhancement of their host plants.Penicillium chrysogenumandPenicillium brevicompactumwere identified using a molecular approach as the main root endophytes inhabitingC. quitensisandD. antarctica, respectively. Both root endophytes were characterized as psychrophilic fungi displaying amylase, esterase, protease, cellulase, hemicellulase, phosphatase and urease enzymatic activities, mainly at 4 degrees C. Moreover, the rates and percentages of nitrogen mineralization, as well as the final total biomass, were significantly higher in symbioticC. quitensisandD. antarcticaindividuals. Our findings suggest that root endophytes exert a pivotal ecological role based not only to breakdown different nutrient sources but also on accelerating nitrogen mineralization, improving nutrient acquisition, and therefore promoting plant growth in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems.

AB Aim The General Dynamic Model (GDM) links island biogeographical processes to island geological history. A key premise of the GDM implies that environmental factors shaping the ecology and evolution of biota on oceanic islands follow a hump-shaped trend over the island's life span and drive dynamics in carrying capacity, species diversity and endemism. An important component of the GDM is environmental heterogeneity (EH), but its effects on insular diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we first quantified EH, tested whether EH follows the expected hump-shaped trend along island ontogeny and evaluated how EH relates to plant diversity. Location 135 oceanic islands of volcanic origin. Taxon Vascular plants. Methods We calculated 20 EH metrics focusing on topographic and climatic components of EH, and compared whole-island metrics (e.g. range) and moving-window metrics (e.g. roughness). Using linear mixed-effects models, we evaluated the trends of EH with island age and the EH-plant diversity relationship expected based on the GDM. Results Our analysis revealed some EH components to be collinear, for example, elevation and temperature heterogeneity but also that EH metrics capture different aspects of EH, for example, climatic gradients versus climatic complexity. EH generally followed a hump-shaped trend with island age, peaking early during island ontogeny. Among the EH components, climatic heterogeneity had the strongest effect on plant species richness and elevational heterogeneity on endemism. Lastly, including EH metrics in GDMs (traditionally, only island age and area were included) improved their predictive power. Main conclusions The EH metrics compared here captured various attributes of the environment that influence insular plant diversity. In line with the GDM, our results strongly support a hump-shaped relationship between EH and island age, suggesting that islands become highly heterogeneous early in their ontogeny. Finally, the contribution of EH to GDM-based models of species richness and endemism suggests that EH is a main driver of the diversity of oceanic island biotas.

AB In this review, the various models to estimate wildlife abundance are organized for promoting the correct application of them in animal ecology. If individuals of the target wildlife are distinguishable, the capture-recapture (CR) model and the spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) model can be applied to the closed population and the Jolly-Seber (JS) model can be applied to the open population. If not, the distance sampling, N-mixture model, random encounter (RE) model, random encounter and staying time (REST) model, and removal sampling can be applied to the closed population, and the harvest-based model can be applied to the open population. Recent advances in the hierarchical model and the integrated population model (IPM) make it possible to model the abundance and demographic rate of the wildlife by considering the ecological process of the target wildlife and observation process of them and to utilize the various but fragmented data. Then, the formalization of the abundance estimation model as a hierarchical model and the construction of the IPM by considering the available data and biological characteristics of the target species are useful for future research.

AB This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Quercus rubra L. (Red Oak, Northern Red Oak; syn. Q. borealis, Q. maxima) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution; habitat; communities; responses to biotic factors; responses to environment; structure and physiology; phenology; floral and seed characters; herbivores and disease; history; and conservation.
   Quercus rubra is a large deciduous tree native to eastern North America. In its native range this species is one of the most important mid-successional tree species. Since the 18th century Q. rubra has been introduced into forest management in Europe and elsewhere. Currently, Q. rubra is a naturalized species in 23 countries. It is an important source of wood, and this was one of the most important reasons for its introduction in forests. In forest management this species is valued for its high growth rate and drought resistance. Red Oak is also widely cultivated in Europe for its ornamental value-red leaves in autumn and smooth, grey bark.
   Red Oak is a threat to native species within its introduced range as it can alter environmental conditions beneath its canopy, especially by decreasing light availability and litter decomposition rate. Such conditions also contribute to biotic homogenization of the understorey vegetation. Q. rubra is widely dispersed by small mammals and birds, up to 1,500 m from seed sources, thereby increasing its potential invasiveness.
   In Europe Q. rubra seems to be less prone to herbivores and fungi, in contrast to its native range, where it is grazed by ungulates and insects, and infected by Phytophthora and oak wilt. Due to its higher tolerance to drought than native European oaks, Q. rubra is claimed to be one of the species replacing native trees which are decreasing due to climate warming. However, consideration of all possible consequences is needed in wide-scale introduction of alien species, such as Q. rubra, due to negative impacts on native ecosystems.

AB The spatial structure of agricultural landscapes can affect crop resilience to potential pest development. Previous studies have found several spatial landscape metrics related to the abundance of the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, and these were combined to elaborate a spatial resilience index. In this paper, this index was calculated for olive landscapes all over Spain, for four years spanning a 50-year temporal range (1956, 1984, 1998 and 2008), using a network of 64 16-km(2) plots representing olive landscapes within a bio-geo-climatic gradient. The resilience index was then modified adapting it through the weighting of spatial landscape metrics determined from the monitoring of this time-series analysis. The results showed that the values of spatial resilience of olive landscapes is predominantly low in southern Spain and medium in northeast and central Spain. The value of the index increased throughout the time-series considered, but not in the south. Expansion and concentration of olive groves, diversification of land uses, and fragmentation of landscapes have been the driving forces behind the evolution and current spatial structure of olive landscapes. The weighted resilience index constitutes a valuable tool for the socio-ecological planning of olive landscapes.

AB Fruit production in tropical forests varies considerably in space and time, with important implications for frugivorous consumers. Characterizing temporal variation in forest productivity is thus critical for understanding adaptations of tropical forest frugivores, yet long-term phenology data from the tropics, in particular from African forests, are still scarce. Similarly, as the abiotic factors driving phenology in the tropics are predicted to change with a warming climate, studies documenting the relationship between climatic variables and fruit production are increasingly important. Here, we present data from 19 years of monitoring the phenology of 20 tree species at Ngogo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Our aims were to characterize short- and long-term trends in productivity and to understand the abiotic factors driving temporal variability in fruit production. Short-term (month-to-month) variability in fruiting was relatively low at Ngogo, and overall fruit production increased significantly through the first half of the study. Among the abiotic variables, we expected to influence phenology patterns (including rainfall, solar irradiance, and average temperature), only average temperature was a significant predictor of monthly fruit production. We discuss these findings as they relate to the resource base of the frugivorous vertebrate community inhabiting Ngogo.

AB Understanding the abundance and distribution patterns of species at large spatial scales is one of the goals of biogeography and macroecology, as it helps researchers and authorities in designing conservation measures for endangered species. Orchids, one of the most endangered groups of plants, have a complicated system of pollination mechanisms. Their survival strongly depends on pollination success, which then determines their presence and distribution in space. Here we concentrate on how pollination mechanisms (presence/absence of nectar) are associated with orchid species density and mean niche breadth along an altitudinal gradient in six different phytogeographical regions in the Czech Republic. We found differences between these regions in terms of orchid species numbers and density. The trend (hump-shaped curve) in species density of nectarless and nectariferous orchids were very similar in all phytogeographical regions, peaking between 300-900m. The trend strongly depends on habitat cover and pollinator availability. In general, the most specialist species of orchids were found from low to middle altitudes. The association of altitude with the richness of orchid flora is much stronger than that with the biogeography. Climate change is a factor that should not be neglected, as it may affect the presence/absence of many species in the future.

AB Drought is often discussed as a major perturbation in savanna ecosystems, associated with lasting shifts in savanna structure and functioning. However, historically, droughts have occurred frequently in southern African savannas, suggesting that plants might benefit from being resilient to drought. Here, we evaluate whether the 2014-2016 drought was an extreme event in terms of effects on the herbaceous vegetation and specifically on grasses. We monitored herbaceous responses, pre-, during and post-drought in the Kruger National Park and compared responses with a previous extreme drought (1991-1992). Grass biomass decreased during both droughts, but recovered quickly once rains returned, regardless of whether areas burned in the years preceding drought. However, species functional composition was slower to recover, with shifts in dominance that closely matched grass photosynthetic machinery. Species drought tolerances were best predicted by their bundle sheath morphology: species characterised by XyMS- bundle sheaths (often associated with NADP-ME photosythesis) declined in abundance consistently during drought, whereas those characterised by XyMS+ bundle sheaths (associated with PEP-ck and NAD-ME photosynthesis) either increased or were unaffected by drought. The response of grass to drought, at least in terms of productivity and functional composition, is relatively predictable.

   COMMUNICATION; HIPPOS; CENSUS
AB Accurately estimating hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) numbers is difficult due to their aggressive nature, amphibious lifestyle, and habit of diving and surfacing. Traditionally, hippos are counted using aerial surveys and land/boat surveys. We compared estimates of numbers of hippos in a lagoon in the Okavango Delta, counted from land to counts from video taken from a DJI Phantom 4TM drone, testing for effectiveness at three heights (40 m, 80 m, and 120 m) and four times of day (early morning, late morning, early afternoon, and late afternoon). In addition, we determined effectiveness for differentiating age classes (juvenile, subadult, and adult), based on visual assessment and measurements from drone images, at different times and heights. Estimates in the pool averaged 9.18 (+/- 0.25SE, range 1-14, n = 112 counts). Drone counts at 40 m produced the highest counts of hippos, 10.6% higher than land counts and drone counts at 80 m, and 17.6% higher than drone counts at 120 m. Fewer hippos were counted in the early morning, when the hippos were active and most likely submerged, compared to all other times of day, when they tended to rest in shallow water with their bodies exposed. We were able to assign age classes to similar numbers of hippos from land counts and counts at 40 m, although land counts were better at identifying juveniles and subadults. Early morning was the least effective time to age hippos given their active behaviour, increasingly problematic with increasing height. Use of a relatively low-cost drone provided a rigorous and repeatable method for estimating numbers and ages of hippos, other than in the early morning, compared to land counts, considered the most accurate method of counting hippos.

AB Screening is a strategy for detecting undesirable change prior to manifestation of symptoms or adverse effects. Although the well-recognized utility of screening makes it commonplace in medicine, it has yet to be implemented in ecosystem management. Ecosystem management is in an era of diagnosis and treatment of undesirable change, and as a result, remains more reactive than proactive and unable to effectively deal with today's plethora of non-stationary conditions. In this paper, we introduce spatial imaging-based screening to ecology. We link advancements in spatial resilience theory, data, and technological and computational capabilities and power to detect regime shifts (i.e., vegetation state transitions) that are known to be detrimental to human well-being and ecosystem service delivery. With a state-of-the-art landcover dataset and freely available, cloud-based, geospatial computing platform, we screen for spatial signals of the three most iconic vegetation transitions studied in western USA rangelands: (1) erosion and desertification; (2) woody encroachment; and (3) annual exotic grass invasion. For a series of locations that differ in ecological complexity and geographic extent, we answer the following questions: (1) Which regime shift is expected or of greatest concern? (2) Can we detect a signal associated with the expected regime shift? (3) If detected, is the signal transient or persistent over time? (4) If detected and persistent, is the transition signal stationary or non-stationary over time? (5) What other signals do we detect? Our approach reveals a powerful and flexible methodology, whereby professionals can use spatial imaging to verify the occurrence of alternative vegetation regimes, image the spatial boundaries separating regimes, track the magnitude and direction of regime shift signals, differentiate persistent and stationary transition signals that warrant continued screening from more concerning persistent and non-stationary transition signals, and leverage disciplinary strength and resources for more targeted diagnostic testing (e.g., inventory and monitoring) and treatment (e.g., management) of regime shifts. While the rapid screening approach used here can continue to be implemented and refined for rangelands, it has broader implications and can be adapted to other ecological systems to revolutionize the information space needed to better manage critical transitions in nature.

AB Despite the grave threat illegal wildlife trade poses to species survival, few studies have attempted to link supply and demand data for the same wildlife product. All ca. 29,000 orchid species are listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and many are protected under domestic legislation too, but a growing body of evidence suggests that orchids continue to be subject to unsustainable harvesting and undocumented trade. South China is a known black spot for trade in wild-collected ornamental orchids but understanding of the drivers determining the flow of species diversity, volume and value remains wanting. We conducted systematic monthly surveys at five markets along a West-East transect from Yunnan to Hong Kong for one year, recording variables including species, numbers of individuals, weight and price. Although wild orchid diversity is highest in Yunnan, the diversity of orchids in trade increased eastwards and mean price per stem rose more than four-fold, albeit always significantly cheaper than that for artificially produced hybrids. Part of this trade appears to be in breach of CITES. Few orchids in trade conformed to six criteria highlighted in prior demand-side studies as being of higher utility value, but most conformed to a combination of four or more, suggesting that vendors can readily offer products that meet a majority of consumer preferences. Effective supply-side regulation, through government intervention and social media campaigns, is needed to facilitate behavioural change and allow artificially propagated plants to compete in the market-place.

AB Crucian carp (Carassius carassius) is a key fish species in most Chinese subtropical and tropical shallow lakes. Through sediment feeding, crucian carp could greatly change water turbidity and nutrient levels, as well as the abundance of herbivorous consumers, which may have important influences on seston element stoichiometry. However, so far, experimental studies on this topic are lacking. We conducted a 36-day mesocosm experiment to explore the effects of crucian carp on water physicochemical and biological properties, and C/N/P ratios in suspended particulate matter (SPM) under eutrophic conditions. Our results provided three major findings: (1) Crucian carp resuspended sediments and along with them, reduced light penetration and lower light/total phosphorus (TP) ratios. (2) Crucian carp reduced biomasses of both zooplankton and macrozoobenthos, whereas their effect on phytoplankton was weak, potentially because of resuspension-induced light limitation. (3) Both C/P and N/P ratios in SPM were significant lower in mesocosms with crucian carp than in fish-free controls, which may be attributed to the high contribution of P-rich sediments and low light to nutrient supply caused by fish-induced resuspension. Our results suggest that besides planktivorous fish, benthivore (e.g., crucian carp) in warm shallow waters could also affect pelagic C/N/P stoichiometry via sediment feeding, which may further influence energy transfer efficiency in lake food chain.

AB Evidence-based policy guidance necessary for addressing mixed outcomes of community-based rangeland management (CBRM) is limited, dominated by case studies, and lacking coverage of diverse ecological settings. In remedy, we studied 65 traditional neighborhoods and 77 formally-organized CBRM groups across four ecological zones and investigated how and when CBRM obtains greater social outcomes than non-CBRM neighborhoods. We measured pastoralists' social capital, rangeland management practices, and behavior using a mixed-methods approach including qualitative interviews, focus groups, and quantitative questionnaires of 706 herder households. We applied a conditional process analysis method, novel to CBRM studies, to investigate potential mechanisms by which CBRM affects social outcomes.
   CBRM members used significantly more information sources, had stronger leadership, more opportunities for knowledge exchange, and rules for resource use, which were significantly associated with greater social outcomes including the use of traditional and innovative rangeland and herd management practices, proactive behavior, and social networking. Access to diverse information sources emerged as an important variable related to strong local leadership, knowledge exchange, and setting rules for rangeland use. Ecological context had a strong association with the level of CBRM social outcomes achieved through this process. The statistical effect of CBRM, mediated by information, leadership, knowledge exchange, and rules, was significantly greater on proactive behaviors of desert steppe herders compared to herders in non-desert steppe zones. Further, CBRM mediated by the same four variables, was associated with higher social networking among herders in the mountain and forest steppe, steppe, and desert steppe but not in the eastern steppe. Our findings suggest why CBRM outcomes have been mixed in Mongolia and elsewhere, and point to the importance of accounting for local context in facilitating development of pastoral institutions. Policies to support CBRM should consider prioritizing resource users' access to diverse information, leadership development, and involvement in elaborating community rules for resource management and local forums for information exchange.

AB Increasing evidence has revealed a close association between intestinal bacterial community and hosts health. However, it is unclear whether and what extend Baimang disease alters the intestinal microbiota in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain). Here, we conducted intestinal contents Illumina sequencing of healthy and Baimang diseased mud crab (S. paramamosain) to understand bacterial community variations among health status. In addition, bacterial functional predication was used to investigate whether and how the bacteria variations further change their functions? The phyla of Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Tenericutes, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetae constituted over 96.44% of the total intestinal bacteria, with being the dominant taxa. The 7 most significantly different orders, including the increased four orders of Clostridiales, Entomoplasmatales, Bacteroidales, and Mycoplasmatales and the decreased three orders of Vibrionales, Campylobacterales, and Fusobacteriales, accounted for 61.14% dissimilarity, probably being the indicator taxa of Baimang disease. Accordingly, 12 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes orthologies in level 3 shifted significantly at the diseased crabs. Especially, bacterial secretion system, secretion system, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis proteins and Vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle, being related to bacterial virulence, were reduced. In addition, the reduced butanoate metabolism, and induced methane metabolism and one carbon pool by folate were important metabolic processes of probiotic, such as Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp., with playing critical roles in host health. This study suggests that Baimang disease coupled altered the intestinal bacterial communities and functions, providing timely information for further analysis the influencing mechanism of Baimang disease in mud crab (S. paramamosain).

AB Premise of the Study Methods In animal-dispersed plants, seed dispersal patterns of the same species in the same habitat can greatly differ among individuals and temporally. Many studies have revealed the pervasive effects of spatial variation in fruit abundance on seed dispersal of individual plants. By contrast, very few studies have investigated the temporal variation in seed dispersal. We investigated the effects of conspecific and community-level fruit abundance on fruit removal rate and seed dispersal distance of six bird-dispersed woody species in a Japanese temperate forest for 3 yr. The six species share similar fruit characteristics but have different fruiting seasons. In addition, we also considered the effects of bird seasonality in diet and species composition on seed dispersal. Key Results Conclusions Inter-annual and inter-seasonal variation in community-level fruit abundance determined both fruit removal and the seed dispersal distance across species, but the effect differed with seasonal changes in bird behavior. Abundant fruit satiated fruit removal by birds only during fruit-feeding periods, not during insect-feeding periods. A scarcity of fruit increased the dispersal distance, but only during the migratory period. This difference was probably due to the different foraging behaviors of passing migrants and territorial birds. Our results illustrated that temporal variation in community-level fruit abundance could be a determining factor for seed dispersal in temperate forests. The effects of temporal variations in fruit abundance on seed dispersal patterns should be investigated in other ecosystems in order to understand their importance and associations with frugivore phenology.

AB 1. The quest for understanding the maintenance of species diversity has matured in recent decades under the umbrella of species coexistence theory, founded by Chesson (2000). The central conclusion of the theory is that coexistence at local scales depends on two opposing forces: average fitness differences between species, which drive the best-adapted species to exclude others, and stabilizing mechanisms, which promote diversity via niche differentiation.
   2. Recent theoretical work has focussed on how interactions between plants and other organisms influence the equalizing and stabilizing forces. However, there is a lack of empirical information. Therefore, the next fundamental step is to assess the prevalence of these mechanisms for controlling plant coexistence across a wide range of interactions and systems.
   3. To that end, this special feature presents 10 theoretical, observational, or manipulative studies illustrating 9 different biotic interactions including mutualisms (pollinators, seed dispersers, soil microbes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and antagonisms (leaf and seed herbivores, and leaf and root pathogens). All studies share a common question: how biotic interactions regulate plant coexistence?
   4. Comparisons across studies suggest that biotic interactions modify both stabilizing and average fitness differences. In those cases where biotic interactions promote stable coexistence between plant species, both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions act more frequently as an equalizing rather than as a stabilizing mechanisms.
   5. Besides these generalities, the studies of this special issue also present novel theoretical and empirical approaches to better understand the maintenance of species diversity over a wide variety of systems, environmental conditions, and organisms.
   6. Synthesis. The studies presented here constitutes a solid base to empirically explore how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions act upon the determinants of plant species competition, and open novel paths for future research. Collectively, these advances will serve to pave the road for a better theoretical and empirical understanding of how biotic interactions control biodiversity.

AB Connectivity is an important property of landscapes that shapes populations and ecosystem functioning. We do not know, however, whether and how different types of spatial linkages combine to influence ecological functions, and this hampers their integration into conservation planning.
   We used coral reef seascapes in eastern Australia as a model system to test whether the proximity of other reefs (habitat proximity) or the proximity of other habitats (seascape proximity) exert stronger effects on two key ecological functions (herbivory and piscivory).
   We measured rates of herbivory (on fleshy macroalgae) and piscivory (on prey fish) on reefs that differed in their proximity to both other reefs and nearby mangroves and seagrass.
   The extent of habitat proximity between reefs significantly influenced both ecological functions, but in different ways: isolated reefs supported high herbivory but low piscivory, whilst, conversely, reefs that were closer to other reefs supported high piscivory but low herbivory. This was not caused by herbivores avoiding their predators, as the dominant piscivores (small predatory snappers) were too small to consume the dominant herbivores (large rabbitfishes). Seascape proximity (e.g., distance to mangroves or seagrass) was less important in shaping ecological functions on reefs in this system.
   We suggest that the effects of seascape configuration on ecological functions depends on the type of spatial linkage, and the ecological functions in question. To better integrate connectivity into conservation, we must develop a deeper understanding of how different spatial linkages combine to shape ecosystem functioning across landscapes.

AB Wildlife populations in semi-arid regions require unrestricted mobility along ecological gradients and across large landscapes to enable adaptive responses to seasonal variability and patchy resources. In the Kalahari region of Botswana, herbivore populations historically depended on seasonal access to the nutrient-rich Schwelle area in the wet season and to water from the Boteti River during drought periods. Blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) have lost access to these key habitats due to fences and encroachment of livestock and humans. We deployed satellite collars onto 10 female wildebeest in the CKGR to examine seasonal movements and habitat selection in relation to the environmental conditions and fragmented ecosystem. Wildebeest favoured open, short-grass pan habitats in all seasons, probably in response to better forage quality and lower predation risk. The ability to remain in pan habitats during the dry season was a result of artificial water provision. A wildebeest herd that had no artificial water in its home range survived the dry season, whereas those wildebeest that were accustomed to water provision died when their water points failed in the dry season. Thus, water provision altered adaptive behaviour and reduced resilience of the population to the arid environment.

AB Colonization is a key component of community assembly because it continuously contributes new species that can potentially establish and adds individuals to established populations in local communities. Colonization is determined by the regional species pool, which is typically viewed as stable at ecological time scales. Yet, many natural communities including plants, birds and microbes, are exposed to several distinct and dynamic sources of colonists and how multiple colonist pools interact to shape local communities remains unclear. Using a 16S rRNA amplicon survey, we profiled bacteria within surface, subsurface and burrow sediments and assessed their role as colonist pools for fiddler crab-associated bacteria. We found significant differences in composition among sediment types, driven by halophilic taxa in the surface, and different Desulfobacteraceae taxa in the subsurface and burrow. Bacteria from burrow sediment colonized the crab carapace whereas gut bacterial communities were colonized by burrow and surface sediment bacteria. Despite distinct colonist pools influencing gut bacteria, variation in composition across gut samples did not lead to significant clusters. In contrast, carapace bacterial communities clustered in six distinct groups loosely associated with crab species. Our findings suggest that multiple colonist pools can influence local communities but factors explaining variation in community composition depend on local habitats. Recognizing multiple colonist pools expands our understanding of the interaction between regional and local processes driving community structure and diversity.

AB Density dependence is of fundamental importance for population and range dynamics. Density-dependent reproduction of plants arises from competitive and facilitative plant-plant interactions that can be pollination independent or pollination mediated. In small and sparse populations, conspecific density dependence often turns from negative to positive and causes Allee effects. Reproduction may also increase with heterospecific density (community-level Allee effect), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and the consequences for community dynamics can be complex. Allee effects have crucial consequences for the conservation of declining species, but also the dynamics of range edge populations. In invasive species, Allee effects may slow or stop range expansion.
   Observational studies in natural plant communities cannot distinguish whether reproduction is limited by pollination-mediated interactions among plants or by other neighbourhood effects (e.g. competition for abiotic resources). Even experimental pollen supply cannot distinguish whether variation in reproduction is caused by direct density effects or by plant traits correlated with density. Finally, it is unknown over which spatial scales pollination-mediated interactions occur.
   To circumvent these problems, we introduce a comprehensive experimental and analytical framework which simultaneously (1) manipulates pollen availability and quality by hand pollination and pollinator exclusion, (2) manipulates neighbourhoods by transplanting target plants, and (3) analyses the effects of con- and heterospecific neighbourhoods on reproduction with spatially explicit trait-based neighbourhood models.
   Applying this framework to Senecio inaequidens, one of Europe's fastest plant invaders, we found that the seed set was strongly pollen limited. Reproduction had increased by pollinator-mediated facilitation by both con- and heterospecific neighbours which may lead to (community-level) Allee effects. Pollination-independent interactions, such as amelioration of abiotic conditions through neighbours, contributed to additional positive neighbour effects. However, these pollination-independent interactions were weaker than the pollination-mediated interactions and they occurred over smaller spatial scales. Finally, the strength and direction of neighbourhood effects depended on neighbour traits and thus changed with the trait composition of the neighbourhood.
   Synthesis. By manipulating both pollen availability and target plant locations within neighbourhoods, we can comprehensively analyse spatially explicit density dependence of plant reproduction. This experimental approach enhances our ability to understand the dynamics of sparse populations and of species geographical ranges.

AB We have studied the diversity of bryophytes in planted Polish post-agricultural forests dominated by the native Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and the alien (North American) red oak Quercus rubra. The planted sites would be suitable for a mesic coniferous forest (abbreviation: CFS) or mesic broadleaved forest (abbreviation: BFS). We analysed the structure and composition of the bryophyte assemblages in relation to forest site and substrate availability. Special attention was paid to the introduced Q. rubra as a host species for native bryophytes. A total of 54 bryophyte species (9 liverworts and 45 mosses) were found in the 90 plots ( = phytosociological releves, 10 x 10 m in area; 45 at each forest site) studied. DCA analysis showed that the bryophyte assemblages of the P. sylvestris-Q. rubra secondary forest community differed significantly between CFS and BFS sites; the similarity of the composition of bryophyte species was 36.8%. The substrate preferences (epigeic, epixylic, epiphytic), as well as the growth form and life form of the recorded bryophytes, also differed between CFS and BFS, while the proportion of bryophytes that had a particular life strategy was very similar. The introduced Q. rubra was inhabited by 28 bryophyte species, including two liverworts. This tree hosted 64% of the CFS and 47% of BFS bryophyte flora and as a host for epiphytes the species successfully fulfilled the functional role of the native oaks (Q. robur and Q. petraea). Thus, the introduction of Q. rubra may contribute to the restoration of post-agricultural forests and to the conservation of epiphytic bryophyte species. On the other hand, the negative impact of Q. rubra observed on the ground flora (including bryophytes) puts the benefits of Q. rubra for the conservation of native biodiversity in general in question.

AB 1. Meta-analyses of disparate studies suggest that size and age of a ' no-take' area (marine sanctuary) can influence its ecological response to protection. Few studies, however, have been designed explicitly to test how these factors influence the abundance trajectories of key species within sanctuaries.
   2. Diver surveys on reef habitat were conducted within a subtropical marine park in eastern Australia, to test for differences in abundances of targeted fishes between sanctuaries differing in size and age and compared with fished zones. Four management zones were sampled: (i) small sanctuaries established 1991 (< 15 ha of reef and < 200m wide); (ii) large sanctuaries established 2002 (> 100 ha of reef and> 500m wide); (iii) zones which allowed recreational fishing but not commercial fish trapping (> 200 ha of reef); and (iv) zones which allowed both recreational fishing and commercial fish trapping (> 200 ha of reef). Multiple sites in each management zone were sampled for selected taxa eight times during the austral winter from 2002 to 2012.
   3. Many of the targeted taxa examined were more abundant in large sanctuary sites within a few years of the establishment of protection compared with the small sanctuary sites and the fished sites. Red morwong Cheilodactylus fuscus increased in large sanctuaries but were more abundant in the older smaller sanctuaries throughout the study. Similar increases were not observed in fished zones. There was considerable variability among years not associated with management type, including a peak in abundance for several species in 2005 and reduced abundance of many taxa following a destructive storm in 2009.
   4. This study provides strong empirical evidence that size and age of 'no take' areas are important for fish, and indicates that larger sanctuaries can rapidly reach levels of fish abundance similar to smaller older sanctuaries. (C) 2015 Commonwealth of Australia.

AB Fiddler crabs (Brachyura, Ocypodidae), like many other marine organisms, disperse via planktonic larvae. A lengthy pelagic larval duration is generally assumed to result in genetic connectivity even among distant populations. However, major river outflows, such as of the Amazon or Orinoco, or strong currents may act as phylogeographic barriers to ongoing gene flow. For example, the Mona Passage, located between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, has been postulated to impair larval exchange of several species. In this study, Cox1 mtDNA data was used to analyze population genetic structure of two fiddler crab species from the western Atlantic, comparing the continental coastline and Caribbean islands. The results indicate genetic homogeneity in Minuca rapax among Atlantic (continental) populations (Suriname, Brazil), whereas Caribbean populations show significantly restricted gene flow among the constituent islands and towards continental populations. Our data support the hypothesis of the Mona Passage hindering larval exchange. Contrastingly, Caribbean Leptuca leptodactyla populations appear to be devoid of detectable variation, while Atlantic-continental (i.e. Brazilian) populations show much higher haplotype and nucleotide diversities and display slight genetic differentiation among populations within the Atlantic region, though not statistically significant. Both species show a pronounced divergence between regions, supporting the presence of a phylogeographic barrier.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Land-use change is cited as a primary driver of global biodiversity loss, with myriad consequences for species, populations, and ecosystems. However, few studies have examined its impact on species interactions, particularly pollination. Furthermore, when the effects of land-use change on pollination have been studied, the focus has largely been on species pollinated by diurnal pollinators, namely, bees and butterflies. Here, we focus on Oenothera harringtonii, a night-flowering, disturbance-adapted species that has experienced a range-wide gradient of land-use change. We tested the hypothesis that the negative impacts of land-use change are mitigated by long-distance pollination.
   METHODS: Our study included both temporal (4yr) and spatial (19 populations range-wide, and 1,2, and 5 km from the population center) data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of land-use change on pollination biology and reproduction.
   KEY RESULTS: We first confirmed that O. harringtonii is self-incompatible and reliant on pollinators for reproduction. We then showed that hawkmoths (primarily Hyles lineata) are highly reliable and effective pollinators in both space and time. Unlike other studies, we did not detect an effect of population size, increased isolation, or a reduction in suitable habitat in areas with evidence of land-use change on pollination ( visitation, pollen removal and deposition). Furthermore, the proportion of suitable habitat and other fragmentation metrics examined were not associated with population size or density in this plant species.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that nocturnal pollination of Oenothera harringtonii via hawkmoths is robust to the negative impacts of land-use change.

AB Ecological studies have frequently stressed that the availability of seeds in the soil is important for the recovery of semi-arid rangelands. However, the crucial role of soil seed banks has not been incorporated into rangeland models to understand vegetation states and transitions in semi-arid rangelands. We developed and evaluated a novel model to show that the availability of seeds in the soil seed banks as a function of plant cover can trigger transitions from perennial to annual grasses and from annual grasses to bare soil with increasing grazing pressure. The model indicates that when grazing pressure is low, a high cover of perennial grasses and a large soil seed bank of these grasses may be present, whereas annual grasses with their seeds in the soil appear with increasing grazing. When grazing pressure further increases, vegetation cover and the soil seed bank size decline. We found that the positive feedback between plant cover and the size of the soil seed bank depends on seed traits, i.e., longevity and germination rate. This positive feedback is an alternative explanation for a sudden vegetation changes in rangelands, which are often explained by the positive feedback between plant cover and the infiltration rate of rain into the soil. In contrast to this latter positive feedback, our model can explain shifts in vegetation from perennials to annuals and vice versa on different soil types, which are often seen in semi-arid rangelands. Our model contributes therefore to the understanding of vegetation dynamics for the proper management and possible restoration of degraded semi-arid rangelands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB An understanding of the habitat selection patterns by wild herbivores is critical for adaptive management, particularly towards ecosystem management and wildlife conservation in semi arid savanna ecosystems. We tested the following predictions: (i) surface water availability, habitat quality and human presence have a strong influence on the spatial distribution of wild herbivores in the dry season, (ii) habitat suitability for large herbivores would be higher compared to medium-sized herbivores in the dry season, and (iii) spatial extent of suitable habitats for wild herbivores will be different between years, i.e., 2006 and 2010, in Matetsi Safari Area, Zimbabwe. MaxEnt modeling was done to determine the habitat suitability of large herbivores and medium-sized herbivores. MaxEnt modeling of habitat suitability for large herbivores using the environmental variables was successful for the selected species in 2006 and 2010, except for elephant (Loxodonta africana) for the year 2010. Overall, large herbivores probability of occurrence was mostly influenced by distance from rivers. Distance from roads influenced much of the variability in the probability of occurrence of medium-sized herbivores. The overall predicted area for large and mediumsized herbivores was not different. Large herbivores may not necessarily utilize larger habitat patches over medium-sized herbivores due to the habitat homogenizing effect of water provisioning. Effect of surface water availability, proximity to riverine ecosystems and roads on habitat suitability of large and medium-sized herbivores in the dry season was highly variable thus could change from one year to another. We recommend adaptive management initiatives aimed at ensuring dynamic water supply in protected areas through temporal closure and or opening of water points to promote heterogeneity of wildlife habitats.

AB To trace the pathway of tetrodotoxin (TTX) producing microorganism in the Atlantic coast of Portugal, culture-dependent evaluation of the bacterial isolates from the viscera of the gastropods Monodonta lineata, Gibbula umbilicalis, Nucella lapillus and Patella intermedia, and from the environmental samples (biofilm and surrounding sea water) was carried out. Samples were collected from eight different coastal locations of Northern Portugal. A total of 311 isolates were identified. The observed bacterial diversity was distributed over five different classes (Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria) with the greatest number of 16S rRNA gene sequence derived from the Gammaproteobacteria (75%). Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene showed that bacterial isolates were highly diverse and most of which were found in other marine environment. Among the different species isolated, Vibrio was found abundant. Eventhough TTX was not detected (UPLC-MS/MS) in the isolates from this study, PCR screening identified some natural product biosynthesis genes (PKS and NRPS) involved in its assembly. Further PCR screening of the TTX producing two ATCC Vibrio sp. reveals that NRPS might be involved in the biosynthesis of TTX through the incorporation of arginine. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Large carnivores are decreasing in number due to growing pressure from an expanding human population. It is increasingly recognised that state-protected conservation areas are unlikely to be sufficient to protect viable populations of large carnivores, and that private land will be central to conservation efforts. In 2000, a fast-track land reform programme (FTLRP) was initiated in Zimbabwe, ostensibly to redress the racial imbalance in land ownership, but which also had the potential to break up large areas of carnivore habitat on private land. To date, research has focused on the impact of the FTLRP process on the different human communities, while impacts on wildlife have been overlooked. Here we provide the first systematic assessment of the impact of the FTLRP on the status of large carnivores. Spoor counts were conducted across private, resettled and communal land use types in order to estimate the abundance of large carnivores, and to determine how this had been affected by land reform. The density of carnivore spoor differed significantly between land use types, and was lower on resettlement land than on private land, suggesting that the resettlement process has resulted in a substantial decline in carnivore abundance. Habitat loss and high levels of poaching in and around resettlement areas are the most likely causes. The FTLRP resulted in the large-scale conversion of land that was used sustainably and productively for wildlife into unsustainable, unproductive agricultural land uses. We recommended that models of land reform should consider the type of land available, that existing expertise in land management should be retained where possible, and that resettlement programmes should be carefully planned in order to minimise the impacts on wildlife and on people.

AB Temperate reefs are superb tractable systems for testing hypotheses in ecology and evolutionary biology. Accordingly there is a rich history of research stretching back over 100 years, which has made major contributions to general ecological and evolutionary theory as well as providing better understanding of how littoral systems work by linking pattern with process. A brief resume of the history of temperate reef ecology is provided to celebrate this rich heritage. As a community, temperate reef ecologists generally do well designed experiments and test well formulated hypotheses. Increasingly large datasets are being collected, collated and subjected to complex meta-analyses and used for modelling. These datasets do not happen spontaneously - the burgeoning subject of macroecology is possible only because of the efforts of dedicated natural historians whether it be observing birds, butterflies, or barnacles. High-quality natural history and old-fashioned field craft enable surveys or experiments to be stratified (i.e. replicates are replicates and not a random bit of rock) and lead to the generation of more insightful hypotheses. Modern molecular approaches have led to the discovery of cryptic species and provided phylogeographical insights, but natural history is still required to identify species in the field. We advocate a blend of modern approaches with old school skills and a fondness for temperate reefs in all their splendour.

AB Ecological models to explain savanna heterogeneity and functioning weakly represent herbaceous forbs, which inevitably created knowledge gaps regarding the diversity and ecology of forbs. Forbs constitute over 70% of semi-arid savanna species richness. The aim of this study was therefore to (i) identify forb species that potentially form part of herbivore diet, and (ii) determine forb browsing intensity across a granitic savanna catenal sequence. Localized contrasts between nutrient-poor dystrophic uplands and nutrient-rich eutrophic bottomlands led us to predict that bottomlands would host forb assemblages dominated by browsed species. Forbs contributed to 78% of the total herbaceous layer species richness, of which 43% were browsed at varying intensities along the catenal sequence. Each topographic zone hosted a unique assemblage of browsed forbs, although browsing intensity was highest in the sodic bottomlands. Some browsed forbs formed prostrate, stoloniferous covers on the bottomlands, creating a lawn type dominated by forbs. Results presented here are the first to identify browsed forb species and to illustrate the turnover in browsing intensity of forbs across a semi-arid savanna catenal sequence. Our results add weight to the need to include herbaceous forbs in savanna management models to better understand savanna resource ecology and heterogeneity. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We used a very large dataset (>40% of all species) from the endemic-rich Cape Floristic Region (CFR) to explore the impact of different weighting techniques, coefficients to calculate similarity among the cells, and clustering approaches on biogeographical regionalisation. The results were used to revise the biogeographical subdivision of the CFR. We show that weighted data (down-weighting widespread species), similarity calculated using Kulczinsky's second measure, and clustering using UPGMA resulted in the optimal classification. This maximized the number of endemic species, the number of centres recognized, and operational geographic units assigned to centres of endemism (CoEs). We developed a dendrogram branch order cut-off (BOC) method to locate the optimal cut-off points on the dendrogram to define candidate clusters. Kulczinsky's second measure dendrograms were combined using consensus, identifying areas of conflict which could be due to biotic element overlap or transitional areas. Post-clustering GIS manipulation substantially enhanced the endemic composition and geographic size of candidate CoEs. Although there was broad spatial congruence with previous phytogeographic studies, our techniques allowed for the recovery of additional phytogeographic detail not previously described for the CFR.

AB As eucalyptus cultivation increases in the southeastern United States to provide feedstock for pulpwood, landscape mulch and an emerging bioenergy market, there is concern regarding potential invasiveness. Recently, models to predict the likelihood of invasiveness have produced conflicting results. Our uncertainty about invasion risk and the relative values we hold for environmental and industry protection will influence which management options and policies are pursued. Here we synthesize the essential practices and barriers to potential eucalyptus spread relative to different stages of the invasion process. Additionally, we offer a discussion of social and economic implications of the possible policies and regulatory techniques for mitigating future problems, with an emphasis on the often-recommended precautionary approach. We highlight future research needs and emphasize a landscape level, collaborative adaptive management approach.

AB Our current understanding regarding the functioning of the savanna ecosystem describes savannas as either competition- or disturbance-dependent. Within this generalized view, the role and importance of facilitation have been mostly neglected. This study presents a mathematical model of savannas with coupled soil moisture-vegetation dynamics, which includes interspecific competition and environmental disturbance. We find that there exist environmental and climatic conditions where grass facilitation toward trees plays an important role in supporting tree cover and by extension preserving the savanna biome. We, therefore, argue that our theoretical results in combination with the first empirical studies on the subject should stimulate further research into the role of facilitation in the savanna ecosystem, particularly when analyzing the impact of past and projected climatic changes on it.

AB Vegetative and reproductive phenological events of Manilkara hexandra (Roxb.) Dubard. were studied in a tropical semi-deciduous forest at Bundala National Park, Sri Lanka, in relation to climatic factors. Twenty one individuals of M. hexandra were observed for phenological studies for four years at fortnightly intervals. M. hexandra is a leaf-exchanging species which shows synchronous phenological events. Rainfall played a key role in major leafing events. However, leaf shedding also took place in the middle of the major rainy season (late November-December). Flower buds initiated immediately after leaf shedding and leaf bud breaking but blooming took place towards the end of the major rainy season. High soil moisture and relative humidity due to heavy rainfall, low air and soil temperatures, low wind velocity and low solar radiation levels provided optimal external environmental conditions for flowering. However, triggering of flowering took place due to the sudden drop of solar radiation and subsequent drop in air and soil temperatures which was maintained for more than 36 hours. Abortion of flowers and young fruits occurred due to sudden climatic variations such as drought or heavy rains. In the absence of such adverse environmental conditions, a large number of fruits may be produced, resulting in a mass fruiting event.

AB Marine reserves are commonly used to conserve living resources, but their effectiveness where policing is difficult is unclear. We compared monthly population density and size structure data collected over 20 months for two rarely and two commonly exploited intertidal limpets inside and outside reserves in South Africa. Densities were greater inside reserves, but significantly so in very few months. Unexpectedly, no significant reserve effect was detected for the territorial Scutellastra longicosta, shown by surveys to be favoured by harvesters. Reserve effects for the rarely exploited S. granularis probably result from indirect effects of higher barnacle cover in reserves where trampling is reduced, while interviews indicated that Cellana capensis is not targeted but large individuals are sometimes misidentified and hence are harvested outside the reserve. There were few reserve effects on mean or mean maximum size. The results indicate a gradient of exploitation among species and sites. One non-reserve site was more heavily exploited than the other, while one reserve experienced more poaching than the other. The effectiveness of marine reserves thus differed between reserves and among species. Exploited limpets were generally larger and at higher densities in reserves, but these effects were rarely statistically significant, indicating that reserve effects are weak compared to natural variability, probably reflecting ineffective policing.

AB This work analyzes bacterial diversity of sediments transiting through the gut of Holothuria scabra which is an important bioturbator in tropical shallow waters. This edible holothurian species has a social and economic importance for coastal populations in many developing countries. Bacterial biodiversity was analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA of bacterial cultures and clones. DAPI and FISH methods were used to determine and compare the number of bacteria found in the various gut compartments. A total of 116 phylotypes belonging to the gamma-Proteobacteria (60.5 %), alpha-Proteobacteria (24.5 %), Bacteroidetes (6 %), Actinobacteria (2.75 %), Fusobacteria (1.75 %), Firmicutes (1.75 %), Cyanobacteria (1.75 %) and delta-Proteobacteria (1 %) were identified. The number of bacteria is significantly greater (1.5x) in the foregut than in the ambient sediments. The number of bacteria significantly decreases in the midgut and remains stable until defecation. Some gamma-Proteobacteria, especially Vibrio, are less affected by digestion than other bacterial taxa. The season has an impact on the bacterial diversity found in the sediments transiting through the gut: in the dry season, gamma-Proteobacteria are the most abundant taxon, while alpha-Proteobacteria dominate in the rainy season. Vibrio is the most frequent genus with some well-known opportunistic pathogens like V. harveyi, V. alginolyticus and V. proteolyticus. Findings show that sediment-associated microbial communities are significantly modified by H. scabra during their transit through the gut which supports the view that holothurians play a substantial role in the structuring of bacterial communities at the sediment-seawater interface.

AB The effect of coastal upwelling on the recruitment and connectivity of coastal marine populations has rarely been characterized to a level of detail to be included into sound fishery management strategies. The gooseneck barnacle (Pollicipes pollicipes) fishery at the Cantabrian Coast (Northern Spain) is located at the fringes of the NW Spanish Upwelling system. This fishery is being co-managed through a fine-scale, interspersed set of protected rocks where each rock receives a distinct level of protection. Such interspersion is potentially beneficial, but the extent to which such spacing is consistent with mean larval dispersal distances is as yet unknown. We have simulated the spread of gooseneck barnacle larvae in the Central Cantabrian Coast using a high-resolution time-series of current profiles measured at a nearshore location. During a year of high upwelling activity (2009), theoretical recruitment success was 94% with peak recruitment predicted 56 km west of the emission point. However, for a year of low upwelling activity (2011) theoretical recruitment success dropped to 15.4% and peak recruitment was expected 13 km east of the emission point. This is consistent with a positive correlation between catch rates and the Integrated Upwelling Index, using a 4-year lag to allow recruits to reach commercial size. Furthermore, a net long-term westward larval transport was estimated by means of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences for five populations in the Cantabrian Sea. Our results call into question the role of long distance dispersal, driven by the mesoscale processes in the area, in gooseneck barnacle populations and point to the prevalent role of small-scale, asymmetric connectivity more consistent with the typical scale of the co-management process in this fishery.

AB Species occurrence depends on both environmental and biotic factors (species interactions). Consideration of species interactions when estimating functions of population distribution is unusual, and may be crucial to understand and predict how species use space and resources. In this study, we combine resource selection probability functions (RSPFs) with a model selection approach based on information theory to evaluate how biotic (interspecific interactions) and abiotic (environmental) factors affect resource selection of guanacos Lama guanicoe and livestock (goats, sheep, cattle and horses) in two seasonal periods. We first test different a priori hypotheses of the environmental effects on guanacos and livestock occurrence (i.e. foraging, predation/topography and human effect hypotheses), then we assess model performance with independent data, and finally we use validated models of each species as predictors of the interaction between them. In all seasons, L.guanicoe occurrence was influenced by both environment and livestock interactions, especially small livestock (goats and sheep). Guanacos selected for habitats characterized by high temporal variability in plant productivity and away from potential human contact. In all seasons, L.guanicoe was negatively related to the RSPF of small livestock, but the reverse was not the case, suggesting that L.guanicoe avoids sites used by goats and sheep. In contrast, livestock was mainly affected by environmental variables related to human presence and was not affected by the interactions with herbivores. Contrary to our predictions, goats and sheep were also associated with less productive sites, probably indicating strong degradation of the sites to which they are restricted. Our results suggest a spatial segregation between L.guanicoe and domestic herbivores throughout the year, which is explained by competitive interactions of L.guanicoe with small livestock but also in response to vegetation productivity and human pressure. This study shows the importance of including species interaction effects in habitat modeling.

AB The use of MPAs to recover fish stocks in littoral areas of the western Mediterranean has made it possible to obtain time dataseries on the biomass evolution over the last decade. The biomass of six fully protected MPAs increased between two-and threefold over a period of five years. After this time the biomass remained stable. This pattern allowed us to adjust logistic curves between the biomass and protection time, and to estimate the carrying capacity (K) of each site. In the present study we investigate the relationships between carrying capacity (K) and habitat characteristics at each protected site. The relationships between habitat/environmental variables and K are analysed by applying generalized linear models. Environmental descriptors showing major effects on biomass are related to depth, exposure, rugosity, and offshore slope at different spatial scales. Comparison of observed and predicted values using the model for exploited sites in the Balearic Islands made it possible to determine their conservation status. This empirical approach to the relationships between environmental factors and fish assemblage biomass could constitute a very useful tool when traditional fishery management based on catch and effort data from the artisanal and recreational fleets is difficult to apply.

AB We examined the changes in the nutritive value and yield of herbage along a grazing gradient, where abrupt changes in community composition occurred, at multiple ecological sites in Mongolian rangelands. At grassland sites, changes in the herbage nutritive value could be attributed to rapid replacement of perennial grasses or forbs with weedy annual forbs along a grazing gradient. Crude protein (CP) concentration increased sharply in approaching the source of grazing gradient, whereas neutral detergent fibre and metabolizable energy (ME) concentrations decreased sharply. As ME can be utilized as a main index of herbage nutritive value, these results indicated its overall loss with severe grazing. Consequently, gradual increases in the yields of CP and ME in the direction of the gradient source at the grassland sites did not necessarily indicate the improvement of rangeland condition. In contrast, at shrubland sites, we could not generally detect any significant trends in the herbage nutritive value. The yield of ME gradually decreased in the direction of gradient source, suggesting that grazing affects herbage yield rather than herbage feed value at shrubland sites. Thus, the nutritive value and yield of herbage can be modified greatly in association with nonlinear responses of vegetation to livestock grazing.

AB Hybridization and genetic swamping by planted exotic Populus taxa are putative threats for native Populus resources. We investigated the potential for hybridization between the exotic hybrid Populus x canadensis Moench and its wild relative, the European black poplar (Populus nigra L.), by a series of pollination experiments in the greenhouse. We also tested the effect of mixtures of pollen from the taxon's own pollen and pollen of the foreign taxon on mating success in reciprocal crosses. We observed reduced pollen and seed viability of the hybrid clones of P. x canadensis compared to the clones of the parental species P. nigra. Surprisingly, when in combination with pollen of its wild relative P. nigra, pollen of exotic P. x canadensis sired significantly better on its own flowers. In poplar breeding, the pollen mentor technique which uses pollen mixes of artificially inactivated conspecific pollen and untreated incompatible foreign pollen, has been successfully used to overcome incompatibility barriers. The results of this study suggest that in the wild, where mixed pollen loads are common, similar effects as the pollen mentor effects may enhance the invasiveness of exotic P. x canadensis. This study helps to explain former field observations and contributes to the understanding of potential environmental impacts of commercial exotic and transgene poplar plantations.

AB In the semiarid Chaco savannas, the balance between herbaceous and woody species affects landscape configuration and ecosystem services such as forage production. Therefore, understanding the factors that control this balance is crucial for management. In a factorial experiment, we assessed the effects of fire and water availability on the emergence and recruitment of grasses, forbs and woody species. The results showed that the effects of fire and water availability on early regeneration stages differed among the three functional groups. For grasses, fire and water addition enhanced emergence when acted solely, but only the positive effects of fire were translated into a greater recruitment, irrespective of the water availability. For forbs, only water addition, when acted solely, promoted the emergence, although this effect was not translated into a greater recruitment. Lastly, in the case of woody species, both fire and water addition reduced emergence and recruitment. Our results support the notion that both fire and greater water availability would contribute to the maintenance and recovery of a grass-dominated state of vegetation through a positive effect of fire on grasses recruitment and a general negative effect of fire and water on woody species emergence and recruitment.

AB The present article is an attempt to perceive the universal sustainability observable in an individual country or region, where the religious, political, social-demographic, economic, environmental, creative, technological and investment subsystems are revealed not only through the vitality of spiritual and material existence media, but rather through the signs of the development of these subsystems as self-assembled units through the erosion of their interaction. The problem of optimal allocation of investment resources among the separate sustainability's subsystems was addressed by means of expert methods and techniques of portfolio methodology which will enable the achievement of the enshrined universal sustainability standards. A country-specific index composition of sustainability subsystems' indices was chosen as the universal sustainability index for the specific country. The index in its dynamics is perceived as a random process. While projecting its state and evaluating its power, i.e., the impact of the subsystem efficiency in a particular moment, this power is measured by the level of the index and the reliability or guarantee of an appropriate level. To solve the problem of investment resources allocation, the idea of Markowitz Random Field was invoked in order to reach the maximum power of sustainability index while applying the technical solution-the so-called "GoldSim"system. Engineering is a methodology that aspires to reveal the core attributes of complex systems and instruments in order to manage the possibility to influence these properties for the systems. Experimental expert evaluation and case study is performed on Lithuanian data.

AB The occurrence of the exotic ectomycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mixed Nothofagus-Eucalyptus native forest was investigated to determine if A. muscaria has switched hosts to form a successful association with a native tree species in a natural environment. A mycorrhizal morphotype consistently found beneath A. muscaria sporocarps was examined, and a range of morphological and anatomical characteristics in common with those described for ectomycorrhizae formed by A. muscaria on a broad range of hosts were observed. A full description is provided. The likely plant associate was determined to be Nothofagus cunninghamii based upon anatomy of the roots. Analysis of ITS-1 and ITS-2 regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences confirmed the identities of both fungal and plant associates. These findings represent conclusive evidence of the invasion of a non-indigenous ectomycorrhizal fungus into native forest and highlight the ecological implications of this discovery.

AB Seedling browsing by livestock has been indicated as major threat for forest sustainability use. Nothofagus pumilio forests are part of the livestock raising system in Patagonia, but because of the sparse understory cover, livestock graze mainly on flood meadows within the forest matrix. The complexity of the environment under study (forests and flood meadows) means that an adaptive predictor is needed to evaluate the intensity of resource use by livestock in order to assess its effect on the forest. Distance to flood meadows was evaluated as a predictor of the use intensity of the forest by livestock and its effect on the understory. The study was conducted at three sites in Chubut Province, Patagonia-Argentina. We established transects in the forest 320 m long, starting at the edge flood meadow-forest. In these transects, the livestock presence indicators (soil compaction, density of feces and trails) and composition of the understory were evaluated. Generalized Linear Model for repeated measures for longitudinal data were used. The indicators showed that distance is efficient for estimating forest use intensity by livestock. The understory varied with distance, the cover of exotic herbaceous was higher near the flood meadow. Far from the flood meadow, the cover was entirely composited of native species. The results support the use of distance to flood meadows as a tool for decision making in livestock and forest management in N. pumilio forests, and for further research on livestock effect on the forest.

AB Given the limitations of the short life span and the highly unpredictable environment of branchiopods, a spatial differentiation strategy may become an immediate issue rather than a long-term life history adaptation to potential interspecific competition for a multi-species branchiopod community. We found an ephemeral pool in northern Taiwan with three sympatric branchiopods, Branchinella kugenumaensis (Ishikawa, 1895), Eulimnadia braueriana (Ishikawa, 1895), and Lynceus biformis (Ishikawa, 1895), and thus we aim to explore the spatial distribution patterns among these three species. We measured the density distributions of these species during two inundation episodes (2008P1 and 2008P2) that lasted for 6 and 32 days respectively. Significant differences in both horizontal and vertical distribution of these species were observed. Horizontally, each species showed its own spatial hotspots, but the hotspots changed irregularly every day. Vertically, while B. kugemunaensis gathered in the upper strata, L. biformis spread over a wide range of depths, with increasing dominance towards the deeper layers. Eulimnadia braueriana, on the other hand, showed no significant pattern of vertical distribution clue to its small population size. We suggest that the significant differences in the spatial distribution of these sympatric branchiopod populations can be an adaptive strategy under the selective stresses of high unpredictability and variability.

AB The assessment of grazing intensity is important for making adequate management decisions on rangelands. Using GPS collars, tended goat herds from three villages in southern Morocco were studied. The aim was to characterise their spatio-temporal movement patterns, i.e. the seasonal variation in grazing intensities, and daily trajectories of the herds. Furthermore, the effect of recording interval on recorded daily walking distances and the relationship between grazing intensities and distance was assessed. Grazing intensities were calculated within 4-ha grid cells for areas around settlements. The highest grazing intensities were found in the 250 m nearest the settlement. Some directions were totally avoided due to either community boundaries or adverse topography. The daily and maximum walking distances were significantly different between seasons. In the arid ecosystems the longest mean daily walking distance were found to be in the spring whereas in semiarid ecosystems it was in summer. It is argued that this variation in grazing pattern is mainly driven by varying fodder availability and its nutritive value, weather conditions and the length of day. The distances were longer in periods when fodder of high nutritive value was available, while cold temperatures and short days in winter limited the distances walked. The relationship between GPS recording interval and recorded trajectory length was described well by an exponential function, which in turn allows extrapolation from data with longer intervals to the actual distances travelled. Using non-linear regressions, the decay of grazing intensity with increasing distance was described better with power functions. The exponents ranged from -1.69 to -2.18, demonstrating that the goats were clumped around the settlements. The description of the grazing patterns of goats in this study provides valuable data for the parameterisation of grazing models.

AB This study aimed to quantify and evaluate the effects of heavy land utilisation, mainly grazing, on plant species richness and diversity, species abundance, vegetation structure and soil characteristics in a communal area in Colophospermum mopane dominated savanna in southern Africa. The treatment was benchmarked against a relatively lightly stocked neighbouring farm. An assessment of termite richness across the contrasting land-use areas was also made. Significant differences were found mainly in plant structure, with reduced plant canopy cover and plant height on the communal land, thus transforming a woodland to a predominantly shrubland physiognomy. There was no significant effect of heavy utilisation on richness or diversity of plant or termite taxa. Species compositional shifts were reflected by significant species associations with either land-use type. Forb species formed an important component of the vegetation irrespective of grazing intensity. Cover of annual plants did not increase with heavy utilisation owing to the increase of 'weedy' annual species being counterbalanced by declining cover of palatable annual plants. Biological soil crusts were markedly less common on the communal land, which may result in an increased hydraulic conductivity of the soil. Other soil properties measured appeared to be insensitive to the intense level of land utilisation.

AB Theory predicts that in more stressful environments, positive plant-plant interactions should be more important than negative ones. For instance, in arid and semiarid regions, amelioration of soil drought produced by the shade of established plants could facilitate establishment of other species, in spite of light reduction. However, this theory has not been tested widely in the context of plant invasion. In this paper we evaluated the hypothesis that in a semiarid ecosystem of central Chile, the native tree, Lithrea caustica, should facilitate through positive shading effects, the seedling establishment of two widely planted and invasive forestry species, Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus globulus. We assessed the seedling establishment examining two processes: seedling recruitment (including germination) and subsequent seedling survival. We sowed seeds to assess recruitment) and planted 8 months old seedlings (to assess seedling survival) of each exotic species under Lithrea patches, open sites and under an artificial shade mimicking Lithrea shading. The study was repeated in a north-facing and a southfacing slope in the study area located in a xeric zone within the distribution range of plantations of these species in central Chile. Our results show that in a north-facing slope Lithrea had positive effects on recruitment of both species, which was produced by shading. These effects were counteracted by negative effects on seedling survival but through a different mechanism, which suggests that Lithrea would have no significant effect on the whole seedling establishment process of Pinus radiata nor Eucalyptus globulus in this habitat. In turn, in a south-facing slope Lithrea had no significant effect on recruitment but had a negative effect on seedling survival, which was not produced by shading. This suggests that in this habitat Lithrea has a negative effect on the seedling establishment of these exotic species. Our results suggest that the effect of the native Lithrea caustica on the seedling establishment of these exotic species is dependent upon the life-cycle phase (recruitment or seedling survival) and habitat even within the same semiarid ecosystem. In contrast to the expected positive effects Lithrea is unlikely to facilitate seedling establishment of these exotic species in this area, and in fact in some habitats this effect could be negative. However, our results also suggest that a common mechanism proposed to resist invasion in forest ecosystems such as shading, probably is not sufficient to inhibit invasion in a semiarid region.

AB Acacia karroo Hayne (Mimosoideae; Fabaceae) is a highly polymorphic species, ranging in height from 1 m to more than 30 m, and with enormous variation in the architecture of adults. Some populations of A. karroo with different morphologies are situated less than 20 km apart. This species has been considered to be a ring species on the basis of allozyme variation. I wished to determine whether this was supported by sapling morphology, and by chemical and physical defences to herbivory. I raised four phenotypes from the restricted area of Zululand (South Africa) in a common garden with controls, and with water and nutrient supplementation. I found that each of the four phenotypes maintained their differences in spite of nutrient and water supplementation. There was no significant genotype by environment interaction. I also found that the coastal population was significantly larger than another phenotype that grows just 12 km inland from it, suggesting that there might be local adaptation of these genotypes to particular soil types. I confirm that A. karroo maintains morphological differentiation even when there is substantial alteration of water and nutrient availability.

AB Cost-effective detection of invasive ant colonies before establishment in new ranges is imperative for the protection of national borders and reducing their global impact. We examined the sampling efficiency of food-baits and pitfall traps (baited and nonbaited) in detecting isolated red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) nests in multiple environments in Gainesville, FL. Fire ants demonstrated a significantly higher preference for a mixed protein food type (hotdog or ground meat combined with sweet peanut butter) than for the sugar or water baits offered. Foraging distance success was a function of colony size, detection trap used, and surveillance duration. Colony gyne number did not influence detection success. Workers from small nests (0- to 15-cm mound diameter) traveled no >3 m to a food source, whereas large colonies (>30-cm mound diameter) traveled up to 17 m. Baited pitfall traps performed best at detecting incipient ant colonies followed by nonbaited pitfall traps then food baits, whereas food baits performed well when trying to detect large colonies. These results were used to create an interactive model in Microsoft Excel, whereby surveillance managers can alter trap type, density, and duration parameters to estimate the probability of detecting specified or unknown S. invicta colony sizes. This model will support decision makers who need to balance the sampling cost and risk of failure to detect fire ant colonies.

AB Agricultural burning is an important land use practice in the central U.S. but has received little attention in the literature, whereas most of the focus has been on wildfires in forested areas. Given the effects that agricultural burning can have on biodiversity and emissions of greenhouse gasses, there is a need to quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of fire in agricultural landscapes of the central U.S. Three years (2006-2008) of the MODIS 1 km daily active fire product generated from the MODIS Terra and Aqua satellite data were used. The 2007 Cropland Data Layer developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was used to examine fire distribution by land cover/land use (LCLU) type. Global ordinary least square (OLS) models and local geographically weighted regression (GWR) analyses were used to explore spatial variability in relationships between fire detection density and LCLU classes. The monthly total number of fire detections peaked in April and the density of fire detections (number of fires/km(2)/3 years) was generally higher in areas dominated by agriculture than areas dominated by forest. Fire seasonality varied among areas dominated by different types of agriculture and land use. The effects of LCLU classes on fire detection density varied spatially, with grassland being the primary correlate of fire detection density in eastern Kansas; whereas wheat cropping was important in central Kansas, northeast North Dakota, and northwest Minnesota.

This analysis was designed to reveal the significant alliances corresponding to alpine and subalpine grasslands, review the associated syntaxonomical hierarchy, and establish the diagnostic floras of these alliances. The study area comprised the subalpine and alpine vegetation belts of the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mountains (northern Spain and southern France). We used 2259 floristic releves, downloaded from the "Sistema de Informacion de la Vegetacion Iberica y Macaronesica" database, for statistical treatment. First, we classified the dataset, using the K-means clustering technique, so as to reveal a syntaxonomical structure. Second, we calculated the fidelity index Ochiai in all classification partitions. Finally, we compared the obtained lists with community descriptions from four bibliographical references. As a result, we could provide a diagnostic flora for every alliance. Therefore, we reconstructed seven of the eight alliances described. The numerical and bibliographical lists of characteristic species were similar for most syntaxa. Moreover, we proposed some new diagnostic species. Some alliances were considered more statistically robust than others. Finally, syntaxonomical repercussions have been suggested.

AB Physiological tolerance of species to temperature, moisture or chemical-physical properties of the soil could be important in determining the distribution and abundance of ant nests. In the present study we investigated the possible differences in the nesting site microhabitat characteristics of two syntopic species of harvester ants of the genus Messor living in a Mediterranean homogeneous grassland area belonging to a single phytosociological association known as "Vulpio ligusticae-Dasypyretum villosi". We tested to see whether the activity of the colonies of the two species directly altered the microhabitat characteristics of the nesting sites. Microhabitat characteristics were assessed quantifying several abiotic factors (light, temperature, soil moisture, soil pH, nitrogen) by means of the Ellenberg Bioindication Model. The model represents a simple way of interpreting the vegetation pattern in terms of ecological factors from the perspective of the plants and can be considered an effective and promising approach to link animal and plant ecology. Our data showed significant differences in the nesting site microhabitat characteristics partially due to a different capacity of the two species to alter nesting site proprieties. Possible differences in the physiological tolerance of these species to moisture gradients could be crucial in determining the distribution and abundance of their nests.

AB The dynamics of Heteropogon contortus and Stylosanthes scabra cv. Seca populations were studied in a subset of treatments in an extensive grazing study conducted in central Queensland between 1988 and 2001. These treatments were 4 stocking rates in native pasture and 2 of these stocking rates in legume oversown and supplement/spring burning treatments. For the 1999-2000 summer, population data for H. contortus in 5 of these native pasture and supplement/burning treatments were compared with those for an additional burnt treatment. Seasonal rainfall throughout this study was below the long-term mean and mean annual pasture utilisation ranged from 24 to 61%. Increasing stocking rate from 5 to 2 ha/steer in native pasture reduced H. contortus plant density. Increasing stocking rate reduced seedling recruitment as a result of its effect on soil seedbanks. Seedling recruitment was the major determinant of change in plant density, although some individual H. contortus plants did survive throughout the study. Burning in spring 1999, particularly at light stocking rate, promoted seedling recruitment above that in both unburnt native and legume oversown pasture and resulted in increased H. contortus plant density. In the legume oversown treatments, S. scabra cv. Seca density increased rapidly from 15 plants/m(2) in 1988 to 140 plants/m(2) in 2001 following a lag phase between 1988 and 1993. This increased S. scabra density was associated with an eventual decline in H. contortus plant density through reduced seedling recruitment. It was concluded that H. contortus population density is sustainable at stocking rates of 4 and 5 ha/steer (30% pasture utilisation) and that spring burning at light stocking rate can promote H. contortus populations. Increasing densities of S. scabra need to be managed to prevent its dominance.

AB Wild pollinators provide important services in both wild and human-dominated ecosystems, yet this group may be threatened by widespread anthropogenic landscape change. We explored the responses of wild bees to exotic floral species and novel habitat in a fragmented, suburban landscape, using pollen grain identification. Pollen loads from bee specimens collected in 13 suburban grassland fragments in Denver, Colorado were sampled and compared with a pollen reference collection. Averaged across two seasonal sampling rounds, 45% of the bee-borne pollen grains were identified to the species level. Wild bees in this system were very receptive to using alien plants for pollen foraging, at least 45% of pollen sampled from bee specimens consisted of non-native pollen grains. During peak flowering in early summer, bees obtained at least 32% of their pollen resources from within-fragment sources and at least 7.5% from surrounding suburban residential yards. In midsummer, within-fragment sources represented 58% of pollen sampled while yards dropped to 1.5%. These bees appear to be more accepting of exotic floral species than of exotic habitat types (yards). The advantages and disadvantages of pollen load analysis for movement studies are discussed.

AB In a field experiment in Florida, USA, N-15-labeled Ammonium Sulfate was used to compare how Pinus taeda seedlings take up and use N in the presence of I. cylindrica and native vegetation using three treatments: 1) vegetation free 2) native competition, and 3) I. cylindrica competition. Imperata cylindrica competition led to smaller pine seedlings with significantly less N content in the pine foliage and roots than those in the native treatment. Competition from I. cylindrica for N contributed to the pine seedlings taking up a greater percentage of the applied fertilizer than the seedlings competing with native vegetation; however, because of their reduced growth they were less efficient in utilizing the fertilizer N. The belowground biomass of I. cylindrica on average was seven times higher than the native species. Despite its lower N concentration in foliage and roots, it retained significantly more N per hectare compared to the native vegetation. While the native species retained more N aboveground, I. cylindrica held significantly more belowground, thus invasion by this grass would lead to a shift of N pools from above to belowground. The fact that we were able to account for 81.5% of the applied fertilizer in the I. cylindrica treatment compared to 62.2% in the native treatment suggests that I. cylindrica tightly retains most of the available N on site making it a particularly good invader.

AB In urban landscapes, nearby birds contribute to allochthonous nutrient flow from residential areas to fragmented forests by consuming food in residential areas and depositing feces in forests. To estimate allochthonous nutrient flow qualitatively, the stable nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) isotope approach is useful. However, the quantitative allochthonous flow rate cannot be estimated by the stable-isotope approach. To quantify allochthonous input, we compare two different landscapes. We assume that the input rate in deep forests in the forest-dominated landscape is the basic autochthonous flow that is common to various forests, and estimate the allochthonous nutrient input by subtracting the autochthonous flow from the total input in urban forests. The observed nutrient-input rate in the forest-dominated landscape as the autochthonous flow is 0.0298 kg P ha(-1) y(-1) and 0.319 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). Using these values, the allochthonous P input (kg P ha(-1) y(-1)) is estimated at 0.0307 in urban fragmented forests and 2.31 in forests with crow roosts, whereas N input (kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) is 0.397 in urban fragmented forests and 23.2 in forests with crow roosts. Our estimation shows that, in urban forests with roosts, birds contribute 2.7 times the amount of allochthonous P contributed via other pathways, and in urban forests without roosts they contribute 0.035 times the amount; and in addition, birds contribute 0.66 times the amount of allochthonous N input via other pathways in urban forests with crow roosts and 0.011 times the amount in urban forests without roosts. We also measure stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios, %N, %P, and %C to estimate the diet of birds. High delta N-15 and delta C-13 values in crow roosts indicate that they eat foods such as livestock meat, C-4 maize, or fish. High avian biomass is the major reason for the large nutrient input in urban landscapes, especially in urban forests with crow roosts.

AB The monitoring of animal populations is necessary to conserve and manage the rare or harvest species and to understand the population change over several years. We used distance sampling methods to estimate seasonal density of blue sheep in a 2,740 km(2) area of Helan Mountain region by walking along 32 transect lines from winter 2003 to autumn 2005. In all, 367-780 blue sheep were observed in 91-143 groups in the surveys during the seasons. Observed mean group size ranged from 3.42 to 8.35 individuals; encounter rate, the number of groups detected per kilometre, varied from 0.19 to 0.30 during the seasons. A hazard rate key function with cosine series expansion and a half-normal key function with either cosine or simple polynomial series expansion were the best fitting models based on the lowest value of Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Density estimates varied between 3.627 sheep per square kilometre in spring 2004 and 4.635 per square kilometre in summer 2005. There were no detectable differences in estimated density among seasons (P = 0.887). The estimated density of blue sheep was negatively correlated with the total number of deaths (P < 0.05), number of sub-adult males' deaths (P < 0.05), number of sub-adult females' deaths (P < 0.05), and number of male lambs' deaths (P < 0.05). We concluded that distance sampling surveys should be used to monitor long-term population trends to provide the best quantitative estimates of blue sheep populations in the Helan Mountains region.

AB Aim To illustrate problems in the methods proposed by B. Vilenkin and V. Chikatunov to study levels of endemism and species-area relationships.
   Location The study used data on the distribution of tenebrionid beetles (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) on the Aegean Islands (Greece).
   Methods A total of 32 islands and 170 taxa (species and subspecies) were included in this study. Levels of endemism were evaluated both as the proportion of endemic taxa, and according to the methods proposed by Vilenkin and Chikatunov, which are based on the number of non-endemic taxa and various relationships with area. A model of the species-area relationship proposed by these authors was also analysed.
   Results The number of endemic taxa was positively correlated with the number of taxa with different distribution types, but this positive correlation did not influence the estimation of the level of endemism. In fact, the commonly used estimate of endemicity as a percentage was strongly correlated with the endemism values calculated according to the method of Vilenkin and Chikatunov. The usual power function fitted the species-area relationship as well as the most complicated method of Vilenkin and Chikatunov.
   Main conclusions As hypothesized by Vilenkin and Chikatunov, the number of endemic taxa was influenced both by the number of taxa of other biogeographical ranks, and by an island's area. However, explanations for the positive relationship between the number of endemic taxa and taxa of different biogeographical ranks are equivocal. Importantly, this relationship did not necessarily influence the level of endemism, which could be expressed adequately by percentages. The method proposed by Vilenkin and Chikatunov to estimate the species-area relationship cannot be clearly justified on theoretical grounds and is of questionable practical utility.

AB The fruiting phenology of 22 woody plant species belonging to 19 families was studied with respect to life-forms, physiognomic groups and dispersal modes, for I year at monthly intervals, in a tropical dry evergreen forest at Oorani (12 degrees 11'N, 79 degrees 57'E) on the Coromandel coast of India. At the community level, bimodal fruiting pattern prevailed, with a major peak in the dry season and a minor one in the early rainy season. An annual fruiting pattern was observed in many species and among the studied species fruiting lasted for 2-9 months. There was no significant difference in the frequency of species at three fruiting stages across the life-form categories and many species of upper and lower canopy trees and lianas were in the ripe fruiting phase during the late dry season. Plant physiognomic groups displayed distinct seasonality in fruiting pattern. The fruit maturation period was much longer for the wet season fruiting brevideciduous species than evergreen and deciduous species that fruited during the dry season. The variation in timing of fruiting behaviour among zoochorous species demonstrated less seasonality and zoochorous fruits were available throughout the year. Fruiting in anemochorous species peaked during the driest months and dryness favoured the dissemination of seeds. The fruiting patterns observed in the studied tropical dry evergreen forest across various plant traits were comparable with patterns recorded in other tropical seasonal forests.

AB The anostracan Phallocryptus spinosa has an almost exclusively palearctic distribution. The Makgadikgadi Pans area in Botswana represents the only distribution record south of the Sahara. In this ephemeral wetland, it is an important food item in the diet of migrating birds. By studying egg bank characteristics (such as depth and density) and hatching requirements, we investigated the persistence of this sub-Saharan population. At localities in the middle and north basin of Sua Pan, sediment cores were taken along a transect, and dormant eggs were isolated. Densities of the active dormant egg bank ranged from 833 to 31449 dormant eggs m(-2), indicating that this species is well established. Most of the dormant eggs were found in the top 4 cm of the sediments, and densities decreased to zero at a depth of 13 cm. Considering the expected low sedimentation rate, the presence of dormant eggs down to 13 cm indicates long-time occurrence of P. spinosa in the Makgadikgadi Pans area. We observed high hatching fractions (up to 85%) at a temperature of 22 degrees C and a salinity of 5 ppt. A second anostracan species, Branchinella ornata, co-occurred with P. spinosa in our study site. This population also had a large active dormant egg bank (ranging from 6634 to 50557 dormant eggs m(-2)) with dormant eggs present until a depth of about 11 cm. This pattern indicates a long-time co-occurrence of P. spinosa and B. ornata.

AB Food limitation effects on life history traits of lake zooplankton have been well documented but few studies have examined linkages between population growth rates and food resources in riverine environments. In rivers, allochthonous inputs of particulate organic matter may mitigate food limitation effects allowing density-independent mechanisms associated with washout (discharge) and feeding interference (turbidity) to assume greater importance. We experimentally manipulated densities of commonly occurring riverine zooplankton (Bosmina longirostris and cyclopoid copepods) within 20001 mesocosms containing ambient or algal-enriched food resources. The experiment was repeated through time (July, August, September) to represent the range of zooplankton densities and food resource levels observed in the Ohio River during warm-water, low-flow conditions. High growth rates and low sensitivity to density-dependent effects were observed during July when particulate organic carbon (POC) and chlorophyll concentrations were highest. Lower growth rates and stronger response to density-dependent effects were observed during August and September experiments when POC and chlorophyll concentrations were lower. Direct manipulations of algal abundance resulted in higher growth rates when gains in chlorophyll were accompanied by increases in the edible size fraction (September experiment). Algal C concentrations were found to be a significant predictor of variation in population growth rates for Bosmina but not cyclopoids. Algal C concentrations in the Ohio River rarely fell below experimentally derived minimum food thresholds but were often below saturation thresholds suggesting that population growth rates were constrained by autochthonous food resources despite the prevalence of allochthonous carbon.

AB Basic Features of the physical and biological limnology of Spioenkop, a large turbid impoundment on the Thukela River, were studied between July 1989 and May 1990, following surveys in spring 1987 and 1988. The lake showed a typical monomictic pattern of summer stratification (November through April) and holomictic winter circulation (May to October). Water quality was chemically good, with little evidence of nutrient enrichment (South African DWAF records). Biological production was confined by high turbidity (SD around 25 cm, NTU values of ca 90) imposed by suspended sediments, limiting annual maximum surface chlorophyll content to below 5 mu g.l(-1), and spring primary production to < 500 mg C.m(-2).d(-1).
   Zooplankton was dominated (numerically and/or gravimetrically) by typical turbid-water fauna; the copepods Metadiaptomus colonialis and Lovenula falcifera, and cladocerans Daphnia barbata and Moina micrura. These species and other tai;a present showed considerable seasonal periodicity, but maximal total abundance of the entire community (680 mg.mg(-2) DW) was attained in mid-summer. Limited information regarding littoral zoobenthos and fish is provided.
   Considerations of Spioenkop as a mirror of its catchment, and in relation to the major Thukela-Vaal inter-basin transfer scheme invite critical appraisal of the level of scientific knowledge and understanding. The plea and challenge is made for more holistic and integrated approaches to ensure sustainable environmental management.

   A test of the prey abundance - Availability assumption
SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PREDATION; PREFERENCE; SIZE
AB Foraging trials were conducted using belted kingfishers (Ceryle alcyon) to examine relationships among prey abundance, availability, and use. Because these relationships are affected by the preference of the predator, I also determined the prey preference of belted kingfishers. Fish (Pimephales promelas and Catostomus commersoni) and crayfish (Orconectes spp.) were exposed to predation by 12 wild belted kingfishers under 4 treatments in which prey availability was manipulated by altering habitat structure. The preferred prey of belted kingfishers were relatively large fish (11-13 cm long). In structurally simple habitats, prey use by belted kingfishers reflected this preference. Complex habitat structure reduced the availability of preferred prey items and resulted in prey use that did not differ from the initial prey abundance distribution. These experiments demonstrated that prey abundance was not equivalent to availability and that habitat structure and prey preference had important effects on the relationships among prey abundance, availability, and use. Thus, evaluating the importance of prey resources to predators on the basis of prey abundance-use comparisons, while ignoring prey availability and the dynamic factors that influence it, may lead to erroneous conclusions.

AB In the time of ongoing climate change and the increasing area of post-mining landscape, the successful afforestation of reclamation sites by suitable adaptive tree species is gaining in importance. One of possible ways may be the use of introduced tree species, which is, however, a controversial topic in relation to risks for forest management and nature conservation. The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the forest stands (age 48 years) of 9 introduced and 3 native coniferous tree species in lowland post-mining coal site of the Czech Republic. The research was focused on production potential, health status, resistance to climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and soil properties. The highest timber production, biomass and carbon stock (49-95% above average), was observed in case of Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra and Pseudotsuga menziesii. On the other hand, unsuitable habitat, insect and pathogens caused poor health status and extremely low production parameters (by 55-62% than average) in Pinus strobus and P. rotundata. In terms of climate, Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra, Larix decidua, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea omorika were the most resistance tree species in relation to climatic extremes. Conversely, Pinus rotundata, P. strobus, P. ponderosa, Picea pungens and P. abies were very sensitive to climate events, especially to the lack of precipitation in vegetation period with synergism of high temperature. In terms of soil parameters, the content of plant available nutrients (K, Ca, Mg) was adequate except P deficiency. The highest soil reaction was detected for Pinus nigra and P. sylvestris (pH 6.9-7.1) compared to Picea mariana (pH 4.8). The benefits of "suitable" introduced tree species (Pinus nigra, Pseudotsuga menziesii) are high timber production potential and good adaptation and mitigation of the changing climate; however, native tree species (Pinus sylvestris, Larix decidua) can provide better environmental benefits on reclamation sites.

AB Competitively dominant carnivore species can limit the population sizes and alter the behavior of inferior competitors. Established mechanisms that enable carnivore coexistence include spatial and temporal avoidance of dominant predator species by subordinates, and dietary niche separation. However, spatial heterogeneity across landscapes could provide inferior competitors with refuges in the form of areas with lower competitor density and/or locations that provide concealment from competitors. Here, we combine temporally overlapping telemetry data from dominant lions (Panthera leo) and subordinate African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) with high-resolution remote sensing in an integrated step selection analysis to investigate how fine-scaled landscape heterogeneity might facilitate carnivore coexistence in South Africa's Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, where both predators occur at exceptionally high densities. We ask whether the primary lion-avoidance strategy of wild dogs is spatial avoidance of lions or areas frequented by lions, or if wild dogs selectively use landscape features to avoid detection by lions. Within this framework, we also test whether wild dogs rely on proactive or reactive responses to lion risk. In contrast to previous studies finding strong spatial avoidance of lions by wild dogs, we found that the primary wild dog lion-avoidance strategy was to select landscape features that aid in avoidance of lion detection. This habitat selection was routinely used by wild dogs, and especially when in areas and during times of high lion-encounter risk, suggesting a proactive response to lion risk. Our findings suggest that spatial landscape heterogeneity could represent an alternative mechanism for carnivore coexistence, especially as ever-shrinking carnivore ranges force inferior competitors into increased contact with dominant species.

AB An ongoing goal of the aquaculture industry is the improvement of oyster larval growth and production. One component of oyster hatcheries that may contribute to the health of oyster larvae is the early establishment and subsequent development of the oyster larval microbiome. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of environmental conditions (hatchery types and spawning seasons) and oyster phenotypes (larval developmental stages) on the composition and diversity of the larval microbiome. In addition, the members of core larval microbiomes were identified and quantified. Microbiome composition and diversity of larval and corresponding hatchery water samples were examined using high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and represented three development stages from two different spawning events at four different hatcheries located in Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Larval and water samples from each spawning cohort were taken at 24-hours 'D' shape (D-stage), 1-week veliger (V-stage), and 2-weeks pediveliger (PV-stage). Larval microbiomes were significantly different from water microbiomes and were significantly influenced by hatchery and spawning, with hatchery having the greatest effect on microbiome composition. While development stage did not show a significant effect on the larval microbiomes, there was a decrease in species richness from the initial D-stage larvae through the final PV-stage and nMDS clustering patterns showed some separation between early (Dand V-) and late stages (PV-) of development, suggesting a shift towards a more selective microbiome as the larvae developed. A total of 25 members (OTU level) were identified as the core larval microbiome (core OTUs), comprising approximately one quarter of the total relative abundance of the larval microbiome. Core OTUs belonging to genera Alteronomonas and Roseobacter have been shown to offer bivalve larvae some protection against pathogens, while those belonging to family Cryomorphaceae are commonly isolated from microalgal species and most likely indicate an association with oyster larval feeding. These findings underscore the importance of environmental conditions on microbiome development of oyster larvae associated with hatchery success of larval cultivation. Further studies are needed to determine the contribution of the core larval microbiome to oyster health and disease resistance.

AB Carnivorous plants (CPs)dthose possessing specific strategies to attract, capture and kill animal prey and obtain nutrition through the absorption of their biomassdare harbingers of anthropogenic degradation and destruction of ecosystems. CPs exhibit highly specialised and often very sensitive ecologies, being generally restricted to nutrientimpoverished habitats where carnivory offers a competitive advantage. As such, they are often the first species to disappear following habitat degradation, land use change, and alteration to natural ecological processes, and are at significant risk from processes such as eutrophication and weed invasion, and even poorly-understood impacts such as airborne nitrogen inputs. Many of the world's 860 species of CPs are found in wetland habitats, which represent some of the most cleared and heavily degraded ecosystems on Earth. Global diversity hotspots for CPs are likewise located in some of the most heavily cleared and disturbed areas of the planet-southwestern Western Australia, Southeast Asia, Mediterranean Europe, central eastern Brazil, and the southeastern United States-placing their conservation at odds with human developmental interests. Many carnivorous plant species exhibit extreme range-restriction and are wholly localised to specific geological formations, microhabitats or elevations, with nowhere to move to in the face of environmental change, such as a warming, drying climate. We provide the first systematic examination of the conservation status and threats to all CPs globally, compiling full or partial assessments of conservation status category for 860 species from 18 genera, and provide ten recommendations towards better conservation and management of this iconic group. A total of 69 species were assessed as Critically Endangered (8% of all species), 47 as Endangered (6%), 104 as Vulnerable (12%), and 23 as Near Threatened (3%). Slightly over 60% of CPs (521 species) were assessed as Least Concern. At least 89 species are known from only a single location based on current knowledge. Data on threatening processes were available for 790 species, with the most common threatening processes including Agriculture and Aquaculture (impacting 170 species), Natural Systems Modifications (168 species), Climate Change and Severe Weather (158 species), Energy Production and Mining (127 species), Human Intrusions and Disturbance (126 species), and Biological Resource Use (98 species). Almost a quarter of all species were impacted upon by three or more threatening processes. The most significant threats placing species at imminent risk of extinction include the continuing clearing of natural habitat for urban and agricultural development and the illegal collection of individuals from the wild for horticultural trade. The complex and specialised ecological requirements of CPs, together with the multifaceted threats they face, make conservation difficult and repatriation even to restored areas challenging. As the number of vulnerable, endangered and extinct carnivorous plant species continues to grow, despite significant conservation efforts in many regions and greater awareness of their ecological requirements, it is clear that a paradigm shift is required in our approach to the preservation of this unique group of plants in order to achieve long-term conservation successes.

AB Wild vertebrate populations all over the globe are in decline, with poaching being the second-most-important cause. The high poaching rate of rhinoceros may drive these species into extinction within the coming decades. Some stakeholders argue to lift the ban on international rhino horn trade to potentially benefit rhino conservation, as current interventions appear to be insufficient. We reviewed scientific and grey literature to scrutinize the validity of reasoning behind the potential benefit of legal horn trade for wild rhino populations. We identified four mechanisms through which legal trade would impact wild rhino populations, of which only the increased revenue for rhino farmers could potentially benefit rhino conservation. Conversely, the global demand for rhino horn is likely to increase to a level that cannot be met solely by legal supply. Moreover, corruption is omnipresent in countries along the trade routes, which has the potential to negatively affect rhino conservation. Finally, programmes aimed at reducing rhino horn demand will be counteracted through trade legalization by removing the stigma on consuming rhino horn. Combining these insights and comparing them with criteria for sustainable wildlife farming, we conclude that legalizing rhino horn trade will likely negatively impact the remaining wild rhino populations. To preserve rhino species, we suggest to prioritize reducing corruption within rhino horn trade, increasing the rhino population within well-protected 'safe havens' and implementing educational programmes and law enforcement targeted at rhino horn consumers.

AB After the recent high-impact European outbreaks of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf), a xylem-limited plant pathogenic bacterium native to the Americas, this research aims to rank the risks of potential entry, establishment and spread of Xf in new countries across Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. A novel risk-ranking technique is developed, based on combining entry risk drivers (imported plants, direct flights and ferry connections) with risk factors related to establishment and spread (presence of potential insect vectors, vulnerable economic crops, alternative hosts and climate suitability) of this pathogen. This reveals that western European countries have the highest risk for entry, but that the Mediterranean basin runs the highest risk for establishment and spread of Xf. Lebanon in particular has the highest level of risk for Xf dispersal within its suitable territory. Countries without current outbreaks combining high risks of Xf arrival and establishment are mainly in the Mediterranean basin: Turkey is at the highest level of risk, followed by Greece, Morocco and Tunisia, which are ranked at the high level. The ranking model also confirms the vulnerability, in terms of invasion by Xf, of southern European countries (Italy, Portugal and Spain) in which the pathogen has already been reported. High summer temperatures in these southern countries are likely to be the significant determinant for the overall invasion process, while northern European countries have a high level risk for the arrival of the pathogen, but relatively low summer temperatures may limit establishment and spread of major outbreaks. In general, our study provides a useful approach for mapping and comparing risks of invasive non-native species and emerging pathogens between countries, which could be useful for regional horizon scanning and phytosanitary and biosecurity management.

AB Private lands are critical for maintaining biodiversity beyond protected areas. Across Kenyan rangelands, wild herbivores frequently coexist with people and their livestock. Human population and livestock numbers are projected to increase dramatically over the coming decades. Therefore, a better understanding of wildlife-livestock interactions and their consequences for biodiversity conservation on private lands is needed. We used a Bayesian hierarchical, multi-species and multi-year occupancy model on aerial survey data of 15 wild-herbivore species, spanning 15 years (2001-2016) to investigate a) spatiotemporal trends in species occurrence and richness across a mosaic of properties with different land uses in Laikipia County, central Kenya; and b) the effects of distance to water, vegetation and livestock relative abundance on species occurrence and richness. Although mean herbivore species richness varied little over time, we observed high spatial variation in species occurrence across Laikipia, mainly driven by negative effects of high livestock relative abundance. As expected, 'wildlife friendly' properties had higher herbivore species richness than other areas. However, high variability suggests that some pastoral properties support rich herbivore communities. The area occupied by five species with global conservation concerns (reticulated giraffe, Gravy's zebra, Beisa Oryx, Defassa waterbuck and gerenuk) and for which Laikipia County is one of the last refuges was < 50% across years. We conclude that 'wildlife friendly' properties remain crucial for conservation, although some pastoralist areas offer suitable habitats for wild herbivores. Effective management of stocking rates is critical for maintaining ecosystems able to sustain livestock and wildlife on private lands, ensuring protection for endangered species.

AB Holothuria polii and Holothuria tubulosa are two of the most commercially exploited sea cucumbers of the Mediterranean Sea. As deposit-feeders, they represent an important component of the benthic community. Hence, knowledge of their feeding behaviour is crucial for understanding their function in terms of benthic ecology and sediment dynamics.
   Using information obtained from stable isotope analysis, the food selectivity/assimilation, temporal variations in diet and trophic niche of H. polii and H. tubulosa were investigated. Analysis of carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in body wall tissue showed a preferential assimilation of seagrass detritus among multiple food sources, with a total contribution to the diet ranging from 63% to 74%. The temporal changes in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values followed the seagrass isotopic dynamics with depleted values in winter and enriched values in summer. Additionally, delta C-13 and delta N-15 measurements were used to outline the species' trophic niche width. The two species coexist, showing an overlap on the delta C-13 axis and a partial degree of niche segregation on the delta N-15 axis. Our results provide an overview on the feeding activity of H. polii and H. tubulosa, providing evidence of their crucial role on the seagrass detrital pathways for Mediterranean coastal ecosystems.

AB The temperate island of Tasmania is a global centre of plant endemism, with relictual lineages that persist in topographically rugged, wet and cool refugia. An iconic example of these palaeoendemic plants is the slow-growing conifer, Athrotaxis cupressoides D. Don (Cupressaceae). The geographic range of A. cupressoides has shrunk since European settlement because of destructive anthropogenic fires. Inscription of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area in 1982 provided formal protection for Tasmania's palaeoendemic taxa, but they remain vulnerable to lightning-ignited landscape fires, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change. We surveyed stands across the species' range and found that stands damaged by fires in the 20th century had higher grass cover and were more exposed to hot northerly winds than unburnt stands. A recruitment bottleneck was evident, with juveniles absent in 28% of unburnt and 47% of burnt transects. Transects on small islands in lakes had lower herbivore densities and less evidence of fire than comparable mainland transects. However, the island transects had lower densities of A. cupressoides seedlings and saplings, despite similar densities of adult trees, suggesting factors other than fire and herbivory contribute to the poor regeneration. We also studied the effects of a lightning fire in 2016, finding it killed 68% of stems overall, with stems less than 30 cm diameter and those scarred by previous fires more likely to die. These findings of high adult mortality and poor regeneration following fire suggest that the geographic range of A. cupressoides will contract due to the increasing frequency of lightning-ignited fires. Management responses to the increasing risk of landscape fires now include establishment of seed banks, restoration planting and use of irrigation to protect stands from active fires, in addition to rapid suppression of ignitions and targeted planned burning to reduce fuel loads in surrounding flammable vegetation.

AB Host species often support a genetically diverse guild of symbionts, the identity and performance of which can determine holobiont fitness under particular environmental conditions. These symbiont communities are structured by a complex set of potential interactions, both positive and negative, between the host and symbionts and among symbionts. In reef-building corals, stable associations with specific symbiont species are common, and we hypothesize that this is partly due to ecological mechanisms, such as succession and competition, which drive patterns of symbiont winnowing in the initial colonization of new generations of coral recruits. We tested this hypothesis using the experimental framework of the de Wit replacement series and found that competitive interactions occurred among symbionts which were characterized by unique ecological strategies. Aposymbiotic octocoral recruits within high- and low-light environments were inoculated with one of three Symbiodiniaceae species as monocultures or with cross-paired mixtures, and we tracked symbiont uptake using quantitative genetic assays. Priority effects, in which early colonizers excluded competitive dominants, were evidenced under low light, but these early opportunistic species were later succeeded by competitive dominants. Under high light, a more consistent competitive hierarchy was established in which competitive dominants outgrew and limited the abundance of others. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of microbial community organization and symbiosis breakdown and recovery. Furthermore, transitions in competitive outcomes across spatial and temporal environmental variation may improve lifetime host fitness.

AB Reservoir operation plays an important role in the coevolution of the nexus across water supply, power generation, and environment (WPE) systems. This paper aims to contribute to the state-of-the-art in how multi objective reservoir operation can be modeled within the framework of the WPE nexus by incorporating the interactions among reservoirs operation, stakeholders' decision preferences, and WPE systems. Specifically, five ordinary differential equations are used to describe the dynamics of WPE states. These dynamics are driven by a multi-objective optimization model that optimizes reservoir operation decisions. Two novel response linkages that describe how the reservoir operational decisions influence socio-economic variables and how the environmental awareness influences stakeholders' preference for reservoir operation are proposed in this study. The Middle Route of China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project is selected as the case study. The results show that: (1) response linkages are effective in describing the interactions between reservoir operational decisions and WPE systems, (2) tradeoffs across WPE systems and reservoir operational decisions shift from stage to stage because of the changing socio-economic conditions, and (3) the control parameter that dominates the shift in stable levels of a given variable can be identified. These results highlight the importance of re-evaluating involved tradeoff effects and updating of operational policies periodically, and how our modeling approach can be used to detect and guide such adaptions.

AB Overharvesting is one of the greatest threats to species survival. Farming overharvested species is a conservation strategy that can meet growing market demand and conserve wild populations of the target species. This strategy is compatible with the international community's desire to uphold the right of local communities to use biological resources to support their livelihoods. However, studies investigating whether farming can alleviate poaching pressure have focused almost exclusively on animals. To address the shortfall in plant-focused studies, we compiled information on commercial cultivation of threatened plants to assess its conservation benefits. Because China's rising middle class has rapidly intensified demand for wildlife products, we searched the scientific literature published in Chinese (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Baidu) and in English. We found 32 reports that contained data on 193 internationally or nationally threatened plant species that were under commercial cultivation. These reports showed that cultivations of 82% of the 193 species were sustained by collecting whole plants from the wild periodically or continuously. Although based on a small sample size, species that were maintained in cultivation only through artificial propagation or seeds collected in the wild were likely associated with a reported reduction in wild harvesting of whole plants. Even so, results of correlation analyses suggested that production system, scale, and when a species began being cultivated had little effect on conservation status of the species, either globally or in China. However, species brought into cultivation relatively recently and on a smaller scale were more likely to have undergone a reduction in collecting pressure. Farming of nonmedicinal plants was most problematic for species conservation because wild plants were laundered (i.e., sold as cultivated plants). For effective conservation, policy to guide cultivation operations based on the target species' biological characteristics, cultural significance, market demand, and conservation status is needed.

AB Tropical montane habitats, including the Shola Sky Islands in the Western Ghats, host several threatened taxa of which, the global distributions are restricted to these mountain-tops. The rapidly increasing human footprint and the spread of invasive alien plants have already resulted in the local extinction of several taxa. Here we examine the entire Shola Sky Islands ecosystem to estimate the extent of habitat loss and to create a baseline of land use in this rapidly changing landscape. We used LANDSAT imageries from 1973, 1995 and 2017, with 840 ground truth points across the ecosystem. We find substantial landscape modification in the large high elevation plateaus (7-60%) over the last four decades while changes are muted in the other parts. The loss of grasslands to exotic trees predominates (340 km(2), 23%) the modification of this landscape, and, continues today at a rapid pace. Contrary to popular belief, Shola Forests have been relatively stable, implying that most plantations were established on grasslands-traditionally classified as "unproductive wastelands". Across the Protected Area (PA) network, Reserve Forests (RF), the least protected areas have faced the greatest loss of grasslands. Older PAs have lost relatively fewer grasslands, but the invasion from adjoining RFs is now increasing. We highlight the complexity of conservation in this landscape with three case studies of PAs with different management histories. Our study highlights the rapid loss of native Shola Grasslands, the continuing loss to invasive exotic trees, and the challenges of conserving this critical habitat with traditional modes of conservation.

AB Estuaries are known to export huge quantities of terrigenous/riverine organic matter and nutrients to coastal areas, subsidizing food sources to their communities; however, this process is seldom investigated in complex multichannel delta-prodelta systems. Stable isotope analysis was used to investigate the contribution of organic sources originated from the Po River Delta, one of the widest deltaic wetlands in the northern Mediterranean Sea, to the diet of the nearby coastal macrobenthic consumers, and their influence on invertebrates' trophic structure and biomass. Following intense river flood events, macrofauna samples were collected in the prodelta area at increasing distance from the main river distributary mouth. Potential primary resources were collected within the delta and the prodelta areas. A terrestrial signal in the primary consumers' diet was evident as a shift in their delta C-13, being this more C-13 depleted near the main river distributary. The Bayesian mixing models indicated an important contribution of deltaic sources, in particular C4-grass detritus (25-57%), to primary consumers' diet, confirming a strong energetic link between delta and prodelta areas. Overall, most of the consumers' biomass were concentrated at sites close to the main distributary mouth, mainly as suspension and surface deposit feeders. A simplification of the macrobenthic community structure, accompanied by narrower transfer pathways was also evident at sites more distant from the main river distributary, in relation to changes in the quality of resources. Our data, although limited to winter season, suggest that during periods of low in situ productivity but high river flow energy, invertebrates are able to efficiently exploit terrigenous food sources, restraining the detrimental effect of increased turbidity and sedimentation. We conclude that riparian/wetland vegetation associated with river deltas can provide important food sources to marine primary consumers. These results furthermore highlight the need for integrated management and protection strategies of connected land-sea ecosystems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Site-specific environmental and climatic records are crucial to our understanding of human behavior and cognition during the African Middle Stone Age. This is particularly true of the South African Middle Stone Age record with its enigmatic and relatively short lived Still Bay and Howieson's Poort industries. Existing environmental models for the South African Middle Stone Age are primarily contingent on global climatic data which are temporally, spatially, and/or stratigraphically separated from archaeological sites. The well-dated and extensive Middle Stone Age sequence of Sibudu provides a rare opportunity to gather the high-resolution on-site data which are sorely needed to evaluate behavior-environment links on the ground.' Stable carbon and oxygen isotope data were collected from faunal tooth enamel samples spanning the entire Sibudu sequence excavated by Wadley from > 77 to similar to 38 thousand years ago (ka). Two periods of habitat change are identified at Sibudu. The pre-Still Bay (> 73 ka) is characterized by more closed, likely forested, and mesic conditions than the rest of the sequence. Late and final Middle Stone Age industries (similar to 48-38 ka) at Sibudu are associated with more open and likely drier conditions than earlier. No major environmental or habitat changes based on stable isotope data, however, are identified in the Sibudu record concordant with the Still Bay, Howieson's Poort, or post-Howieson's Poort techno-complexes. These results suggest that social and demographic changes were presumably as significant as environmental conditions, if not more so, in behavioral transitions at Sibudu.

AB Defining the geographic origins of free-living aquatic microorganisms can be problematic because many such organisms have ubiquitous distributions, and proving absence from a region is practically impossible. Geographic origins become important if microorganisms have invasive characteristics. The freshwater diatom Didymosphenia geminata is a potentially ubiquitous microorganism for which the recent global expansion of nuisance proliferations has been attributed to environmental change. The changes may include declines in dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) to low levels (e.g., <2mg/m(3)) and increases in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to >10mg/m(3) because both these nutrient conditions are associated with nuisance proliferations of D. geminata. Proliferations of D.geminata have been observed in South Island, New Zealand, since 2004. We aimed to address the ubiquity hypothesis for D.geminata in New Zealand using historical river water nutrient data and new molecular analyses. We used 15years of data at 77 river sites to assess whether trends in DRP or DIN prior to the spread of D.geminata were consistent with a transition from a rare, undetected, species to a nuisance species. We used new sequences of chloroplast regions to examine the genetic similarity of D.geminata populations from New Zealand and six overseas locations. We found no evidence for declines in DRP concentrations since 1989 that could explain the spread of proliferations since 2004. At some affected sites, lowest DRP occurred before 2004. Trends in DIN also did not indicate enhanced suitability for D.geminata. Lack of diversity in the chloroplast intergenic regions of New Zealand populations and populations from western North America is consistent with recent dispersal to New Zealand. Our analyses did not support the proposal that D.geminata was historically present in New Zealand rivers. These results provide further evidence countering proposals of general ubiquity in freshwater diatoms and indicate that, as assumed in 2004, D.geminata is a recent arrival in New Zealand.

AB Objectives: (1) To evaluate how ecosystem services may be utilized to either reinforce or fracture the planning and development practices that emerged from segregation and economic exclusion; (2) To survey the current state of ecosystem service assessments and synthesize a growing number of recommendations from the literature for renovating ecosystem service analyses.
   Methods: Utilizing current maps of ecosystem service distribution in Bushbuckridge Local Municipality, South Africa, we considered how a democratized process of assessing ecosystem services will produce a more nuanced representation of diverse values in society and capture heterogeneity in ecosystem structure and function.
   Results: We propose interventions for assessing ecosystem services that are inclusive of a broad range of stakeholders' values and result in actual quantification of social and ecological processes. We demonstrate how to operationalize a pluralistic framework for ecosystem service assessments.
   Conclusion: A democratized approach to ecosystem service assessments is a reimagined path to rescuing a poorly implemented concept and designing and managing future social-ecological systems that benefit people and support ecosystem integrity. It is the responsibility of scientists who do ecosystem services research to embrace more complex, pluralistic frameworks so that sound and inclusive scientific information is utilized in decision-making.

AB Marine communities face continuing and accelerating climate change. Predicting which species will go extinct or persist in future climates requires assessing redistribution potential and tolerance to warming, both of which can depend on dispersal ability. We evaluated biophysical processes that could promote population persistence under changing climatic conditions by (1) promoting poleward dispersal in an Eastern Boundary Current region, where offshore currents flow predominantly equatorward, and (2) increasing the frequency of more thermotolerant phenotypes in marine populations. We paired intensive time-series observations (during 2014 and 2015) of recruitment and thermal tolerance limits for cohorts of marine mussels with simulated larval transport using a high-resolution, 3D coastal circulation model of the northeastern Pacific. We used the modeling results to predict the proportion of individuals in each recruiting cohort that originated from sources south or north of our study site on the USA west coast (45.50 degrees N, 123.95 degrees W) as well as the environmental conditions experienced in the water column. We found that the coastal upwelling index was related to origin of individuals within recruiting cohorts, with poleward recruitment predicted to increase under downwelling conditions. Furthermore, thermal tolerance limits were higher in cohorts predicted to experience higher and more variable temperatures during dispersal. These findings highlight complex links between demographic and physical transport processes as well as the potential for climate-driven changes in wind patterns to indirectly affect species' abilities to cope with increasing temperatures.

AB Pine plantations and pine invasions have numerous impacts on native ecosystems in the Fynbos biome of South Africa. The severity of these impacts greatly determines the extent of potential ecosystem recovery after the pines are felled. The recovery potential of fynbos after felling of pine plantations of varying longevity and the subsequent application of ecological burns was investigated in the Helderberg Nature Reserve, Western Cape Province, South Africa. Above-ground vegetation, soil seed bank and abiotic variables were sampled across three treatments (reference fynbos and sites that had been under pines for 30 and 50 years respectively) using 1 m(2) quadrats placed along 50 m line transects. The soil seed bank samples were smoke treated and then monitored in a greenhouse to determine the soil seed bank species and growth form composition. Areas previously under 30 year old pine plantations had high native species and growth form density (number of species/growth forms per unit area) and similar plant density (number of individuals per unit area) to the reference fynbos areas. Conversely, areas previously under 50 year old pine plantations had significantly lower native species and growth form density and plant density than the reference fynbos and were dominated by alien species. In addition, areas previously under 50 year old pine plantations had lower species diversity than the reference fynbos areas and areas previously under 30 year old pine plantations which were found to be similar to one another. Felled pine plantations were shown to minimally impact on soil abiotic variables, with only soil temperature and pH showing significant differences. Therefore, areas previously under 30 year old pine plantations have higher recovery potential following pine removal than 50 year old plantations, owing to the depleted native soil seed bank in the latter. Consequently, active restoration may be needed to re-introduce the missing long-lived growth forms and to prevent soil erosion. Pine plantation and invasion management in the Fynbos biome should aim to fell pines before the native seed bank is depleted to maintain the recovery potential of fynbos and prevent the need for active restoration.

AB Aims: To detect changes in area and vegetation dynamics of monsoon rain forests in relation to disturbance and an observed wetting trend.
   Location: The Mitchell Plateau and the Bougainville Peninsula (north Kimberley, Australia).
   Methods: Geo-rectified aerial photographs acquired in 1949 and 1969 and a preexisting map from 2005 were used to detect changes in rain forest boundaries. To ground-truth rain forest expansion, we established 20 transects running across rain forest-savanna boundaries and recorded plant species, stand basal area, grass and rock cover, cattle impact, and canopy cover. Generalised linear models and Akaike's information criterion were used to detect differences in these variables between locations.
   Results: On the Bougainville Peninsula average fire frequency was low (0.11 per year) and cattle entirely absent, while on the Mitchell Plateau average fire frequency was high (0.58 per year), and cattle were common and associated with lower seedling density in savannas. Rain forests expanded more on the Bougainville Peninsula (69%), where patches were bigger and more convoluted, than on the Mitchell Plateau (9%). Rain forest expansion was positively associated with rainfall and topographic complexity, and on level terrain it occurred only on the Bougainville Peninsula. Rain forests were floristically and structurally similar in the two locations, while savannas on the Bougainville Peninsula had denser vegetation and more abundant rain forest elements. The frequency distribution of canopy cover was bimodal on the Mitchell Plateau, signalling the presence of two distinct vegetation states, and unimodal on the Bougainville Peninsula, consistent with the blending of the two states.
   Main conclusions: Wetting trends are likely strong drivers of rain forest expansion, but at a landscape scale their effect is probably modulated by fire activity and the presence of mega-herbivores, which may also be pivotal in maintaining sharp floristic and structural distinctions between rain forests and savannas.

AB The dynamics of land-use transitions decrease the coastal resilience of the social-ecological landscape (SEL), particularly in light of the fact that it is necessary to analyze the causal relationship between the two systems because operations of the social system and the ecological system are correlated. The purpose of this study is to analyze the dynamics of the coastal SEL and create a sustainable land-use planning (SLUP) strategy to enhance coastal resilience. The selected study site was Shindu-ri, South Korea, where land-use transitions are increasing and coastal resilience is therefore decreasing. Systems thinking was used to analyze the study, which was performed in four steps. First, the issues affecting the coastal area in Shindu-ri were defined as coastal landscape management, the agricultural structure, and the tourism industry structure. Second, the main variables for each issue were defined, and causal relationships between the main variables were created. Third, a holistic causal loop diagram was built based on both dynamic thinking and causal thinking. Fourth, five land-uses, including those of the coastal forest, the coastal grassland, the coastal dune, the agricultural area, and developed sites, were selected as leverage points for developing SLUP strategies to increase coastal resilience. The results show that "decrease in the size of the coastal forest", "decrease in the size of the coastal dune", and "increase in the size of the coastal grasslands" were considered parts of a land-use plan to enhance the resilience of the Shindu-ri SEL. This study developed integrated coastal land-use planning strategies that may provide effective solutions for complex and dynamic issues in the coastal SEL. Additionally, the results may be utilized as basic data to build and implement coastal land-use planning strategies.

AB Autotrophic picoplankton (APP) abundance and contribution to phytoplankton biomass was studied in Hungarian shallow lakes to test the effect of inorganic turbidity determining the size distribution of the phytoplankton. The studied lakes displayed wide turbidity (TSS: 4-2250 mg l(-1)) and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a: 1-460 mu g l(-1)) range, as well as APP abundance (0 and 100 million cells ml(-1)) and contribution (0-100%) to total phytoplankton biomass. Inorganic turbidity had a significant effect on the abundance and contribution of APP, resulting in higher values compared to other freshwater lakes with the same phytoplankton biomass. Our analysis has provided empirical evidence for a switching point (50 mg l(-1) inorganic turbidity), above which turbidity is the key factor causing APP predominance regardless of phytoplankton biomass in shallow turbid lakes. Our results have shown that turbid shallow lakes are unique waters, where the formerly and widely accepted model (decreasing APP contribution with increasing phytoplankton biomass) is not applicable. We hypothesize that this unusual behaviour of APP in turbid waters is a result of either diminished underwater light intensity or a reduced grazing pressure due to high inorganic turbidity.

AB Understanding the mechanisms of species coexistence is a key task for ecology. Recent theory predicts that both competition and predation (which causes apparent competition among prey) can either promote or limit species coexistence. Both mechanisms cause negative interactions between individuals, and each mechanism promotes stable coexistence if it causes negative interactions to be stronger between conspecifics than between heterospecifics. However, the relative importance of competition and predation for coexistence in natural communities is poorly known. Here, we study how competition and apparent competition via pre-dispersal seed predators affect the long-term fecundity of Protea shrubs in the fire-prone Fynbos biome (South Africa). These shrubs store all viable seeds produced since the last fire in fire-proof cones. Competitive effects on cone number and pre-dispersal seed predation reduce their fecundity and can thus limit recruitment after the next fire. In 27 communities comprising 49 990 shrubs of 22 Protea species, we measured cone number and per-cone seed predation rate of 2154 and 1755 focal individuals, respectively. Neighbourhood analyses related these measures to individual-based community maps. We found that conspecific neighbours had stronger competitive effects on cone number than heterospecific neighbours. In contrast, apparent competition via seed predators was comparable between conspecifics and heterospecifics. This indicates that competition stabilizes coexistence of Protea species, whereas pre-dispersal seed predation does not. Larger neighbours had stronger competitive effects and neighbours with large seed crops exerted stronger apparent competition. For 97% of the focal plants, competition reduced fecundity more than apparent competition. Our results show that even in communities of closely related and ecologically similar species, intraspecific competition can be stronger than interspecific competition. On the other hand, apparent competition through seed predators need not have such a stabilizing effect. These findings illustrate the potential of community demography', the demographic study of multiple interacting species, for understanding plant coexistence.

AB In recent years, interest in availability of georeferenced vegetation plots has stimulated or reinvigorated national initiatives to compile these data. In Italy, eleven vegetation databases are currently registered in the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD). In this paper we describe the Vegetation Plot Database - Sapienza University of Rome (VPD-Sapienza; GIVD code EU-IT-011), which started in 2012 and rapidly became one of the most prominent ones with a total of 21,917 georeferenced vegetation plots spanning across the country. These plots include 286,650 vascular plant species occurrences. Most of the plots belong to temperate deciduous forests (Querco roboris-Fagetea sylvaticae) and broadleaved evergreen forests (Quercetea ilicis), which together account for about 40% of the database. The need for the establishment of a national federated database integrating other national, regional, local and thematic databases is discussed in order to avoid setbacks such as duplication of data, taxonomic and syntaxonomic inconsistencies, and reduced efficiencies in collaborative projects, both at national and international levels.

AB Connectivity among individual marine protected areas (MPAs) is one of the most important considerations in the design of integrated MPA networks. To provide such information for managers in Hawaii, USA, a numerical circulation model was developed to determine the role of ocean currents in transporting coral larvae from natal reefs throughout the high volcanic islands of the Maui Nui island complex in the southeastern Hawaiian Archipelago. Spatially- and temporally-varying wind, wave, and circulation model outputs were used to drive a km-scale, 3-dimensional, physics based circulation model for Maui Nui. The model was calibrated and validated using satellite-tracked ocean surface current drifters deployed during coral-spawning conditions, then used to simulate the movement of the larvae of the dominant reef-building coral. Porites compressa, from 17 reefs during eight spawning events in 2010-2013. These simulations make it possible to investigate not only the general dispersal patterns from individual coral reefs, but also how anomalous conditions during individual spawning events can result in large deviations from those general patterns. These data also help identify those reefs that are dominated by self-seeding and those where self-seeding is limited to determine their relative susceptibility to stressors and potential roadblocks to recovery. Overall, the numerical model results indicate that many of the coral reefs in Maui Nui seed reefs on adjacent islands, demonstrating the interconnected nature of the coral reefs in Maui Nui and providing a key component of the scientific underpinning essential for the design of a mutually supportive network of MPAs to enhance conservation of coral reefs.

AB Adults of most marine benthic and demersal fish are site-attached, with the dispersal of their larval stages ensuring connectivity among populations. In this study we aimed to infer spatial and temporal variation in population connectivity and dispersal of a marine fish species, using genetic tools and comparing these with oceanographic transport. We focused on an intertidal rocky reef fish species, the shore clingfish Lepadogaster lepadogaster, along the southwest Iberian Peninsula, in 2011 and 2012. We predicted high levels of self-recruitment and distinct populations, due to short pelagic larval duration and because all its developmental stages have previously been found near adult habitats. Genetic analyses based on microsatellites countered our prediction and a biophysical dispersal model showed that oceanographic transport was a good explanation for the patterns observed. Adult sub-populations separated by up to 300 km of coastline displayed no genetic differentiation, revealing a single connected population with larvae potentially dispersing long distances over hundreds of km. Despite this, parentage analysis performed on recruits from one focal site within the Marine Park of Arrabida (Portugal), revealed self-recruitment levels of 2.5% and 7.7% in 2011 and 2012, respectively, suggesting that both long-and short-distance dispersal play an important role in the replenishment of these populations. Population differentiation and patterns of dispersal, which were highly variable between years, could be linked to the variability inherent in local oceanographic processes. Overall, our measures of connectivity based on genetic and oceanographic data highlight the relevance of long-distance dispersal in determining the degree of connectivity, even in species with short pelagic larval durations.

AB Pollinator specialisation through exploitation barriers (such as long floral tubes) does not necessarily mean a lack of pollination when the favoured pollinator is rare or absent. Theory predicts that suboptimal visitors will contribute to plant reproduction in the absence of the most effective pollinator. Here I address these questions with Chasmanthe floribunda a long-tubed plant species in the Cape Floristic Region, which is reliant on one species of pollinator, the long-billed Malachite Sunbird. In contrast to short-billed sunbirds, the Malachite Sunbird occurs in lower abundance or is absent in transformed landscapes. Short-billed sunbirds rob and thieve nectar from long-tubed flowers, but their potential contribution towards pollination is unknown.
   Experiments assessing seed set after single flower visits were performed to determine whether thieving short-billed sunbirds can act as substitute pollinators. To determine whether short-billed sunbirds reduce pollen limitation in transformed areas, pollen supplementation was done by hand and compared to natural fruit set.
   Short billed sunbirds are unable to act as substitute pollinators, and seed set is significantly lower in the flowers that they visited, compared to flowers visited by long-billed sunbirds. This is substantiated on a landscape scale, where fruit production in Chasmanthe floribunda could artificially be increased by 35% in transformed landscapes, but not so in natural areas.
   These findings have important consequences for the management and conservation of long-tubed bird-pollinated plant species that exist in recently transformed landscapes. The potential vulnerability of specialised plant species in transformed landscapes is highlighted.

AB Penaeus monodon, the Asian black tiger shrimp is one of the most widely consumed marine crustaceans worldwide. In this study, we examine and compare the fecal microbiota of P. monodon from highly polluted waters around Jakarta Bay, with those of less polluted waters of Bali. Using next generation sequencing techniques, we identified potential bacterial pathogens and common viral diseases of shrimp. Proteobacteria (96.08%) was found to be the most predominant phylum, followed by Bacteriodetes (2.32%), Fusobacteria (0.96%), and Firmicutes (0.53%). On the order level, Vibrionales (66.20%) and Pseudoaltermonadales (24.81%) were detected as,predominant taxa. qPCR profiling was used as a confirmatory step and further revealed Vibrio alginolyticus and Photobacterium damselae as two potential pathogenic species present in most of the samples. In addition, viral diseases for shrimp were discovered among the samples, WSSV in Jakarta free-living samples, YHV in Bali free-living samples and IHHNV in both. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mating patterns and natural selection play important roles in determining whether genetic polymorphisms are maintained or lost. Here, we document an atypical population of Lapeirousia anceps (Iridaceae) with a bimodal distribution of floral-tube length and investigate the reproductive mechanisms associated with this pattern of variation. Flowers were visited exclusively by the long-proboscid fly Moegistorhynchus longirostris (Nemestrinidae), which exhibited a unimodal distribution of proboscis length and displayed a preference for long-tubed phenotypes. Despite being visited by a single pollinator species, allozyme markers revealed significant genetic differentiation between open-pollinated progeny of long- and short-tubed phenotypes suggesting mating barriers between them. We obtained direct evidence for mating barriers between the floral-tube phenotypes through observations of pollinator foraging, controlled hand pollinations and measurements of pollen competition and seed set. Intermediate tube-length phenotypes produced fewer seeds in the field than either long- or short-tubed phenotypes. Although floral-tube length bimodality may not be a stable state over long timescales, reproductive barriers to mating and low hybrid' fitness have the potential to contribute to the maintenance of this state in the short term.

AB Interactions between climate, fire and CO2 are believed to play a crucial role in controlling the distributions of tropical woodlands and savannas, but our understanding of these processes is limited by the paucity of data from undisturbed tropical ecosystems. Here we use a 28,000-year integrated record of vegetation, climate and fire from West Africa to examine the role of these interactions on tropical ecosystem stability. We find that increased aridity between 28-15 kyr B.P. led to the widespread expansion of tropical grasslands, but that frequent fires and low CO2 played a crucial role in stabilizing these ecosystems, even as humidity changed. This resulted in an unstable ecosystem state, which transitioned abruptly from grassland to woodlands as gradual changes in CO2 and fire shifted the balance in favor of woody plants. Since then, high atmospheric CO2 has stabilized tropical forests by promoting woody plant growth, despite increased aridity. Our results indicate that the interactions between climate, CO2 and fire can make tropical ecosystems more resilient to change, but that these systems are dynamically unstable and potentially susceptible to abrupt shifts between woodland and grassland dominated states in the future.

AB AimA good' classification should provide information about the composition and abundance of the species within communities, if it serves as an informative surrogate for biodiversity. A natural way to formalize this is with a predictive model, where group membership (clusters) is the predictor, and multivariate species data (site by species matrix) is the response. In this study, we aimed to develop a predictive model-based framework for evaluating the predictive performance of alternative classifications of vegetation communities, and apply it to make objective and automated decisions about classification structure.
   MethodsWe used GLMs fit to multivariate species data to predict occurrence of individual species with site groupings. We used AIC to estimate predictive performance of alternative models to: (1) identify optimal partitioning of sites among multiple competing flexible- clustering solutions; (2) identify species that contribute most to compositional differences between clusters (i.e. characteristic species); and (3) automatically merge clusters to maximize expected predictive performance using an iterative pruning approach. Using field data from southeastern Australia, and simulated data, we demonstrate our approach for common ecological data types (presence/absence, counts, cover-abundance scores, percentage cover). We supply all code and data required for these analyses.
   ResultsAIC was a useful metric for assessing competing classification solutions. Our method produced outputs that were simple to interpret and required few subjective choices to be made by the user, while performing similarly to the popular OptimClass assessment methodology. Characteristic species defined by predictive performance were consistent between data types, and had good general agreement with existing methods for defining characteristic species. Using model performance to iteratively refine clustering produced classifications with better than expected predictive performance compared to the dendrogram hierarchy, although the flexible- hierarchy did a reasonable job of improving predictive performance.
   ConclusionsAppropriately specified models are a natural way to maximize the predictive performance of a classification and its associated diagnostics. We show that a model-based assessment provides a clear decision framework based on data type, offering an objective pathway to make classification assessment decisions, as well as evaluate methodological choice and performance.

AB Traits of primary producers associated with tissue quality are commonly assumed to have strong control over higher trophic levels. However, this view is largely based on studies of vascular plants, and cryptogamic vegetation has received far less attention. In this study natural gradients in nutrient concentrations in cryptogams associated with the proximity of penguin colonies on a Maritime Antarctic island were utilized to quantify the impact of nitrogen content on micro-arthropod communities. Proximity to penguin colonies increased the nitrogen concentration of cryptogams, and the penguin source was confirmed by decreasing delta N-15 values at greater distances from colonies. Micro-arthropod abundance, diversity (H') and richness declined with distance from the penguin colonies, and was positively correlated with the nitrogen concentrations of cryptogams. Delta N-15 of micro-arthropods was positively correlated (r(2) = 0.865, P < 0.01) with delta N-15 of the moss Andreaea depressinervis indicating that penguin-derived nitrogen moves through Antarctic food webs across multiple trophic levels. Nitrogen content of cryptogams was correlated with associated micro-arthropods indicating that biotic interactions affect community development in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. The spatial patterns of Antarctic biodiversity can therefore be affected by local factors, such as marine vertebrates, beyond existing latitudinal patterns of temperature and water availability.

AB The problem of how ecological mechanisms create and interact with patterns across different scales is fundamental not only for understanding ecological processes, but also for interpretations of ecological dynamics and the strategies that organisms adopt to cope with variability and cross-scale influences.
   Our objective was to determine the consistency of the role of individual habitat patches in pattern-process relationships (focusing on the potential for dispersal within a network of patches in a fragmented landscape) across a range of scales.
   Network analysis was used to assess and compare the potential connectivity and spatial distribution of highland fynbos habitat in and between protected areas of the Western Cape of South Africa. Connectivity of fynbos patches was measured using ten maximum threshold distances, ranging from five to 50 km, based on the known average dispersal distances of fynbos endemic bird species.
   Network connectivity increased predictably with scale. More interestingly, however, the relative contributions of individual protected areas to network connectivity showed strong scale dependence.
   Conservation approaches that rely on single-scale analyses of connectivity and context (e.g., based on data for a single species with a given dispersal distance) are inadequate to identify key land parcels. Landscape planning, and specifically the assessment of the value of individual areas for dispersal, must therefore be undertaken with a multi-scale approach. Developing a better understanding of scaling dependencies in fragmenting landscapes is of high importance for both ecological theory and conservation planning.

AB Background: The Caribbean has one of the largest cruise ship industries in the world, with close to 20 million visitors per year. The potential for communicable disease outbreaks on vessels and the transmission by ship between countries is high. Barbados has one of the busiest ports in the Caribbean. Our aim was to describe and analyse the epidemiology of illnesses experienced by passengers and crew arriving at the Bridgetown Port, Barbados between 2009 and 2013.
   Methods: Data on the illnesses recorded were extracted from the passenger and crew arrival registers and passenger and crew illness logs for all ships and maritime vessels arriving at Barbados' Ports and passing through its territorial waters between January 2009 and December 2013. Data were entered into an Epi Info database and most of the analysis undertaken using Epi Info Version 7. Rates per 100,000 visits were calculated, and confidence intervals on these were derived using the software Openepi.
   Results: There were 1031 cases of illness from over 3 million passenger visits and 1 million crew visits during this period. The overall event rate for communicable illnesses was 15.7 (95 % CI 14.4- 17.1) per 100,000 passengers, and for crew was 24.0 (21.6-26.6) per 100, 000 crew. Gastroenteritis was the predominant illness experienced by passengers and crew followed by influenza. The event rate for gastroenteritis among passengers was 13.7 (12.5-15.0) per 100,000 and 14.4 (12.6, 16.5) for crew. The event rate for non-communicable illnesses was 3.4 per 100,000 passengers with myocardial infarction being the main diagnosis. The event rate for non-communicable illnesses among crew was 2.1 per 100,000, the leading cause being injuries.
   Conclusions: The predominant illnesses reported were gastroenteritis and influenza similar to previous published reports from around the world. This study is the first of its type in the Caribbean and the data provide a baseline for future surveillance and for comparison with other countries and regions.

AB Circulation patterns of coastal upwelling areas may have central consequences for the abundance and cross-shelf transport of the larval stages of many species. Previous studies have provided evidences that larvae distribution results from a combination of subtidal circulation, species-specific behaviour and larval sources. However, most of these works were conducted on organisms characterised by small-sized and abundant early life phases. Here, we studied the influence of the hydrography and circulation of the Ria de Vigo and adjacent shelf (NW Iberian upwelling system) on the paralarval abundance of two contrasting cephalopods, the benthic common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) and the pelagic squids (Loliginidae). We sampled repeatedly a cross-shore transect during the years 2003-2005 and used zero inflated models to accommodate the scarcity and patchy distribution of cephalopod paralarvae. The probability of catching early stages of both cephalopods was higher at night. Octopus paralarvae were more abundant in the surface layer at night whereas loliginids preferred the bottom layer regardless of the sampling time. Abundance of both cephalopods increased when shelf currents flowed polewards, water temperature was high and water column stability was low. The probability of observing an excess of zero catches decreased during the year for octopus and at high current speed for loliginids. In addition, the circulation pattern conditioned the body size distribution of both paralarvae; while the average size of the captured octopuses increased (decreased) with poleward currents at daylight (nighttime), squids were smaller with poleward currents regardless of the sampling time. These results contribute to the understanding of the effects that the hydrography and subtidal circulation of a coastal upwelling have on the fate of cephalopod early life stages.

AB We describe for the first time the histology of an ornithuromorph bird from the Lower Cretaceous Jehol Group, revealing the bone structure of one of the oldest members of this derived clade. The newly discovered Sihedang locality of the Yixian Formation in northeastern China preserves the oldest ornithuromorph dominated avifauna, with all collected birds referable to a single taxon, Iteravis huchzermeyeri. These specimens are all preserved in a relatively greater degree of three-dimensionality compared to Jehol specimens from other localities. We sampled a specimen of Iteravis in order to test the hypothesis that this aggregation of birds may represent a breeding colony. Although medullary bone is known to facilitate three-dimensional preservation, this bone tissue was not present in the histological samples. The specimen is nearly adult with regards to skeletal fusion, and histology indicates medullary expansion had occurred and an inner circumferential layer had already formed. However, lines of arrested growth are absent. Overall the bone histology is comparable to Ichthyornis; this is consistent with the derived phylogenetic placement inferred for this new taxon relative to previously sampled basal ornithuromorphs (Patagopteryx, Hollanda), which all indicate they required more than one year to reach adulthood. This suggests that the modern avian growth strategy evolved in the Early Cretaceous in non-ornithurine birds.

AB We document and assess management options for the first reported invasion of Melaleuca parvistaminea Byrnes (initially identified as M. ericifolla) in the world, in the context of a South African wetland ecosystem. Delimitation surveys indicate that the entire invasion is restricted to three sites between Tulbagh and Wolseley and that populations are only associated with areas currently or previously covered by pine plantations (primarily Pinus radiata). To estimate abundance we surveyed 42% of the three identified areas and found similar to 26,000 plants over 1800 ha (condensed canopy area of 1.15 ha). At least 63% of recorded plants were seedlings or juveniles, mostly <4 yrs old, and most occurred in seasonally inundated (but not waterlogged) habitats. M. parvistaminea creates monospecific stands that overtop the native shrubland vegetation (Breede Shale Renosterveld) and is thus considered a potential transformer species. Species distribution modelling also revealed large areas of climatically suitable habitat in the Western Cape, pointing to substantial invasion debt for the species in South Africa. Felling triggers seed release from serotinous capsules, resulting in prolific seedling recruitment after winter rains (up to similar to 18,000 seedlings/m(2)). No evidence of a soil-stored seed bank was found, and when plants are cut at ground level or treated with herbicide after cutting, plants do not resprout The invasive populations of this water-dispersed species are close to major rivers (the Berg and Breede), but the intervening countryside is largely transformed and is unfavourable for establishment. Much of the area downstream from the invaded area is open vegetation that is unsuitable for major recruitment but easy to survey and detect small plants. Consequently, although the extent of invasion is large (potentially 9185 ha), the invasion can be delimited with some confidence, and eradication is considered achievable since seeds only survive for about a year, seedlings achieve maturity after 4 years, and because the species is an obligate reseeder. Given the threats posed, eradication is desirable and M. parvistaminea should be listed as a category-1a invader (requiring compulsory control) under the proposed invasive species regulations under South Africa's National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (10/2004). We estimate that search and destroy operations could eradicate the species by 2021 at a cost of ZAR 3 475 000 (US$ 355 400). (C) 2014 SAAB. Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Global threats to plant-pollinator interactions are potentially serious in alpine ecosystems, which combine great diversity with particular fragility. We utilized tools from complex network theory to assess the robustness to species extinction of two Spanish alpine pollination networks. A comparison with ten additional alpine and subalpine pollination (ASP) networks allowed us to give our assessment a broader scope and provide a general view of ASP network robustness. We found a broad range of robustness among ASP networks. The two Spanish pollination networks ranked intermediate to high in robustness. This could be due to two of their structural features, connectance (proportion of potential interactions actually observed) and asymmetry (normalized difference between pollinator and plant richness), which showed a positive relationship with network robustness. A finer-scale focus on the two Spanish networks did not reveal differences between endemic and nonendemic plants in their functional role within the network but indicated that they differed in their robustness to pollinator extinction. Contrasting patterns across networks suggested that endemic robustness depends on community particularities. To improve the utility of robustness assessment as a conservation tool, we should increase our understanding on (1) the order in which network species will get extinct, (2) how species rewire once they have lost their partners, and (3) how much species depend on their mutualistic interaction.

AB Global climate change will remodel ecological communities worldwide. However, as a consequence of biotic interactions, communities may respond to climate change in idiosyncratic ways. This makes predictive models that incorporate biotic interactions necessary. We show how such models can be constructed based on empirical studies in combination with predictions or assumptions regarding the abiotic consequences of climate change. Specifically, we consider a well-studied ant community in North America. First, we use historical data to parameterize a basic model for species coexistence. Using this model, we determine the importance of various factors, including thermal niches, food discovery rates, and food removal rates, to historical species coexistence. We then extend the model to predict how the community will restructure in response to several climate-related changes, such as increased temperature, shifts in species phenology, and altered resource availability. Interestingly, our mechanistic model suggests that increased temperature and shifts in species phenology can have contrasting effects. Nevertheless, for almost all scenarios considered, we find that the most subordinate ant species suffers most as a result of climate change. More generally, our analysis shows that community composition can respond to climate warming in nonintuitive ways. For example, in the context of a community, it is not necessarily the most heat-sensitive species that are most at risk. Our results demonstrate how models that account for niche partitioning and interspecific trade-offs among species can be used to predict the likely idiosyncratic responses of local communities to climate change.

AB Biological invasions can transform our understanding of how the interplay of historical isolation and contemporary (human-aided) dispersal affects the structure of intraspecific diversity in functional traits, and in turn, how changes in functional traits affect other scales of biological organization such as communities and ecosystems. Because biological invasions frequently involve the admixture of previously isolated lineages as a result of human-aided dispersal, studies of invasive populations can reveal how admixture results in novel genotypes and shifts in functional trait variation within populations. Further, because invasive species can be ecosystem engineers within invaded ecosystems, admixture-induced shifts in the functional traits of invaders can affect the composition of native biodiversity and alter the flow of resources through the system. Thus, invasions represent promising yet under-investigated examples of how the effects of short-term evolutionary changes can cascade across biological scales of diversity. Here, we propose a conceptual framework that admixture between divergent source populations during biological invasions can reorganize the genetic variation underlying key functional traits, leading to shifts in the mean and variance of functional traits within invasive populations. Changes in the mean or variance of key traits can initiate new ecological feedback mechanisms that result in a critical transition from a native ecosystem to a novel invasive ecosystem. We illustrate the application of this framework with reference to a well-studied plant model system in invasion biology and show how a combination of quantitative genetic experiments, functional trait studies, whole ecosystem field studies and modeling can be used to explore the dynamics predicted to trigger these critical transitions.

AB The whooping crane (Grus americana), an endangered species, has been counted on its winter grounds in Texas, USA, since 1950 using fixed-wing aircraft. Many shortcomings of the traditional survey technique have been identified, calling into question its efficacy, defensibility, repeatability, and usefulness into the future. To improve and standardize monitoring effort, we began investigating new survey techniques. Here we focus on efficacy of line transect-based distance sampling during aerial surveys. We conducted a preliminary test of distance sampling during winter 2010-2011 while flying the traditional survey, which indicated that detectability within 500 m of transects was 0.558 (SE = 0.031). We then used an experimental decoy survey to evaluate impacts of observer experience, sun position, distance from transect, and group size on detectability. Our results indicated decoy detectability increased with group size and exhibited a quadratic relationship with distance likely due to pontoons on the aircraft. We found that detectability was 2.704 times greater when the sun was overhead and 3.912 times greater when the sun was at the observer's back than when it was in the observer's eyes. We found that an inexperienced observer misclassified non-target objects more often than an experienced observer. During the decoy experiment we used marks on the struts to categorize distances into intervals, but we found that observers misclassified distances 46.7% of the time (95% CI = 37.0-56.6%). Also, we found that detectability of individuals within detected groups was affected by group size and distance from transect. We discuss how these results inform design and implementation of future whooping crane monitoring efforts. Published 2013. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

AB Background and aims - Habitat destruction, eutrophication and fragmentation are the main drivers of plant extinctions. In addition to these environmental factors, it has been suggested that features related to intrinsic characteristics of the species play a role in their decline, however leading to widely divergent results. This paper aims at exploring whether intrinsic factors (species traits) can play a role in the decline of plant species, by specifically asking whether: (1) plant reproductive traits are significantly different between declining species and species that are doing well; and (2) these traits are related differently to species trend in different countries, suggesting context-dependent relationships.
   Methods - Species traits and trend indices were compared for large datasets from UK (1136 species) and Northern Belgium (1055 species) using multiple trait analysis (GLM) and single trait analysis (Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance).
   Key results - Of the ten traits considered, type of reproduction and pollen vector showed by far the strongest association with species trend, although differently in each of the datasets considered. Species trends were also associated to flower class, floral reward, diaspore type, dicliny and breeding system, but patterns were not consistent among countries confirming a context-dependence of these findings.
   Conclusions - The relationships between decline and plant traits likely depend primarily upon extrinsic (environmental) factors, which might explain the difficulty in recognising consistent patterns. Consequently, environmental degradation (e.g. habitat destruction) is likely the main driver of plant decline and may cause extinctions irrespective of species traits. This context-dependence of the findings indicates that reliably identifying those species most prone to extinction based on their reproductive traits is problematic. We therefore recommend great caution when interpreting patterns emerging from the study of species traits.

AB A temporally and spatially variable Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA) was established as a marine protected area along the US west coast in 2002 to protect stocks of rockfishes Sebastes spp. Since the RCA falls within the region sampled annually by the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey, we utilized data collected from 2003 to 2011 to evaluate whether establishment of the RCA influenced catch per unit effort (CPUE), species richness, and size distribution of demersal fishes. We compared CPUE and species richness among 3 management areas (continuously closed, periodically closed, and open to commercial bottom trawling) using analysis of covariance models that account for variability due to area, year, and depth. The most appropriate models for CPUE (35 species treated individually and aggregated into 6 subgroups) and species richness were selected using Akaike's information criterion. All of the best-fit models were highly significant (p < 0.0001), explaining 3 to 76% of the variation in catch. For 27 species and 5 subgroups, mean CPUE was significantly greater within the area continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling relative to areas periodically closed or open. The most appropriate model for richness included area and year, and mean richness was greatest in the area continuously closed to trawling. Species-specific length composition distributions were calculated from subsampled individual lengths for 31 species. Significant differences in length frequency distributions were observed, with a higher proportion (similar to 65%) of larger fish most often present in areas continuously closed to commercial bottom trawling (20 of 31 species) relative to other areas. Our data suggest that the RCA is an effective management tool for conserving not only rockfishes, but also other demersal fish species.

AB Karst topography links rainfall to groundwater recharge; therefore, possible changes in the hydrology can play an important role in ecosystem function especially in tropical dry forests where water is the most limiting resource. This study investigates the temporal variation in isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta D values) of rainwater and groundwater in the Guanica Dry Forest of southwestern Puerto Rico. The study not only establishes a dataset of oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of rainwater to assist in local ecohydrological studies but also establishes the origin of rainfall in the semiarid region of the island. The geographical position of Puerto Rico in the northeastern Caribbean causes the study site to receive marine air masses from the North Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. This research documents the monthly to annual variability in stable isotopic composition of rainwater and estimates the source of groundwater recharge in the Guanica Dry Forest. To calculate the local meteoric water line (LMWL), the authors analyzed the isotopic signatures of rainwater, collected at near-monthly intervals from January 2008 to December 2011. The LMWL (delta D 5 7.79 delta O-18 + 10.85) is close to the global meteoric water line (delta D 5 8.17 delta O-18 + 11.27). Isotopic signatures of rainwater for the Guanica Dry Forest are consistent with southeastern Caribbean, where rainfall is of marine origin with an annual cycle contributed by sea surface temperature (SST) and significant intermonthly fluctuations due to rainfall and winds during tropical weather events. The d-excess values in the period of data collection (2008-11) respond to the rainfall-evaporation balance, with little seasonal cycle and strong pulsing events. Comparison of rain and groundwater isotopic compositions in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) Guanica Dry Forest indicates that groundwater recharge is confined to rainfall events of more than 90 mm. Imbalances between rainfall and drought place cumulative stresses on ecosystems where plants and animals synchronize their growth phenology and reproduction to climatic patterns, especially in areas with variable annual cycles. Therefore, it is useful in ecohydrological studies to determine the origins and temporal dynamics of rainfall and groundwater recharge in the Caribbean, where predictions of climate models indicate drying trends.

AB Mutualisms are commonly threatened by parasites and cheaters: species that exploit the host-derived resources without providing an adequate service. Here, we summarize mechanisms for the stabilization of obligate defensive ant-plant mutualisms, a typical element of tropical lowland forests. Host plants exert partner choice and can sanction non-defending ants by shedding the domatia that serve as nesting space or ceasing the production of ant rewards. Hosts can also restrict the exploitation of the ant rewards by means of specific biochemical traits that decrease their quality for non-adapted generalist exploiters and, thus, convert them into exclusive rewards. Reward provisioning can even shift the competitive balance between mutualists and exploiters in favor of the mutualists. In turn, plant-ants show adaptations in their colony structure and changes in their digestive capacities that enhance their efficiency in the use of the host-derived resources. Founding queens use plant odors for host choice behavior, and ants not supplied with adequate amounts of EFN decrease their defensive service and thereby exert partner sanctions. Theoretical models and empirical research into mutualisms usually focus on actions that are taken by the host. Using ant-plants as model systems, we are now discovering the importance of contributions that come from the symbiont. This discovery indicates the potential for multiple reciprocal interactions between phenotypically plastic hosts and symbionts, which contribute significantly to what is still considered a miracle: the stability of mutualisms in the presence of exploiters.

AB Different environments are expected to exert differential selective pressures, often generating distinct sets of traits in organisms inhabiting different geographic regions. Starvation endurance is an important trait for organisms in harsh (i.e., extreme climate and/or biotically poor) and unpredictable environments. This is especially true for sit-and-wait predators, such as antlions, which experience stronger fluctuations in prey arrivals than do actively searching predators. We conducted an experimental comparison of starvation endurance in pit-building antlions, originating from semi-arid and hyper-arid environments. We hypothesized that individuals from the climatically harsher and biotically poor environment (i.e., hyper-arid) should be better adapted to endure long starvation periods. Additionally, we posited that faster-growing individuals are expected to be more sensitive to starvation because of their need to sustain higher metabolic rates. We found that antlions originating from the semi-arid region maintained higher activity levels, which led to slightly higher mass loss rates during starvation, but enabled faster recovery when food supply was renewed. Conversely, antlions originating from the hyper-arid region had lower activity levels, consistent with their lower rate of mass loss during starvation, but this came at the expense of decreased response to prey and lower growth rate when food became available again. Each strategy holds its advantages for coping with long starvation periods, and we cannot say decisively which strategy is better. Results from both regions were consistent with the predictions of the growth compensation phenomenon: antlions that were fed less frequently pre-starvation grew at faster rates when food supply was renewed. Our study demonstrates that individuals originating from different environments adopt different strategies in order to endure starvation, exemplifying antlions' ability to compensate for mass lost during starvation.

AB The boundaries between oceanographic domains often function as dispersal barriers for many temperate marine species with a dispersive pelagic larval phase. Yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus, YR) are widely distributed across the northeastern Pacific Ocean, inhabiting coastal rocky reefs from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska through southern California. This species exhibits an extended pelagic larval duration and has the capacity for long distance larval transport. We assayed 2,862 YR individuals from 13 general areas in the northeast Pacific Ocean for allelic variation at nine microsatellite loci. Bayesian model-based clustering analyses grouped individuals from the Strait of Georgia (SG) into a distinct genetic cluster, while individuals from outer coastal water locations (OCLs) were partitioned equally across two genetic clusters, including the cluster associated with the SG fish. Pairwise F-ST values were consistently an order of magnitude higher for comparisons between the SG and OCLs than they were for all OCL-OCL comparisons (similar to 0.016 vs. similar to 0.001). This same pattern was observed across two time points when individuals were binned into an "old" and "young" group according to birth year (old: similar to 0.020 vs. 0.0003; young: similar to 0.020 vs. similar to 0.004). Additionally, mean allelic richness was markedly lower within the SG compared to the OCLs (8.00 vs. 10.54-11.77). These results indicate that the Strait of Georgia "deep-basin" estuary oceanographic domain acts as a dispersal barrier from the outer coastal waters via the Juan de Fuca Strait. Alternatively, selection against maladapted dispersers across this oceanographic transition may underlie the observed genetic differentiation between the Georgia basin and the outer coastal waters, and further work is needed to confirm the SG-OCL divide acts as a barrier to larval dispersal.

AB Determining how competing species coexist is essential to understanding patterns of biodiversity. Indirect facilitation, in which a competitively dominant species exerts a positive effect on one competitor by more strongly suppressing a third, shared competitor, is a potentially potent yet understudied mechanism for competitive coexistence. Here we provide evidence for indirect facilitation in a guild of four African Acacia ant species that compete for nesting space on the host plant Acacia drepanolobium, showing that a competitively dominant acacia ant species indirectly creates establishment opportunities for the most subordinate species that may help to maintain diversity. Using long-term observational data and field experiments, we demonstrate that the competitively dominant ant species outcompetes two competitively intermediate species, while tolerating colonies of the subordinate competitor; this creates opportunities for local colonization and establishment of colonies of the subordinate species within the dominant species' territories. Host plants occupied by this subordinate species are then more likely to be colonized by the intermediate species, which in turn are more likely to be displaced by the dominant species. This process has the potential to generate a cyclical succession of ant species on host trees, contributing to stable coexistence within this highly competitive community.

AB We used population genetics to assess historical and modern demography of the exploited wavy top snail, Megastraea undosa, which has a 5-10 day pelagic larval duration. Foot tissue was sampled from an average of 51 individuals at 17 sites across the range of M. undosa. Genetic structure at the mtDNA locus is strikingly high (Phi(ST) of 0.19 across 1000 km), and a major cline occurs in northern Baja California (Phi(CT) per of 0.29 between northern and southern populations). Genetic data indicate that the northern region is highly connected through larval dispersal, whereas the southern region exhibits low genetic structure. However, additional analyses based on patterns of haplotype diversity and relationships among haplotypes indicate that M undosa has likely recently expanded into the Southern California Bight or expanded from a small refugial population, and analysis using isolation by distance to calculate dispersal distance indicates surprisingly short estimates of dispersal from 30 m to 3 km. This scenario of a northward expansion and limited larval dispersal is supported by coalescent-based simulations of genetic data. The different patterns of genetic variation between northern and southern populations are likely artifacts of evolutionary history rather than differences in larval dispersal and this may have applications to management of this species. Specifically, these data can help to inform the scale at which this species should be managed, and given the potentially very small dispersal distances, this species should be managed at local scales. Consideration of the evolutionary history of target species allows for a more accurate interpretation of genetic data for management.

AB The trapping of prey, where predators use external resources to help capture prey, is a specialized type of feeding behavior that is identified in the trace fossil record only rarely. Trapping traces that have been reported in the literature include spider webs, ant-lion burrows, scorpion pits, cerianthid tube anemone burrows, echiuran worm burrows, polychaete worm (Paraonis) burrows, and deep-sea graphoglyptids burrows. There is uncertainty, however, if all of these examples actually represent traps. Paraonis burrows, for example, have been represented as trapping traces, but there is a question if they actually represent this kind of behavioral strategy. Previous references and new field work indicate that Paraonis likely employs a selective deposit feeding strategy. In the fossil record, most of the known trapping traces are represented by spider webs, which are preserved in amber, and graphoglyptid burrows. Trace fossils that could represent trapping strategies may exhibit some basic morphological attributes, including (1) a conical depression composed of loose sediment; (2) an open pit; (3) a physical snare composed of a sticky substance; and/or (4) adequate spacing between the burrows, pits, or snare material without much overlapping. The interpretation that at least some graphoglyptids (e.g., Spirorhaphe) represent trapping was based on a tiapping model for Paraonis, but since Paraonis does not trap prey, the question arises whether graphoglyptids should be considered trapping at all. The variety of graphoglyptid morphologies supports the idea that graphoglyptids were not all doing the same thing. Previously, the ethological category of agrichnia has been applied to graphoglyptids and has been used to denote both trapping and farming behaviors, although the two behaviors display distinctly different feeding strategies. Some graphoglyptids may represent farming traces, while others may represent trapping traces, but it is unlikely that an individual burrow represented both behaviors. The new behavioral category 'irretichnia' is proposed here to encompass trapping trace fossils, due to its unique behavioral significance and also to separate trapping from farming.

AB Foliage dynamics of three functional tree types representing major components of the tropical montane evergreen forest in southern part of Central Ethiopia were compared. The species were Podocarpus falcatus (evergreen gymnosperm), Prunus africana (evergreen broadleaf), and Croton macrostachyus (facultative deciduous). The hypothesis examined is that in such tropical trees, endogenous control of foliage dynamics by the leaf life-spans (LLS) is largely dominant over external signals. Crown foliage turnover, leafiness of twigs, LLS, photosynthetic performance, respiration rate, specific leaf area, and relative growth rates of the stems were investigated. Foliage dynamics and leafiness of the twigs were monitored over 2 years while leaf traits were followed over 3 months. The degree of inter and intra-individual synchronization of foliage phenophases was examined to get an estimate of the contributions of endogenous and external signals to the dynamics of the foliages. Autoregression analysis indicated significant influence of the moisture regime on leaf sprouting of Croton and Podocarpus. During pronounced dry periods, new leaves were not developed. Analysis of phenological data using circular statistics revealed that in spite of strong inter-individual synchronization of leaf flush and fall (Podocarpus and Croton), the dynamics of individual parts of the crowns were less synchronized. LLS was independent of climate factors and it had substantial contribution to the control of foliage turnover. Moreover, examination of ecophysiological traits of developing leaves of the studied functional types showed differing patterns with LLS corroborating the ecophysiological characteristics. Although overlaid by fungal infestation, both the foliage and ecophysiological properties of Prunus resemble that of Podocarpus but the former exhibited a shorter LLS and slightly higher metabolic rates. Nevertheless, all species reacted positively to high moisture with respect to stem growth. In spite of largely differing weather conditions of the 2 years, direct competitive advantage of one of the species over the others could not be detected.

AB Quantitative comparisons of distribution and abundance of exotic species in their native and non-native ranges represent a first step when studying invaders. However, this approach is rarely applied 2 particularly to tree species. Using biogeographical contrasts coupled with regional dispersal surveys, we assessed whether two exotic maple tree species, Acer negundo and Acer platanoides, can be classified as invasive in the non-native regions surveyed. We also examined the importance of biogeography in determining the degree of invasion by exotic species using this reciprocal approach. Local-scale surveys were conducted in a total of 34 forests to compare density, relative abundance, age structure of native and introduced populations, and whether the two introduced maple species negatively affected native tree species density. Regional-scale surveys of a total of 136 forests were then conducted to assess distribution in the introduced regions. Introduced populations of A. negundo were denser than populations measured in their native range and negatively related to native tree species density. Age structure did not differ between regions for this species. At the regional scale, this species has invaded most of the riparian corridors sampled in France. Conversely, the density of A. platanoides introduced populations was similar to that of native populations and was not related to native tree species density. Although seedling recruitment was higher away than at home, this species has invaded only 9% of the forests sampled in southern Ontario, Canada. Although reported invasive, these two exotic maple species differed in their relative demographic parameters and regional spread. Acer negundo is currently invasive in southern France while A. platanoides is not aggressively invasive in southern Ontario. Importantly, this study effectively demonstrates that biogeography through structured contrasts provide a direct means to infer invasion of exotic species.

AB Accurately estimating abundance of wildlife is critical for establishing effective conservation and management strategies. Aerial methodologies for estimating abundance are common in developed countries, but they are often impractical for remote areas of developing countries where many of the world's endangered and threatened fauna exist. The alternative terrestrial methodologies can be constrained by limitations on access, technology, and human resources, and have rarely been comprehensively conducted for large terrestrial mammals at landscape scales. We attempted to overcome these problems by incorporating local peoples into a simultaneous point count of Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) and goitered gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa) across the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area, Mongolia. Paired observers collected abundance and covariate metrics at 50 observation points and we estimated population sizes using distance sampling theory, but also assessed individual observer error to examine potential bias introduced by the large number of minimally trained observers. We estimated 5671 (95% CI = 3611-8907) wild asses and 5909 (95% CI = 3762-9279) gazelle inhabited the 11,027 km(2) study area at the time of our survey and found that the methodology developed was robust at absorbing the logistical challenges and wide range of observer abilities. This initiative serves as a functional model for estimating terrestrial wildlife abundance while integrating local people into scientific and conservation projects. This, in turn, creates vested interest in conservation by the people who are most influential in, and most affected by, the outcomes. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sand-dwelling antlion larvae are well known predators with a highly specialized prey-catching strategy, which either construct efficient pitfall traps or bury themselves in the sand ambushing prey on the surface. Although habitat selection in antlions has been extensively studied, little is known about the role substrate density plays in such behavioural decisions. We thus first quantified the natural substrate densities of 13 antlion species by collecting soil samples from 18 different field sites. We found that natural substrate densities varied from 121 g/l to 1562 g/l. The substrate densities of three non-pit-building species (Neuroleon microstenus, Distoleon tetragrammicus. Nophis teillardi) ranged from medium to high, while those of obligatory pit-builders (Euroleon nostras and eight Myrmeleon species) were more variable. The substrate density of the facultative pit-builder Cueta sp. was high. Next, we explored the responses of the pit-building antlion E nostras to different substrate densities using both a habitat choice and a complementary no-choice experiment. We hypothesized that antlions should be capable of distinguishing between substrate types and that pit size should decrease with increased substrate density. When allowed to choose among eight substrate densities, E. nostras larvae preferred to build their pits in the fractions with low densities (i.e., 121, 353 and 512 g/l) and only a small proportion constructed pits in high density fractions (i.e., 1312 and 1546 g/l). A complementary no-choice experiment demonstrated that pit diameter, pit depth and pit angle were negatively correlated with substrate density. These reductions in pit size can negatively affect prey capture success. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The comparison of some elephants count methods - aerial sampling count, aerial total count and direct foot count - has been presented through surveys' study cases implemented in Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. We compare them in terms of effort and cost to survey an area (sampling efficiency), efficiency in data collection (detection efficiency) as well as accuracy and precision. Aerial sampling count returns low sampling and detection efficiency and very low precision and accuracy figures when counting elephants populations below 0.5 elephant. km(-2). Precision can partly be improved by stratification. Direct foot count returns the best sampling and detection efficiency but insufficient data number to produce reliable estimates. Therefore some authors often produced no results for elephants. Aerial total count is a costly method in absolute value. It requires important logistic and no measure of error is possible. However it provides relatively good sampling and detection efficiency as well as relatively accurate figures appreciated by wildlife managers if technical requirements are respected. Aerial total count could be recommended to survey small population of West African elephants each 3 to 5 years to minimize yearly count costs.

AB We tested the hypothesis that exposure to antibiotics alters the growth and reproductive responses of Daphnia magna to changing stoichiometric food quality. To do so, we measured growth and reproduction of differentially P-nourished Daphnia in the presence and absence of sublethal concentrations of antibiotics. We found that exposure to an antibiotic cocktail significantly reduced an index of the microbial load of Daphnia and altered its growth responses to changing dietary P-content. Growth rates of Daphnia consuming the most P-rich and P-poor food increased with antibiotic exposure but were negatively or not affected in animals eating mildly to moderately P-limiting food. Similar effects were found in a subsequent experiment where daphnid neonates were exposed to natural bacterial communities prior to receiving antibiotics and being fed different food C:P ratios. In contrast, antibiotic effects on Daphnia reproduction were either not detected (number and size of broods) or were relatively minor (day of first reproduction). We also found no evidence that gut flora provides defense against pathogenic bacterial infection; instead, infection rates in Daphnia by a bacterial microparasite, Pasteuria ramosa, decreased in animals that had experienced prior antibiotic exposure. Our results demonstrate that antibiotic exposure reduced the microbial load and altered growth rates of an important zooplankton herbivore. Given the mediating role of animal's food C:P ratio, our results show that interactions between Daphnia and its microbial symbionts vary in strength and nature partly with the host's nutritional state.

AB Harpacticoids owe their 'reputation' as primary consumers in aquatic food webs to their substantial grazing on diatoms, thus assuring an efficient energy flow to higher trophic levels. Due to the complex feeding behavior of harpacticoids, the nature and dynamics of diatom-harpacticoid trophic interactions remain poorly understood. In addition, there is a growing interest from aquaculture industry in mass-culturing harpacticoids with algal foods but the labor costs of maintaining algal stock cultures are high. This study focuses on the palatability of preserved diatoms for copepods and considers the possible role of bacterially mediated effects on diatom food uptake.
   The grazing of Paramphiascella fulvofasciata on a preserved freeze-dried diatom diet was tested and compared to the grazing on fresh cells. P. fulvofasciata assimilated the preserved diet, but assimilation of fresh cells was higher. When both cell types were mixed, no selective feeding was observed. Community fingerprinting of the bacteria associated with diatoms and fecal pellets suggests that the copepod gut flora was modified depending on the food source. Furthermore, the results suggest that the egestion of gut bacteria enriches the microenvironment and this can have an additional influence on the feeding behavior of the copepod.
   Experimental research using preserved foods must take into account that copepod grazing assimilations of fresh foods are likely to be significantly higher. Yet, the stated high assimilation of the mixed diet, encourages further exploration of the application of preserved 'balanced' foods for harpacticoid mass-culturing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB To assess the impact of aquaculture activities, we measured the primary production, total sediment oxygen consumption, and benthic nutrient flux at two aquaculture farms (sea squirt and oyster) and one reference site. The estimated primary production in the water column ranged from 19-169 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Total sediment oxygen consumption rates ranged from 58 to 328 mmol m(-2) d(-1), 1.1 to 40 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for nitrogen, 0.17 to 3.0 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for phosphate, and 7.3 to 74 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for silicate. The average total sediment oxygen consumption at the longline farms was > 2.5 times higher than the reference site. Nitrate was significantly removed by denitrification at the longline farms in July and September and ranged from -5.4 to -0.09 mmol m(-2) d(-1), which is higher than for other coastal sediments. The benthic fluxes of nitrogen and phosphate at longline farms were up to 16 and six times higher than at the reference site, respectively. The average nitrogen requirements of the primary producers were 9.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at the sea squirt farm, 7.0 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at the oyster farm, and 13.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at the reference site, corresponding to 88, 316, and 27.2% of the nitrogen supplied by benthic fluxes, respectively. Our results suggest that benthic nutrient fluxes at longline farms are a major nutrient source for primary production in coastal waters.

AB The destruction of wetlands due to afforestation areas is a common activity in temperate and subtropical regions in Southern America. The expansion of pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) in the Coastal Plain of Southern Brazil is critical and its impacts on aquatic biodiversity are little known. We tested the hypotheses that: (1) pine occurrence diminishes the macrophyte richness and changes the macrophyte composition in ponds; (2) beta-diversity between natural and pine ponds is determined mainly by species nestedness (species loss). Sampling was carried out from 2007 to 2009 in five ponds in pine invasion matrix and five ponds in native grassland matrix. In natural ponds, the total richness was 87 species, followed by 51 species in pine ponds. From the total richness, 42 species were shared between natural and pine ponds. The natural ponds were richer than the pine ponds along the entire study, and the composition of macrophyte species was different between natural and pine ponds. Comparing natural ponds with each other and pine ponds with each other, the species turnover (species replacement) was determinant for beta-diversity, however, when we compared natural and pine ponds, we found that nestedness and species turnover were equivalent for beta-diversity. The increase in the nestedness mechanism indicates that the pine occurrence implies in species loss in Southern Brazil ponds. The change of hydroperiod may be one of the causes for the macrophyte species loss. The removal of pine from areas destined to conservation in Southern Brazil is urgent as well as a proper management of pine plantations in order to minimise its expansions and impacts in the aquatic biodiversity, since 90% of its wetlands have been already lost.

AB Although fire is frequent in African savanna ecosystems and may cause considerable loss of nitrogen (N), N-2-fixing herbaceous legumes-which could be expected to benefit from low N conditions-are usually not abundant. To investigate possible reasons for this scarcity, we conducted a pot experiment using two common plants of humid African savannas as model species, the legume Cassia mimosoides and the C-4 grass Hyperthelia dissoluta. These species were grown at different levels of water, N and phosphorus (P), both in monoculture and in competition with each other. In the monocultures, yields were significantly increased by the combined addition of N and P in pots receiving high water supply. In pots with interspecific competition, the legume grew poorly unless P was added. Foliar delta 15N values of legume plants grown in mixtures were considerably lower than those in monocultures, suggesting that rates of symbiotic N-fixation were higher in the presence of the grass. Grass delta 15N values, however, were also lower in mixtures, while N concentrations were higher, indicating a rapid transfer of N from the legume to the grass. We conclude that the main reason for the low abundance of C. mimosoides is not low P availability as such, but a greater ability of H. dissoluta to compete for soil N and P, and a much higher N-use efficiency. If other C-4 grasses have a similar competitive advantage, it could explain why herbaceous legumes are generally sparse in African savannas. We encourage others to test these findings using species from other types of savanna vegetation.

AB Rock-pools have specific environmental characteristics, usually with multiple short and unpredictable hydroperiods in 1 season. This requires a specific set of life-history adaptations of their permanent inhabitants, which affects species occurrence. In Southern African rock-pools, large branchiopods are usually represented by Branchipodopsis species. During an intensive sampling campaign in 2004 in the Western Cape of South Africa, a population of Streptocephalus purcelli Sars, 1898 was discovered for the first time in a clear rock-pool with a short hydroperiod. Its usual habitat is a more turbid mud-pool with a longer hydroperiod. We investigated under standard laboratory conditions the differences in early life-history traits between the rock-pool population and a conspecific mud-pool population. Dormant eggs of the rock-pool population were smaller than those of the mud-pool population. The smaller larvae also hatched earlier. These characteristics are in accordance with what is expected for populations living in ephemeral systems. The rock-pool population, on the other hand, also exhibited a higher total hatching percentage, a longer hatching duration, a longer maturation time and a lower mortality. Although, deduced from the last mentioned life-history traits, S. purcelli seemed not well-adapted to unpredictable and ephemeral rock-pool habitats, they could probably occur due to the absence of the competitively stronger species in the region or due to dispersal and mass effects.

AB Information on the distribution of animal populations is essential for conservation planning and management. Unfortunately, shared coordinate-level data may have the potential to compromise sensitive species and generalized data are often shared instead to facilitate knowledge discovery and communication regarding species distributions. Sharing of generalized data is, unfortunately, often ad hoc and lacks scalable conventions that permit consistent sharing at larger scales and varying resolutions. One common convention in African applications is the Quarter Degree Grid Cells (QDGC) system. However, the current standard does not support unique references across the Equator and Prime Meridian. We present a method for extending QDGC nomenclature to support unique references at a continental scale for Africa. The extended QDGC provides an instrument for sharing generalized biodiversity data where laws, regulations or other formal considerations prevent or prohibit distribution of coordinate-level information. We recommend how the extended QDGC may be used as a standard, scalable solution for exchange of biodiversity information through development of tools for the conversion and presentation of multi-scale data at a variety of resolutions. In doing so, the extended QDGC represents an important alternative to existing approaches for generalized mapping and can help planners and researchers address conservation issues more efficiently.

AB We assessed presence/absence prediction of plant species and communities in a southern Mongolian mountain range from geospatial data using a randomized sampling approach. One hundred randomized vegetation samples (3 x 3 m) were collected within the 2 x 2 km summit region of the Dund Saykhan range, which forms part of the core zone of the Gobi Gurvan Saykhan National Park in arid southern Mongolia. Using logistic regression, habitat preference models for all abundant species (n = 52) and communities (n = 5) were constructed; predictors were derived from Landsat 5 imagery and a digital elevation model. Nagelkerkes r (2) was used for an initial data mining, and all significant models were validated by splitting the data and using one half for accuracy assessment based on the AUC (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve)-values. Significant models could be built for half of the species. Altitude proved to be the most important predictor followed by variables derived from Landsat data. The clear altitudinal distribution patterns most definitely reflect precipitation; overall biodiversity in this arid environment is widely controlled by moisture availability. The chosen approach may prove valuable for applied studies wherever spatial data on species distributions are required for conservation efforts.

AB Shrub encroachment is a widely observed problem in Southern African savannas. Although the effects of herbivory and grass height on woody species recruitment have been studied individually, little information exists about how these factors interact. In this study seeds and seedlings of the encroaching shrub Dichrostachys cinerea were planted in clipped and unclipped grass plots, with and without large herbivores present. Seed germination, seedling survival and seedling predation were monitored for 8 months. Germination started earlier in plots where herbivores were excluded. Overall, the earlier the seeds germinated, the longer the seedlings survived. Clipping positively affected the number of germinated seeds, seedling growth and survival but effects varied among herbivore exclusion treatments and sites. Invertebrates caused the majority of the seedling damage. We conclude the recruitment of D. cinerea is influenced by the interplay of grass height and herbivory. In this study, the presence of large herbivores early in the wet season, and the absence of simulated grazing later on, affected the regeneration of D. cinerea negatively. However, differences in effects among sites suggest that the mechanisms found here may work differently in other habitats.

AB Soil C and N were measured from a chronosequence of adjacent riparian forest sites located along the floodplain terrace of the San Antonio Fiver. The communities were 25, 39, 45, 47, 49, and 53 yr past long-term farmland use. Four of these sites (25, 45, 49, and 53 yr old) were also sampled 20 yr ago. Soil C was significantly greater after 20 yr of community development; however, the increase was dependent on the community age. Soil C increased by 38 g kg(-1) in the 49-yr-old community during the 20-yr period, but only 11 to 15 g kg(-1) in the 25, 45-, and 53-yr-old communities. Soil N was significantly greater (1.7-2.5 g kg(-1)) after 20 yr of development for communities 25, 45, and 49 yr old. In the oldest community (53 yr old), no significant increase was seen in soil N after 20 yr. No significant spatial differences [underneath the canopy of Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd. vs. intercanopy grassland] were found in soil C and N in the 25-yr-old community. The late successional dominant Celtis laevigata Willd., total woody plant density, and total woody plant basal area could be explained by soil C or N. Changes in soil C and N through time parallel other studies, increasing through the early- and mid-successional stages and decreasing from the mid- to late-successional stages. Spatial differences in soil C and N that existed in the 15-yr-old community disappeared in the 25-yr-old community as A. farnesiana basal area increased from 0.7 to 13 m(2) ha(-1).

AB Acacia species are important components of bush encroachment and browse production in Africa. Goats are both abundant and regarded as useful biological agents of woody plant control, but compensatory regrowth responses can reduce the impacts of herbivory. Compensatory/overcompensatory regrowth of woody plants following herbivory is postulated to be most likely to occur when resources are not limiting, but the responses of Acacia seedlings to resource-browsing interactions have not been studied. A split-plot experiment was conducted to investigate effects of irrigation, N fertiliser and grass cover on growth and biomass allocation of Acacia karroo seedlings after early wet season clipping in a semi-arid savanna. Responses were estimated at the end of the wet season. Compensatory/overcompensatory regrowth occurred when water was added without grass cover. Clipping increased the mean leaf-shoot mass ratio and had either neutral or positive effects on spine:leaf and spine:shoot ratios that appeared to be unrelated to resources. We postulate that in conditions of heavy grazing that reduce grass biomass, it is more difficult to control Acacia seedlings with goats in wet than in dry years. This is important to consider for bush control because Acacia seedling recruitment is believed to be high in wet years, when control by goats may be most difficult. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Small-scale habitat complexity has been shown to influence interspecific competition and resource use in ant communities. Nevertheless, in Mediterranean communities, where temperature variations have a stronger effect on the foraging of subordinate species than competition by dominants, the effect of small-scale habitat complexity on resource use by ants is unknown. We investigated the influence of an experimental spatial mosaic of microhabitats (interior, edge and open) on the dynamics of resource use in a guild of ants of a Mediterranean grassland. We used baits containing one of three food resource types (honey, tuna and seeds) placed in the different microhabitats. Variation in resource use among microhabitats appears to result from differential responses among ant species to small-scale spatial heterogeneity. Analysis of frequency of occurrence, number of foragers and monopoly at baits of ant species indicated that the resource use and recruitment intensity was modified by microhabitat, once the effect of temperature was removed from the analysis. Thus, foraging activity and competitive interactions of ant species were influenced by the different microhabitats apart from temperature, which suggests an effect of small-scale structural complexity. Small-scale spatial variations in structural complexity have an effect in resource use by most ants in this system that is not wholly explained by differences in temperature. Finally, this suggests that microhabitat may be one factor influencing the outcome of the dominance hierarchies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of urbanization on nutrient cycling is vaguely known. Here we document that birds, especially those increasing in urban areas ( such as crows, Corvus macrorhynchos and C. corone), affect nutrient cycles. Using fecal traps, we measured phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) input from the excrement of birds in fragmented forests in an urban landscape. Sources of avian feces were examined on the basis of carbon ( C), N, and P percentages and stable isotopes of delta N-15 and delta C-13. Nitrogen and P input was aggregated in the urban landscape, being especially high at the forest where crows roosted during winter. The annual P input due to bird droppings ( range 0.068-0.460 kg (.) ha(-1) (.) yr(-1); mean 0.167 kg (.) ha(-1) (.) yr(-1)) was 12.4% of the total of other pathways in typical forests and 52.9% in the evergreen forest where crows roosted. The annual N input due to bird droppings ( range 0.44-3.49 kg (.) ha(-1) (.) yr(-1); mean 1.15 kg (.) ha(-1) (.) yr(-1)) was 5.2% of the total of other pathways in typical forests and 27.0% in the evergreen forest used by roosting crows. Expected sources of nutrients in feces included insects in the breeding season, fruits in autumn, and mammals and birds in winter. Stable isotopes suggested that the source of nutrients in forests used by roosting crows was from outside the forest. Therefore, birds played a significant role as transporters of nutrients from garbage (including fish, livestock, and/or C-4 plants such as corn, with high delta N-15 and delta C-13) in residential and business areas to fragmented evergreen forests, especially near their winter roosts.

AB This research was undertaken to determine the natural regeneration potential of native boreal forest species following oil sands mining. The objective was to investigate the potential of two natural and locally available propagule sources (i.e. peat, and the litter and humus layer (LFH) of the forest floor) and two application depths (i.e. 10 and 20cm) to enhance native plant establishment and diversity. A large-scale experiment was designed to assess treatment response at an operational level. In a controlled growth chamber, seeds and vegetative propagules were enumerated; in the field, plots were assessed for total canopy cover, canopy cover by species and species density. Preliminary growth chamber results indicate that application depth was the main influence on the number of viable propagules, while field results indicate that both propagule source and application depth are influencing vegetation establishments. LFH appears promising for oil sands revegetation, with a 20cm application depth recommended for early community development.

AB At an intertidal site on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, the abundance of the invasive barnacle Chthamalus proteus was negatively correlated with abundance of the native limpet Siphonaria normalis. As the substratum at this site was a conglomerate of materials, we hypothesized that the observed pattern was the result of differences in substratum preferences, and/or negative interactions between the 2 species, or both. We used manipulative field experiments to test these hypotheses, and then generalized our findings with surveys across several sites that differed in substratum type and abundances of barnacles and limpets. The limpet recruited in highest numbers to light-colored substrata. The barnacle settled in highest numbers on rough substrata, with a trend toward higher settlement on dark-colored substrata. Surprisingly, in experimental plots, recruitment of the barnacle was positively correlated with the density of the limpet. In contrast, limpet densities increased in experimental plots from which barnacles had been removed. Thus the pattern at this site appears to result from a combination of substratum preferences and interactions between the 2 species. These experiments and surveys of other intertidal sites on Oahu suggest that (1) limpets and barnacles have little effect on each other at low densities, (2) at higher densities limpets facilitate settlement of barnacles, but barnacles have a negative effect on limpets, and (3) substratum type can mediate the density-dependent interactions between these 2 species by affecting their settlement patterns.

AB The gait length and width and faecal pellet diameter of bilbies were examined to determine whether these measures could be used to accurately identify different age classes of individuals in the field. There was a good relationship between gait width+length and animal size that allowed the identification of three age classes: immature-independent individuals <500 g, mature females and small males 500-1200 g, and large males >1700 g. The relationship between pellet diameter and animal size was not as strong and faecal pellet diameter was suitable to identify only immature-independent individuals. An application of these measurements to a bilby population in the Tanami Desert indicated that immature individuals were limited to the central half of their current distribution whereas medium-sized individuals were distributed throughout.

AB Freshwater fairy shrimp that live in episodically filled rainpools are obligate bisexual animals that produce drought-resistant, encapsulated embryos called cysts. A fraction of these hatches upon each inundation, a bet-hedging strategy, and the resulting larvae grow in a concerted manner, forming a cohort. Here, we show that in the Sudan fairy shrimp, Streptocephalus proboscideus, about one-third of the cysts hatches shortly after being released from the brood-sac, without intervening period of drought. However, as long as the adult population overshoots a density of about one specimen per litre, the emerging nauplii are cannibalized by their parents. At such a density and above it, fairy shrimp filter the whole pond volume in less than 24 h and since it takes about the same amount of time for first-instar nauplii to moult to an immune size, they are all consumed. In addition to being auto-regulatory, this behaviour is adaptive: animals fed their own nauplii on top of an algal diet showed a 30% increase in reproductive output, and an increase in somatic growth rate. This allocation almost quantitatively recouped the loss of inclusive fitness to cannibalism. In contrast, hatching percentages of cysts obtained from animals fed this nauplii-supplement were the same as in algal-fed animals, such that their bet-hedging strategy remains intact and is carried forward to the next generation.

AB African Acacias are often major contributors to the progressive increase in the woody component of savannas, a phenomenon commonly referred to as bush encroachment. They produce large quantities of seed and may have large soil-stored seed banks. In Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park, the number of adult Acacia nilotica trees per hectare far exceed that of A. karroo adults. The relative dominance is reversed in the juvenile stage with A. karroo outnumbering A. nilotica threefold outside closed woodlands. Acacia karroo trees were smaller than A. nilotica trees on average, but produced more seeds for a given basal diameter size class. Acacia karroo showed less bruchid infestation than A. nilotica at all stages of pod development. Unlike A. nilotica, a proportion of A. karroo seeds was able to germinate after bruchid attack. We detected no difference between the two species in the soil-stored seed bank or in the viability of seeds found in the seed bank.

AB We quantified aspects of the breeding biology of Whiskered Auklets (Aethia pygmaea) at Buldir Island, western Aleutian Islands, Alaska, from 1993 to 1998 to provide a better understanding of this poorly known species' ecological relationship to other auklets (Aethia spp.). Whiskered Auklets nest in rock crevices in a range of habitats including talus slopes, cliffs, and beaches. No physical characteristic of nesting crevices predicted breeding success. Hatching dates varied among years; mean hatching dates averaged 20 June +/-6.8 days (range 16-27 June). Chicks remained in the nest for 39 :L 2 days, with mean annual fledging from 27 to 29 July. Eggs were 44.1 +/- 1.6 mm in length and 31.1 +/- 1.61 mm in breadth, and varied significantly in size among years. Chicks weighed 17.4 +/- 2.4 g (15.6% of adult mass) within two days of hatching and gained 3.8 g day(-1) in mass and 3.2 mm day(-1) in wing length during the linear growth period. Chicks fledged at 101.3 +/- 11.3 g (90.5% adult mass) after a prefledging mass recession of 8.9% of peak mass, and a wing length of 102.2 +/- 4.3 mm (93.5% adult wing length). Mass increase during the linear growth period and fledging mass varied among years, but wing growth and fledging wing length did not. Parents provisioned chicks after nightfall with copepods (Neocalanus spp.) and euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.); the proportion of food types varied significantly among years. Eighty-nine percent of chicks that hatched survived to fledge; most of those that did not had died of starvation. Low-intensity monitoring underestimated breeding success but provided useful comparative information. Whiskered Auklets exhibited a suite of unique characteristics that make them an ecological outlier among Aethia auklets.

AB Puddles of rain water on the surfaces of rock exposures are a little known but very common habitat for freshwater-dwelling animals. In Africa, these are inhabited by the larvae of two taxa of fly unique to these pools. One of these includes species able to survive dry periods in situ; the other includes species that must reach adulthood and migrate to survive periods when the pool is dry. Hence, the opportunity exists for a comparative study of adaptation among these species. Since puddles are small, our principal method in the study of adaptation has been the experimental manipulation of puddles and their faunas in the wild. Using this method we were able to identify the spatial consistency of pools and their unpredictable duration during the rainy season as the main selective pressure shaping adaptation. Adaptations include diapause and adaptive adjustment of the life cycle. It is the second of these that provides the focus of our interest here.

AB Photosynthetic responses to moisture, light, temperature, salinity and inorganic nitrogen fertilization are reported for a shore-zone lichen Turgidiusculum complicatulum (formerly Mastodia tesselata), a possible recent introduction to sub-Antarctic Marion Island.
   Optimum moisture contents for net photosynthesis were 225-346% lash free, dry mass). Net CO2 exchange was dominated by a strong temperature dependence of respiration rate. Net photosynthetic rate responded sharply to increasing PPFD and saturated below 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), but electron transport rate (ETR) increased up to approx. 900 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) PPFD suggesting that gross photosynthesis responded to light to this level. Nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching increased rapidly with PPFD up to approx. 400 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and thereafter more slowly. Even at high PPFD (1050 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) most PSII centres were open.
   Salinity did not significantly influence CO2 assimilation rate; however, NH4NO3 significantly depressed net photosynthesis rate at all salinities except 100% seawater. ETR and dark respiration rate were increased by NH4NO3.
   The response of T. complicatulum to light and temperature enables high rates of CO2 assimilation under the island's microclimatic regime; if sufficiently hydrated, the lichen would exhibit near maximal photosynthesis rates for approx. 75% of the photoperiod over the year.

AB Reproductive parameters of Australasian Gannets Morus serrator breeding at Pope's Eye in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia were examined in the 1994-95 breeding period. Contents of individual nests were determined during routine visits, and eggs and chicks measured. Nests and breeding birds were assigned to groups based on position and adults of known age (previously banded as chicks) as indicators. A severe storm in November 1994 removed most nests and resulted in extensive re-laying, particularly by order (centrally nesting) birds. The ability to re-lay and successfully raise young suggested that food (preferentially Pilchards Sardinops sagax, although gannets take a wide range of fish at this location) was not limiting, being abundant even towards later stages of the breeding cycle. 'Older' adults formed more central nests, laid earlier, and replaced more lost eggs than younger birds. Chicks of older adults were produced earlier and were heavier at comparable ages than those of younger birds. Age influences some reproductive parameters, and hence lifetime reproductive success, in this species as it does in other seabirds.

AB In order to study the potential impact of the soil microarthropod Onychiurus fimatus (Collembola) on the microbial community, we analysed the fate of luciferase marker gene tagged bacterial strains fed to young adult specimens in petri dish microcosm experiments. In farces collected from O. fimatus, Escherichia coli S17-1/pRP4luc and Sinorhizobium meliloti L33 were only detectable for 2 days after feeding whereas strain HR2/pRP4luc, a close relative of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, isolated from another collembolan species, could be detected for 16 days. The amount of shed cells of strain HR2 increased during the frequent releases of the cast-off skins (exuvia). In order to analyse whether gut associated bacteria could serve as recipients for mobile genetic elements, plasmid-bearing E. coli donor strains were incubated with faeces in filter mating-like experiments and, in other experiments, directly fed to O. fimatus specimens. Transconjugants were obtained with both the conjugative self-transferable broad host range plasmid pRP4luc and the mobilisable (Mob(+)) broad host range plasmid pSUP104luc, the latter, however, only with a mobilising donor strain. No transfer was detected with the narrow host range plasmids pSUP202luc (Mob(+)), pUC18luc (Mob(-)), or with the broad host range transposon delivery plasmid pUTluxCDABE (Mob(+)). Transconjugants of pRP4luc were detected within one day of the beginning of a feeding experiment and then throughout the incubation period of two weeks, with gaps of no detection after 5, 12 and 14 days, probably caused by moulting. The results of this study indicate that Feeding activities of collembola can modify the structure of soil-inhabiting microbial communities and enhance the spread of plasmids from non-indigenous to indigenous soil bacteria.

AB Data from tropical reservoirs in equatorial Africa and,America are re-assessed in an attempt to show that: (1) the predictability of seasonal events is low in the tropics as compared to the temperate zone, while that of diel episodes is much higher in tropical than in temperate habitats; (2) the high predictability of diel episodes results in conspicuous lunar periodicity in tropical habitats; (3) seasonality is fueled from the bottom up and is thus most clearly displayed at the lowest trophic level, while diel rhythms are fueled top-down and are most distinct at higher trophic levels; (4) there are many factors intrinsic to the tropics that might enhance or weaken diel or seasonal periodicity as well as yield a decrease in predictability through the inclusion of chaotic changes in densities of keystone species; (5) reservoirs differ from natural lakes in specific features that stem from their peculiar hydrology as well as from a specific biota which reflects the shortage of time for long-term succession and evolutionary adjustments, especially to predation (the governing factor in offshore habitats); this difference is more conspicuous in the tropics than in the temperate zone.

AB In the Recent biota, species of the hipponicid gastropod genus Sabia that excavate characteristic pits on the outer surfaces of shells of reef-dwelling gastropods and hermit crabs occur only in the tropical Indo-West Pacific region and in adjacent warm-temperate parts of Japan and Australia. I report the discovery of Sabia pits in reef-associated gastropod shells from the Cercado (late Miocene) and Gurabo (early Pliocene) Formations of the Dominican Republic. The likely culprit was Hipponix otiosa Pilsbry and Johnson, 1917, a species here reassigned to Sabia Gray, 1840. Pliocene extinction, which was far more severe in the Caribbean and elsewhere in the western Atlantic than in the Indo-West Pacific, selectively eliminated Sabin and its commensalism from Atlantic reef ecosystems. This case is one of several examples indicating the vulnerability of specialized associations to extinction-causing disturbances.

AB 1. We measured growth performance of six species of tropical pelagic seabirds on Midway Islands during the 1981-83 breeding seasons, which encompassed a major Ei Nino event with profound effects on seabirds in the tropical Pacific and elsewhere.
   2. Analyses were based upon mass and short-term increments of mass and wing length normalized with respect to tl-le size (wing length) of the chick.
   3. We investigated contributions of year, date within year, and individual to variation in growth performance.
   4. We could not detect a marked effect of the 1982-83 El Nino at Midway Islands, Year-to-year differences in short-term growth increments were not significant for any species, although masses of chicks of sooty terns were, on average, significantly lower in 1983 than in 1982.
   5. We did detect significant short-term variation in growth in all species. Runs tests revealed that the periods of variation were short, generally of the same order as our measurement intervals.
   6. Variation in growth performance was not correlated among species, suggesting a general independence of variation in food availability to each species.
   7. Growth performance of individuals within each species was significantly homogeneous, indicating consistently negative correlations between amounts of food delivered in successive intervals to individual chicks.
   8. Our results do nor support the widely held notion of extreme variability and unpredictability of food resources and feeding conditions in the tropical pelagic environment. Thus, such adaptations of pelagic seabirds as low reproductive rates, slow postnatal development, and accumulation of lipid reserves are not necessarily linked to variability and unpredictability of the marine environment.

AB The pulmonate limpets Siphonaria japonica and Siphonaria sirius occur over a wide range of local habitat types in terms of exposure to wave action and salinity. This is a study of these two species on three different shore types in Hong Kong, ranging from an extremely exposed, high salinity (32-35 parts per thousand) shore at Cape d'Aguilar to a sheltered, low salinity (16-33 parts per thousand) shore at Tai Lam Chung. Both species are restricted to the low shore, year round. S. japonica is a winter breeder and recruitment occurred between October and January. The recruitment of S. sirius could not be recognised from the size-frequency histograms. The algal standing crop at Tai Lam Chung was higher than at Wu Kwai Sha during the winter period, i.e., be tween October and April. Seasonal fluctuations in growth rate were recorded for both Siphonaria species with the time of fastest growth occurring in winter. S. japonica grew faster at Tai Lam Chung than at Wu Kwai Sha. Food availability is thought to he an important factor affecting growth.

AB The influence of a black-headed gull (Larus ridibundus L.) colony on the soil and the vegetation was studied on an island located on the river Vistula, Poland in 1987-89. A direct effect of the presence of a gull colony was an increase in the content of ammonium nitrogen in soil due manuring by gulls. The effect of the birds was more pronounced in the sandy part than in the earthy part, this being related to a higher fertility of the latter. The gull-affected sites had a higher percentage plant cover, and with a larger total % cover of grasses. Some plant species tended to occur in places occupied by birds, mostly species with short life cycles and ruderal species. This could be related to a higher content of nitrogen in soil and also to the mechanical effects of gulls such as, digging of scrapes, pulling out plants, treading. Generally, the effect of black-headed gulls on the vegetation was rather weak. It can be explained mainly by a higher original fertility of the site, that is, by a high suitability, in a broad sense, of the sandy Vistula islands for their colonization by vascular plants, independent of the presence of gulls. On the other hand periodic flooding, which leach out the ammonium and remove vegetation cover are important.

AB Occasional records of predation by freshwater fishes on Anostraca suggest thes
   Selection of species for this use should consider prey/predator size relations, biological characteristics of the prey, ecological requirements of the prey and of the predator, hatching characteristics of the species selected, hatching techniques, biochemical composition of the cysts and nauplii, and feasibility of mass culturing for commercial cyst production.
   In light of this, biometrics, biological characteristics and ecological requirements of a number of fairy shrimp species from Italy are presented.
   Most species examined have a suitable cyst diameter, particularly after decapsulation. Instar I nauplii sizes fall within the range considered optimum. The most suitable species are Chirocephalus ruffoi (0.263 mm mean diameter; 0.400 mm naupliar length), Branchipus pasai, and B. schaefferi (0.266 mm and 0.257 mm; 0.365 mm and 0.342 mm cyst and instar I naupliar sizes respectively).
   A number of species seem to be tolerant of broad environmental variation, and are fast growing. However, there is great variability in fecundity and hatching success within and between species.

ID IMPLANTED DUMMY TRANSMITTERS; CHANNEL CATFISH; EXPULSION
AB Radiotelemetry was used from June 1986 through February 1987 to observe the movements of four Nile crocodiles, Crocodylus niloticus Laurenti, introduced into a resident population at Lake Ngezi, Zimbabwe.  The use of surgically-implanted transmitters was the first application of this technique on wild Nile crocodiles.  A subadult female (194 cm TL, 35 kg) and two males (256 cm, 81 kg; 348 cm, 260 kg) wandered throughout the area.  A large female (297 cm, 149 kg) moved > 12 km from her point of release to Ngezi River and nested; she guarded the nest site through 21 January 1987 when she moved the hatchlings to a nearby creche.  A juvenile crocodile (120 cm TL, 8 kg) captured in Lake Ngezi was also monitored from June 1986 to February 1987.  It traversed some 15 km of the shoreline of Lake Ngezi and moved as much as 1.0 km overnight.  Evidence is presented that the translocated crocodiles, excluding the nesting female, exhibited exploratory behaviour throughout the nine-month observation period, and did not establish home ranges per se.

AB Longevity and fecundity of the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), and the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (F.), reared at various densities on caged wheat plants were onserved under laboratory conditions.  On heading plants, R. padi responded to intraspecific competition by having a significantly shorter life and lower fecundity.  When infested with 4 R. padi + 4 S. avenae on the same plant, S. avenae had either no effect or a positive effect on longevity and fecundity of R. padi.  The presence of R. padi on wheat sedlings, however, appeared to increase longevity and fecundity of S.  avenae.  Both species had reduced longevity and fecundity when 16 R. padi + 16 S. avenae were placed on the same plant.  The bird cherry-oat aphid preferred lower parts of the heading plant, while the English grain aphid preferred the plant head.  The presence of the two species did not affect the spatial distribution of each aphid species on the plant.  Only when crowded by its own species, S. avenae spread downward to avoid intraspecific competition on the wheat head.

AB Illegal or unsustainable wildlife trade (IUWT) currently presents one of the most high-profile conservation challenges. There is no "one-size-fits-all" strategy, and a variety of disciplines and actors are needed for any counteractive approach to work effectively. Here, we detail common challenges faced when tackling IUWT, and we describe some available tools and technologies to curb and track IUWT (e.g. bans, quotas, protected areas, certification, captive-breeding and propagation, education and awareness). We discuss gaps to be filled in regulation, enforcement, engagement and knowledge about wildlife trade, and propose practical solutions to regulate and curb IUWT, paving the road for immediate action.

AB Wet markets have been implicated in multiple zoonotic outbreaks, including COVID-19. They are also a conduit for legal and illegal trade in wildlife, which threatens thousands of species. Yet wet markets supply food to millions of people around the world, and differ drastically in their physical composition, the goods they sell, and the subsequent risks they pose. As such, policy makers need to know how to target their actions to efficiently safeguard human health and biodiversity without depriving people of ready access to food. Here, we propose a taxonomy of wet markets, oriented around the presence of live or dead animals, and whether those animals are domesticated or wild (either captive-reared or wild-caught). We assess the dimensions and levels of risk that different types of wet markets pose to people and to biodiversity. We identify six key risk factors of wet markets that can affect human health: (1) presence of high disease-risk animal taxa, (2) presence of live animals, (3) hygiene conditions, (4) market size, (5) animal density and interspecies mixing, and (6) the length and breadth of animal supply chains. We also identify key factors informing risk to biodiversity. Finally, we recommend targeted, risk-adjusted policies to more efficiently and humanely address the dangers posed by wet markets.

AB Microbial communities within animal intestines reflect various aspects of host physiological and metabolic status, including growth, feeding, and immunity. To find microbial indicators associated with faster abalone growth and hence the economics of abalone aquaculture, we performed a metabarcoding analysis of the intes-tinal microbial community in Pacific abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) with different growth rates. Two groups of Pacific abalone of different sizes were selected from a population that originated from the same fertilization batch grown in indoor tanks for 750 days post-fertilization: small (S; 4.24 ? 1.89 g; n = 8) and large (L; 24.47 ? 4.65 g; n = 8). We then performed DNA isolation using intestines dissected from the Pacific abalone in both groups, followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. Overall, an average of 75,643 reads, of which 415.8?424.9 bp were obtained via Illumina MiSeq analysis. Taxonomic classification of the 16S rRNA gene identified up to 1032 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) per group and more than 807 microbial genera were detected at least twice from all intestinal metabarcoding DNA samples analyzed. Principal coordinate analysis indicated that there was a clear distinction between groups. The most dominant genus among the intestinal samples in both size groups was Mycoplasma, followed by Psychrilyobacter, Vibrio, and Algibacter. The microbial genus that were more prevalent in large than small abalone were Mycoplasma (32.3635 ? 4.356%), followed by Psychrilyobacter (17.305 ? 8.179) and unclassified species belonging to Mycoplasmataceae (2.930 ? 0.794%), and Rhodospirillaceae (2.555 ? 0.486%). The microbial genera more prevalent in small abalone were as follows: Algibacter (4.944 ? 0.969%), Shewanella (3.037 ? 0.589%), and Haloferula (2.810 ? 0.445). A higher ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was observed in large abalone (1.067 ? 0.694) than in small abalone (0.027 ? 0.013). The species richness within each group was assessed based on OTUs (L: 371.38 ? 136.40, S: 837.63 ? 138.99, P < 0.001), the Chao1 index (L: 380.31 ? 141.03, S: 860.18 ? 151.01), and abundance-based coverage estimator values (L: 391.89 ? 147.17, S: 888.19 ? 163.38). Species diversity was compared between groups based on the Shannon index (L: 2.82 ? 0.5, S: 4.41 ? 0.11, P < 0.001). These results indicated that microbial species diversity was higher in small abalone with slower growth rates. Understanding changes in the characteristics of intestinal microbial populations in Pacific abalones, and the relationship thereof with growth rates, will provide a basis for developing a microbiota-based strategy for abalone aquaculture.

AB Direct comparisons between historical and contemporary populations allow for detecting changes in genetic diversity through time and assessment of the impact of habitat fragmentation. Here, we determined the genetic architecture of both historical and modern lions to document changes in genetic diversity over the last century. We surveyed microsatellite and mitochondrial genome variation from 143 high-quality museum specimens of known provenance, allowing us to directly compare this information with data from several recently published nuclear and mitochondrial studies. Our results provide evidence for male-mediated gene flow and recent isolation of local subpopulations, likely due to habitat fragmentation. Nuclear markers showed a significant decrease in genetic diversity from the historical (H-E=0.833) to the modern (H-E=0.796) populations, whereas mitochondrial genetic diversity was maintained (H-d=0.98 for both). Although the historical population appears to have been panmictic based on nDNA data, hierarchical structure analysis identified four tiers of genetic structure in modern populations and was able to detect most sampling locations. Mitogenome analyses identified four clusters: Southern, Mixed, Eastern, and Western and were consistent between modern and historically sampled haplotypes. Within the last century, habitat fragmentation caused lion subpopulations to become more geographically isolated as human expansion changed the African landscape. This resulted in an increase in fine-scale nuclear genetic structure and loss of genetic diversity as lion subpopulations became more differentiated, whereas mitochondrial structure and diversity were maintained over time.

TI Effects of legalization and wildlife farming on conservation
SO GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Wildlife farming; Legalization; Wildlife products; Tiger; Bear; Turtle;
   Snake; Demand
AB Many wildlife species are impacted by unsustainable consumption. Wildlife is consumed for such diverse purposes as food, medicine, ornamentation, entertainment, and social status. However, it is still debated whether legalization and wildlife farming can saturate demand and thus reduce poaching, or if these policies increase demand, and subsequently poaching of vulnerable wildlife. This paper used an experimental vignette survey in Mainland China (N = 1002) to explore empirically how legalization, wildlife farming, and possible changes in consumptive acceptability affect demand for wildlife products. Each respondent read a vignette about the consumption of a wildlife product from one of four species (bears, tigers, snakes, or turtles), for one of two uses (medicinal or non-medicinal), in one of three legal situations (product is illegal, product is legal and from farmed animal, or product is legal and from wild animal). All respondents were asked about the acceptability of wildlife consumption, the social stigma around consumption, and the perceived legal consequences of consumption for eight products: bear bile, bear paws, tiger bone, tiger skin, snake bile, snake leather, turtle shells, and turtle meat. Data was analyzed using linear regression models that included interaction effects and controlled for age, gender, education, income, and attitudes towards specific species, towards wildlife consumption, and towards Traditional Chinese Medicine. Wildlife product bans decreased the acceptability and social approval of wildlife consumption and increased estimations of legal punishments. The type of ban that produced these effects depended upon the wildlife product and the measurement of wildlife consumption. The effects of wildlife farming on demand for wildlife products were particularly prominent for mammals. Bear farming increased the acceptability and perceived social approval of bear bile; it also decreased perceived legal sanctions for bear consumption. Tiger farming diminished perceived legal sanctions for tiger consumption and farming tigers for medicinal use increased the acceptability of tiger consumption. Overall, these results indicate that bans on wildlife consumption and decreased wildlife farming of mammals can have conservation benefits. (c) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Rocky shore ecology has been studied for a long time, starting with qualitative descriptions and becoming more quantitative and experimental over time. Some of the earliest manipulative experimental ecological studies were undertaken on rocky shores. Many, over time, have made considerable contributions to ecological theory, especially highlighting the importance of biological interactions at the community level. The suitability of rocky shores as convenient test systems for ecological experimentation is outlined. Here we consider contributions from rocky shores to the emerging concepts of supply-side ecology, the roles of competition, predation and grazing, disturbance and succession and positive interactions in structuring communities along environmental gradients. We then address alternative stable states, relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and bottom-up and top-down control of ecosystems. We briefly consider the feedback and synergies between ecological concepts and experimental work on rocky shores, whilst still emphasizing the traditional values of marine natural history upheld in JMBA since its first publication. The importance of rigorous experimental designs championed by Underwood and co-workers is emphasized. Recent progress taking advantage of new technologies and emerging approaches is considered. We illustrate how experimental studies have shown the importance of biological interactions in modulating species and assemblage-level responses to climate change and informed conservation and management of coastal ecosystems.

FX SJH, LBC, SRJ, KH wish to thank the European-funded project EUROROCK
   which enabled us to all work together in such a fruitful and fun way,
   and was an important step in all our careers. EUROROCK was shaped by
   advice from Tony Underwood in its conception, experimental designs and
   reinforced by training received by the team from him and Gee Chapman.
   Eurorock's co-ordinator Guido Chelazzi herded cats well. SJH would also
   like to thank all his PhD students and Post-doc Fellows hosted,
   especially Richard Thompson, Nova Mieszkowska, Louise Firth, Mike
   Burrows, Mark Johnson, Ross Coleman, Tasman Crowe, Paula Moschella, Ally
   Evans who have helped him do much work and have been great fun on the
   shore and pub over the years. SJH would like to thank the Marine
   Biological Association of the UK for hosting his NERC-funded postdoc in
   1979-1980 and providing lab space on subsequent visits from Manchester,
   Port Erin, Southampton, Bangor, allowing him to be Director from 1999 to
   2007 and according him the privilege of a Lankester Research Fellowship
   as an Emeritus from Southampton -plus an office. SJH has a large
   personal and professional debt to Richard Hartnoll who helped get him a
   NERC studentship on experimental ecology and spotted the value of such
   an approach and helped finish many things off and get them published.
   George Russell always took an interest and introduced him to
   limpet-algal interactions on a field course in 1975. Alan Southward was
   a great inspiration and mentor for nearly 40 years -we dedicate this
   review to him -and we are sure he would have had some trenchant
   criticisms ('too much theory and jargon'). SJH, SRJ and KH all
   benefitted from the unique atmosphere at Port Erin Marine
   Laboratory/Marine Biological Station (RIP). Over the years SJH has
   received a personal appeal NERC studentship, personal Post-doc
   Fellowship, and many grants and studentships from NERC, plus NERC
   grant-in-aid to the MBA (1999-2007). SRJ similarly received a NERC
   studentship and has been subsequently funded by them including grants,
   studentships and held a NERC grant-in-aid funded Fellowship at the MBA.
   We all thank Jane Lewis for this invitation to write this review and her
   patience. The review has benefitted from expert input from two referees:
   David Schiel and George Branch who contributed much to improving it.

AB Increasing anthropogenic pressures are causing long-lasting regime shifts from high-diversity ecosystems to low-diversity ones. In the Mediterranean Sea, large expanses of rocky subtidal habitats characterized by high diversity have been completely degraded to the barren state due to the high grazing pressure exerted by sea urchins, which could persist for a long time. In several areas of the world, removal of sea urchins has been found to have a positive effect on the recovery of overexploited subtidal rocky habitats. This study assessed, for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea, the effects of extensive sea urchin culling on the recovery of subtidal reefs from the barren state. We tested this approach within a Marine Protected Area where a combination of oligotrophic conditions, general depletion of fish stocks, dramatically high sea urchin densities, and the large expanses of barren grounds caused by date mussel fishery have hampered the natural recovery of shallow rocky reefs. Culling intervention (through hammering) was carried out in spring 2015, covering an area of 1.2 hectares at about 5 m depth. The effects of sea urchin removal were monitored at regular intervals for a time span of 3 years and were compared with two control sites adjacent to the culling area. We documented a progressive reduction in the extent of barren grounds in the fully protected area after the intervention. Also, very low re-colonization of sea urchins was observed during the experiment, so that no additional extensive culling was necessary. Our findings suggested sea urchin culling as a promising practice, also considering the limited costs of the intervention. However, since the reduction in extent of barren grounds was largely driven by turf-forming algae, caution is needed in the interpretation of the outcomes in terms of restoration, and results are discussed considering the factors involved in the observed shift and the synergies to be carried out for a full recovery of the system.

AB Large-sized animals (megafauna) and trees (megatrees) are key ecosystem components with high cultural and economic importance going back millennia. Once common, both groups of megabiota have been massively reduced in pre-historic and historic times, with human-induced downsizing still ongoing.
   Key ecosystem services provided by megafauna and megatrees include nutrient and seed transfer, carbon allocation, climate regulation and biodiversity facilitation. Socio-cultural services include food and timber provisioning and the 'charisma' of large-sized organisms, with its associated high cultural, recreational and nature conservation values for human societies worldwide.
   Conservation and restoration of megafauna and-trees in a socio-ecological framework are needed to counteract past and ongoing analogous downsizing of both groups of megabiota and the loss of important ecosystem services in a human-dominated world. Importantly, synergistic megatree-megafauna restoration promotes self-regulating biodiverse ecosystems across the full range of land use intensities ranging from current downsized wildlands to highly human-modified landscapes.
   We propose an integrative rewilding-based restoration framework applicable across the whole range of human land use intensity. This includes individual-based protection, assisted colonisation and facilitation of urban wildlife. Active management of megafauna and -trees can be economically beneficial and necessary to minimize human-wildlife conflicts in highly human-dominated landscapes. Societal acceptance and adaptation to old big trees and wild megafauna are prerequisites for successful megabiota restoration in human-modified landscapes and elsewhere where human-wildlife conflicts are hard to avoid.
   The prime goal of such integrative rewilding activities should be a proactive facilitation of the self-regulation potential of natural and novel ecosystems for which large-sized trees and animals would be some of the most important components for enhancing biodiversity and societal value in the Anthropocene. Such megabiota restoration needs to be done on a wide scale to restore functional effects on the biosphere.

AB Quantitative approaches to measuring and assessing terrestrial ecosystem resilience, which expresses the ability of an ecosystem to recover from disturbances without shifting to an alternative state or losing function and services, is critical and essential to forecasting how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to global change. However, global and continuous terrestrial resilience measurement is fraught with difficulty, and the corresponding attribution of resilience dynamics is lacking in the literature. In this study, we assessed global terrestrial ecosystem resilience based on the long time-series GLASS LAI product and GIMMS AVHRR LAI 3g product, and validated the results using drought and fire events as the main disturbance indicators. We also analyzed the spatial and temporal variations of global terrestrial ecosystem resilience and attributed their dynamics to climate change and environmental factors. The results showed that arid and semiarid areas exhibited low resilience. We found that evergreen broadleaf forest exhibited the highest resilience (mean resilience value (from GLASS LAI): 0.6). On a global scale, the increase of mean annual precipitation had a positive impact on terrestrial resilience enhancement, while we found no consistent relationships between mean annual temperature and terrestrial resilience. For terrestrial resilience dynamics, we observed three dramatic raises of disturbance frequency in 1989, 1995, and 2001, respectively, along with three significant drops in resilience correspondingly. Our study mapped continuous spatiotemporal variation and captured interannual variations in terrestrial ecosystem resilience. This study demonstrates that remote sensing data are effective for monitoring terrestrial resilience for global ecosystem assessment.

AB South Africa experienced a severe multiyear drought from 2014 to 2016. Here, we explore the response of a South African savannah ecosystem to this drought focusing on tree and grass dynamics. We used open long-term monitoring plots established in 2000 and distributed across broad rainfall gradients in the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park in KwaZulu-Natal. Analysis showed negligible tree mortality due to drought in 2016 (0.03%) and 2017 (0.49%). However, there was an apparent increase in the tree population especially among the small size classes (0.1-0.3 m) in 2016 and 2017 relative to the predrought 2012 census. Drought effects may be confounded with changes in browser populations. The impala population declined in a mesic savannah (Hluhluwe), as measured with dung counts; however, this decline started before the drought. Impala decline in a semi-arid savannah (iMfolozi) was more coincident with drought. Grass biomass and cover decreased in 2016 compared to predrought 2012 but showed rapid recovery once rains began. In iMfolozi grass species, composition improved from a grazing perspective as a result of the recovery of the decreaser species, an increase in palatable species and a marked decline of unpalatable species. The minor changes in woody plants and grasses from before the drought until rain resumed and the rapid recovery of grasses suggest that this South African savannah ecosystem was resilient to severe drought.

AB Understanding the causes and consequences of coexistence and thus biodiversity is one of the most fundamental endeavors of ecology, which has been addressed by studying species' requirements and impacts - conceptualized as their Grinnellian and Eltonian niches. However, different niche types have been mostly studied in isolation and thus potential covariation between them remains unknown. Here we quantified the realized Grinnellian niche (environmental requirements), the fundamental (morphological phenotype) and realized Eltonian niche (role in networks) of plant and pollinator taxa at a local and regional scale to investigate the interconnectedness of these niche types. We found a strong and scale-independent co-variation of niche types suggesting that taxa specialized in environmental factors are also specialized in their position in trait spaces and their role in bipartite networks. The integration of niche types thus will help to detect the true causes for species distributions, interaction networks, as well as the taxonomic and functional diversity of communities.

AB A key challenge to maintaining resilient landscapes is adapting to and maintaining dynamic ecological processes. In fire-dependent ecosystems, this includes identifying and defining mechanisms through which fire influences forest structure and functionality. Interpretations of tree patterns via land survey records in the Lake States have often highlighted the importance of infrequent moderate to extreme disturbance events. However, historical survey methods are limited to observing higher severity disturbances and over large landscapes, thus it is not clear if the origin, structure, and forcing factors for either patterns or processes are adequately quantified by these methods. We used dendrochronological methods to determine how fire history and stand structure, including cohort structure, tree density, and spatial patterning, are linked within Lake States mixed conifer forests in Wisconsin. We found relatively short mean fire return intervals (MFRIs) ranging from 6 to 13 yr with little variation in fire frequency among sites. Current densities of red-pine-dominated forests are 4-37 times historical (ca. 1860) densities (mean 12x) and almost entirely spatially random, whereas historically forests were spatially aggregated at stand scales. Stands also contained multiple and/or loosely defined cohort structures suggesting very different controls operating historically than currently. Heterogeneity that helped maintain ecosystem resilience in these ecosystems historically came from frequent fire disturbance processes that affected stand-scale forest resistance. This was likely the historical dynamic across fire-adapted transitional pine forests of the Lake States.

AB Aims While patterns of variation in woody plant aboveground traits related to disturbance and resource availability in savanna ecosystems are fairly well understood, dimensions of variation in belowground traits remain poorly understood. We investigate how sapling coarse root (>2 mm diameter) traits and belowground storage organs vary with respect to differing disturbance regimes (i.e. fire or herbivore dominated) and soil fertility in Southern African savannas. Methods We examined how sapling rooting strategies (type of rooting system, storage organs, root allocation) as well as root total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations [TNC], root N and C:N of 69 common woody savanna and forest species at 16 sites vary with respect to differing disturbance regimes and soil fertility. Results We found that root [TNC] and the occurrence of storage organs were highest while root N was lowest for species growing at fire-driven sites, compared to herbivore-driven sites and competition-controlled forest species. Allocation to belowground biomass was higher at fire-dominated sites but root volume:stem basal area did not differ between disturbance regimes. None of the measured traits were found to differ between nutrient rich clayey soils and nutrient poor sandy soils. Conclusions Our results suggest that disturbance related controls are important drivers of savanna belowground traits.

AB Recent studies argue for the presence of genetic population structure in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in all oceans. However, the persistence of family groups has never been considered a viable mechanism of structure, nor has it been measured. We analyzed genetic similarity among 280 yellowfin tunas from seven population samples collected in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) using single nucleotide polymorphisms, and found population structure that was significantly explained by the presence of 96 individuals involved in 332 half or full sib dyads. We found significantly higher mean and median relatedness between individuals from the same sample groups, compared to individuals from different groups; and high relatedness between individuals caught at the same fish-aggregating device (FAD) than between those caught in the wider exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Alternatively, the EEZ of the Federated States of Micronesia may harbor exceptionally large numbers of close kin. We conclude that yellowfin directly school with related individuals through their first year, and at least demonstrate tightly overlapping regional fidelity as adults. These results may explain, to some extent, the patterns of population genetic structure recently observed in yellowfin tuna.

AB Pomacea canaliculata is a successful invader and also a competitor and predator of other snails and may play a key role in structuring freshwater snail communities both in its native and invaded range. In the present study we evaluated the contact and distant effects of P. canaliculata in its native range on exotic (Melanoides tuberculata and Physa acuta) and native snails (Heleobia parchappii, Biomphalaria peregrina, and Chilina parchappii). Habitat use was affected in P. acuta, H. parchappii, and B. peregrina by contact effects of P. canaliculata, whereas survival was only affected in P. acuta through combined contact and distant effects. Fecundity was reduced in P. acuta and B. peregrina by combined contact and distant effects; evidence of egg mass predation was also observed in both species. Melanoides tuberculata was not affected at all by P. canaliculata. The snail species with higher withdrawal responses to contacts with P. canaliculata were those that suffered less mortality by corporal contact, whereas snails with high crawling away responses suffered from higher mortality. The effects of P. canaliculata seem to be highly negative to small nonoperculate snails that lay gelatinous egg masses, whereas large operculate ovoviviparous snails are not affected in their survival and reproduction. This apple snail may exert biotic resistance against P. acuta but could favor the establishment of M. tuberculata and other functionally similar species in new habitats in South America.

AB The use of baits at camera trap stations has been shown to increase capture rates in population surveys of large carnivores. This study set out to establish the most cost-effective density and duration of sampling for baited-camera trapping (BCT) of leopards in a semi-arid savanna environment. To determine this, we used batches of 30 BCT stations (sampling occasions) to survey a population of leopards (Panthera pardus) at Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve in south-eastern Zimbabwe from July to October 2017. We applied combinations of low to high sampling densities (2-7 occasions) and short to long sampling durations (2-14 days) and observed the effects on population estimates and cost of conducting the survey. Sixty-one leopards were identified from 4596 photographs collected over 2940 camera days. At the highest level of sampling (7 occasions and 14 days), 50 out of the 61 recorded individuals were captured more than twice indicating a near-complete survey, so the population estimate at this level (61; 95% CI = 61-67) was used as a benchmark to gauge accuracy of estimates from lower levels of effort. Accuracy and precision of population estimates stabilized over a range of efforts with 4 occasions and 9 days being the most cost-effective and sampling beyond this point incurring increased costs but negligible benefits. A minimum cost of US$47 km(-2) was required to obtain a reliable estimate with running costs responding more to changes in sampling density than sampling duration. We concluded that using BCT stations at a density of 0.24 cameras km(-2) for 9 days is optimal for censusing leopards in semi-arid savannas. Conducting a cost-benefit analysis may help researchers allocate resources and time within budget and technical constraints, ensuring that effort is not expended beyond what is economically or ecologically necessary.

AB Tropical forest loss and fragmentation can change bee community dynamics and potentially interrupt plant-pollinator relationships. While bee community responses to forest fragmentation have been investigated in a number of tropical regions, no studies have focused on this topic in Australia. In this study, we examine taxonomic and functional diversity of bees visiting flowers of three tree species across small and large rainforest fragments in Australian tropical landscapes. We found lower taxonomic diversity of bees visiting flowers of trees in small rainforest fragments compared with large forest fragments and show that bee species in small fragments were subsets of species in larger fragments. Bees visiting trees in small fragments also had higher mean body sizes than those in larger fragments, suggesting that small-sized bees may be less likely to persist in small fragments. Lastly, we found reductions in the abundance of eusocial stingless bees visiting flowers in small fragments compared to large fragments. These results suggest that pollinator visits to native trees living in small tropical forest remnants may be reduced, which may in turn impact on a range of processes, potentially including forest regeneration and diversity maintenance in small forest remnants in Australian tropical countryside landscapes.

AB Tropical semi-arid grasslands are a widespread and ecologically and economically important terrestrial biome. Here, we use paleoecology to understand woodland-grassland transitions across the mid- to late-Holocene period in the Banni grassland, western India. Multi proxy analyses involving palynology, phytoliths and elemental geochemistry were carried out on two sediment cores retrieved from wetlands (Chachi and Luna), to understand temporal fluctuations in vegetation, moisture availability and other environmental parameters. Based on the results, the Chachi core was divided into two major climatic phases. Phase 1 (4600-2500 cal. yr BP) was characterised by high precipitation and abundance of pollen types and phytolith morphotypes that indicate the presence of woody savanna, and mesic herbaceous taxa. Phase 2 (2500 cal. yr BP to the present) was characterised by lower precipitation, lower abundance of mesic taxa and an increase in grass phytolith abundance. However, the period from 1000 cal. yr BP to the present was characterised by the increased abundance of leguminous taxa, dryland herbs/shrubs and a decline in grass phytolith abundance. The Luna core (1000 cal. yr BP to the present) also showed results matching with the Chachi core for this latter period. Overall, moisture availability in the ecosystem appears to have declined since 4600 cal. yr BP, and the vegetation has responded to this. Although the balance between tree, shrub and grass elements has fluctuated, overall, the region has remained as an open grass and shrub savanna' with sparse woody vegetation throughout this period. Our study provides insights into the vegetation dynamics and environmental settings in a poorly understood tropical arid-grassland ecosystem from Asia during the mid-late-Holocene.

AB Floral scent and colour are key trait for many floricultural crops. Floral volatiles are biologically and economically important plant derived compounds and they play vital role in pollinator attraction, plant defense and interaction with surrounding the environment. Orchidaceae is one of the largest and most widespread families of flowering plants, with more than 25,000 species. Orchids are one of the most significant plants in ecologically adopted every habitation on earth. Floral volatiles is not limited in its role to pollinator attraction, it's widely used for perfumes, cosmetics, flavourings and therapeutic applications. Even though biochemistry of floral volatiles is still new field for investigation. Due to importance of the plant biology orchid floral scent research were deeply needed. Analysis of the biosynthesis mechanisms involved in floral scent is necessary to understand the fine-scale molecular functions and to breed to new cultivars through floral volatile genetic engineering approaches. Now a days many researchers developed floral scent models in plants. However, little is known about the pathways responsible for floral scent in orchids, due to the long life cycle and large genome size. Only some terpenoid pathways were reported in orchids. In this review, we mainly concentrated orchid floral volatile regulation and compounds synthesis responsible pathways. Moreover,we mentioned emission of orchid floral volatiles and their function in pollination ecology. This information will provide a basic information on orchid floral scent research.

AB Eucalyptus globulus has great economic importance in the Iberian Peninsula and is now the most widespread tree species on the Portuguese mainland. We aimed to evaluate the establishment capacity of E. globulus from plantations into natural habitats and to understand its association with the climate, plantation characteristics and host site characteristics. We surveyed 50 E. globulus plantations across Portugal looking at the natural establishment (occurrence and density) of E. globulus in habitats adjacent to plantations. Eucalypts presence was only recorded in 8% of the plots. Site characteristics (such as habitat type, vegetation cover and disturbance) were the most important variables influencing the natural recruitment of E. globulus in comparison to climate or plantation variables. Forest and grassland were the most resistant habitats to eucalyptus invasion while highly disturbed areas can be considered hubs for eucalypt density. The high importance of site characteristics reflects that most of the variability in eucalypt establishment occurs at small spatial scales. Thus, monitoring and management efforts should focus on those sites with higher establishment probability (i.e. open areas) trying to promote native vegetation and reduce disturbance levels.

AB In this paper we are concerned with how aggregated outcomes of individual behaviours, during interactions with other individuals (games) or with environmental factors, determine the vital rates constituting the growth rate of the population. This approach needs additional elements, namely the rates of event occurrence (interaction rates). Interaction rates describe the distribution of the interaction events in time, which seriously affects the population dynamics, as is shown in this paper. This leads to the model of a population of individuals playing different games, where focal game affected by the considered trait can be extracted from the general model, and the impact on the dynamics of other events (which is not neutral) can be described by an average background fertility and mortality. This leads to a distinction between two types of background fitness, strategically neutral elements of the focal games (correlated with the focal game events) and the aggregated outcomes of other interactions (independent of the focal game). The new approach is useful for clarification of the biological meaning of concepts such as weak selection. Results are illustrated by a Hawk-Dove example.

AB Questions: How do plant functional trait abundance and diversity in urban remnants of a rapidly urbanizing city change with fragmentation? Is there a delayed functional response to fragmentation?
   Location: Thirty remnant Banksia woodlands, Perth, Australia.
   Methods: We used GLMM to examine the effects of remnant age and area, and their interaction, on the relative abundance and functional diversity (FD) of five plant functional traits: growth form, pollination, seed dispersal, nutrient acquisition and regeneration strategies. We then used fourth-corner analysis to examine the influence of a wider set of fragmentation-related factors on trait abundances.
   Results: The functional composition and diversity of Banksia woodlands changed with remnant age, particularly in the smaller remnants. Plants more prone to decline with remnant age were the growth form shrubs, root-clustered trees, herbaceous obligate seeders and understorey species that are insect-pollinated, have seeds dispersal internally by animals and have arbuscular or ericoid mycorrhizas. In contrast, plants more prone to persist were growth forms trees, sedges and rushes, ectomycorrhizal trees, herbaceous resprouters, wind-pollinated and root-clustered understorey species. FD increased with remnant age in the growth forms and overstorey, but declined among the herbaceous and shrub pollination and nutrient acquisition traits.
   Conclusions: Functional traits that consistently signalled the plant community response to fragmentation were growth form, pollination and dispersal. This functional response was largely delayed, suggesting a functional extinction debt, which will lead to a further decline of plants with vulnerable trait states in the future, especially in the small- and medium-sized remnants. Our study illustrates the vulnerability of small remnants to changes in community assembly and ecosystem function due to fragmentation. Furthermore, it exemplifies how a functional trait approach is valuable to understand the impacts of urbanization on remnant plant communities, before local extinctions may occur. Finally, the study shows how cities' fragmentation history and biogeographic settings provide an important context influencing plant functional responses to urbanization-related processes.

AB Landscape restoration is a global priority as evidenced by the United Nations' 2020 goal to restore 150 million hectares of land worldwide. Landscape restoration is often undermined by misalignments between governance and environmental systems, often called social-ecological scale mismatches. Despite growing recognition of this problem, few empirical studies focus on scale mismatches in environmental restoration work. In response, this paper analyzes scale mismatches in estuary restoration in a sub-basin of Puget Sound, Washington, U.S.A. I address both the effects of scale mismatch on individual restoration projects and landscape level restoration planning and implementation. I qualitatively analyze 95 semi-structured interviews with participants from 80 governing organizations. My analysis reveals how scale mismatch is a complex social-ecological landscape pattern that affects the flow of financial, human, and natural capital across the landscape. Furthermore, many organizations have limited capacity, which often hampers cross border collaborations that might overcome scale mismatches and further affects how resource are allocated in the region. My findings illustrate why human-environment processes should be included in landscape restoration planning. Social factors are not considered as constraints to restoration, but rather, part of the very landscape fabric to be restored. This represents a new way of thinking about scale mismatch for landscape restoration. Understanding these patterns and processes is essential for a social-ecological approach to landscape restoration that can help create sustainable landscapes and communities.

AB Protective benchmarks for the effects of total suspended solids (TSS) on freshwater aquatic biota primarily focus on fish; whether these benchmarks will also protect their prey or co-existing lower trophic level aquatic biota was uncertain. We conducted an extensive literature review of TSS effects on those organisms comprising the food webs upon which fish living in lakes depend: phytoplankton, zooplankton, periphyton, and benthic invertebrates. The available literature indicates that TSS benchmarks that protect sensitive life stages of lake fish will also protect their supporting food webs; in other words, the function of lake aquatic communities will be protected and maintained.

AB 1. Animal defecation, or egestion, is a pronounced transformation of organic matter in many ecosystems. However, because egesta have been presumed recalcitrant and low nutrient, their significance and variability as an animal nutrient flux in aquatic settings - especially relative to mineralization via excretion - are poorly known.
   2. We compared carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics over short- to long-term (up to 107 days) microbial decomposition of egesta from the aquatic shredders Allocapnia spp., Lirceus spp. and Tipula spp. fed low- or high-P content Platanus occidentalis litter to investigate roles of egesta in aquatic nutrient dynamics.
   3. Tipula produced N and P deplete egesta of higher N : P compared to Lirceus and Allocapnia, and high-P diets increased egesta P content compared to low- P diets. Despite measurable C losses to decomposition, these differences in nutrient content persisted through decomposition, showing diet and species control both immediate and long-term properties of egested particles.
   4. Egesta switched between uptake and release of dissolved phosphorus and ammonium during decomposition, and exhibited consistent net N uptake as nitrate-nitrite. Across species and diets, lower N : P egesta tended to exhibit greater uptake of dissolved inorganic N, suggesting P enrichment of egesta drove stronger dissolved N demand by decomposer microbes.
   5. Shredder egesta exhibit stable nutrient contents long term and, counter to assumptions that they are negligible or minor net sources, can be strong, extended sinks of dissolved inorganic nutrients. Future studies should consider contrasts between animal nutrient fluxes as excretion, which facilitates nutrient recycling via mineralization, vs. egestion, which slows nutrient recycling via organic nutrient repackaging and can create sinks of dissolved nutrients.

AB According to the hologenome theory, the microbiota contributes to the fitness of the holobiont having an important role in its adaptation, survival, development, health, and evolution. Environmental stress also affects the microbiota and its capability to assist the holobiont in coping with stress factors. Here, we analyzed the diversity of cultivable bacteria associated with Manila clam tissues (mantle, gills, hemolymph) in two non-contaminated sites (Portugal and France) and one metal-contaminated site (Portugal). A total of 240 isolates were obtained. Representative isolates (n = 198) of the overall diversity were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and subjected to functional characterization. Isolates affiliated with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Proteobacteria (mostly Pseudoalteromonadaceae and Vibrionaceae) were dominant in non-contaminated sites while Actinobacteria (mostly Microbacteriaceae) dominated in the metal-contaminated site. The main factor affecting the microbiota composition was contamination. No significant differences were observed between clam tissues and geographic regions. Several isolates tested positive for antibacterial activity, biofilm formation, protease, and siderophore production. The results show that the Manila clam harbors a diverse microbiota that may contribute to clam protection and overall fitness, as well as to its adaptation to stressful environments. In addition, the Manila clam microbiota is revealed as a promising source of novel probiotics with potential application in aquaculture.

AB Armed conflict has played an increasingly important role in the transformation of key social and environmental systems at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Accelerated resource flows and-environmental change dynamics intersect with conflict processes in ways that are substantial and yet inadequately understood. Drawing on research along the Pakistani border in eastern Afghanistan's embattled province of Nangarhar, we employ a coupled systems approach for understanding the ways in which social-ecological processes shape and are shaped by armed conflict. Based on field surveys, geospatial analysis of land and forest change, and participatory research among local communities, government agencies and military actors, we identify several causal processes linking conflict and dynamics of social-ecological change in the context of multiscalar geopolitical processes. We focus attention on four inter-related elements: (1) transitional modes of resource governance relating to armed militia groups and state intervention, (2) forest changes related to illegal logging and trade networks, (3) the erosion of upper -montanerangelands through encroachment and changing pastoral responses to conflict, and (4) significant land use changes in the agricultural sector toward the cultivation of opium poppy. Our research highlights the importance of center-periphery relations, the problematic nature of local agency, and the ways in which local social-ecological elements here, particularly, timber and opium become political objects within competing narratives of (in)security and ongoing state formation.

   PLASTICITY
AB Evidence for sexual dimorphism is extremely limited in the non-avian dinosaurs despite their high diversity and disparity, and despite the fact that dimorphism is very common in vertebrate lineages of all kinds. Using body-size data from both Alligator mississippiensis and Rhea americana, which phylogenetically bracket the dinosaurs, we demonstrate that even when there is strong dimorphism in a species, random sampling of populations of individuals characterized by sustained periods of growth (as in the alligator and most dinosaurs) can result in the loss of this signal. Dimorphism may be common in fossil taxa but very hard to detect without ontogenetic age control and large sample sizes, both of which are hampered by the limitations of the fossil record. Signal detection may be further hindered by Type III survivorship, whereby increased mortality among the young favours the likelihood that they will be sampled (unless predation or taphonomic bias against small size acts against this). These, and other considerations relating to behaviour and ecology, provide powerful reasons to suggest that sexual dimorphism in dinosaurs may be very difficult to detect in almost all currently available samples. Similar issues are likely also to be applicable to many fossil reptiles, or animals more generally.

AB AimsNatural disturbances drive plant assemblages in Afromontane grassland. Our aim is to assess how intensity of cattle grazing and time since last fire influence plant species richness, dominance and assemblage composition.
   LocationCentral Midlands, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.
   MethodsSites differed in grazing intensity (light, moderate and heavy) and time since last fire: recently burned (RB) vs unburned (UB). We sampled plants in 24 vegetation quadrats (1-m(2)) randomly located within each site (similar to 1000m(2)). We used linear regression models for species richness and dominance, IndVal to identify indicator species and CCA for assemblage composition. All analyses were conducted at quadrat and site level.
   ResultsSpecies richness was significantly influenced by time since last fire (RB>UB), grazing intensity (light < moderate > heavy) and the fire-grazing interaction at quadrat level. Dominance reciprocated the response of species richness to time since last fire (UB>RB), but did not respond consistently to grazing intensity (light > moderate > or < heavy). Plant assemblage composition was significantly influenced by time since last fire, grazing intensity and vegetation structure (live vegetation cover and vegetation height). Indicator species of species-poor, heavily grazed sites included alien species, such as Cirsium vulgare and Conyza bonariensis.
   ConclusionResponse of species richness to grazing intensity conforms to the predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Burning and moderate grazing should be part of grassland management. To prevent species loss and influx of alien species, heavy grazing should be minimized. As development of grassland ecological networks in a timber matrix is being pioneered in South Africa, these findings indicate a way forward for the management of similar systems elsewhere in the world.

AB Nesting biology and ecology have been investigated for Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), but information on behaviour and movement patterns of nesting females during nest guarding is scant. Consequently, we investigated the home ranges, nest-site selection strategies, movement patterns, activity levels and nest fidelity of four nesting females using telemetry. Gravid females selected winter basking/breeding areas close (351 +/- 2m) to nest-sites. Mean home range and core-use areas of nesting females were 8539 +/- 4752 m(2), and 4949 +/- 3302 m(2) respectively. Mean home range (0.85 ha) was significantly smaller than those of non-nesting females (108.4 ha) during nesting season. Activity levels and mean daily movements while nesting were 8.1 +/- 2.5% and 213 +/- 64 m, respectively, and increased to 47.9 +/- 11.7% and 2176 708 m post-nesting. Overall levels of nest fidelity were 82.8 +/- 11.7%, (day 78.1 +/- 15.9%; night 87.3 7.8%). Highest nest fidelity recorded during incubation was 99.7% over 96 days. Telemetry data from nesting females were helpful for elucidating spatial and behavioural patterns during the nest guarding period, and provided novel insights into this biologically important event.

AB Given that the lack of adequate nutrition is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease, increased food production through aquaculture is a seemingly welcome sign. Microorganisms remain the richest, multifaceted and most promising source of structurally and functionally diverse and highly potent bioactive compounds. The ocean supports a rich biodiversity, of which bacteria comprise a vast number. Exploration of the ocean for novel bacteriocins is built on the idea that because marine habitat is an extreme environment, highly competitive marine bacteria could produce more potent bacteriocins as compared to compounds isolated from other sources. Although numerous studies have investigated the potentials of marine bacteria and their bacteriocins, there is not much established industrial applications that have been reported. This review gives a comprehensive overview of biological characteristics of bacteriocins along with their chemical nature which may provide some innovative insights on a diverse range of bacteria-produced chemicals. In addition, the actual and potential applications of marine bacteria and their bacteriocins in aquaculture and briefly on the potential uses in other fields have been discussed. Moreover, literature data from isolation, biochemical characterization, and antimicrobial assay reports have also been integrated to provide a contemporary understanding of marine bacteriocin potentials.

AB The stable coexistence of very similar species has perplexed ecologists for decades and has been central to the development of coexistence theory. According to modern coexistence theory, species can coexist stably (i.e. persist indefinitely with no long-term density trends) as long as species' niche differences exceed competitive ability differences, even if these differences are very small. Recent studies have directly quantified niche and competitive ability differences in experimental communities at small spatial scales, but provide limited information about stable coexistence across spatial scales in heterogeneous natural communities. In this study, we use experimental and observational approaches to explore evidence for niche and competitive ability differences between two closely related, ecologically similar and widely coexisting annual forbs: Trachymene cyanopetala and T. ornata. We experimentally tested for stabilizing niche differences and competitive ability differences between these species by manipulating species' frequencies, under both well-watered and water-stressed conditions. We considered these experimental results in light of extensive field observations to explore evidence of niche segregation at a range of spatial scales. We found little evidence of intra-specific stabilization or competitive ability differences in laboratory experiments while observational studies suggested niche segregation across pollinator assemblages and small-scale microclimate heterogeneity. Though we did not quantify long-term stabilization of coexisting populations of these species, results are consistent with expectations for stable coexistence of similar species via a spatial storage effect allowing niche differences to overcome even small (to absent) competitive ability differences.

AB Questions: While mowing is a viable management tool for the maintenance of diversity in grasslands, the suitability of mowing in grasslands with invasion by exotic plants is poorly understood. In this 18-yr study, we investigate the effects of long-term mowing on a tallgrass prairie community invaded by exotic yellow bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum; BOIS). We explore the influence of BOIS on species richness and composition in the face of different mowing treatments as well as monitoring any post-treatment legacy effects.
   Location: Northeast central Oklahoma, US.
   Methods: A total of 144 permanent plots were laid out comprising eight treatments (i.e. all combinations of Mar, Jun and Sept, mows resulting in three single mows, three double mows, one triple mow and an un-mowed control). Plots were mowed 1996-2011 and recovery was monitored through 2014. Repeated mixed model ANOVA, PERMANOVA and principal response curves were employed to analyse species richness and compositional changes from mowing. Correlation was used to explore the effects of BOIS on species richness.
   Results: Mowing resulted in higher species richness relative to the absence of mowing, with the highest levels being sustained in the late season mown plots throughout the study. Once mowing had ceased, early season mown plots declined in species richness down to the same levels as the un-mown plots, concomitant with the sharpest increased cover of BOIS in these plots relative to all other treatments. Overall, we found a strong negative correlation between BOIS cover and species richness. Species dissimilarity was highest between any plot that was mowed and the un-mown controls, as well as between March and September only treatments.
   Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential of mowing in maintaining high species richness. However, the positive response to early season mowing of the exotic yellow bluestem and ensuing negative effect on species richness suggests that BOIS can confound the favourable effects of mowing. We found only minor post-treatment legacy effects, since BOIS strongly re-established in the absence of mowing in all previously mown plots, especially the early season mown plots. Thus, we recommend sustained late season mowing to help control the spread of BOIS and maintain species-rich grasslands.

AB The Spratly Island archipelago is a remote network of coral reefs and islands in the South China Sea that is a likely source of coral larvae to the greater region, but about which little is known. Using a particle-tracking model driven by oceanographic data from the Coral Triangle region, we simulated both spring and fall spawning events of Acropora millepora, a common coral species, over a 46-yr period (1960-2005). Simulated population biology of A. millepora included the acquisition and loss of competency, settlement over appropriate benthic habitat, and mortality based on experimental data. The simulations aimed to provide insights into the connectivity of reefs within the Spratly Islands, the settlement of larvae on reefs of the greater South China Sea, and the potential dispersal range of reef organisms from the Spratly Islands. Results suggest that (1) the Spratly Islands may be a significant source of A. millepora larvae for the Palawan reefs (Philippines) and some of the most isolated reefs of the South China Sea; and (2) the relatively isolated western Spratly Islands have limited source reefs supplying them with larvae and fewer of their larvae successfully settling on other reefs. Examination of particle dispersal without biology (settlement and mortality) suggests that larval connectivity is possible throughout the South China Sea and into the Coral Triangle region. Strong differences in the spring versus fall larval connectivity and dispersal highlight the need for a greater understanding of spawning dynamics of the region. This study confirms that the Spratly Islands are likely an important source of larvae for the South China Sea and Coral Triangle region.

AB Connectivity is a pivotal feature of landscapes that affects the structure of populations and the functioning of ecosystems. It is also a key consideration in conservation planning. But the potential functional effects of landscape connectivity are rarely evaluated in a conservation context. The removal of algae by herbivorous fish is a key ecological function on coral reefs that promotes coral growth and recruitment. Many reef herbivores are harvested and some use other habitats (like mangroves) as nurseries or feeding areas. Thus, the effects of habitat connectivity and marine reserves can jointly promote herbivore populations on coral reefs, thereby influencing reef health. We used a coral reef seascape in eastern Australia to test whether seascape connectivity and reserves influence herbivory. We measured herbivore abundance and rates of herbivory (on turf algae and macroalgae) on reefs that differed in both their level of connectivity to adjacent mangrove habitats and their level of protection from fishing. Reserves enhanced the biomass of herbivorous fish on coral reefs in all seascape settings and promoted consumption of turf algae. Consumption of turf algae was correlated with the biomass of surgeonfish that are exploited outside reserves. By contrast, both reserve status and connectivity influenced herbivory on macroalgae. Consumption of macroalgae was greatest on fished reefs that were far from mangroves and was not strongly correlated with any fish species. Our findings demonstrate that landscape connectivity and reserve status can jointly affect the functioning of ecosystems. Moreover, we show that reserve and connectivity effects can differ markedly depending on resource type (in this case turf algae vs. macroalgae). The effectiveness of conservation initiatives will therefore depend on our ability to understand how these multiple interactive effects structure the distribution of ecological functions. These findings have wider implications for the spatial conservation of heterogeneous environments and strengthen the case that the impact of conservation on ecosystem functioning is contingent on how reserves are positioned in landscapes.

AB The Cape Floristic Region of South Africa is a global biodiversity hotspot threatened by invasive alien plants (IAPs). We assessed the effect of plant invasions, and their subsequent clearing, on riparian arthropod diversity. Foliage-active arthropod communities were collected from two native and one invasive alien tree species. Alpha- and beta-diversity of their associated arthropod communities were compared between near pristine, Acacia-invaded and restored sites. Arthropod alpha-diversity at near pristine sites was higher than at restored sites, and was lowest at invaded sites. This was true for most arthropod taxonomic groups associated with all native tree species and suggests a general trend towards recovery in arthropod alpha-diversity after IAP removal. Overall, arthropod species turnover among sites was significantly influenced by plant invasions with communities at near pristine sites having higher turnover than those at restored and invaded sites. This pattern was not evident at the level of individual tree species. Although arthropod community composition was significantly influenced by plant invasions, only a few significant differences in arthropod community composition could be detected between restored and near pristine sites for all tree species and arthropod taxonomic groups. Assemblage composition on each tree species generally differed between sites with similar degrees of plant invasion indicating a strong turnover of arthropod communities across the landscape. Results further suggest that both arthropod alpha- and beta-diversity can recover after IAP removal, given sufficient time, but catchment signatures must be acknowledged when monitoring restoration recovery.

AB Fire and herbivory are important disturbances in vegetation globally. These disturbances are widely applied in combination for conservation and livestock management. Little is known regarding the relative effects on species composition of post-fire grazing, grazing by itself, burning by itself, the absence of both of these disturbances or of the variation of their influences between vegetation types. At seven sites in Tasmania, Australia, in sedgeland, heathy forest and grassland, the covers and heights of tracheophytes were measured before and for 2 years after the commencement of a fire experiment that nested grazing within burning. Burning followed by grazing, largely by native vertebrates, tended to result in greater changes in species and lifeform composition than either grazing by itself or burning by itself. Heathy forest and sedgeland responded primarily to fire rather than grazing. Heathy forest shifted to a new state with burning while sedgeland began a return to its pre-burn state. Grazing after burning most strongly affected the lowland tussock grassland, while also strongly influencing the height of highland tussock grasslands. Intact canopies in eucalypt forest after fire prevented a return to the original understorey while grazing animals turn tussock grassland into lawn after fire. In all cases, the effects of grazing after burning are incremental rather than strongly synergistic.

AB Context. In the past 200 years, many carnivores have experienced a widespread decline in numbers and range reductions. Conservation interventions include the use of small, fenced reserves that have potential restoration benefits for conservation. Over the past 25 years, the Eastern Cape province of South Africa has seen the establishment of many small (<= 440 km(2)) game reserves, and the reintroduction of the larger, indigenous wildlife that had been extirpated by the early 20th century, including brown hyaenas (Hyaena brunnea). These game reserves have restored the environment to a more natural state but little information exists concerning the benefits and implications of introducing elusive animals that are seldom seen after reintroduction. Fenced reserves have the potential to provide surplus animals that can be relocated for restoration purposes (where applicable) or serve as a buffer to the extinction of naturally occurring populations, but careful management is required to monitor populations appropriately, so as to avoid the costs of rapid population increase.
   Aims. The reintroduction of brown hyaenas to the Eastern Cape has provided a case study to assess the role of small reserves and their potential to contribute to conservation, by determining the persistence and population growth of brown hyaenas in a small, enclosed reserve.
   Methods. Estimates of brown hyaena density were calculated using a capture-recapture approach from individually identifiable images captured during a 3-month camera trapping survey.
   Key results. After a single decade, the brown hyaena population increased by at least 367%, from six individuals to a minimum of 28 individuals. These results suggest that this brown hyaena population has the highest density ever recorded for the species in southern Africa.
   Conclusions and Implications. Because brown hyaena populations were high relative to natural unfenced populations, high fences may provide two utilities for their conservation. Fenced reserves may provide surplus animals to support reintroductions and provide protected populations to buffer the risk of species extinction.

AB Many legume species in the Cape Floristic Region, recently renamed the Core Cape Subregion (CCR), occur in distinct population patches within the landscape. We hypothesized that when compared to non-legumes, legumes occupy a distinct nutrient-enriched biogeochemical niche, and that foliar nutrient concentrations would correspond with soil chemistry. Soil and leaf samples were collected at eight sites in the CCR that were selected based on soil types including limestone-, sandstone-, granite- and sand-derived soils. At each site, samples were collected along three parallel replicate line transects originating inside the legume patch and extending into the adjacent non-legume habitat. The soil and plant samples were processed and analysed for chemical elements. Within a soil type, canonical discriminant analysis of soil nutrient concentrations separated legume from non-legume habitats on limestone, sandstone and granitic soils, thereby identifying their biogeochemical niche. Multiple nutrients were associated with the legume niche, and the nutrients varied with soil type. Relative to the non-legume habitat, the legume habitat was enriched with nutrients with greater concentrations of total N, total P, K, Mg, Na and C in both limestone and sandstone soils, but only enriched with C in granitic soil. Furthermore, a strong canonical correlation in both legume and non-legume plants (e.g. along CV1 r = 0.90 and 0.83, respectively) was found between the soil and leaf nutrients. Overall, the study provided empirical evidence for the existence of a nutrient-rich biogeochemical niche for legumes in the CCR and showed that foliar nutrients reflected soil chemistry.

AB Bumble bee abundance in agricultural landscapes is known to decrease with increasing distance from seminatural grasslands, but whether the pollination of bumble-bee-pollinated wild plants shows a similar pattern is less well known. In addition, the relative effects of landscape composition (landscape heterogeneity) and landscape configuration (distance from seminatural grassland) on wild plant pollination, and the interaction between these landscape effects, have not been studied using landscape-level replication. We performed a field experiment to disentangle these landscape effects on the pollination of a native herb, the sticky catchfly (Lychnis viscaria), while accounting for the proportion of oilseed rape across landscapes and the local abundance of bee forage flowers. We measured pollen limitation (the degree to which seed set is pollen-limited), seed set, and seed set stability using potted plants placed in landscapes that differed in heterogeneity (composition) and distance from seminatural grassland (configuration). Pollen limitation and seed set in individual plants did not respond to landscape composition, landscape configuration, or proportion of oilseed rape. Instead, seed set increased with increasing local bee forage flower cover. However, we found within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to increase with increasing distance from seminatural pasture. Our results suggest that average within-plant levels of pollen limitation and seed set respond less swiftly than the within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to changes in landscape configuration. Although landscape effects on pollination were less important than predicted, we conclude that landscape configuration and local habitat characteristics play larger roles than landscape composition in the pollination of L. viscaria.

AB The study of movement patterns and home range is fundamental in understanding the spatial requirements of animals and is important in generating information for the conservation and management of threatened species. Ndumo Game Reserve, in north-eastern KwaZulu-Natal, bordering Mozambique, has the third largest Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) population in South Africa. Movement patterns of 50 Nile crocodiles with a total length of between 202 cm and 472 cm were followed over a period of 18 months, using mark-resight, radio and satellite telemetry. The duration of radio transmitter attachment (131 +/- 11.4 days) was significantly and negatively related to total length and reproductive status. Satellite transmitters failed after an average of 15 +/- 12.5 days. Home range was calculated for individuals with 10 or more radio locations, spanning a period of at least 6 months. There was a significant relationship between home range size and total length, with sub-adults (1.5 m - 2.5 m) occupying smaller, more localised home ranges than adults (> 2.5 m). The largest home ranges were for adults (> 2.5 m). Home ranges overlapped extensively, suggesting that territoriality, if present, does not result in spatially discrete home ranges of Nile crocodiles in Ndumo Game Reserve during the dry season. Larger crocodiles moved farther and more frequently than smaller crocodiles. The reserve acts as a winter refuge and spring breeding site for an estimated 846 crocodiles, which also inhabit the Rio Maputo during the summer months. Nile crocodile movement out of the reserve and into the Rio Maputo starts in November and crocodiles return to the reserve as water levels in the floodplain recede in May.
   Conservation implications: Movement patterns of Nile crocodiles show the important role the reserve plays in the conservation of Nile crocodile populations within the greater Ndumo Game Reserve-Rio Maputo area.

AB Suspension-feeding mussels exert top-down grazing control on primary producers, and provide bottom-up feedback of regenerated nutrients. Besides direct excretion, an important pathway of nutrient regeneration is through the decomposition of feces and pseudofeces, of which mussels can produce large quantities. Information on mussel feces and pseudofeces quality and nutrient regeneration rates is scarce. Feces and pseudofeces, produced in varying proportions, are commonly treated as one pool. We determined nutrient regeneration rates of feces and pseudo feces decomposition in incubations using natural seawater and juvenile Mytilus edulis from spat collectors. Apart from one 1993 trial, our results are the first to present nutrient regeneration dynamics of feces and pseudofeces separately. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphate regeneration continued at stable rates for approximately 3 wk, after which 13.1 and 12.4% of the available N and 8.7 and 7.9% of the available P was regenerated from feces and pseudofeces, respectively. Rates of silicate regeneration declined continuously, which we attribute to its accumulation in the experimental setup. Coinciding environmental levels of DIN and silicate at growth-limiting levels indicate the potential ecological relevance of biodeposit decomposition. Overall DIN regeneration rates were similar between feces and pseudofeces, but depletion of ammonia was initially more rapid for pseudofeces due to stronger nitrification. Phosphate and silicate regeneration rates were 1.1 and 1.4 times greater from feces than pseudofeces, respectively. Future research should clarify the role of bivalve suspension feeders in controlling Si and P availability in coastal ecosystems in relationship to the proportion of pseudofeces generated, which depends on food concentration.

AB Monttea aphylla flowers simultaneously produce oil and nectar, rewards known to differentially attract ecologically and functionally distinct pollinators. We examined whether geographical differentiation occurred for rewards, and whether this could be explained by spatially heterogeneous pollinator guilds and climate. Rewards were measured across the entire species range. Geographical patterns of reward quantity and their relationships with biotic and abiotic factors were examined using uni- and multivariate analyses. Latitude significantly explained population variation in nectar and oils, although in contrasting ways. Pollinator assemblages showed a prevalence of oil-collecting Centris bees. Centris vardyorum, specialized on M.aphylla, showed a latitudinal pattern of visits. Oil production was not higher where plants associated with ecologically specialized bees (i.e. C.vardyorum), but this occurred instead where they were less frequent and co-occurred with other bees that used many floral sources, including other plant species that produce oil. The multivariate analysis showed that the prevalence of C.vardyorum was the factor that contributed most significantly to the combined patterns of rewards. We suggest that large-scale variation in rewards involves local optima throughout the species range, related to processes that operate in each ecoregion with their particular biotic and abiotic scenarios.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2015, 178, 314-328.

AB The Mediterranean Basin is a climate change and biological invasion hotspot where recent warming is facilitating the establishment and spread of invasive species, one of which is the highly destructive South American tomato leafminer (Tuta absoluta). This pest recently invaded the Mediterranean Basin where it threatens Solanaceous crops. Holistic approaches are required to project the potential geographic distribution and relative abundance of invasive species and hence are pivotal to developing sound policy for their management. This need is increasing dramatically in the face of a surge in biological invasions and climate change. However, while holistic analyses of invasive species are often advocated, they are rarely implemented. We propose that physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs) in the context of a geographic information system (GIS) can provide the appropriate level of synthesis required to capture the complex interactions basic to manage invasive species such as T. absoluta. We review the PBDMs for two invasive flies, and use them as a basis for assessing the biological data available for the development of a PBDM for T. absoluta, and in the process identify large data gaps that using the PBDM as a guide can be easily filled. Other components for an ecologically based management program for this pest (habitat modification, natural and classical biocontrol, pheromones, and others) are also reviewed. The development of a PBDM for T. absoluta would provide the basis for an interdisciplinary agroecological synthesis of the problem and the role different control tactics would play in region-specific control of the pest.

TI Why are lions killing us? Human-wildlife conflict and social discontent

SO JOURNAL OF MODERN AFRICAN STUDIES

DT Article
ID NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; LAND; POLITICS; CONSERVATION; TRADITION;
   CAMPFIRE; PROGRAM; PROJECT; REFORM
AB An emerging perspective on Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) in Zimbabwe is that increased authoritarianism in governance has enabled elite capture of wildlife resources and silenced local people's voices. This paper qualifies this perspective, showing how ordinary people continue to raise their concerns about local governance. In the Mbire district, people's interpretations of an upsurge in lion attacks on livestock and people in early 2010 took on a dimension of social commentary on the evolving governance arrangements in the district and beyond. Beneath an apparent human-wildlife conflict lie complex human-human conflicts about access to, and governance of, wildlife resources. Interpretations of the lion attacks built on two distinct epistemologies - a local religious discourse on spirit lions and an ecological one but invariably construed outsiders as the ones accountable for local problems. This construction of outsiders is also a salient feature of Zimbabwean political discourse. Local voices thus constitute a widely understood discourse of protest.

TI LARGE-SCALE OCEANIC CIRCULATION AND LARVAL RECRUITMENT OF THE SPINY

AB The most important populations of the spiny lobster (Panulirus argus (Latreille, 1804)) in the Atlantic are found in the Caribbean and along the Brazilian coast. Field studies covering the waters off the Cuban archipelago and Brazil have improved our understanding of the importance of oceanic circulation to larval recruitment. South of Cuba, puerulus settlement is intensive in October and November when the coastal reefs (83 degrees W) are impacted by a cyclone-anticyclone pair, suggesting this area is the main source of retention and supply of surviving larvae, thus of self-recruitment. On the continental shelf of Brazil, puerulus settlement takes place throughout the year, but two annual peaks have been identified: one in March-April and one in July-September, when retroflection eddies of the North Brazil Current are more intense and feed into the eastward-flowing North Equatorial Countercurrent. Conceivably, Brazilian spiny lobster larvae are trapped in this oceanic system, leading to self-recruitment. On the continental shelf of Brazil the larval period lasts 6-7 months, depending on the season and spawning date. In the Caribbean the period is reported to be 6-8 months. Information on the relative abundance of early-stage spiny lobster larvae makes it possible to predict patterns of recruitment of pueruli and juveniles and the timing of their life cycle. However, further research on seasonal variations in local currents, current retroflection and ring formation is needed to clarify important aspects of larval transport, puerulus settlement and recruitment.

AB The brine shrimp Artemia (Crustacea) and a diversity of halophilic microorganisms coexist in natural brines, salterns and laboratory cultures; part of such environmental microbial diversity is represented in the gut of Artemia individuals. Bacterial diversity in these environments was assessed by 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting. Eight natural locations in Chile, where A. franciscana or A. persimilis occur, were sampled for analysis of free-living and gut-associated bacteria in water from nature and laboratory cultures. The highest ecological diversity (Shannon's index, H') was found in brines, it decreased in the gut of wild and laboratory animals, and in laboratory water. Significant differences in H' existed between brines and laboratory water, and between brines and gut of wild animals. The greatest similarity of bacterial community composition was between brines and the gut of field animals, suggesting a transient state of the gut microbiota. Sequences retrieved from DGGE patterns (n = 83) exhibited an average of 97.8 % identity with 41 bacterial genera from the phyla Proteobacteria (55.4 % of sequences match), Bacteroidetes (22.9 %), Actinobacteria (16.9 %) and Firmicutes (4.8 %). Environment-exclusive genera distribution was seen in Sphingomonas and Paenibacillus (gut of field animals), Amaricoccus and Ornithinimicrobium (gut of laboratory animals), and Hydrogenophaga (water of laboratory cultures). The reported ecological and physiological capabilities of such bacteria can help to understand Artemia adaptation to natural and laboratory conditions.

AB Exotic ants have become invasive in many regions around the world, with variable ecological impacts. Postinvasion, native ant communities are often found to be depauperate, though the causes of this apparent lack of coexistence are rarely well known. Myrmica rubra (L.), a Palearctic Myrmecine ant, is currently expanding its range as an invasive in North America. This aggressive ant forms dense, patchy local infestations and appears to aggressively displace native ant fauna. We measured behavioral interactions and rates of recruitment in experimental field assays pitting native foragers against captive colonies of M. rubra at tuna-jelly or aphid baits in uninfested areas of Mt. Desert Island, ME. Behavioral interactions were idiosyncratic with respect to the native opponent, but M. rubra generally showed significantly higher levels of recruitment, aggression, and displacement of native foragers. As with other invasive ant species shown to have broken the "dominance-discovery trade-off," M. rubra was consistently faster to discover baits and disproportionately displaced native foragers, providing a plausible proximate mechanism for native ant exclusion. Finally, we surveyed ant recruitment at baits for 24 h in August 2004 at four sites with varying M. rubra abundance but found little evidence of temporal niche partitioning. Taken together, these results indicate competitive superiority by M. rubra with respect to native ant communities of the northeastern North America and suggest direct aggression and competitive exclusion at food resources can lead to local native displacement.

AB 1. Connectivity is a crucial process underpinning the persistence, recovery, and productivity of marine ecosystems. The Convention on Biological Diversity, through the Aichi Target 11, has set the ambitious objective of implementing a well connected system of protected areas' by 2020.
   2. This paper identifies eight challenges toward the integration of connectivity into MPA network management and planning. A summary table lists the main recommendations in terms of method, tool, advice, or action to address each of these challenges. Authors belong to a science-management continuum including researchers, international NGO officers, and national MPA agency members.
   3. Three knowledge challenges are addressed: selecting and integrating connectivity measurement metrics; assessing the accuracy and uncertainty of connectivity measurements; and communicating and visualizing connectivity measurements.
   4. Three management challenges are described: integrating connectivity into the planning and management of MPA networks; setting quantitative connectivity targets; and implementing connectivity-based management across scales and marine jurisdictions.
   5. Finally, two paths toward a better integration of connectivity science with MPA management are proposed: setting management-driven priorities for connectivity research, bridging connectivity science, and MPA network management.
   6. There is no single method to integrate connectivity into marine spatial planning. Rather, an array of methods can be assembled according to the MPA network objectives, budget, available skills, data, and timeframe.
   7. Overall, setting up boundary organizations' should be promoted to organize complex cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral and cross-jurisdiction interactions that are needed between scientists, managers, stakeholders and decision-makers to make informed decision regarding connectivity-based MPA planning and management.

AB The potential long-term influences of mesobrowsers versus those of savannah elephants on woodland dynamics have not been explored. This may be a critical omission especially in southern African savannahs, where efforts to preserve existing woodlands are typically directed at elephant management. We describe a simple browse-browser model, parameterized from an extensive review of the literature and our own data, including quantitative assessment of impala impact, from the study site, iMfolozi Park, South Africa. As there is a paucity of species-specific demographic data on savannah woody species, we modelled, in a novel approach, functional groups of plant species typical of Acacia woodlands. Outputs suggest that over the long term (100 years), low-to-moderate densities of impala will have a similar impact on woodland structure, in terms of density of adult trees, as low-to-moderate densities of elephant. Further, the outputs highlight the apparently strong synergistic effect impala and elephant impacts combined have on woodland dynamics, suggesting that reduction or removal of either impala or elephant will radically reduce long-term destruction of savannah woodlands. Recorded changes in adult tree numbers in iMfolozi broadly supported the model's outputs.

AB AimOur aim was to document African rain forest tree diversity patterns to test whether they support one of the following hypotheses: the structure of tree species diversity is at equilibrium and mostly driven by neutral processes (H-0); the structure of tree species diversity results from Pleistocene forest cover dynamics (H-1); or the structure of tree species diversity results from ecological sorting along environmental gradients (H-2).
   LocationWest Central Africa: the hilly region of Gabon, a putative Pleistocene forest refuge, and the adjacent flat littoral region, putatively colonized by forests from the hilly region after the last glaciation.
   MethodsWe used 103 standardized 0.1-ha tree plots distributed among five landscapes in the two regions. We partitioned the tree diversity within and among plots at a local and regional scale using the Hurlbert effective number of species framework. The explanatory power of geographical and elevational distances on species turnover was tested. At the landscape scale, we partitioned the beta diversity into nestedness and turnover components.
   ResultsMean alpha and gamma diversities were much higher in the hilly region, where differences in elevation explained a significant part of species turnover. Substantial species turnover correlated with geographical distance also occurred in the littoral region despite its low elevational heterogeneity. Floristic turnover between plots from different regions remained stable whatever the elevational/geographical distances. At the regional scale, species replacement remained the main contributor to beta diversity (low nestedness values).
   Main conclusionsThe heterogeneous distribution of alpha and gamma diversity, similar levels of species turnover among plots and the low contribution of the nestedness component to beta diversity between hilly and littoral landscapes do not support hypotheses H-0 and H-1. The combined impacts of limited dispersal and ecological sorting along environmental gradients (H-2) can explain patterns within regions. The marked floristic discontinuity between regions could reflect contrasting histories (two distinct refugia) although the role of contrasting environments cannot be discounted.

AB Biocarbon projects can connect climate finance to smallholder farmers and can provide considerable benefits to improved productivity, land health and income, market access, institutional stability and, ultimately, food security and reduced poverty for asset-poor rural communities. While most biocarbon projects focus on forested land or tree plantations, this paper explores the potential for connecting agroforestry approaches with carbon benefits. Drawing on experiences in Africa, we identify the major challenges and opportunities for developing and rolling out biocarbon projects in agroforestry systems. We highlight the need for external, up-front funding to overcome high project establishment costs and the need for innovative solutions to minimize trade-offs between livelihood and environmental goals. We contend that resource constraints, flexibility, technical capacity, tenure and institutional frameworks must be addressed for smallholders to invest in and benefit from carbon projects. Lastly, we argue that projects should emphasize non-carbon benefits, using carbon revenue as a tool to help farmers transition to more sustainable and productive practices on their land.

AB We analysed yearly estimates of population size data during 2001-2012 for five carnivores species of conservation interest (Ursus arctos, Canis lupus, Lynx lynx, Felis silvestris and Canis aureus). Population size estimations were done by the game management authorities and integrated by the competent authorities on the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. Trends in data were detected using non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. This test was chosen considering the short length of data series and its usefulness for non-normal distributed data. The trend was tested at three spatial scales: game management units (n = 1565), biogeographical region (n = 5) and national. Trends depicted for each game management unit were plotted using ArcGIS, resulting species trend distribution maps. For the studied period, increasing population trends were observed for Ursus arctos, Canis lupus, Canis aureus and Lynx lynx, while for Felis silvestris there was no trend recorded. The analysis could be especially useful for conservation proposes, game management and reporting obligations under article 17 of the EC Habitat Directive, using population trend as a proxy for population dynamics. We conclude that he status of the five carnivore species is favourable during the study period.

AB The Fynbos Biome of southern Africa is a Mediterranean-climate ecosystem with highly infertile soil. It is home to the endemic leguminous shrub Aspalathus linearis (rooibos tea), which is both an invaluable wild resource and commercially cultivated plant. Wild rooibos has a narrow geographic range and is confined to mountain ranges of the Cederberg Region. Under projected climate change, warmer and more arid conditions may place additional pressure on these range-restricted plants to survive in an already resource-limited environment. To understand the adaptive strategies that may allow rooibos to persist in its habitat under future climate change, the present study evaluated changes in the photosynthetic activity and nutrient cycling of wild and cultivated A. linearis, at the temperature and rainfall extremes of summer and winter. Wild and cultivated rooibos tea had different methods of adapting to nitrogen (N) nutrition and carbon (C) assimilation during wet and dry seasons. In particular, the wild plants were better able to tolerate summer drought by increased water use efficiency and maintaining higher levels of biological N-2 fixation than was the cultivated tea.

AB In Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), the establishment of woody vegetation refers to flowering, fertilization, seed production, germination, and the growth of tree seedlings. It determines not only the population densities but also other important ecosystem structural variables. In current DGVMs, establishments of woody plant functional types (PFTs) are assumed to be either the same in the same grid cell, or largely stochastic. We investigated the uncertainties in the competition of establishment among coexisting woody PFTs from three aspects: the dependence of PFT establishments on vegetation states; background establishment; and relative establishment potentials of different PFTs. Sensitivity experiments showed that the dependence of establishment rate on the fractional coverage of a PFT favored the dominant PFT by increasing its share in establishment. While a small background establishment rate had little impact on equilibrium states of the ecosystem, it did change the timescale required for the establishment of alien species in pre-existing forest due to their disadvantage in seed competition during the early stage of invasion. Meanwhile, establishment purely from background (the scheme commonly used in current DGVMs) led to inconsistent behavior in response to the change in PFT specification (e.g., number of PFTs and their specification). Furthermore, the results also indicated that trade-off between individual growth and reproduction/colonization has significant influences on the competition of establishment. Hence, further development of establishment parameterization in DGVMs is essential in reducing the uncertainties in simulations of both ecosystem structures and successions.

AB Given increased pressure on natural resources to deliver benefits, complex trade-offs and the regulation of behaviours in relation to benefits is of key concern. Behaviours that signify resistance to the rules according to which benefits are allocated prompt us to consider causal links and feedbacks between benefits, perceptions of benefits, meanings attached to the benefits, and the regulatory instruments that mediate the distribution of benefits. An understanding of how meanings influence the perception of benefits exposes the complexity inherent in how people perceive and allocate value to natural resource benefits. Meanings are personal, sometimes overlapping, context dependent and variable across space and time. A challenge in directing resource user behaviour in common pool resources is that the relationship between the resource and resource use is typically not interpreted to include the manner in which users associate resource benefits with meanings. We propose that collective ordering of meanings and associated rules help to direct behaviours and in doing so they contribute to the purposeful maintenance of desirable elements of a social-ecological system (i.e. robustness). Using an example, we illustrate how tensions around benefit sharing are rooted in the emergence and changing prioritisation of contexts and meanings over time. The importance of eliciting, ordering and sanctioning of meanings is emphasised. We conclude by discussing the implications for robustness and benefit sharing in social-ecological systems and we comment on the usefulness and limitations of the framework.

AB Extensive ongoing degradation of coral reef habitats worldwide has lead to declines in abundance of coral reef fishes and local extinction of some species. Those most vulnerable are ecological specialists and endemic species. Determining connectivity between locations is vital to understanding recovery and long-term persistence of these species following local extinction. This study explored population connectivity in the ecologically-specialized endemic three-striped butterflyfish (Chaetodon tricinctus) using mt and msatDNA (nuclear microsatellites) to distinguish evolutionary versus contemporary gene flow, estimate self-replenishment and measure genetic diversity among locations at the remote Australian offshore coral reefs of Middleton Reef (MR), Elizabeth Reef (ER), Lord Howe Island (LHI), and Norfolk Island (NI). Mt and msatDNA suggested genetic differentiation of the most peripheral location (NI) from the remaining three locations (MR, ER, LHI). Despite high levels of mtDNA gene flow, there is limited msatDNA gene flow with evidence of high levels of self-replenishment (76%) at all four locations. Taken together, this suggests prolonged population recovery times following population declines. The peripheral population (NI) is most vulnerable to local extinction due to its relative isolation, extreme levels of self-replenishment (95%), and low contemporary abundance.

AB Aim We test the hypothesis that the European destruction of western Tasmanian Aboriginal society, and consequent changes in burning patterns, resulted in succession towards rain forest near the coast, and an increase in the area of more fire-resistant sedgeland in inland areas. Location South-western and western Tasmania, Australia. Methods Attributes of organic soils (surface and underlying dominant horizons) beneath rain forest and sedgeland were described and measured from 559 soil pits in areas with highly siliceous surface geology. Multiple logistic regression was used to discriminate the dominant horizons of rain forest and sedgeland soils. This equation was used to derive scores for all soil pits. The hypothesis that change was greater near existing boundaries was tested using correlation. The hypothesis that change was greater at coastal than inland locations was tested using ANOVA. Results Both upper horizons of the soils under the fire-sensitive rain forest (14C-dated to be younger than 60 years) and dominant horizons of these soils had significantly higher organic contents, lower bulk density and more nitrogen than the soils under the fire-requiring sedgeland. Twenty-nine per cent of the soils under sedgeland had dominant horizons that indicated past rain forest. One-quarter of the soils under rain forest had dominant horizons characteristic of sedgeland soils. Although results were heterogeneous in both locations, the former difference was more common inland and the latter near the coast. Change was not higher close to present boundaries. Main conclusions The characteristics of the dominant horizons and the post-colonial surface horizon give a strong indication of the vegetation that formed them. Changes in fire regimes, caused by the displacement of Tasmanian Aborigines by Europeans, appear to have caused vegetation changes that differed within and between the coast and inland areas. Thus, there has been a strong human role in determining the distributions of vegetation types in the region.

AB Upogebia pusilla and U. deltaura are 2 common ghost shrimp species occurring in estuaries and over the shelves of European coasts, respectively. The adults have a great impact on benthic habitats and communities, as they depend on sandy and muddy substrates to construct long burrows that provide shelter and appropriate conditions for reproduction and feeding. Their planktonic larval phase lasts around 3 wk and consists of 4 zoeal stages and a decapodid that must settle in the benthos before recruiting to adult populations. In situ data were obtained from CTD casts and plankton hauls during an oceanographic survey that took place along the southern Portuguese coast in August 2010. All zoeal stages and decapodids of both species were found distributed over the shelf not exceeding 30 km from the coastline. A modelling approach was used to explain the differences in dispersal of these Upogebia congeners inhabiting different habitats of the same geographic area and exposed to similar oceanographic conditions. Their vertical distribution, oceanic circulation and the points of larval release were considered. A different dispersal strategy, influenced by natal origin and vertical behaviour, was evident for each species. The presence of decapodid stages close to substrates suitable for settlement where adult populations occur, especially for U. deltaura, suggests a good probability of successful settlement. Dispersal patterns observed for the 2 species and the agreement between field observations and model simulations indicate that these species are good models for other coastal invertebrates that reproduce in summer and have short larval development.

AB Aerosols play important roles in soil genesis and plant nutrition, at both local and intercontinental scales, by redistributing nutrients through the atmosphere. Aerosol capture by tree crowns is a possible mechanism by which trees significantly augment their nutrition, particularly in trace elements. Forests capture considerable amounts of aerosols relative to adjacent grasslands, but the extent to which aerosol capture occurs in small, scattered trees in savanna and the effect that such capture has on soil nutrients are unknown. We analyzed spatial variations in elemental concentration in topsoils near indigenous trees (<8 m tall) in short savannas marginal to treeless grassland in South Africa, by comparing samples taken immediately adjacent to tree trunks, under tree crowns and in the open. Soils adjacent to tree trunks were significantly enriched in Ca, Zn and Sr, and enriched in most study sites in As, Se and Mo compared with soils in the open. Soils adjacent to tree trunks were also significantly impoverished in Be, V, Fe and Co, and impoverished in most study sites in Ti, Cr, Mn and Ni compared with soils in the open. The elemental content of aerosols differs according to the aerosol origin. In natural, non-industrial aerosols, all elements (except Al and Si) are differential from the average particle of similar size in the sense that their concentrations in the aerosols particles exceed the Earth's crustal averages. Most of the elements identified in this study as showing enrichment adjacent to tree trunks were strongly differential elements indicating atmospheric accretion. By contrast, most elements that showed impoverishment adjacent to tree trunks were weakly differential elements of ambivalent origin. This suggests that aerosol capture by tree crowns may be a significant source of enrichment of certain elements in soils under small trees at the edges of savanna. The relative impoverishment of certain elements (e.g. Fe) shown in our study could reflect the soil conditions prior to tree establishment, suggesting that the establishment of the seedlings of savanna trees may occur predominantly within micro-sites of relative soil nutrient poverty where intensity of grass competition is least. Our study confirms that several, possibly antagonistic, mechanisms influence nutrient content under trees, resulting in a complex pattern of enrichment and impoverishment in topsoils. Augmentation of nutrients such as Zn through aerosol capture may have adaptive value for the trees studied given that many soils in South Africa tend to be Zn-poor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB Impacts of mining activity can be particularly difficult to remediate in wetland ecosystems subject to inundation pulses due to the reduced length of the plant growing season. We used a factorial experiment to test whether litter and seed addition could be used to increase the efficiency of ecological restoration on a flood-prone forest (known as igapo) impacted by deposition of bauxite tailings. Our results clearly showed that the addition of litter collected from pristine igapo areas increased plant growth, seedling density, and seedling species richness. The increase in individual plant growth was echoed at the community level with higher leaf area index values on litter addition plots compared to controls. Litter addition can enhance reaccumulation of nutrient pools during successional development, which has been proposed as an important feature to ensure self-sustainability of areas under restoration. The success of the seed addition treatment depended on the species used. Of the seven sown species, only Acosmium nitens (a leguminous nitrogen-fixing species) showed high establishment. The introduction of nitrogen-fixing species is also expected to build up the nitrogen pool in the system as has been reported for restoration programs in non-inundated forests. These practices have the advantage, compared to direct fertilizing, of not causing eutrophication of water bodies when applied to flood-prone vegetation.

AB The main objective of this study was to compare woody vegetation structure and composition along a distance gradient from permanent-artificial and ephemeral-natural water points in northern Gonarezhou National Park (GNP), Zimbabwe. Woody plants were sampled in May 2010 using a stratified systematic design with plots systematically placed at 100, 500, 1000 and 2000 m from four selected water points. A total of 912 woody plants were assessed in 32 sampling plots and 63 woody plant species were recorded. There were no significant differences in mean height, number of stems per plant, density and diversity with distance from water points. Significant differences in basal areas were only recorded at 2000 m. Only one ephemeral-natural water pan showed a decrease in plant density with increase in distance from the water pan. Our results suggest that there has been some slight degradation of woody vegetation around water points in northern GNP.

AB Early Pleistocene vegetation in upland southeastern Australia included diverse rainforests and sclerophyll forests, which alternated on precessional timescales. The nature and timing of transitions between these biomes, and the role of fire in maintaining or driving transitions between them, are uncertain. Here we present a high-resolution pollen record from Stony Creek Basin, a small Early Pleistocene palaeolake in southeastern Australia. The pollen record documents a pattern of vegetation change, over ca. 10 ka at ca. 1590-1600 ka, between sclerophyll forests, dominated by Eucalyptus, Callitris (Cupressaceae) or Casuarinaceae, and rainforests dominated by either angiosperms or conifers of the family Podocarpaceae. Transitions between these biomes typically occurred within ca. 1-2 ka. The associated charcoal record suggests that greatest biomass combustion occurred when local vegetation was dominated by Eucalyptus, and the least biomass combustion occurred when local vegetation was dominated by Podocarpaceae. However, local fires burnt in both sclerophyll and angiosperm-dominated rainforest vegetation, at least once every several centuries. Fire was very rare (less than about one fire per millennium) only when the local vegetation was rainforest dominated by Podocarpaceae. This suggests that fire was an irregular presence in both sclerophyll- and angiosperm-dominated rainforest biomes during the late Neogene, though was largely absent in Podocarpaceae-dominated rainforests.

AB Environmentally-friendly methods for controlling microbial pathogenesis in aquaculture with probiotic bacteria are becoming increasingly preferred over the use of chemical means, such as disinfectants or antibiotics. Previous research at the Milford Laboratory has shown that naturally-occurring bacteria isolated from the digestive glands of adult oysters (Crassostrea virginica) show promise as potential probiotic additives in oyster larviculture, based on bench-scale experiments. The previous, bench-scale challenge studies reported in the accompanying article (Lim et al. this volume) indicated that 48-h survival of 2-day-old oyster larvae supplemented with Vibrio sp. strain OY15 improved after challenge with pathogenic Vibrio sp. strain B183 compared with the pathogen alone. This study investigated further the effectiveness of probiotic candidate OY15 to improve survival of oyster larvae to metamorphosis under pilot-scale culture conditions, both with and without pathogen B183 challenge. The effective dosage of probiotic candidate OY15 that significantly improved larval survival was determined to be 10(3) cfu/mL. The LD50 calculated for pathogen B183 was 9.6 X 10(4) cfu/mL. Results from these bioassays indicated that addition of probiotic candidate OY15 significantly improved survival of oyster larvae to metamorphosis when challenged with pathogen B183 in pilot-scale trials. These studies can provide the basis for the development of functional foods for use in shellfish larviculture that incorporate a naturally-occurring, probiotic bacterial strain.

AB A seed-feeding beetle, Sulcobruchus subsuturalis (Pic) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), was released in South Africa in 1999 as a biological control agent against the invasive, leguminous, scrambling shrub Caesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston (Fabaceae). Despite being easy to rear in the laboratory and having been released in large numbers (>350 000) and widely distributed at many field sites, the beetle remains scarce where present and has failed to persist at many of the original release sites. Although eggs are oviposited readily on loose seeds in dishes, the few eggs that were found at release sites in the field were always on seeds still attached to pods hanging on plants. High levels of predation and parasitism were recorded in the field, which may be hindering population expansion by the beetle. Clarity about the taxonomic status of S. subsuturalis, and uncertainty as to the centre of origin of the weed, have led to suspicions that C. decapetala may exist as several biotypes, and that the local variety may not be a suitable host for the form of S. subsuturalis that has been imported into South Africa. These uncertainties should be addressed, together with additional efforts to determine what is happening to the agent in the field. Other phytophagous species from different feeding-guilds need to be investigated as potential biological control agents.

AB Dry tropical forest tree species show variations in leafless duration (i.e. deciduousness), stem wood density (SWD), leaf mass area (LMA) and leaf strategy index (LSI, reflecting resource use rate) to overcome water limitations. We investigated the role of these tree traits in the seasonal timing of flowering and subsequent fruiting. Flowering and fruiting time of 24 tree species was recorded over two consecutive annual cycles and their relationships with the abovementioned tree specific traits were examined across the species. In leaf-exchanging species having higher SWD and LMA, low LSI and short deciduousness, flowering coincides with leaf transitional state when vegetative growth is at its minimum, and fruit formation and leaf flushing are both supported at the same time. However, > 4-months-deciduous species with lowest SWD and LMA, higher LSI and longer deciduousness showed predominantly dry season flowering, subsequent fruiting on leafless shoots and distinct separation of vegetative and flowering phenophases. In contrast, intermediate species (< 2 months-deciduous, 2-4-months-deciduous) showed wider flowering range through summer, rainy, autumn or winter seasons. Fruiting duration varies considerably with variation in the flowering time; ca. 5-14 months in summer flowering species; 7-12 months in rainy flowering species; 6-10 months in autumn flowering species, 4-9 months in dry season flowering and 3-7 months in winter flowering species. In most species, fruit maturation occurred just prior to the onset of rains, ensuring seedling survival. The ability of tree species to withstand (leaf-exchange) or avoid (deciduousness) drought stress and varying seasonal flowering timings appear to be the principal mechanisms for successful survival and reproduction under extremely dry and seasonal climate. Since environmental characteristics affect flowering and fruiting either directly (e.g. through conditions in the habitat) or indirectly (e.g. through deciduousness, LMA, SWD and LSI), the impact of probable global climatic change will have long implications on reproduction of dry tropical trees.

AB We report evidence of hierarchical resource selection by large herbivores and plant neighbouring effects in a Mediterranean ecosystem. Plant palatability was assessed according to herbivore foraging decisions. We hypothesize that under natural conditions large herbivores follow a hierarchical foraging pattern, starting at the landscape scale, and then selecting patches and individual plants. A between- and within-patch selection study was carried out in an area formed by scrubland and pasture patches, connected by habitat edges. With regard to between-patch selection, quality-dependent resource selection is reported: herbivores mainly consume pasture in spring and woody plants in winter. Within-patch selection was also observed in scrub habitats, influenced by season, relative patch palatability and edge effect. We defined a Proximity Index (PI) between palatable and unpalatable plants, which allowed verification of neighbouring effects. In spring, when the preferred food resource (i.e. herbs) is abundant, we observed that in habitat edges large herbivores basically select the relatively scarce palatable shrubs, whereas inside scrubland, unpalatable shrub consumption was related to increasing PI. In winter, a very different picture was observed; there was low consumption of palatable species surrounded by unpalatable species in habitat edges, where the latter were more abundant. These outcomes could be explained though different plant associations described in the literature. We conclude that optimal foraging theory provides a conceptual framework behind the observed interactions between plants and large herbivores in Mediterranean ecosystems.

AB 1. Similarity indices are commonly used for multivariate analyses, estimations of beta-diversity and assessments of ecological impacts of disturbances. Both statistical and ecological criteria have guided index selections. The former criteria includes accuracy (i.e. how close an estimate is to the true value) and precision (i.e. how repeatable different estimates are) while the latter is focused on detection of known assemblage changes or environmental gradients.
   2. These two types of criteria, however, often lead to conflicting recommendations of similarity indices. We hypothesized that a key statistical criterion, accuracy, is either irrelevant or incompatible with the ecological criteria.
   3. To test this hypothesis, we compared eight commonly used similarity indices for quantifying the responses of stream macroinvertebrate assemblages to a simulated stress gradient based on both types of criteria.
   4. Chao's abundance-based Jaccard and Sorenson coefficients, and Morisita index were most accurate but strongly nonlinear in response to linear community changes and the least or less capable of discriminating stress levels. By comparison, the Bray-Curtis index, CY similarity index and Canberra Metric were less or least accurate, but outperformed the first three indices in all ecological criteria used. Multiple linear regressions confirmed that accuracy is irrelevant to or incompatible with the ecological criteria.
   5. Synthesis and applications. By examining the relationships between the statistical and ecological performances of similarity indices, our study provides a critical synthesis of index evaluations and clarified much existing confusion about index selection.

AB This study set out to generate estimates of the standing perennial biomass for six different vegetation types, and associated upland and lowland habitats, across the altitudinal gradient presented by the Kamiesberg mountain range in the Namaqualand region of the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Volume-biomass regressions, established for 94 perennial species accounting for 70-80% of the plant cover, were used to generate these estimations. Comparisons to other studies give similar findings, corroborating the method adopted. Biomass was found to vary significantly in relation to the altitudinal, and associated rainfall, gradient, as well as by habitat type where the rocky uplands have considerably more biomass that the sandy lowland habitats. An examination of the impact of sustained heavy grazing associated with a communal rangeland on this standing perennial biomass, showed a significant decrease in on the lowland habitats. This loss in biomass is principally of palatable species, with no evidence of a response in terms of perennial biomass. These findings point to degradation on the lowland habitats of the communal rangeland, with negative consequences for livestock farmers in the region. (C) 2010 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Animal population sizes and trends, as well as their distributions, are essential information to the understanding and conservation of ecosystems. During this study in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa, a spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta Erxleben, 1777 (Hyaenidae) population was surveyed by attracting individuals with pre-recorded sounds. The hyaena population (excluding cubs) is substantially larger (321 individuals) than the previous estimate of 200 and this population is the second largest protected population 2 in South Africa. Average hyaena density, at 0.357 individuals/km(2), was relatively high compared to other southern African conservation areas, and range from 0 to 1.25 individuals/km(2) across sampling stations. For short periods, spatial heterogeneity in density was marked at small and large spatial scales, but decreased when averaged over a longer period. This heterogeneity may be important in promoting the coexistence of other large and mobile carnivores in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park by creating potential dynamic competition refugia in space and time. Furthermore, heterogeneity of hyaena density at smaller scales should influence studies investigating the avoidance of hyaenas by competitively inferior carnivores.

AB Zonation patterns on rocky shores are typically as a result of both physical factors and biological interactions. Physical factors generally set the upper limits of species distributions whereas biological interactions generally set their lower limits. However, recent research has shown that biological factors can also influence the upper limits of species' recruitment and colonisation. Whereas such evidence has been shown for rocky shores internationally, little experimental evidence exists for South African shores. This study provided such evidence for the biological effects of long-term exclusion (for the period 2003-2008) of the South African herbivorous limpet Cymbula oculus (Born), on the community structure of the Kalk Bay rocky intertidal zone on the South African south-western Cape coast. To demonstrate this, a herbivore exclusion experiment was set up in the mid-eulittoral zone in May 2003. Initially, all herbivores were removed from the exclusion plots; after one year, only C. oculus individuals recruiting into the plots were continually removed. Algal recruitment (percentage cover abundance) was determined monthly for the first 12 months and then annually thereafter, whereas invertebrate recruitment (density) was monitored only annually. The results showed that the natural density of C. oculus had increased markedly during the first year (from 4.87 +/- 1.09 individuals m(-2) to 12.35 +/- 1.70 individuals m(-2), p = 0.001), and that grazing by C. oculus is the primary biological factor preventing the recruitment and colonisation of macroalgae and some invertebrates onto the Kalk Bay intertidal zone. Not only does herbivory by C. oculus prevent recruitment and colonisation, but it also decreases algal diversity and prevents algal succession. Within the mid-eulittoral zone of the Kalk Bay rocky intertidal zone, herbivory by C. oculus is thus more important in structuring this marine community than physical factors associated with desiccation stress.

AB To analyse the ecological patterns of distribution of the avifaunas of the Neotropical humid montane forests, by assessing the degree of habitat restriction among species through the calculation of a numerical index, analysing their relationships with adjacent habitat, and exploring the relative contribution of both higher and lower habitats in shaping the avian assemblages.
   The Neotropical humid montane forests, from Mexico to north-western Argentina.
   The degree of species' restriction to the habitat was calculated through a restriction index based on published endemicity indexes. The index scores range from 0 to 1: a score of 1 indicates a totally endemic species (i.e. fully restricted to the habitat); values tending to 0 indicate a widespread species.
   In Mesoamerica, completely restricted species represent a lower proportion of the total avifauna than in South American humid montane forests; whereas species shared to other habitats showed a higher proportion of the avifauna with affinities to higher altitude forests (e.g. pine and pine-oak forests). South America, on the other hand, holds assemblages with a high proportion of completely restricted species; species shared to other habitats showed a high proportion of taxa with affinities to lowland forests.
   The ecological distribution of the HMF's avifauna could be partitioned in three main components: the ecologically restricted avifauna, the high altitude species and, the lower altitude species, which are tightly associated to the floristic composition along the gradient. The history of formation of the HMF flora and the ecological distribution of different avian taxa suggest a common history. Finally, the restriction index allowed a detailed evaluation of the composition of avian assemblages, their degree of restriction to the habitat and of the affinities regarding adjacent habitats, as well as an accurate distinction between species richness and restricted species richness, which should be a fundamental step towards the establishment of conservation priorities.

AB We compared avian communities and vegetation characteristics in invaded and uninvaded pine barren ecosystems to test whether invasive woody plants were altering native bird communities, We hypothesized that structural changes in vegetation caused by the invasion of fire-intolerant deciduos,,, trees were altering bird communities in (lie Albany pine Bush, east central New York State. We recorded bird calls at 55 stations during breeding season to estimate abundances of breeding birds in areas dominated by fire-dependent pine-shrub savanna and areas dominated by invasive hardwoods (black locust. Robinia pseudoacacia, and aspens, Populus tremuloides and P. grandidentata). Vegetation surveys were conducted surrounding each station to quantify woody plant composition and structure. Sites, characterized Lis invaded had more vegetation layers, twice as much closed canopy, and higher tree stein densities in all but the largest (> 25 cm dia) size classes. Forty-seven bird species were recorded thirty-three at both invaded and uninvaded sites. Grassland/shrubland birds. Such as prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor). field sparrow (Spizella pusilla). red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), and eastern towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus). were twice as frequent and three times as abundant at uninvaded sites. Native bird species characteristic of closed-canopy forest were more frequent and abundant at stations in invaded sites. Multivariate analyses indicate distinct associations of particular birds with unique combinations of vegetation characteristics that differed between invaded and uninvaded points. A campaign of adaptive fire management holds promise to restore critical avian habitat in protected areas of this threatened barrens ecosystem.

AB Monthly flowering and fruiting observations were recorded for the most dominant species (11 annual herbs, 72 perennial herbs, 21 shrubs, and 8 trees) in a temperate forest, during 2004, in the Cerro Altamirano Core Zone of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve in central Mexico. Intraspecific synchrony in flowering and fruiting of eight woody species was estimated by monitoring 20 individuals of each. Flowering and fruiting occurred mainly during the rainy season and at the beginning of the dry season (Jul-Dec) and showed a low degree of seasonality. Reproductive activity within growth forms occurred in different periods: 1) annual and perennial herbs flowered principally during the rainy season and at the beginning of the dry season, while their fruiting peaked during the dry season; 2) shrubs produced flowers and fruits throughout the year without peaks in any season; and 3) nearly all trees had flowers and fruits during the dry season. Correlations of the number of flowering species at community level and perennial herbs against rainfall showed a significant positive relationship. However a negative relationship was found between rainfall and number of fruiting species in shrubs and trees. High reproductive synchrony (> 60% of individuals in the same phenological phase) was detected in five tree species. Phenological reproductive patterns in the study area, essentially a temperate high altitude forest in the tropics, were similar to those documented for the seasonal lowland tropical forests, mainly explained by annual rainfall and growth form.

AB Although differences in the mean density, biomass and size of rocky intertidal biota inside and outside MPAs have been well documented, little is known about the variability in these attributes at different spatial scales. This topic merits investigation because it can influence the outcome of reproduction, competition and predation, and thereby affect the viability of populations. In this study, a nested sampling design was used to assess differences in density and biomass of seven species of patellid limpets at the scales of plots, sites and shores inside and outside a marine protected area (MPA) on the southeast coast of South Africa. At the scale of plots, significant variation was more common inside than outside the MPA. This probably reflects differences in the general pattern of space occupancy and quality of habitats available to limpets inside and outside the MPA. Significant variation at the scale of sites was rare. This suggests that either the processes contributing to variability at this scale counteract each other or that the sites were similar in terms of habitats and ecological processes. At the scale of shores, significant variation was more common in densities than in biomass, but both occurred with equal frequency inside and outside the MPA. Variation at this scale is probably driven by a combination of recruitment and/or mortality. Five species exhibited greater spatial variability inside than outside the MPA. The spatial patterns observed did not appear to be linked with differences in the mobility, habitat requirements or susceptibility of these species to exploitation. The lack of consistent patterns suggests that each species probably responds in a different way to the ecological processes operating at these spatial scales.

AB We propose a simple method to validate vegetation types in phytosociological tables obtained with the Braun-Blanquet approach. The method is based on fuzzy set theory and it measures the sharpness of a classification of releves based on degrees of belonging calculated by similarity functions. The idea animating this work is that the validated vegetation types offer non-random species combinations that can be used to model environmental changes taking biodiversity into account. Phytosociological tables are widely available today and the information they contain can be very useful in studying environmental changes at different scales, from local to global.

AB In black cotton uplands in East Africa, four symbiotic acacia-ant species compete for possession of a single swollen thorn tree species, Acacia drepanolobium, and yet coexist at fine spatial scales. Three of the four ant species produce independent foundress queens that establish colonies claustrally within swollen thorns, most often on small saplings. We conducted surveys of such saplings at two sites in 2001 and 2004, and examined foundresses and incipient colonies within their swollen thorns to determine what factors influence their success. Competition among foundresses for nest initiation sites was intense, with an average of over one founding attempt per swollen thorn in all samples, and with living and dead queens significantly hyper-dispersed among available thorns. Combat with other foundresses was the most common cause of death among claustral queens, especially for Tetraponera penzigi. In interspecific battles for nest initiation sites, T. penzigi was dominant over Crematogaster nigriceps and C. mimosae, and C. nigriceps won over 80% of its contests with C. mimosae foundresses. For singleton foundresses, brood parasitism by the braconid wasp Trigastrotheca laikipiensis typically results in the death of the entire ant brood. Host queens defend parasite larvae, pupae and eclosed adults, apparently unable to distinguish the wasps from legitimate offspring. Rates of brood parasitism were as high as 15-20% for incipient colonies of both Crematogaster species, but were extremely low for T. nigriceps in all samples. Although T. penzigi and C. nigriceps foundresses are always solitary, approximately 18% of claustral C. mimosae colonies contain cooperating pleometrotic queens. For unparasitized, claustral C. mimosae colonies, brood production per queen did not differ between solitary and cooperating foundresses. However, the per-capita risks associated with parastitism were reduced for pleometrotic queens.

AB The nitrogen isotope signatures in the sediments amended by seal excrements, from Fildes Peninsula of King George Islands, Antarctica, were examined for their paleoecological application potential. The contents of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) and the atomic C/N ratios in the sediments show that the organic carbon and nitrogen are predominantly of marine origin and derived from seal excrements. The remarkably high delta(15)N values in the sediments may be related to at least two important factors of trophic enrichment and NH3 volatilization, which requires further studies. The large variations in the seal hair abundances and the determined delta(15)N values in the sediments signify similar changes of the historical seal populations around the study site. A significant negative correlation between the delta(15)N values and seal hair abundance was observed, and this suggests that the delta(15)N values, like the number of seal hairs, can be used as a paleoecological proxy for the historical seal populations. The time-integrated delta(15)N signatures in the sediments with predominantly animal-derived nitrogen source thus provide a new tool for estimating historical populations of seals and penguins and interpreting the underlying paleoecological processes.

AB The dynamics of Heteropogon contortus (black speargrass) populations were measured in a subset of treatments contained within an extensive grazing study conducted between 1990 and 1996 in H. contortus pasture in southern Queensland. This subset included 2 landscape positions and 3 stocking rates in both native pasture and legume-oversown native pasture.
   Severe drought conditions throughout much of the study necessitated ongoing adjustments to the original stocking rates and, as a result, drought was the major influence on the dynamics of H. contortus populations. Plant density and basal area in the silver-leaved ironbark landscape were consistently higher than those in the narrow-leaved ironbark landscape. There was limited evidence of any impact by either light or moderate stocking rate but there was evidence of an impact at the heaviest stocking rate. There was minimal impact of legume oversowing.
   Relatively large fluctuations in plant density occurred during this study resulting from the death of existing plants, due mainly to drought, and seedling recruitment. Similarly, there were relatively large fluctuations in basal area caused mainly by changes in plant size. Rates for turnover of plant numbers were relatively high whereas plant turnover rates of basal areas were relatively low. Regular seedling recruitment appeared necessary to ensure the persistence of this species. Despite the high turnover, populations were maintained at reasonable levels indicating the overall resilience of H. contortus.

AB In the effort to acquire information about tropical forests across regional scales via remote sensing, recent research notes the potential of the reflected component of middle infrared (MIR) radiation acquired by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) channel 3 (at 3.75 mum). This paper demonstrates this potential further, using MIR reflectance to determine tropical forest amount across south-west Ghana, and explores temporal variations in the MIR reflectance measured. Significant inverse relationships between forest tree density and MIR reflectance were derived for three dates. However, the remotely sensed response between the dates was observed to alter; thus temporal variability was evident. Further research to elucidate fully the factors controlling MIR reflectance and moreover its temporal variability from tropical forest canopies is required prior to its routine use in studies of tropical forests at regional scales.

AB The possible antipredation benefits of group living have been difficult to study in species where the size and incidence of groups are beyond the investigator's control. A field test with tethered Mediterranean slipper lobsters, Scyllarides latus, revealed that attack and capture rates for solitary individuals did not differ significantly from those for grouped individuals after either 3 or 24 h of exposure to potential predators. Although predator attack rates on grouped and solitary lobsters also did not differ after 3 h, they were significantly higher on groups than on solitary lobsters after 24 h. Differences in fish behaviour during the first hour of lobster exposure suggest that confusion effects played a role only initially and, presumably, conferred a short-lived advantage on clumped prey. Confusion effects were represented by a higher frequency of passes and reapproaches for fish concentrating on grouped lobsters and a lower frequency of bites. Attacks were more directed for fish concentrating on solitary lobsters. With increasing exposure time, however, groups may have served to facilitate predation because triggerfish (Balistes carolinensis) were equally successful at capturing grouped and solitary lobsters.

AB Major factors influencing the population dynamics of zooplankton are food availability and predation. Also, especially in shallow lakes, zooplankton may be affected by benthic macrophytes, some species of which produce allelopathic substances, and by suspended sediments which may constitute an additional food resource, or inhibit feeding. We estimated the influence of resource availability, predation by larval fish, and potential allelopathic substances on the population dynamics of Daphnia carinata in Tomahawk Lagoon, a shallow, coastal lake, over 14 months. Zooplankton and fish were sampled regularly, and estimates of food availability were obtained from biomasses of plant pigments and suspended sediments, and from clearance rates, fecundity and lipid-ovary indices of Daphnia. The effects of allelopathic substances in solution on the clearance rates of Daphnia were assessed regularly by comparison with rates in a 'standard' water. D. carinata underwent large fluctuations in abundance (0-258 l(-1)), with peaks of abundance in early spring. The population appears to have been severely food limited in late spring and early summer of both years; predation by juvenile fish (Gobiomorphus cotidianus) is likely to have contributed to a catastrophic decline of the Daphnia population in mid summer and to have effectively suppressed the adult daphniid breeding stock until late autumn. Substances in solution severely inhibited daphniid feeding only once, and not at a time when macrophytes (Nitella hookeri) were abundant. The possible effects of allelopathy from macrophytes on zooplankton warrant further study in other ecosystems.

AB The digestive system of the thalassinidean mud-shrimp Upogebia stellata was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Within the lumen of the midgut both filamentous and rod-shaped bacteria were observed. The hindgut microbial populations were dominated by dense mats of epimural rod-shaped bacteria. The gut contents were often dominated by diatoms but also contained bacteria, dinoflagellates, plant and algal fragments. Direct bacterial counts by epifluorescence microscopy along the length of the gut revealed a slight decrease in numbers within the midgut moving from the anterior to the posterior regions, and then a dramatic rise in numbers within the hindgut. Numbers deceased again in the posterior regions of the hindgut. Common in the transient/resident samples (bacterial population when gut contents were present) were enterobacteria and an unidentified fermenter conforming to an isolate named X-ferm. However, nearly 30% of the bacterial isolates remained unidentified. The resident-only bacterial isolates from the gut (determined when the gut was empty) were dominated by the X-ferm bacteria and to a lesser extent by the genera Vibrio and Aeromonas. With respect to the enzyme capabilities of the gut bacteria, the resident-only collection of bacterial isolates showed much higher levels of amylase, cellulase, chitinase, protease and lipase activity than the transient/resident bacterial isolate collections, suggesting that the indigenous bacteria are likely to play a significant role in the digestion of the gut contents. Thalassinidean shrimps are likely to play an important role in the breakdown of plant and detrital material, and the recycling of nutrients in marine benthic systems.

AB Trees are important components of agricultural systems in the dry tropics of Africa. The assumption that exotic species are more productive than the indigenous woodland in these situations is seldom supported by quantitative data. In this study a new technique of recognising annual growth rings from the bands of marginal parenchyma has been used to model growth in a natural population of Acacia karroo Hayne, one of the most widespread and useful trees in the savanna woodlands of southern Africa. The study showed both basal area and sectional area at ankle height to be excellent predictors of total tree volume. Stands may yield from about 1 to 4 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) dependent upon spacing and site; individual trees produced up to 1 m(3) of wood in 26 years. Maximum current annual increment was reached about 12 years after the trees approached breast height, thereafter declining until they became moribund about 8 years later. The economic rotation for wood production was close to the lifespan of the tree.

Gut contents, analyzed for abundance and diversity of prey type, showed that predator size, sex and their interaction had strong effects on prey consumption. Regardless of their size, and of prey density, S. proboscideus females consumed 25-90% more prey than males. Their filtration rates (adult II) were higher (125 mi ind.(-1) h.(-1)) than those of males (30 mi ind.(-1) h.(-1)) too. Rotifers had the highest numerical Percentage in the gut, regardless of predator size or sex. Cladocerans were only consumed by adults I and II. Adult II females consumed 28.5-43.3 mu g zooplankton dry weight ind.(-1) h.(-1). Size distribution of B. longirostris in the field and in the,out were closely similar. This study confirms S. proboscideus as a non-selective filter feeder. Since it did not eat jumping rotifers, copepod nauplii and copepodites, it may contribute to structuring its prey communities, because good escapers will be enriched in the medium, while poor escapers will be depleted.

AB Consequences of 'pushing contests' between pairs of the intertidal pulmonate limpet Siphonaria sirius were analyzed, focusing on the relationship between dominance order and resting site fidelity.  The pushing contests occurred near patches of Enteromorpha sp., their favorite algal food resource.  Three or four dominance ranks were determined from the consequences of the contests in different seasons.  Individuals in lower dominance ranks tended to shift their resting sites significantly more than those in higher ranks.  The dominance order of limpets is considered to play an important role in migration by its effect on resting site fidelity.  Density dependent dispersal, from the lower to the upper part of limpets' habitats, was observed in late summer to winter when desiccation was not a problem and food resources became abundant in less populated areas.  In late spring to summer, however, migration was directed downwards, from less to more populated areas, where desiccation pressure was relatively weaker.  This migration is considered to have a survival advantage, and the behavior of the limpets may have masked density-dependent dispersal during the two seasons.  Distribution of home site was also considered affected by aggressive social behavior during the two periods.

AB All freshwater calanoids in southern Africa belong to the family Diaptomidae of which there are two subfamilies, the Paradiaptominae (Lovenula, Paradiaptomus and Metadiaptomus) and Diaptominae (Tropodiaptomus and Thermodiaptomus). The Paradiaptominae are endemic to Africa, while the Diaptominae have one endemic African genus Thermodiaptomus, and the other genus Tropodiaptomus, occurs in other parts of the world as well as Africa, Knowledge of distribution of the Diaptomidae has been hampered by incomplete taxonomic knowledge and lack of co-ordination of available information. Distribution patterns of 19 described species and 11 new species confirm that the majority of species have a limited distribution, and that the Paradiaptominae are arid-adapted and belong to temporary pool communities. Six species are endemic to coastal pans and vleis of the western and southern Cape Province. Only those species with a wider distribution have been recorded as colonising man-made lakes. The four Lovemula species are predators and often co-exist with a Metadiaptomus species as prey. Synapomorphies of widely separated species of the Paradiaptominae, provide interesting insights into how their evolution may have been governed by vicariance, dispersal and palaeoenvironments of the African continent.

AB In response to intraspecific contact in the field, the agonistic behavior of the intertidal owl limpet, Lottia gigantea Sowerby (Gastropoda:Mollusca), ranges from forceful aggression to unequivocal evasion. In the present study, laboratory experiments demonstrated that the decision to fight or flee is strongly influenced by recent agonistic success or failure. Most limpets given an experience mimicking consecutive agonistic victories responded aggressively to subsequent contact. Limpets that were given an experience mimicking consecutive agonistic defeats responded evasively to subsequent contact. This experience-specific behavior was readily reversed by reversing the agonistic experience. In a separate experiment, we tested the effect of substratum cues on agonistic behavior. After giving each limpet 2 wk of either agonistic victories or agonistic defeats, we replaced the tile of each limpet's home range with an unfamiliar tile. Although limpets tested on unfamiliar substratum following both kinds of training were less aggressive, the differential effect of training was not diminished. Thus, previous overall agonistic experience, perhaps in concert with substratum familiarity, appears to account for at least part of the diverse behavior shown by limpets in the field.

AB Crops worldwide are simultaneously affected by weeds, which reduce yield, and by climate change, which can negatively or positively affect both crop and weed species. While the individual effects of environmental change and of weeds on crop yield have been assessed, the combined effects have not been broadly characterized. To explore the simultaneous impacts of weeds with changes in climate-related environmental conditions on future food production, we conducted a meta-analysis of 171 observations measuring the individual and combined effects of weeds and elevated CO2, drought or warming on 23 crop species. The combined effect of weeds and environmental change tended to be additive. On average, weeds reduced crop yield by 28%, a value that was not significantly different from the simultaneous effect of weeds and environmental change (27%), due to increased variability when acting together. The negative effect of weeds on crop yield was mitigated by elevated CO2 and warming, but added to the negative effect of drought. The impact of weeds with environmental change was also dependent on the photosynthetic pathway of the weed/crop pair and on crop identity. Native and non-native weeds had similarly negative effects on yield, with or without environmental change. Weed impact with environmental change was also independent of whether the crop was infested with a single or multiple weed species. Since weed impacts remain negative under environmental change, our results highlight the need to evaluate the efficacy of different weed management practices under climate change. Understanding that the effects of environmental change and weeds are, on average, additive brings us closer to developing useful forecasts of future crop performance.

AB Leaf-out and flowering are two key phenological events of plants, denoting the respective onsets of visible vegetative growth and reproduction during the year. For each species, the schedule of vegetative growth and reproduction is crucial to the maximization of its fitness. Warming-induced advances of leaf-out and flowering have been reported frequently; however, it is unclear whether the responses of the two events are equal for any given species.
   Using long-term phenological records in Europe, we examined simultaneously the responses of both leaf-out and flowering of four common temperate tree species to climate warming and further examined the effects of winter chilling, spring forcing and photoperiod on the responses of the two events.
   We found that regardless whether flowering or leaf-out occurred first, the first event advanced more than the second during 1950-2013, resulting in a prolonged time interval between the two events. The temporal changes were also supported by a similar geographical trend that the time interval between the two events increased from cold to warm sites. Due to the warming-induced reduction in chilling, the spring forcing accumulated until the second event was increased more than the forcing accumulated until the first event, and that reduced the temperature sensitivity of the second event. In addition to the effect of chilling, the shorter photoperiod, associated with the advanced spring phenology, was also likely to substantially increase the spring forcing accumulated until the second event, which thus slowed down its advance, compared to the advance of the first event. The relative contributions of chilling and photoperiod to the increased forcing varied between species and events, with chilling mostly outweighing photoperiod.
   Synthesis. This study provides the large-scale empirical evidence of prolonged time interval between leaf-out and flowering with climate warming. The unequal advances of the two events may alter the partition of resources between vegetative growth and reproduction and cause different changes of spring frost damage to vegetative and reproductive tissues, which may alter species fitness and further affect ecosystem structure and function.

AB Aims (a) To disentangle the global patterns of native and alien plant diversity on coastal sand dune ecosystems across habitats and floristic kingdoms; (b) to determine the main drivers of variation in species richness in native and alien species in these endangered ecosystems; and (c) to test for an interaction between spatial scale and native-alien richness patterns, as predicted by the invasion paradox.
   Location Global.
   Methods We collated a dataset of 14,841 vegetation plots in coastal sand dune ecosystems from around the world. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used to assess the patterns and main ecological determinants underlying native and alien species richness. Variation partitioning revealed the relative importance of environmental and anthropogenic variables.
   Results GLMs revealed strong differences among both habitats and floristic kingdoms in the number of native and alien species. Specifically, native species richness increased along the sea-inland gradient and was higher in the Cape and Paleotropical kingdoms. In contrast, alien species richness was relatively similar across habitats and kingdoms, though some differences were detected. There were strong differences between the drivers of native and alien richness; anthropogenic factors such as gross domestic product were positively associated with alien richness whereas native richness was more strongly related to environmental factors. Furthermore, we found a weak support for an invasion paradox effect.
   Conclusions Our results revealed the complexity of causal processes underpinning coastal sand dune plant biodiversity and highlight the importance of considering native and alien species separately. Recognizing these differences while researching variation in biodiversity patterns and processes at multiple spatial scales will lead to a better mechanistic understanding of the causes of invasion worldwide, and in coastal ecosystems in particular, allowing the development of more focused control and management measures.

AB Despite good recognition of distributions and spread mechanisms of the three most invasive trees in Europe (Prunus serotina,Quercus rubraandRobinia pseudoacacia), their impacts on forest biodiversity are unevenly recognized. Most studies cover only taxonomic alpha diversity, and only a single study included functional and phylogenetic diversity. Using a set of 186 study plots in western Poland we assessed the impacts of these invasive tree species on the alpha and beta taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of understory vascular plants. Alpha diversity was higher inR. pseudoacaciaforests and lower inQ. rubraforests compared to mature native forests. Compared to non-invaded plantations and forests, alpha diversity was higher inP. sylvestrisplantations invaded byP. serotina, but lower in invaded nutrient-poorP. sylvestrisforests. Alien species richness was higher and beta diversity was lower in forests invaded byP. serotinaorR. pseudoacaciathan in non-invaded forests. In contrast, beta diversity was higher inQ. rubraforests than in native forests. We proved that invaded forests differed from non-invaded forests in species composition, but not always with decreased alpha and beta diversity. Impacts of particular invasive species also depended on the reference ecosystem properties (here mature native forests, which did not always have the highest biodiversity), which is a source of inconsistency in previous studies, usually referring to single native ecosystem types.

AB Aim Large and ecologically functioning steppe complexes have been lost historically across the globe, but recent land-use changes may allow the reversal of this trend in some regions. We aimed to develop and map indicators of changing human influence using satellite imagery and historical maps, and to use these indicators to identify areas for broad-scale steppe rewilding. Location Eurasian steppes of Kazakhstan. Methods We mapped decreasing human influence indicated by cropland abandonment, declining grazing pressure and rural outmigration in the steppes of northern Kazakhstan. We did this by processing similar to 5,500 Landsat scenes to map changes in cropland between 1990 and 2015, and by digitizing Soviet topographic maps and examining recent high-resolution satellite imagery to assess the degree of abandonment of >2,000 settlements and >1,300 livestock stations. We combined this information into ahuman influence index(HI), mapped changes in HI to highlight where rewilding might take place and assessed how this affected the connectivity of steppe habitat. Results Across our study area, about 6.2 million ha of cropland were abandoned (30.5%), 14% of all settlements were fully and 81% partly abandoned, and 76% of livestock stations were completely dismantled between 1990 and 2015, suggesting substantially decreasing human pressure across vast areas. This resulted in increased connectivity of steppe habitat. Main conclusions The steppes of Eurasia are experiencing massively declining human influence, suggesting large-scale passive rewilding is taking place. Many of these areas are now important for the connectivity of the wider steppe landscape and can provide habitat for endangered megafauna such as the critically endangered saiga antelope. Yet, this window of opportunity may soon close, as recultivation of abandoned cropland is gaining momentum. Our aggregate human influence index captures key components of rewilding and can help to devise strategies for fostering large, connected networks of protected areas in the steppe.

AB A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between land cover, climate change and disturbance dynamics is needed to inform scenarios of vegetation change on the African continent. Although significant advances have been made, large uncertainties exist in projections of future biodiversity and ecosystem change for the world's largest tropical landmass. To better illustrate the effects of climate-disturbance-ecosystem interactions on continental-scale vegetation change, we apply a novel statistical multivariate envelope approach to subfossil pollen data and climate model outputs (TraCE-21ka). We target paleoenvironmental records across continental Africa, from the African Humid Period (AHP: ca 14 700-5500 yr BP) - an interval of spatially and temporally variable hydroclimatic conditions - until recent times, to improve our understanding of overarching vegetation trends and to compare changes between forest and grassy biomes (savanna and grassland). Our results suggest that although climate variability was the dominant driver of change, forest and grassy biomes responded asymmetrically: 1) the climatic envelope of grassy biomes expanded, or persisted in increasingly diverse climatic conditions, during the second half of the AHP whilst that of forest did not; 2) forest retreat occurred much more slowly during the mid to late Holocene compared to the early AHP forest expansion; and 3) as forest and grassy biomes diverged during the second half of the AHP, their ecological relationship (envelope overlap) fundamentally changed. Based on these asymmetries and associated changes in human land use, we propose and discuss three hypotheses about the influence of anthropogenic disturbance on continental-scale vegetation change.

AB Herbivory is a key process that controls the abundance and accumulation of algal turf on tropical coral reefs. The capacity of reefs to prevent algal accumulation hinges on the balance between algal production and consumption (i.e., grazing). In this study, we quantify algal turf biomass accumulation and grazing using experimental substrata and herbivore exclusion cages across sites in Kenya that represent different levels of fisheries management: heavily fished reefs, community marine-protected areas less than 10 yr old, and older government-managed marine-protected areas. These reefs had different assemblages of grazing herbivores with fished reefs being dominated by sea urchins, while government closures had a high abundance of grazing fishes, in particular parrotfishes. The community fisheries closures had an intermediate mix of sea urchins and grazing fishes, with the latter dominated by surgeonfishes. These management regimes mediated algal biomass on experimental substrata such that urchins consumed as much as 90% on fished reefs and fishes as much as 96% at the government marine-protected areas by the end of the 390-d trial. The younger community fisheries closures lacked the herbivory to significantly reduce algal biomass, and consumption was less than 50% of production and never greater than 2 g algae m(-2) d(-1). These findings point to the importance of recovery dynamics of herbivorous fishes from heavy fishing pressure. They also suggest that while sea urchins might be effective grazers to prevent macroalgal dominance, they are not a functional replacement for fishes due to their ability to reduce reef accretion through bioerosion and prevent settlement of crustose coralline algae in this system.

AB Large-bodied mammalian herbivores can influence processes that exacerbate or mitigate climate change. Herbivore impacts are, in turn, influenced by predators that place top-down forcing on prey species within a given body size range. Here, we explore how the functional composition of terrestrial large-herbivore and -carnivore guilds varies between three mammal distribution scenarios: Present-Natural, Current-Day and Extant-Native Trophic (ENT) Rewilding. Considering the effects of herbivore species weakly influenced by top-down forcing, we quantify the relative influence keystone large-herbivore guilds have on methane emissions, woody vegetation expansion, fire dynamics, large-seed dispersal, and nitrogen and phosphorus transport potential. We find strong regional differences in the number of herbivores under weak top-down regulation between our three scenarios, with important implications for how they will influence climate change relevant processes. Under the Present-Natural non-ruminant, megaherbivore, browsers were a particularly important guild across much of the world. Megaherbivore extinction and range contraction and the arrival of livestock mean large, ruminant, grazers have become more dominant. ENT Rewilding can restore the Afrotropics and the Indo-Malay realm to the Present-Natural benchmark, but causes top-down forcing of the largest herbivores to become commonplace elsewhere. ENT Rewilding will reduce methane emissions, but does not maximize natural climate solution potential. This article is part of the theme issue 'Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions'.

AB Traditional cultural landscapes are experiencing strong changes. Abandonment is one of the most significant processes, especially since the last decades of the 20th century. From a resilience approach, it is believed that the preservation of these landscapes depends on their capacity to adapt to new challenges without altering their essential characteristics. Here, we assess the resilience of a traditional periurban agricultural landscape, Huerta de Valencia during the period 2008-2013, and use landscape character areas (LCAs) to allow a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial dimension of resilience. Our main goals are: (1) to estimate two dimensions of resilience of agricultural activity (persistence and adaptability) in the different LCAs that compose Huerta de Valencia, and (2) to analyze correlations between these two dimensions and a set of factors that may explain resilience behavior in Huerta de Valencia. Our results show the existence of different behavior patterns within the set of LCAs concerning resilience and suggest the importance of the initial landscape condition in terms of abandonment, land use, type of crop, and extent of people-place connection in promoting persistence. Regarding adaptability, transformation processes are more evident in areas showing a higher rate of abandonment because reversion of abandonment to irrigated arable land is the most frequent process of change in crop management. Lessons have emerged from our study of Huerta de Valencia that could be applied to other traditional periurban landscapes. To improve resilience, change should be guided toward farm types with high levels of flexibility that facilitate adaptation, encouragement of full-time professional farming, and rise of the visibility of local varieties that are distinctive to the area. In addition, linkages between people and the physical space should be encouraged by the improvement of physical and visual connections that increase social use and appreciation of these traditional landscapes.

AB In savannas, mapping grazing resources and indicators of land degradation is important for assessing ecosystem conditions and informing grazing and land management decisions. We investigated the effects of classifiers and used time series imagery-images acquired within and across seasons-on the accuracy of plant species maps. The study site was a grazed savanna in southern Kenya. We used Sentinel-2 multi-spectral imagery due to its high spatial (10-20 m) and temporal (five days) resolution with support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. The species mapped were important for grazing livestock and wildlife (three grass species), indicators of land degradation (one tree genus and one invasive shrub), and a fig tree species. The results show that increasing the number of images, including dry season imagery, results in improved classification accuracy regardless of the classifier (average increase in overall accuracy (OA) = 0.1632). SVM consistently outperformed RF, and the most accurate model and was SVM with a radial kernel using imagery from both wet and dry seasons (OA = 0.8217). Maps showed that seasonal grazing areas provide functionally different grazing opportunities and have different vegetation characteristics that are critical to a landscape's ability to support large populations of both livestock and wildlife. This study highlights the potential of multi-spectral satellite imagery for species-level mapping of savannas.

AB Tropical and subtropical high-mountain forests are often restricted to ravines, with forest presence being rare in other topographies such as ridges. We tested the hypothesis that this distribution is partly due to increased soil water content and/or protection from winds in ravines as compared to ridges. We planted 396 saplings of the dominant tree species in a three-factor experiment that included topography (ridge/ravine), wind protection (protected/unprotected) and water addition (watered/not watered). We monitored wind speed and soil water content for one complete annual cycle and sapling survival and growth for 27 months. Sapling survival presented marginally significant differences for topography, being slightly greater in ridges than in ravines (0.88 and 0.78, respectively), with no significant differences for wind protection or water addition treatments. By contrast, sapling growth was considerably reduced in ridges as compared to ravines (16.1 and 26.0 cm, respectively); the wind protection treatment showed a significant positive effect on growth (saplings grew 25.5 and 16.5 cm with and without wind protection, respectively), whereas the water addition treatment had no effect. Importantly, saplings under wind protection treatment in ridges had similar growth to that of unprotected saplings in ravines, and growth difference due to the wind protection treatment was positively correlated with wind intensity, suggesting that reduced wind impact in ravines is an important abiotic factor that promotes forest occurrence in ravines.

AB Giant clams (subfamily Tridacninae) are prevalent members of coral reef communities and engage in symbioses with algal photosymbionts of the family Symbiodiniaceae, similar to their scleractinian coral counterparts. However, we know little about their associated bacterial microbiome members. Here, we explored bacterial community diversity of digestive system, gill, and mantle tissues associated with the giant clam Tridacna maxima across a cross-shelf gradient (inshore, midshore, and offshore reef sites) in the central Red Sea using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Different tissues harbor spatially stable and distinct microbial communities. Notably, diverse assemblages of bacteria affiliated to the family Endozoicomonadaceae were prevalent in all tissues, but particularly abundant in gills and to a lesser extent in digestive tissues. Besides Endozoicomonadaceae, bacteria in the families Pasteurellaceae, Alteromonadaceae, and Comamonadaceae were common associates, depending on the tissue queried. Taxonomy-based functional inference identified processes related to nitrogen cycling (among others) to be enriched in giant clam tissues and contributed by Endozoicomonadaceae. Our study highlights the tissue-specificity and broad taxonomic range of Endozoicomonadaceae associates, similar to other marine invertebrates, and suggests their contribution to nitrogen-related pathways. The investigation of bivalve-associated microbiome communities provides an important addition to the pathogen-focused studies for commercially important bivalves (e.g., oysters).

AB Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) have been widely used as a fundamental tool to reveal the genomic mechanisms that underlie the individual's response to environmental and developmental cues. Standard approaches infer GRNs as holistic graphs of gene coexpression, but such graphs cannot quantify how gene-gene interactions vary among individuals and how they alter structurally across spatiotemporal gradients. Here, we develop a general framework for inferring informative, dynamic, omnidirectional, and personalized networks (idopNetworks) from routine transcriptional experiments. This framework is constructed by a system of quasi-dynamic ordinary differential equations (qd0DEs) derived from the combination of ecological and evolutionary theories. We reconstruct idopNetworks using genomic data from a surgical experiment and illustrate how network structure is associated with surgical response to infrainguinal vein bypass grafting and the outcome of grafting. idopNetworks may shed light on genotype-phenotype relationships and provide valuable information for personalized medicine.

AB An in-depth look at the basic aspects of dormancy in cyclic parthenogenetic organisms is now possible thanks to research efforts conducted over the past two decades with rotifer dormant embryos. In this review, we assemble and compose the current knowledge on four central themes: (1) distribution of dormancy in animals, with an overview on the phylogenetic distribution of embryo dormancy in metazoans, and (2) physiological and cellular processes involved in dormancy, with a strong emphasis on the dormant embryos of cyclically parthenogenetic monogonont rotifers; and discussions of (3) the selective pressures and (4) the evolutionary and population implications of dormancy in these animals. Dormancy in metazoans is a widespread phenomenon with taxon-specific features, and rotifers are among the animals in which dormancy is an intrinsic feature of their life cycle. Our review shows that embryo dormancy in rotifers shares common functional pathways with other taxa at the molecular and cellular level, despite the independent evolution of dormancy across phyla. These pathways include the arrest of similar metabolic routes and the usage of common metabolites for the stabilization of cellular structures and to confer stress resistance. We conclude that specific features of recurrent harsh environmental conditions are a powerful selective pressure for the fine-tuning of dormancy patterns in rotifers. We hypothesize that similar mechanisms at the organism level will lead to similar adaptive consequences at the population level across taxa, among which the formation of egg banks, the coexistence of species, and the possibility of differentiation among populations and local adaptation stand out. Our review shows how studies of rotifers have contributed to improved knowledge of all of these aspects.

AB Due to climate change, coral reefs have experienced mass bleaching, and mortality events in recent years. Although coral reefs are unlikely to persist in their current form unless climate change can be addressed, local management can have a role to play by extending the time frame over which there are functional reef systems capable of recovery. Here we consider the potential application of one form of local management - management of herbivorous fishes. The premise behind this approach is that increased herbivory could shift reef algal assemblages to states that are benign or beneficial for corals, thereby increasing corals' ability to recover from destructive events such as bleaching and to thrive in periods between events. With a focus on Indo-Pacific coral reefs, we review what is known about the underlying processes of herbivory and coral-algal competition that ultimately affect the ability of corals to grow, persist, and replenish themselves. We then critically assess evidence of effectiveness or otherwise of herbivore management within marine protected areas (MPAs) to better understand why many MPAs have not improved outcomes for corals, and more importantly to identify the circumstances in which that form of management would be most likely to be effective. Herbivore management is not a panacea, but has the potential to enhance coral reef persistence in the right circumstances. Those include that: (i) absent management, there is an "algal problem" - i.e., insufficient herbivory to maintain algae in states that are benign or beneficial for corals; and (ii) management actions are able to increase net herbivory. As increased corallivory is a potentially widespread negative consequence of management, we consider some of the circumstances in which that is most likely to be a problem as well as potential solutions. Because the negative effects of certain algae are greatest for coral settlement and early survivorship, it may be that maintaining sufficient herbivory is particularly important in promoting recovery from destructive events such as mass bleaching. Thus, herbivore management can have a role to play as part of a wider strategy to manage and reduce the threats that currently imperil coral reefs.

AB Aim The interactive effects of increased temperature and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on terrestrial and aquatic biota remain poorly understood. Our goal is to increase knowledge by providing a comprehensive assessment of the combined effects of warming and increased UV-B on organisms across these domains. Location Global. Time period 1995-2016. Major taxa studied Terrestrial plants and animals, and marine and freshwater microalgae, macroalgae and animals. Methods We examined, using a meta-analysis based on 1,139 published experimental assessments, the combined effects of temperature and UV-B across terrestrial, freshwater and marine biota. We characterized the prevailing mode of combined effects (additive, synergistic or antagonistic), and assessed whether these were dose-dependent or differed between terrestrial, freshwater and marine species, or between organisms growing in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Results Our results show that the two stressors generally acted opposingly, with a significant positive effect of increased temperature and a significant adverse effect of elevated UV-B radiation. Regarding their interactive impact, additive interactions (84%) appeared to be much more common compared with multiplicative (16%) effects. The frequencies of interaction types differed significantly among the three habitats and different plant functional groups. The proportion of both synergistic and antagonistic effects increased with increasing magnitude of temperature and UV-B changes, suggesting that additivity is constrained by an organism's thermal and physiological limits. Main conclusions Our analysis demonstrates that due to their mostly opposing nature, elevated temperature, within the thermal limits of organisms, tends to compensate for the negative impact of UV-B radiation when acting together, while their additive interaction is likely to assist impact prognosis. Our study, therefore, provides new insights into the predictions of the interactive effects of global change drivers across different habitats.

AB Estimating spatial and temporal resource use and partitioning among carnivore species varies based on life history and is critical to understanding ecological relationships of sympatric carnivores and their prey. Temporal variation in food availability can have a substantial influence on distribution, foraging behavior, prey selection, and population dynamics of carnivores. We investigated shifts in space use of black bears (Ursus americanus), bobcats (Lynx rufus), coyotes (Canis latrans), and gray wolves (C. lupus) in response to seasonal availability of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawns in Michigan, USA, May-August 2009-2011. We used generalized linear mixed models to identify whether probabilistic fawn space use resulted in shifts in carnivore space use from deer pre-parturition (PPP, 1 May-24 May) to fawn limited mobility (LMP, 25 May-30 June) and social mobility (SMP, 1 July-31 August) periods. We developed a rule-based algorithm to identify "clusters" of carnivore GPS locations and investigated carnivore clusters to identify fawn predation sites. Carnivores shifted space use among periods, but responses varied among species regarding fawn space use. Black bears selected against areas with greater fawn use during LMP and selected areas with greater fawn use during SMP. We suggest black bear space use was unrelated to fawn space use and reflected availability of vegetative forage. Bobcats selected areas with greater fawn use during LMP and SMP. Coyotes were indifferent to areas where fawns occurred during LMP but selected against areas with greater fawn use during SMP, likely foraging on alternative prey. Coyotes were spatially constrained by wolves, selecting against areas with greater wolf use during LMP and SMP. Wolves selected against areas with greater fawn use during LMP and SMP and selected areas near habitat edges and areas containing livestock carcasses. Carnivore responses to fawn white-tailed deer distribution and vulnerability were congruent with life history strategies, resulting in space use shifts in response to temporarily abundant resources. Carnivores did not overall rely predominantly on fawns, likely shifting their space use to maximize intake of other seasonal resources. These events provide additional insight into life history strategies among co-occurring species and dynamics of multi-species predator-prey systems.

AB Phylogenies recurrently demonstrate that oceanic island systems have been home to rapid clade diversification and adaptive radiations. The existence of adaptive radiations posits a central role of natural selection causing ecological divergence and speciation, and some plant radiations have been highlighted as paradigmatic examples of such radiations. However, neutral processes may also drive speciation during clade radiations, with ecological divergence occurring following speciation. Here, we document an exceptionally rapid and unique radiation of Lamiaceae within the New Caledonian biodiversity hotspot. Specifically, we investigated various biological, ecological, and geographical drivers of species diversification within the genus Oxera. We found that Oxera underwent an initial process of rapid cladogenesis likely triggered by a dramatic period of aridity during the early Pliocene. This early diversification of Oxera was associated with an important phase of ecological diversification triggered by significant shifts of pollination syndromes, dispersal modes, and life forms. Finally, recent diversification of Oxera appears to have been further driven by the interplay of allopatry and habitat shifts likely related to climatic oscillations. This suggests that Oxera could be regarded as an adaptive radiation at an early evolutionary stage that has been obscured by more recent joint habitat diversification and neutral geographical processes. Diversification within Oxera has perhaps been triggered by varied ecological and biological drivers acting in a leapfrog pattern, but geographic processes may have been an equally important driver. We suspect that strictly adaptive radiations may be rare in plants and that most events of rapid clade diversification may have involved a mixture of geographical and ecological divergence.

AB Restoring nutrients lost in the mining process and re-establishing nutrient-cycling are often key goals of mine restoration. One common strategy to facilitate these goals is to seed fast-growing legumes combined with one application of P-fertiliser to maximise legume growth and increase soil-N. However, the longer term effects of this strategy have received little attention. Here we report the results of a 15-year-old experiment that was established to test the effects of fertiliser-P application and seeding large understorey legumes, both singly and in combination, on jarrah forest restoration after bauxite mining.
   Fifteen years after the establishment of this experiment, the majority of the seeded legumes had senesced, with total legume cover having declined significantly compared with results of the same experiment at 5-years-of-age. Yet, despite the legumes having senesced there were still negative effects of both large legumes and P-fertiliser on species richness and abundance of non-leguminous understorey species. These negative effects may be mediated by the persistent effects of legume competition that was evident at 5 years and the accumulation of significant quantities of leaf litter and fine woody debris in the large legume x P-addition treatments. Compared with the 0 kg P ha(-1) treatment, application of 20 kg P ha(-1) significantly increased jarrah tree growth, but there was no additional benefit of 80 kg P ha(-1). These data suggest that moderation of P-fertiliser and large under-storey legumes could maximise understorey cover, tree growth and understorey species richness, and therefore simultaneously address multiple key restoration goals.

AB Invasions of many plant species strongly depend on propagule pressure. Thus, habitat-related differences in seed dispersal could affect susceptibility of distinct habitat types to plant invasions. We examined the fate of northern red oak (Quercus rubra, invasive in Europe) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur, native in Europe) acorns dispersed by yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicoilis) in (i) hardwood stands invaded by northern red oak, (ii) uninvaded hardwood stands dominated by native oaks, and (iii) uninvaded coniferous stands dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Regardless of forest type, mice preferred to harvest and consume pedunculate rather than red oak acorns. Similarly, acorn harvest rates were unaffected by forest type. However, the fate of acorns, and thus effectiveness of seed dispersal, varied considerably among forest types. Acorns had the highest probability of being cached in uninvaded hardwood stands, while coniferous stands were characterized by the longest seed dispersal distances and a high proportion of missing seeds (probably indicating larderhoarding). Relative to the other forest types, stands with northern red oak were characterized by a combination of low acorn caching rates and short dispersal distances. These findings suggest that differences in rodent-mediated seed dispersal might increase recruitment rates of northern red oak at the edges of invaded range.

AB Many Australian native plants from regions with ancient, highly weathered soils have specialised adaptations for acquiring phosphorus (P) and can exhibit negative effects of excess P supply on growth and survival. Despite this, fertiliser (including P) is routinely applied in post-mining and other restoration schemes. In this study we investigated the effect of a range of applied P on the growth and tissue P concentrations for six woody species from the Great Western Woodlands (GWW) of Western Australia - a region that it not only biodiverse, but that has experienced significant levels of mining related activities. Our data from a pot-based experiment show that all six species exhibited greater growth with increased P application up to 15 mg kg sand(-1). However, at P concentrations in excess of 15 mg kg(-1), dry mass accumulation did not increase further for three of the species tested. For the other three species, dry mass accumulation declined as the P concentration increased above 15 mg kg-1. For all of the study species, root and shoot P concentrations increased as the concentration of applied P increased. The internal shoot P concentration, at which dry matter accumulation either plateaued or started to decline, was in the range 1.95 to 3.2 mg P g(-1) dry matter. This was similar to 2-4 times the concentration found in natural vegetation. These data suggest that in a restoration context, there is a potential risk that, excess P application may decrease plant growth rates for some species. Consequently, the addition of fertiliser to restored sites may have unpredictable impacts on the plant community by directly reducing the growth of some species but increasing the growth of others. We suggest that careful consideration should be given to designing appropriate fertiliser regimes for land restoration schemes in ancient P deplete landscapes to avoid the risk that fertiliser addition has the unwanted outcome of decreasing growth and survival of the target native species and increasing the abundance of unwanted weeds or aggressive pioneer species.

AB Invasive alien tree species can strongly impact biodiversity and future projections predict their spread over natural, semi-natural and human habitats. However, little is known about plant communities that form during the first stages of invasion. We investigated the composition of plant communities in alien Robinia pseudoacacia L. secondary forests growing on grasslands and cultivated areas abandoned during the last 35-40 years in north-eastern Italy to understand whether these formations could cause floristic homogenization of plant communities composition. On the basis of a cluster analysis, plant communities were assigned to seven syntaxonomic categories and split into four groups characterized by the occurrence of 20 species indicative of (a) nitrogen-rich, (b) true forest and (c) open habitat conditions. RDA analysis enabled main stand and environmental variables filtering these communities to be identified and B-diversity components were partitioned through the SDR (Similarity - richness Difference - species Replacement) simplex approach. Plant composition patterns were significantly associated to variability in elevation, stand vertical structure, shrub cover, mean tree diameter and height, and basal area. Shrub cover discriminates between plant communities associated with open or shaded conditions. The partition of B-diversity components revealed that replacement is the prominent process structuring plant communities in these secondary forests. Our study showed that secondary Robinia forests growing on abandoned lands may host compositionally heterogeneous plant communities, thus contributing to regional biodiversity.

AB Life history changes may change resource use. Such shifts are not well understood in the dung beetles, despite recognised differences in larval and adult feeding ability. We use the flightless dung beetle Circellium bacchus to explore such shifts, identifying dung sources of adults using DNA metabarcoding, and comparing these with published accounts of larval dung sources. C. bacchus is traditionally considered to specialise on the dung of large herbivores for both larval and adult feeding. We successfully extracted mammal DNA from 151 adult C. bacchus fecal samples, representing 16 mammal species (ranging from elephants to small rodents), many of which are hitherto undescribed in the diet. Adult C. bacchus showed clear dung source preferences, especially for large herbivores inhabiting dense-cover vegetation. Our approach also confirmed the presence of cryptic taxa in the study area, and we propose that this may be used for biodiversity survey and monitoring purposes. Murid rodent feces were the most commonly fed-upon dung source (77.5%) for adult C. bacchus, differing markedly from the large and megaherbivore dung sources used for larval rearing. These findings support the hypothesis of life history-specific shifts in resource use in dung beetles, and reveal a hitherto unsuspected, but ecologically important, role of these dung beetles in consuming rodent feces. The differences in feeding abilities of the larval and adult life history stages have profound consequences for their resource use and foraging strategies, and hence the ecological role of dung beetles. This principle and its ecological consequences should be explored in other scarabaeids.

AB While most Vibrionaceae are considered generalists that thrive on diverse substrates, including animal-derived material, we show that Vibrio breoganii has specialized for the consumption of marine macroalga-derived substrates. Genomic and physiological comparisons of V. breoganii with other Vibrionaceae isolates revealed the ability to degrade alginate, laminarin, and additional glycans present in algal cell walls. Moreover, the widely conserved ability to hydrolyze animal-derived polymers, including chitin and glycogen, was lost, along with the ability to efficiently grow on a variety of amino acids. Ecological data showing associations with particulate algal material but not zooplankton further support this shift in niche preference, and the loss of motility appears to reflect a sessile macroalga-associated lifestyle. Together, these findings indicate that algal polysaccharides have become a major source of carbon and energy in V. breoganii, and these ecophysiological adaptations may facilitate transient commensal associations with marine invertebrates that feed on algae.
   IMPORTANCE Vibrios are often considered animal specialists or generalists. Here, we show that Vibrio breoganii has undergone massive genomic changes to become specialized on algal carbohydrates. Accompanying genomic changes include massive gene import and loss. These vibrios may help us better understand how algal biomass is degraded in the environment and may serve as a blueprint on how to optimize the conversion of algae to biofuels.

AB Protected area managers need reliable information to detect spatial and temporal trends of the species they intend to protect. This information is crucial for population monitoring, understanding ecological processes, and evaluating the effectiveness of management and conservation policies. In under-funded protected areas, managers often prioritize ungulates and carnivores for monitoring given their socio-economic value and sensitivity to human disturbance. Aircraft-based surveys are typically utilized for monitoring ungulates because they can cover large areas regardless of the terrain, but such work is expensive and subject to bias. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles have shown great promise for ungulate monitoring, but these technologies are not yet widely available and are subject to many of the same analytical challenges associated with traditional aircraft-based surveys. Here, we explore use of inexpensive and robust distance sampling methods in Kafue National Park (KNP) (22,400 km(2)), carried out by government-employed game scouts. Ground-based surveys spanning 101, 5-km transects resulted in 369 ungulate group detections from 20 species. Using generalized linear models and distance sampling, we determined the environmental and anthropogenic variables influencing ungulate species richness, density, and distribution. Species richness was positively associated with permanent water and percent cover of closed woodland vegetation. Distance to permanent water had the strongest overall effect on ungulate densities, but the magnitude and direction of this effect varied by species. This ground-based approach provided a more cost-effective, unbiased, and repeatable method than aerial surveys in KNP, and could be widely implemented by local personnel across under-funded protected areas in Africa.

AB The quantification of carbon stocks is vital for decision making in forest management, carbon stock change assessment and scientific applications. We applied the land degradation surveillance framework (LDSF) method with a sentinel site of (10 km x 10 km) to assess carbon stock levels and tree diversity in the Marsabit Forest Reserve (MFR). The above ground (ABG) carbon stock was estimated at 12.42 t/ha, while soil organic carbon (SOC) was 12.51 t/ha, with SOC densities increasing with increasing depth. The mean ABG carbon and SOC densities were higher in the least disturbed strata than the disturbed strata. The estimated ABG carbon and SOC stocks were significantly lower than the range observed in a typical dry tropical forest. Twenty-one tree species were recorded belonging to twelve families with the disturbed areas recording nine tree species while the least disturbed recording twelve species. Rubiaceae and Rutaceae were the richest families with four species each while Boraginaceae, Capparaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Tiliaceae, Violaceae, and Ochnaceae the least frequent with one species each. The most common tree species were, Croton megalocarpus, Drypetes gerrardii, Ochna insculpta, Strychnos henningsii and Vangueria madagascariensis. The forest recorded a basal diameter of 14.09 +/- 12.15 cm, basal area of 0.016 m 2/ha with a mean height of 8.69 m. The basal size class distribution declined monotonically indicative of a stable population. Livestock grazing, selective logging, and firewood collection were the primary forms of anthropogenic activities recorded in the MFR despite the moratorium imposed on consumptive utilisation of forest products by the Marsabit County security committee. The Pearson correlation coefficient returned an inverse relationship between forest disturbance with SOC and ABG carbon in the disturbed strata suggesting that anthropogenic activities reduced carbon stocks in the MFR. Concerted efforts to mitigate anthropogenic impacts on the MFR could significantly increase its terrestrial carbon sequestration potential and the provision of critical ecosystem goods and services.

AB The restoration and evaluation of degraded ecosystems is an important component of the sustainable development of complex "human-natural-economic" ecosystems. Based on an analysis of ecosystem evolution and the integration of structure, function, and services, this study proposes that ecosystems can be returned to a self-maintaining, dynamic balance by enriching system elements, strengthening the relationships between the different elements and diverse ecological processes, and restoring internal functions, which includes the self-regulation of degraded ecosystems. This study developed and categorized quarry ecosystem recovery indicators based on the Core Capabilities of the Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) International through literature review and the development of recovery plans. Metrics identified in the literature were validated through the recovery plan review and the case study, and based on the findings, a user-friendly checklist for practitioners was established. Three elements and 17 indicators representing ecological processes, vegetation structures, and ecological functions were developed to evaluate and manage the ecological restoration of an abandoned quarry.

AB Despite widespread recognition of the crucial role seabirds play in the fertilization of nutrient-poor polar terrestrial ecosystems, no studies have attempted a concurrent analysis of the entire or large proportion of an ornithogenically-supported food web. The aim of the current study was to assess the significance of allochthonous nutrient enrichment of key elements of the Bjornoya (Svalbard) terrestrial ecosystem by investigating how different seabird species influenced the characteristics of soil, vegetation, and soil invertebrates (direct ornithogenic effects), and also how those characteristics were interrelated (indirect ornithogenic effects). We sampled in the vicinity of a little auk (Alle alle) colony, and in areas occupied by great skua (Stercorarius skua) and glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus) nests. Our data demonstrate clear, multi-trophic-level, ornithogenic impacts across the terrestrial ecosystem, with most of the measured parameters of soil, vegetation and invertebrates being altered by proximity to bird nesting areas, though to varying degrees. The ornithogenic effects tended to weaken with increasing complexity of interactions between the ecosystem components, with progression through successive trophic levels. The clearest responses were observed for soil (higher nitrogen stable isotope ratio delta N-15, nitrogen and water content) and vegetation characteristics (higher delta N-15, N content and total cover, lower diversity and species number, and modified community composition). The responses seen in the invertebrate communities were less clear (community composition change), and were only apparent when major invertebrate groups were considered together and for the assumed decomposers: springtails and oribatid mites, while not in the case of predators (mesostigmatid mites and one spider species). There were also suggestions in the data that different seabird species may have different impacts on the surrounding environment, probably due to their different diet and nesting area topography. However, generally, the species of bird was a weaker factor than the presence of a seabird colony or nest itself. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Exploitation of anthropogenic foods has profound effects on various aspects of the behavior and ecology of nonhuman primates. On the Cape Peninsula, South Africa, incentives to exploit novel resources are high and most local chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) feed on anthropogenic foods. Here we investigate the foraging profile, activity budget, and ranging behavior of a Peninsula group that feeds exclusively on natural foods. We predicted that the group would exploit the marine foods available to them and feed more extensively on subterranean foods, spend more time feeding and traveling, and occupy a larger area and travel further than groups that feed on anthropogenic foods, and groups elsewhere that occupy highly productive habitats. We tracked the group using handheld GPS units, and recorded behavioral data using instantaneous scan sampling in four seasons through 13 months. Our predictions were supported with the study group feeding on marine foods during all for seasons, but allocating a small percentage (< 5%) of their total feeding time to exploiting these foods. Also, the group used a greater area (45.3 km(2)) and traveled further (5.9 km/day), and allocated more time to feeding and traveling, than previously studied groups on the Peninsula that exploit anthropogenic foods. These findings highlight behavioral variation in baboons associated with anthropogenic food use. Comparison of our results with those reported elsewhere should allow management authorities to more accurately predict changes in behavior of cercopithecoid monkeys as their access to anthropogenic foods is gradually restricted.

AB The current study aims at identifying and measuring components and factors affecting social and economic resilience in Rudbar, Iran. This applied research is using descriptive and analytical methods. The sample size in the study was estimated as 345 households using the Cochran's formula. Using library resources and experts, the components and factors affecting social and economic resilience were identified. Afterwards, the required date and information were collected using field method and household questionnaire. To analyze the data, descriptive and analytical statistical methods, including one-sample t-test, univariate and multiple linear regressions, were used. Awareness, knowledge, skill, attitude and social capital indices were considered as components of social resilience and the amount and severity of damage, compensation, and the possibility of returning to occupational and financial conditions were considered as the economic resilience components. Results of descriptive statistics showed that, in terms of social resilience (216.3 +/- 33.4) and economic resilience (30.6 +/- 7.3) (Mean +/- SD), households in Rudbar were in a relatively appropriate and inappropriate conditions, respectively. With respect to the factors affecting social and economic resilience, the results of multiple linear regression model showed that social resilience increases with the length of stay in neighborhood, the number of educated family members, higher education level of the head of the household, the employed heads of household compared to unemployed ones, having physically-mentally disabled persons in the family, owning the house compared to renting it. Moreover, it seems that economic resilience might increase with having employed family members (other than the head of the household), medical and accident insurance, higher approximate value of dwelling, and lower monthly expenses. Based on the findings, the study proposes some social and economic resilience components which could be used to improve the flexibility and resilience level of the communities at neighborhood level.

AB Three ant species nest obligately in the swollen-thorn domatia of the African ant-plant Vachellia (Acacia) drepanolobium, a model system for the study of ant-defence mutualisms and species coexistence. Herewe report on the characteristic fungal communities generated by these ant species in their domatia. First, we describe behavioural differences between the ant species when presented with a cultured fungal isolate in the laboratory. Second, we use DNA metabarcoding to show that each ant species has a distinctive fungal community in its domatia, and that these communities remain characteristic of the ant species over two Kenyan sampling locations separated by 190 km. Third, we find that DNA extracted from female alates of Tetraponera penzigi and Crematogaster nigriceps contained matches for most of the fungal meta-barcodes from those ant species' domatia, respectively. Fungal hyphae and other debris are also visible in sections of these alates' infrabuccal pockets. Collectively, our results indicate that domatium fungal communities are associated with the ant species occupying the tree. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of such ant-specific fungal community-level differences on the same myrmecophytic host species. These differences may be shaped by ant behaviour in the domatia, and by ants vectoring fungi when they disperse to establish new colonies. The roles of the fungi with respect to the ants and their host plant remain to be determined.

AB Livestock production is an appropriate land use for mainstreaming biodiversity conservation, but little is known about the impact of grazing strategies on forbs that contribute most species, in grasslands. This study compared the effects of high-density, short-duration stocking (HDG) with no grazing (control) on vegetation structure, composition and demography of selected perennial forbs in a South African mesic grassland in a three-year experiment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. HDG resulted in four-fold more and deeper litter accumulation, which reduced irradiance. Cover of three forb species, including the alien Bidens pilosa, was promoted and cover of another three forb species was reduced under HDG. There were no short-term effects of HDG on diversity, evenness and species richness. Ninety percent of forb species were damaged by HDG; type of damage varied widely from leaves and stems grazed to tearing and shredding by the hooves of cattle. Study of demography revealed that HDG threatened future populations of the grazing-sensitive species Afroaster hispida, Agathisanthemum chlorophyllum and Gerbera ambigua through increased mortality or reduction in the recruitment of large from small individuals. This study has revealed that HDG potentially has negative direct and indirect effects on indigenous perennial forbs in a South African mesic grassland.

AB Intertidal boulder-fields form important habitat because they support a wide range of fauna, many species of which are rare or not found in other habitats. Over many decades, they have been studied to test general ecological theories, such as effects of disturbance, succession and species-area relationships, because of the case with which the habitats themselves and their biota can be manipulated experimentally. Much less is known about their unique characteristics and biota, Experimental studies are limited to few parts of the world, primarily south-eastern Australia, Intertidal boulder-fields support a diverse biota of often related rare and common species, which typically show extremely aggregated patterns of dispersion, but little consistent association among different species. This review summarizes experimental research in these habitats, which has led to current understanding of factors affecting spatial and temporal patterns of species living in boulder-fields, in addition to the contributions that have been made to broader ecological concepts. Finally, directions for future research arc suggested, particularly with respect to conservation and restoration of intertidal boulder-fields in a rapidly changing world.

AB The introduction of alien plants into a new range can result in the loss of co-evolved symbiotic organisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi, that are essential for normal plant physiological functions. Prior studies of mycorrhizal associations in alien plants have tended to focus on individual plant species on a case-by-case basis. This approach limits broad scale understanding of functional shifts and changes in interaction network structure that may occur following introduction. Here we use two extensive datasets of plant-fungal interactions derived from fungal sporocarp observations and recorded plant hosts in two island archipelago nations: New Zealand (NZ) and the United Kingdom (UK). We found that the NZ dataset shows a lower functional diversity of fungal hyphal foraging strategies in mycorrhiza of alien when compared with native trees. Across species this resulted in fungal foraging strategies associated with alien trees being much more variable in functional composition compared with native trees, which had a strikingly similar functional composition. The UK data showed no functional difference in fungal associates of alien and native plant genera. Notwithstanding this, both the NZ and UK data showed a substantial difference in interaction network structure of alien trees compared with native trees. In both cases, fungal associates of native trees showed strong modularity, while fungal associates of alien trees generally integrated into a single large module. The results suggest a lower functional diversity (in one dataset) and a simplification of network structure (in both) as a result of introduction, potentially driven by either limited symbiont co-introductions or disruption of habitat as a driver of specificity due to nursery conditions, planting, or plant edaphic-niche expansion. Recognizing these shifts in function and network structure has important implications for plant invasions and facilitation of secondary invasions via shared mutualist populations.

AB The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata ( Wiedemann), is one of the most economically damaging pests in the world and has repeatedly invaded two major agricultural states in the United States, Florida and California, each time requiring costly eradication. The Mediterranean fruit fly gains entry primarily in infested fruit carried by airline passengers and, since Florida and California each receive about 13 million international passengers annually, the risk of Mediterranean fruit fly entering the United States is potentially very high. The risk of passengers bringing the pest into Florida or California from Mediterranean fruit fly-infested countries was determined with two novel models, one estimated seasonal variation in airline passenger number and the other defined the seasonal and spatial variability in Mediterranean fruit fly abundance. These models elucidated relationships among the risk factors for Mediterranean fruit fly introduction, such as amount of passenger traffic, routes traveled, season of travel, abundance of Mediterranean fruit fly in countries where flights departed, and risk of the pest arriving at destination airports. The risk of Mediterranean fruit fly being introduced into Florida was greatest from Colombia, Brazil, Panama, Venezuela, Argentina, and Ecuador during January-August, whereas primarily the risk to California was from Brazil, Panama, Colombia, and Italy in May-August. About three times more Mediterranean fruit flies were intercepted in passenger baggage at airports in Florida than California, although the data were compromised by a lack of systematic sampling and other limitations. Nevertheless, this study achieved the goal of analyzing available data on seasonal passenger flow and Mediterranean fruit fly population levels to determine when surveillance should be intensified at key airports in Florida and California.

AB The role of anthropogenic activity is increasingly recognized as an agent of environmental change. Photographs, taken more than 130 years ago in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, show a very different landscape to that viewed today. In attempting to understand some of the dynamics behind the changes in the landscape, we explored the history of land-use in communal rangelands in KwaZulu-Natal from the arrival of Iron Age man through to modern practices. Communal farming is frequently cited as a major cause of environmental degradation. Traditional lifestyles have been eroded by social, political and economic changes since the arrival of European explorers and settlers in the early 1800s. This may have contributed to encroachment by woody plants into the open savannas and grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in recent times because of increased grazing pressure and, perhaps reduced fires. Furthermore, there is decreasing dependence on wood for everyday needs due to the increased availability of electricity. Interviews with a number of community members indicate that they have noted a change in climate and in vegetation structure. Their observations have been confirmed by climate data and historic photographs. Environmental planners need to view change in a holistic manner, taking cognisance not only of the physical changes but also of the history of land-use and human needs and to give credence to community perceptions.

AB The Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of South Africa is a biodiversity hotspot threatened by the impacts of habitat transformation and invasive alien species. Cape Flats Sand Fynbos (CFSF) is a critically endangered vegetation type occurring within the GCFR, and its largest remaining fragment is the focus of a large-scale invasive plant control and biodiversity restoration project. Acacia saligna is a highly problematic invasive in CFSF and the main target of the control. To mitigate damage caused by this species, stands are removed and burned, which stimulates both the large invasive seed-bank and the indigenous seed-bank in the soil. Although there are no clear methods on how to manage the re-invasion at this stage without damaging indigenous plant recovery, three post-burn removal methods have the potential to be effective: (1) cutting the Acacia saplings below the coppicing point, (2) cutting the saplings and applying herbicide to the stumps, and (3) foliar herbicide spray. The aims of this study were to (i) find the most effective post-burn A. saligna control treatment, (ii) find the treatment that causes the least harm to indigenous plant recovery, (iii) determine the most cost-effective treatment, and (iv) establish which treatment is the most suitable for large-scale use. Cutting below the coppicing point of the A. saligna provided the most effective removal and was also the least damaging to indigenous vegetation recovery. The foliar spray treatment, however, saved the most time and costs. The best method is therefore dependent on the project goals, scale, and density of the A. saligna invasion. These results may be applicable to other types of fynbos and to other fire-stimulated invasive Acacia species. (C) 2016 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The orchid genus Teagueia Luer (Orchidaceae, subtribe Pleurothallidinae) presents an extraordinary example of recent local evolutionary radiation. In principle, mutualisms might affect the origin of plant species via an effect on speciation. As orchids depend on mycorrhizal fungi for seed germination and early plantlet development we tested whether certain mycorrhizal fungi are acting as drivers of this radiation in Teagueia species. Sampling was carried out near Banos in east Andean Ecuador. Roots were collected from a total of 11 flowering individuals of eight morphospecies (referred to as Teagueia spp). The whole ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nrDNA region and part of the 28S nrDNA were amplified, cloned and sequenced. Molecular phylogeny of the obtained sequences revealed four phylogenetic species of Tulasnellaceae and one of Atractiellales (Pucciniomycotina, Basidiomycota) associated with Teagueia spp. Tulasnelloid fungi were detected in all samples. Up to three different phylogenetic species of mycobionts were found associated with one Teagueia species. We found that co-occurring Teagueia species share mycobionts. All detected mycobionts had wide geographical distribution. Based on the available evidence we conclude that the extraordinary local radiation of Teagueia is most likely driven by other factors than by mycorrhizal fungi, but that mycorrhiza may be a key factor for the coexistence of so many closely related orchid species.

AB Isolation of naturally occurring bacterial strains from metal-rich environments has gained popularity due to the growing need for bioremediation technologies. In this study, we found that the vanadium concentration in the intestine of the vanadium-rich ascidian Ascidia sydneiensis samea could reach 0.67 mM, and thus, we isolated vanadium-resistant bacteria from the intestinal contents and determined the ability of each bacterial strain to accumulate vanadium and other heavy metals. Nine strains of vanadium-resistant bacteria were successfully isolated, of which two strains, V-RA-4 and S-RA-6, accumulated vanadium at a higher rate than did the other strains. The maximum vanadium absorption by these bacteria was achieved at pH 3, and intracellular accumulation was the predominant mechanism. Each strain strongly accumulated copper and cobalt ions, but accumulation of nickel and molybdate ions was relatively low. These bacterial strains can be applied to protocols for bioremediation of vanadium and heavy metal toxicity.

AB Abundant, localized foods can concentrate predators and their foraging efforts, thus altering both the spatial distribution of predation risk and predator preferences for prey that are encountered incidentally. However, few investigations have quantified the spatial scale over which localized foods affect predator foraging behavior and consumption of incidental prey. In spring 2010, we experimentally tested how point-source foods altered how generalist predators (white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus) utilized space and depredated two incidental prey items: almonds (Prunus dulcis; highly profitable) and maple seeds (Acer saccharum; less profitable). We estimated mouse population densities with trapping webs, quantified mouse consumption rates of these incidental prey items, and measured local mouse activity with track plates. We predicted that 1) mouse activity would be elevated near full feeders, but depressed at intermediate distances from the feeder, 2) consumption of both incidental prey would be high near feeders providing less-preferred food and, 3) consumption of incidental prey would be contingent on predator preference for prey relative to feeders providing more-preferred food. Mouse densities increased significantly from pre- to post-experiment. Mean mouse activity was unexpectedly greatest in control treatments, particularly <15 m from the control (empty) feeder. Feeders with highly preferred food (sunflower seeds) created localized refuges for incidental prey at intermediate distances (15 to 25 m) from the feeder. Feeders with less-preferred food (corn) generated localized high risk for highly preferred almonds <10 m of the feeder. Our findings highlight the contingent but predictable effects of locally abundant food on risk experienced by incidental prey, which can be positive or negative depending on both spatial proximity and relative preference.

AB Accurate detection of individual animals and estimation of ungulate population density might be a function of vegetation cover, animal size, observation radius or season. We assessed the effect of these factors on estimates of detection probability and density using five ungulate species in Western Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Estimates were derived from information collected using ground surveys involving line transects targeting three resident species (impala, topi and buffalo) and two migrants (wildebeest and zebra) and analysed using DISTANCE, MANOVA, t-test and Pearson correlation. Results showed that ground surveys that take observation radii of 100m would appreciably estimate at least 80% of the available ungulates. Beyond 100m radii, surveys would leave approximately 43% of individuals undetected, the reason being a substantial influence of animal size, vegetation cover and observation radius on the detection. Animal size and observation radius have interactive effects. On their own seasonal differences, they do not have any effect but in interaction with animal size have significant effects especially on the migrant species. As reliable estimates of detection and density are required for making reasonable inferences, we urge that surveys using DISTANCE approach should consider incorporating both ground and aerial survey methods and ensure adequate sample replication.

AB Among a vast number of forage trees, Vachellia karroo (Acacia karroo) remains one of the most widely distributed indigenous plant legumes in Southern Africa. The plant possesses some striking attributes, such as rapid growth rate, drought tolerance, adaptation to alkaline and acidic sterile soils, and resistance to a variety of edaphic and temperature changes. In past years V. karroo was recognised to be a major threat to rangeland productivity owing to its invasive nature. Research interest has shifted from its eradication as an unwanted plant to its utilisation as a feed resource for livestock. Extensive utilisation of V. karroo is mainly hindered by the presence of tannins and spines. Prospects to lessen the adverse effects of the anti-nutritional influences are now recognised. Vachellia karroo possesses desirable fatty acid profiles, and high protein and mineral contents that can improve animal performance. Presently, the use of V. karroo for goat production in communal areas is restricted owing to limited evidence for its nutritional value as animal feed. The present review, therefore, seeks to demonstrate the utility potential of V. karroo to improve growth performance, carcass characteristics, chevon quality, meat fatty acid profiles and as a natural anti-helminth for goats raised under an extensive system of production.

AB Temperature is of crucial importance, affecting all aspects of insect life such as survival, development and daily activity patterns, and consequently behaviour. In the present study we evaluated the effect of temperature on the behavioural plasticity of antlion larvae, the sit-and-wait predators, which are considerably more dependent on local habitat conditions. We provided ethological descriptions of pit construction and feeding behaviour. An increase in temperature led to greater activity and consequently to greater frequency of sand tossing during pit construction. Larvae constructed bigger pits at higher temperatures, but required less time than at lower temperatures, when the resulting pits were the smallest. At low temperature, larvae required more time for feeding, and behaviour followed a core pattern with little variety, in comparison to behaviour at high temperatures. Two behavioural patterns occurred only at the highest temperature: 'relocation' and 'submergence', presumably in response to high temperatures.

AB A next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach was used to study the microbiota associated to Pecten maximus broodstock, applying pyrosequencing of PCR-amplified V1-V4 16S rRNA gene regions. We analysed the resident bacterial communities in female and male scallop gonads before and after spawning. DNA samples were amplified and quality-filtered reads were assigned to family and genus taxonomic levels using the Ribosomal Database Project classifier. A total of 18,520 sequences were detected, belonging to 13 phyla, including Proteobacteria (55%), Bacteroidetes (11,7%), Firmicutes (3%), Actinobacteria (2%) and Spirochaetes (1,2%), and 110 genera. The major fraction of the sequences detected corresponded to Proteobacteria, Beta-and Gammaprotebacteria being the most abundant classes. The microbiota of P. maximus gonad harbour a wide diversity, however differences on male and female samples were observed, where female gonad samples show a larger number of genera and families. The dominant bacterial genera appeared to be Delftia, Acinetobacter, Hydrotalea, Aquabacterium, Bacillus, Sediminibacterium, Sphingomonas, and Pseudomonas that were present among the four analysed samples. This next generation sequencing technique, applied for the first time in P. maximus (great scallop) gonads was useful for the study of the bacterial communities in this mollusc, unravelling the great bacterial diversity in its microbiota.

AB Zooplankton in temporary waters produces resting stages to survive recurrent dry periods. Branchiopod crustaceans (i.e., cladocerans, large branchiopods) overcome these periods in the form of resting eggs buried in the sediment. Examining the diversity in the resting egg banks allows for a more accurate estimation of biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems than looking only at the active communities. The isolation of resting eggs from the sediment may be achieved by the sugar flotation method, which usually results in higher density and diversity than untreated samples (i.e., incubated in the sediment). We tested the effect of sugar isolation and centrifugation on the hatching success of resting eggs already isolated from sediment in order to reveal any direct effects on hatching success. We used four different branchiopod species, Daphnia magna, Moina brachiata, Branchinecta orientalis, and Triops cancriformis. Although we hypothesised that osmotic stress caused by sugar and centrifuging influence the hatching success either positively (e.g., faster activation as a response to osmotic changes) or negatively (destroyed by centrifugation), we found no significant difference either in the timing or rate of hatching between centrifuged and non-centrifuged eggs. Once the eggs are exposed to light and/or oxygen availability by being removed from the sediment, the centrifugation process does not have any additional effect on their hatching. Regardless of treatment, we found a significant difference in the hatching timing in the two major groups, with large branchiopods hatching earlier than cladocerans. We found that the sugar flotation method itself does not influence the hatching fraction of branchiopod resting eggs (implying no adverse effect on their viability) and its success in enhancing hatching can be attributed to its efficiency in removing eggs from the sediment.

AB The growing phenomenon of green roofs throughout the world mostly results in the establishment of extensive green roofs with low species diversity. However, research from the last few decades has shown that several advantages can accrue from diverse ecological systems, such as increased faunal diversity, storm water retention, thermal stability, pollution mitigation, and visual appeal. The maintenance of diversity on extensive green roofs has not been closely examined and few studies incorporate methods to ensure long-term coexistence into green roof design. Theoretical work has placed much focus on the niche and neutral theories that attempt to explain diversity as a result of the existence of different habitats or of demographic and dispersal patterns, respectively. These theories have resulted in several theoretical and practical recommendations for the maintenance of diversity in ecological systems and could suggest additional practices that would support biodiverse green roofs. We hereby review and discuss relevant theory and supporting research to provide suggestions regarding future research in the field as well as practical green roof construction recommendations and species selection.

AB Boundary currents are spectacular oceanographic features whose role as the main drivers of dispersal is often taken for granted. However, numerous genetic studies of passively dispersing coastal species have challenged this idea, and have identified gene flow in the direction opposite to the currents, pointing to a role of nearshore circulation in facilitating dispersal. We explored the influence of the Agulhas Current in eastern South Africa on mitochondrial DNA gene flow in the rocky shore limpet Siphonaria serrata. Our study design was particularly suitable to address this issue because (1) levels of genetic structure are high, suggesting that migrants should be readily distinguishable from native individuals, and (2) the Agulhas Current flows very close to the coast in parts of the study area, and inshore dispersal in the opposite direction is unlikely. We identified a northern and a southern lineage, and although evidence for southward dispersal was particularly strong, gene flow analyses also inferred some northward dispersal. An investigation of this result revealed that the single haplotype responsible for this finding could not be clearly assigned to either lineage, and the northward dispersal scenario is thus questionable. We conclude that genetically inferred dispersal may not be biologically meaningful when lineage sorting among regional populations is incomplete and suggest that this was a problem in most previous studies investigating gene flow in southern African coastal organisms. Despite their considerable potential, genetic methods have so far contributed little towards clarifying the role of nearshore circulation in facilitating population connectivity.

AB The spatial distribution of a spring/summer community of combined decapod and stomatopod larvae along the southwestern Atlantic shelf, and its possible linkages with hydrographical processes and with parental habitats were investigated. Vertical plankton hauls were performed between 21 degrees S and 34 degrees S, at 107 stations, distributed along 2000 km of coastline and up to 400 km offshore, during late spring 2010 and early summer 2011. Salinity and temperature were obtained with a CTD/rosette system, which provided seawater for chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations. A coupling between chlorophyll concentration and abundance of early larvae of benthic species was observed, suggesting that the larval release could be synchronized with phytoplankton maxima. Our findings indicated that the composition and abundance of larvae are strongly influenced by distance from the coast, freshwater sources and water mass distribution. Assemblages of larvae were observed in the most relevant environmental scenarios: (1) coastal environments, dominated by intertidal, shallow water or coastal species; (2) offshore environments, with predominance of holopelagic and deepwater species; and (3) southern continental runoff, mainly represented by benthic neritic crabs and shrimps. In addition, the large-scale distribution of larvae revealed a relationship with the adult's distribution, shown mainly by the occurrence of larvae transported from the estuaries in the inner shelf and by larvae of the deepwater fauna found mainly along the outer shelf.

AB The St Lucia Estuary is the largest estuarine lake in Africa and due to anthropogenic activities it has since the 1950s been kept isolated from its main source of freshwater, the Mfolozi River. Stakeholders are increasingly calling for a full reconnection of the historical linkage in order to initiate system restoration. Studies conducted to test the effects of turbidity on the copepod Acartiella natalensis and the mysid Mesopodopsis africana have shown that turbidity reduces the fitness of these species. The turbidity tolerance of the dominant copepod Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni has not yet been documented. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of turbidity on the feeding, respiration and mortality rates of P. stuhlmanni. Although chlorophyll a and phaeopigment consumption was negatively affected by inorganic silt, the use of natural silt resulted in more variable trends. In contrast, a positive relationship was found between total organic carbon (TOC) consumption and turbidity. The high ingestion rates in the highest turbidity treatments of the TOC experiments are attributed to gut loading of organically-enriched silt High turbidity also resulted in increased respiration rates of P. stuhlmanni, highlighting the energetic demand of turbid environments. Compared with other previously studied St Lucia zooplankters, P. stuhlmanni appears to be relatively tolerant of high turbidity. However, as the overall effect on this species is also negative, it is concluded that the St Lucia Estuary needs to be protected from excessive silt inputs if its ecological integrity is to be sustained.

AB We analyzed the distributional patterns of 95 selected species of leptosporangiate ferns inhabiting the Mexican Mountain Component, using grid-cells of one geographical degree as unit areas, applying endemism indices and richness and beta diversity analyses. Distributional data were obtained from several herbaria and specialized literature. Five grid-cells appear to be important for fern species richness, as they contain 35 to 49 species. These grid-cells are located in the Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO), Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB) and the Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS). Mean richness by latitudinal belts of one degree showed that the belts with highest values are related to the TMVB and SMS. A total of 13 grid-cells were recognized as important from the perspective of endemism; most of them are located also in the SMO, TMVB and SMS. The richest gridcells coincided with one of the main centres of endemism for ferns obtained in this study, located in the convergence of the southern part of the SMO, the eastern portion of the TMVB and the northern part of the SMS, reflecting the high humidity existing on the mountain slopes facing the Gulf of Mexico. Some important grid-cells recognized from richness and endemism analyses coincide with Mexican Natural Protected Areas. The beta diversity analysis showed a low degree of similarity among grid-cells, implying a high species replacement, as the result of environmental heterogeneity occurring in the Mexican mountain systems. On the other hand, the spatial analysis suggested a pattern of phytogeographical regionalization comprising two main areas: the Mexican Transition Zone and the Mexican Central Plateau. Ferns play an important role in the Mexican biodiversity and contributing to the beta diversity of Mexico.

AB Large branchiopods adapt to stochastic temporary wetlands by means of rapid development and production of dormant eggs. Unhatched eggs build the egg bank that bridges the frequent unfavorable periods. Dormancy termination is complex not only in appropriate hatching times, but also in hatching fractions. We investigated the parameters of hatching phenology including the initial hatching time, hatching duration, hatching rate, and cumulative hatching rate of two sympatric large branchiopods, Branchinella kugenumaensis (Ishikawa, 1895) and Eulimnadia braueriana Ishikawa, 1895, in Siangtian Pond in northern Taiwan, to explore the hatching strategies. In the laboratory studies, substrate samples with quantified egg numbers were inundated and dehydrated periodically and repetitively until no further hatching occurred, and the according parameters were recorded and calculated. We found that for both species, the hatching time was focused early in the hydroperiod. Most larvae hatched in the early hydroperiods. Overall, E. braueriana had a higher hatching rate through hydroperiods, and a higher cumulative hatching rate (82.9%) than B. kugenuaensis (47.5%). Early and concentrated hatching in a given hydroperiod could be adaptive, leading individuals to mature before the end of hydroperiod and reducing the frequency of abortive hatching. Since the hydroperiods of Siangtian Pond were synchronous with torrential rains, to incline the hatchings toward early hydroperiods is more preferable than to spread over several hydroperiods under the predictable hydroregime. Generally, the hatching phenology of E. braueriana, i.e., the longer the hatching duration and higher hatching rate, the better the adaptation to the hydroregime of Siangtian Pond.

AB Understory fires are important for the maintenance of pine savanna ecosystems of the southeastern U.S., which contain high biodiversity and numerous federally endangered species. Prescribed burns are administered to maintain the open structure of pine savannas, conserve biodiversity, and to reduce wildfire hazard. However, relatively little research has examined which factors control the effects of prescribed burns on mature trees, and how responses might be altered by changing climate. The impact of prescribed burning on growth responses is likely to vary by tree species and by environmental conditions. To test the importance of these factors, tree cores were taken from mature Pinus palustris and Pinus serotina individuals at multiple locations across Fort Bragg, NC, a military preserve with detailed records on prescribed burn history dating back to 1991. Individual trees were sampled along the hydrologic gradient from xeric uplands to streamside wetlands. Annual growth was modeled as a function of species identity, hydrologic position, fire history, and climate conditions. We determined that prescribed burning produced a moderate decline in annual growth indicating that stress from prescribed burns outweighs benefits from increased water and nutrient availability. We found that the negative effects from prescribed burning were diminished or reversed during warmer years, and that the model predicts potential increases in growth during burn years under anticipated climate change scenarios. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in growth rate by species or hydrologic position. Together these findings suggest that while prescribed burns may have minor, short-term impacts on tree growth under most current conditions, these effects are small enough that they are unlikely to outweigh the many benefits of this management technique for other aspects of ecosystem structure.

AB Pollinator decline causes great concern because reduced pollinator availability may negatively affect plants' seed production and in turn influence seedling recruitment and densities of plant populations. We used a novel experimental approach that simulates pollinator decline to assess the effects of a 4-year reduction in pollinator availability on reproduction and recruitment in two common European herbs, Centaurea jacea and Leucanthemum vulgare. The experiment strongly reduced visitation rates (by 59%) and seed set (by 23%) in Leucanthemum, but this did not cause reduced seedling recruitment, suggesting that other factors, such as water availability or the existence of a seed bank, are important for recruitment in this population of Leucanthemum. The experiment also significantly reduced visitation rates to Centaurea (by 33%), but did not affect seed set or seedling recruitment. In this species, however, seed set increased with visitation rates and local recruitment increased with seed production, indicating that a consistent pollinator decline may negatively affect Centaurea population densities.Synthesis. Our experiment reduced pollinator availability without artificially affecting quality components of the pollination process. Therefore, this approach may represent a realistic simulation of a pollinator decline. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses an experimental reduction in pollinator visitation to assess its effects on population recruitment in plants. This study shows that a large pollinator decline may affect population densities, but only in populations where seedling recruitment is limited by seed production. Our results also highlight the importance of going beyond visitation rates and seed production to study the impact of pollinator decline on plant populations.

AB Temperature variability under different wind conditions and its association with the spatial pattern of settlement of three intertidal barnacles - the chthamaloids Jehlius cirratus and Notochthamalus scabrosus, and the balanoid Notobalanus flosculus - were studied across Cartagena Bay, locatedin the upwelling region of central Chile. During days of strong winds, the diurnal signal in surface temperature at the protected end of the bay (site CTGN) was attenuated and decoupled from the northern sites (ECIM and PCHC) which are directly exposed to wind forcing, suggesting that wind intensity drives shifts in the relative importance of physical transport processes across the bay. Overall, the mean settlement rates of both chthamaloids were higher at PCHC, whereas N.flosculus settled at higher rates in CTGN. Under strong wind conditions, settlement rates of both chthamaloids decreased at the northern sites, while the settlement of N. flosculus reached minima at all three sites. Moreover, the effect of wind stress on the spatial pattern of settlement across the bay differed between species. A significant and positive correlation between the spatial heterogeneity of settlement and maximum daily wind stress - used as a metric for the intensity of the afternoon sea breeze was found only for J. cirratus. It is concluded that daily changes in wind stress have a strong effect on the spatial pattern of diurnal temperature fluctuations, and on the spatial pattern of barnacle settlement around the bay. Such association emerges from the effect of wind on near-shore circulation and its differential modulation of thermal structure around an open embayment and, by extension, on the patterns of larval transport and onshore delivery to sites located at extremes of the bay, which probably is common in other bays with similar characteristics.

AB Protected areas (PAs) cover 12 % of terrestrial sub-Saharan Africa. However, given the inherent inadequacies of these PAs to cater for all species in conjunction with the effects of climate change and human pressures on PAs, the future of biodiversity depends heavily on the 88 % of land that is unprotected. The study of biodiversity patterns and the processes that maintain them in human-modified landscapes can provide a valuable evidence base to support science-based policy-making that seeks to make land outside of PAs as amenable as possible for biodiversity persistence. We discuss the literature on biodiversity in sub-Saharan Africa's human-modified landscapes as it relates to four broad ecosystem categorizations (i.e. rangelands, tropical forest, the Cape Floristic Region, and the urban and rural built environment) within which we expect similar patterns of biodiversity persistence in relation to specific human land uses and land management actions. Available research demonstrates the potential contribution of biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes within all four ecosystem types and goes some way towards providing general conclusions that could support policy-making. Nonetheless, conservation success in human-modified landscapes is hampered by constraints requiring further scientific investment, e.g. deficiencies in the available research, uncertainties regarding implementation strategies, and difficulties of coexisting with biodiversity. However, information currently available can and should support efforts at individual, community, provincial, national, and international levels to support biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes.

AB Large branchiopods in temporary wetlands produce eggs that hatch in an asynchronous sequence to overcome stochastic hydroperiods. Long-term dynamics between egg replenishment and depletion result in habitat-specific egg bank spatial structures. Unlike earlier studies focusing mainly on the active stages, this study explores the horizontal distributions and functional sizes of the egg banks of three large branchiopods, Branchinella kugenumaensis, Eulimnadia braueriana, and Lynceus biformis, in Siangtian Pond, Taiwan. Superficial sediment was systematically collected from 58 sites in a defined "core area," and eggs were identified and quantified in 0.5 g sediment aliquots, with ten replicates for each site. The egg density was calculated to estimate the egg bank size and was plotted to show the spatial distribution patterns. We found that of the three species, L. biformis was the most abundant in the egg bank, while the egg bank size of B. kugenumaensis was close to cohort fecundity, indicating limited egg accumulation. Horizontal distributions varied significantly between species, with B. kugenumaensis concentrated centrally at the three deepest sites, E. braueriana aggregated peripherally in less vegetated areas, and L. biformis found predominately in the south. The egg bank spatial structure could be partially explained by the varying inundation area and population maturation times. However, egg floatation and wind action may also be influential.

AB The interaction, both above and belowground, between tree saplings and the surrounding grass sward is dependent on solar radiation, temperature, rainfall, soil depth, tree species and sward composition. These factors, as well as level of sward defoliation, influence whether the system will remain as savanna or move towards a woodland or grassland state. The effects of above- and belowground competition between grasses and two Acacia species and the effects of soil depth on these interactions were examined by planting A.karroo and A.nilotica seedlings into a natural sward on three different soil depths. Three aboveground treatments: full shading, reduced shading by tying back the neighboring grasses and reduced shading by clipping, and two belowground treatments: full and no belowground competition, were used. Plant size increased with increasing soil depth, while belowground competitive intensity was unaffected. Removing belowground competition increased sapling biomass by half (P<0.05) on all soil depths. By contrast, reduced shading had little effect at all soil depths, whereas sward clipping increased sapling biomass (47%) on shallow soils only (P=0.027), indicating that encroachment on shallow soils may result from factors that decrease root vigor of the surrounding grasses rather than light competition. Irrespective of soil depth, root competition appeared to be the major factor influencing sapling growth rates, thus grazing management practices that reduce grass root productivity are expected to result in woody encroachment.

AB The quality of the landscape is declining in many grassland and savanna areas of Africa as a consequence of woody plant encroachment. We investigated the changes in vegetation at selected sites on the battlefields of the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879 in KwaZulu-Natal. We used fixed-point repeat photographs to compare the landscape at the time of the Anglo-Zulu War with the same landscape in 2011. Nine photo-pairs were analysed, covering three specific sites: Isandlwana, Fugitives' Drift and Rorke's Drift. A further eight photographs from these sites, taken during the intervening years, were matched and compared with the present landscape. All sites we analysed showed an increase in woody cover since 1879. We used the Whittaker plant diversity sampling method to determine current woody and grass species composition on the sites. We also investigated the effect of catena, aspect, rockiness and land use on the bush encroachment. Rainfall and temperature data were also analysed. The observed large increases in woody cover cannot be explained by land use or by local climatic conditions only. The changes are also consistent with global climate change effects, most likely due to increasing atmospheric CO2.

AB Penguin colonies represent some of the most concentrated sources of ammonia emissions to the atmosphere in the world. The ammonia emitted into the atmosphere can have a large influence on the nitrogen cycling of ecosystems near the colonies. However, despite the ecological importance of the emissions, no measurements of ammonia emissions from penguin colonies have been made. The objective of this work was to determine the ammonia emission rate of a penguin colony using inverse-dispersion modelling and gradient methods. We measured meteorological variables and mean atmospheric concentrations of ammonia at seven locations near a colony of Adelie penguins in Antarctica to provide input data for inverse-dispersion modelling. Three different atmospheric dispersion models (ADMS, LADD and a Lagrangian stochastic model) were used to provide a robust emission estimate. The Lagrangian stochastic model was applied both in 'forwards' and 'backwards' mode to compare the difference between the two approaches. In addition, the aerodynamic gradient method was applied using vertical profiles of mean ammonia concentrations measured near the centre of the colony. The emission estimates derived from the simulations of the three dispersion models and the aerodynamic gradient method agreed quite well, giving a mean emission of 1.1 g ammonia per breeding pair per day (95% confidence interval: 0.4-2.5 g ammonia per breeding pair per day). This emission rate represents a volatilisation of 1.9% of the estimated nitrogen excretion of the penguins, which agrees well with that estimated from a temperature-dependent bioenergetics model. We found that, in this study, the Lagrangian stochastic model seemed to give more reliable emission estimates in 'forwards' mode than in 'backwards' mode due to the assumptions made.

AB The factors that regulate the self-recruitment of fish larvae were explored in Cabrera National Park (CNP), an insular Marine Protected Area (MPA) located off southern Mallorca (Western Mediterranean). Our study attributes the regulation of larval arrival to the MPA to a combination of retention by topographically generated circulation patterns around the island and shelf break frontal dynamics. Specifically, within the shelf, interaction of the wind-induced oscillatory flow with the island was shown to generate ephemeral recirculation patterns that, over time, favor larval retention in the proximity of the MPA. According to our measurements, oscillatory flows produced by wind-forced island-trapped waves (ITWs) dominate the flow around CNP. ITW-forced dispersion simulations were in agreement with the observed distributions of several typical fish species that breed in the CNP. A second regulator of environmental variability is the influence of boundary currents and open ocean mesoscale structures at the shelf break. These structures generate frontal zones that are comparatively more long-lived than inner-shelf circulation patterns, and they were shown to act as barriers to the offshore dispersion of coastal fish larval assemblages. Finally, inferences from larval size distributions around the MPA together with particle-tracking model simulations suggested the relevance of behavioral processes for larval recruitment to the MPA. Based on these observations, the waters around the CNP can be viewed as a relatively stable system that allows breeding fish populations to rely on self-recruitment for their long-term persistence, independent of other source populations along the coast of Mallorca.

AB The decline of the threatened western prairie fringed orchid (Platanthera praeclara Sheviak and Bowles) is associated with destruction of the tallgrass prairie in North America. The role of pollinators in conservation and recovery is not well understood. We studied interactions with hawk moth pollinators in one of the three remaining metapopulations of P. praeclara. In an experiment, plants exposed to moths showed three signs of visitation that were associated with production of seed capsules. Plants not exposed to moths failed to produce capsules. The signs of visitation were used to estimate visitation rates at field sites over a four-year period. A majority of plants were visited (89%) and most flowers receiving pollen produced a seed capsule (60%). We discovered two new native hawk moth pollinator species, Lintneria eremitus (Hubner) and Hyles lineata (Fabricius), giving a total of five pollinators for this P. praeclara meta-population. Only one of the five species was found in each of the nine years of trapping. This was the sole non-native pollinator, Hyles euphorbiae L., a Eurasian species introduced to North America to control an invasive weed, leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.). Given that plants with a greater diversity of pollinators have reduced risk of extinction, conservation and recovery plans should expand the definition of suitable P. praeclara habitat to include resources required by native pollinators, including the host plants that feed hawk moth larvae and the nectar plants that feed hawk moth adults before and after the nectar provided by P. praeclara.

AB Questions What are the effects of conifer invasion on plant species composition and richness of coastal heathlands; do effects differ between heathlands invaded by introduced or native coniferous tree species? Location Threatened coastal Calluna heathlands, western Norway. Methods We compared the effects of invasion by introduced Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) and native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) on heathland plant communities by focusing on the local impacts of single coniferous tree canopies. For each of 58 target coniferous trees (2-4-m tall), 2-m transects were laid out in a north and south orientation from the tree stem to beyond the tree canopy, and control transects were laid out in open heathland adjacent to the target trees. Vascular plants and bryophytes were recorded within 0.0625m2 contiguous quadrats along the transects. Principal response curves (PRC) and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to investigate tree canopy effects on species composition and richness. Results Invasion by coniferous trees induced considerable changes in the coastal heathland vegetation: distinct microcommunitites developed beneath the canopies of relatively young, single coniferous trees in the heathlands. There was a marked difference in subcanopy species composition under the introduced Sitka spruce relative to the native Scots pine; forest floor species had colonized to a greater extent under Sitka spruce, replacing the light-demanding species characteristic of the coastal heathland vegetation. Conclusion Our study showed that conifer invasion induces considerable and rapid changes in heathland vegetation, and that the effects were stronger under the introduced conifer. This suggests that Sitka spruce invasion may pose a more immediate threat to the characteristic coastal heathland vegetation and flora than succession based on native conifers. The open coastal heathlands along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe are a threatened landscape of high conservation value, and our results suggest that the spread of Sitka spruce into these landscapes should be controlled, especially in heathlands that are targeted for conservation.

AB To clarify the relationship between the detritivore fiddler crab, Uca thayeri, and sediment bacteria, we quantified morphotype richness, abundance and evenness of these microorganisms inside the crabs' guts and in mangrove-associated sediments in Sisal, Mexico (21 degrees 9' N, 90 degrees 1' W) from July to September 2008. Increased bacterial richness and abundance were observed in mesocosm experiments when nutrients were added to the sediment or in the absence of fiddler crabs. Thus, crab disturbance seems to play a role in shaping the bacterial assemblage by reducing richness and abundance just as nutrient limitation does. Crabs can also play a second role by harboring a subset of bacterial morphotypes inside their gut. We exposed sterile sediment to fiddler crabs and found that viable cells were expelled from the crab's gut and proliferated in previously sterile substratum. The bacterial community is thus structured by the foraging behavior of fiddler crabs since it benefits some bacteria and restricts others. By agar plating we have obtained conservative results, yet the data suggest that the crab influences the bacterial assemblage in two ways by allowing inoculation of the sand from the gut and reducing bacteria diversity through disturbance when foraging on sediments.

AB Below-ground grass competition limits woody establishment in savannas. N-2-fixing legumes may, however, have a nutritional advantage over broad-leaved species. We hypothesised that broad-leaved non-legume savanna thicket species would be more severely constrained by grass competition for N and consequently respond more to N-fertilization than the legume, Acacia karroo.
   A. karroo and five non-legume thicket species (Maytenus senegalensis, M. heterophylla, Euclea divinorum, Ziziphus mucronata, Schotia brachypetala) were grown together in an irrigated competition experiment with clipped-, unclipped-grass and without grass with/without N-fertilizer. The biomass, foliar nutrient, delta C-13 and delta N-15 of grasses and woody species were determined.
   Growth of both A. karroo and the non-legume species was equally sensitive (c. 90 % reduction) to both clipped- and unclipped-grass competition, regardless of N-fertilization. With grass competition, however, foliar [N] increased and delta N-15 decreased in response to N-fertilization. Grass biomass accumulation was also unchanged by fertilisation, despite increases in foliar [N] and decreases in delta N-15.
   The N-2-fixation capacity of A. karroo provided no growth advantage over non-legumes. The lack of responsiveness of biomass accumulation by both the woody species and the grasses to N-fertilization, despite evidence that plants accessed the N-fertilizer, indicates limitation by other nutrients.

AB Fish predation is often cited as a key process in structuring sea urchin populations on coral reefs, with population outbreaks often being related to the removal of key predators through overfishing. However, moderate-high densities of the sea urchin Echinometra mathaei have been reported on a reef with relatively intact predator assemblages; Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. This study examined the relationship between the densities of E. mathaei and its potential predators, to gain some insight into the potential role of predation in structuring E. mathaei populations on Ningaloo Reef. To identify potential urchin predators we recorded predation events on tethered E. mathaei using stationary video cameras. Seven fish species preyed on the tethered urchins with two labrid species, Cords aygula and Choerodon rubescens, accounting for 65% of all observed predation events. There was, however, no evidence for the role of predation in determining E. mathaei populations either within or among habitats. Despite the densities of E. mathaei varying from 0.1 to 219.7 ind 100 m(-2) among habitats, the density and biomass of potential urchin predators displayed limited variation among habitats. Furthermore, the density of E. mathaei was positively related to that of their predators on the reef slope and the back reef. While the overall density of potential predators (53.3 ind ha(-1)) was comparable to other protected reefs, the suite of predators differed from that of other regions. In particular, large triggerfish species (f. Balistidae), the dominant predators of E. mathaei on other Indo-Pacific reefs, were rare or absent. While the lack of these species may have contributed to the moderate-high densities of E. mathaei on Ningaloo Reef, other factors such as larval supply, food availability and habitat characteristics may be important. Irrespective of the mechanisms, moderate-high densities of E. mathaei should not be universally viewed as an indicator of reef degradation. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We evaluated puma (Puma concolor) and culpeo fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus smithersi) occurrence in relation to a national park where livestock was reduced and hunting banned, and in relation to human presence and landscape features. In the high mountains of central Argentina puma signs were about 3.5 times less frequent than culpeo signs. Puma and culpeo signs were 33 and 19 times, respectively, more abundant within than outside the park. Puma signs increased with distance to settlements within the park but no trend was detected outside the park where signs were scarce. Culpeos were abundant all throughout the park with no relation with distance to settlements while outside the park signs increased with distance from settlements. Rock outcrops had a positive effect on pumas, which used this habitat frequently, and negative effect on culpeos, whose presence decreased slightly at sites with the highest proportion of rock outcrops inside the park and sharply at sites with presence of rock outcrops outside the park. We conclude that top carnivores were positively affected by the park creation and encourage the creation of more protected areas with connectivity in the region to better assure the long-term conservation of top predators.

AB Assessment of grazing-induced degradation of arid and semiarid rangelands with stochastic rainfall regimes is challenging. To assess grazing impacts on vegetation under highly variable environments, we focused on resource variations in relation to the scale of local rangeland use. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that grazing impacts on resources were greater in areas heavily used during drought (i.e. key resource areas) than elsewhere. Near Mandalgobi, Mongolia, we established study sites in four typical vegetation communities (Caragana, Allium, Achnatherum and Reaumuria) according to landscape type. First, we interviewed key informants about the four community types to examine how local pastoralists used these communities during normal and drought summers. Second, we compared dung pellets numbers among communities to quantify the different grazing impacts on each community. Finally, to determine grazing impacts on vegetation in each community, we performed vegetation surveys in grazing and non-grazing plots at each site. According to respondents, during normal summers all types of community were used, but during drought, the main community used was Achnatherum community. The number of dung pellets was highest in the Achnatherum community. Species composition was significantly more affected by grazing in the Achnatherum and Reaumuria community than in the other communities. These results suggested that the Achnathrum community would have a role of key resource in study sites and grazing impacts affected key resource areas. If rangeland management is focused only on maintaining resource accessibility, then grazing-induced degradation of key resource areas could occur even on highly variable rangelands.

AB Although historic land use is often implicated in non-native plant invasion of forests, little is known about how land-use legacies might actually facilitate invasion. We conducted a 2-year field seeding experiment in western North Carolina, USA, to compare germination and first-year seedling survival of Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. in stands that had been cultivated and abandoned a century earlier and were dominated by tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), and in paired stands that had never been cultivated and were dominated by oaks (Quercus spp.). Experiments were conducted at five sites with paired tulip poplar and oak stands by varying litter mass (none, low, or high) and litter type (tulip poplar or oak). We also performed reciprocal soil translocations using pots seeded with C. orbiculatus. Soil moisture and temperature were measured throughout the growing season. Germination and survival were highest in the tulip poplar stands. Germination was also higher in plots with low litter mass. Seedling survival was highest in plots with low litter mass or no litter. Soil moisture was higher in tulip poplar stands and under low-mass litter. Differences in germination and survival among the potted plants were minimal, suggesting that soil type and ambient site conditions were less important than litter conditions for C. orbiculatus establishment. Our results suggest that the low litter mass and mesic soil conditions that are characteristic of tulip poplar stands may confer higher invasibility and explain the higher abundance of C. orbiculatus in areas with successional overstory communities associated with historically cultivated forests.

AB Community-wide seasonal fruiting and seed dispersal by the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus fulvus) was investigated in a tropical dry forest, north-western Madagascar. The brown lemur is the sole disperser of large seeds > 10 mm in diameter. Considering the limited assemblage of dispersers, large-seeded plants should display distinctive fruiting patterns to acquire dispersers. To compare fruiting patterns and seed dispersal by the brown lemur between small-seeded and large-seeded plants, fruiting conditions for 432 trees on a transect, feeding activity over 1212 h of observation, and the composition of 1126 dung samples were recorded for 1 y. Seeds of a total of 52 species were identified through both observations and faecal analysis. As rainfall increased, larger numbers of species and individuals of small-seeded plants fruited. Among the 52 species, the brown lemur dispersed 29 and 13 species with small and large seeds, respectively, during the rainy season. High moisture levels probably favoured seed germination and seedling establishment in various species. During the dry season, although small-seeded species rarely fruited, a few large-seeded species, particularly Vitex beraviensis, formed a long-term fruiting peak and provided essential food resources for the brown lemur. Because seeds of these large-seeded plants were frequently dispersed by the brown lemur, dry-season fruiting seemed to be favourable to avoid competition for dispersers with other plant species.

AB Native vegetation is frequently replaced by alien plants on isolated oceanic islands. The effects of such replacements by invasive plants on the diversity and temporal dynamics of island-endemic insects remain unclear. We examined flying insect communities using Malaise traps on the small island of Nishi-jima in the oceanic Ogasawara Archipelago in the northwestern Pacific. On the island, an alien tree, Casuarina equisetifolia, has become dominant, occupying 57.3 % of the vegetation area. The species richness, composition, and abundance of pollinators (bees), predators (wasps), and wood-boring beetles (cerambycids, mordellids, and elaterids) were compared in each summer season of 4 years among three vegetation types: C. equisetifolia forest, natural forest, and grassland. In the traps, 82.3 % of species captured were endemic to the archipelago. The grassland harbored the highest species richness of native bees and wasps, whereas the natural forest had the highest species richness of native wood-boring beetles. The C. equisetifolia forest had the poorest species richness for most insect groups. Principal response curves indicated that differences in species composition among the three vegetation types were consistent through time for all insect groups. Most insect species were more abundant in natural forest or grassland than in C. equisetifolia forest. Standard deviations in both the numbers of individuals and species estimated under a Bayesian framework suggested that annual fluctuations of abundance and species density were similar among vegetation types (except for elaterid abundance). Therefore, replacement by C. equisetifolia has likely altered insect species composition but has not necessarily dramatically affected the temporal dynamics of insect assemblages on the island.

AB This study investigated dip-tank use effects on herbaceous vegetation and soil, and relationships between environmental and species variables. Eight dip-tanks, three each in sandy (DPBS) and loamy (DYRL) soils, and two in stony (ROSG) soils were used. Data were collected at 50, 100, 150, 300, 500, 700 and 900 m from each dip-tank. In DPBS, phosphorus and potassium contents were highest (P < 0.05) on approaching dip-tanks. In all soils, forb and perennial grass abundances showed significant differences but there were no significant trends with distance. These variables are not sufficiently sensitive to form gradients or the gradient is diminished with heavy grazing. In DPBS, the canonical correspondence analysis showed negative correlation of distance with bareness, the abundance of Aristida rhiniochloa and Cynodon dactylon, which may suggest these variables may respond to grazing gradients around dip-tanks, but this pattern was not established on the other soil types. Therefore, caution is required in drawing conclusions of the piosphere effect around focal points. The abundance of highly palatable species was low except for Panicum maximum in DPBS. It is concluded that vegetation and soil changes are driven by abiotic (site and soil) and biotic (livestock) factors that have different influences at different scales. Therefore, any rangeland utilisation and management program should consider these drivers.

AB Conifers are the most studied group of plants in invasion biology. Outside their natural range, they are capable of causing major community and ecosystem impacts. Firms contorta, is currently considered one of the world's most invasive tree species, especially in temperate ecosystems. This study aims to determine if the invaded vegetation differ along a P. contorta invasion gradient in the Malalcahuello National Reserve, located in the Andes of the Araucania Region, south-central Chile. 18 rectangular plots of 100 m(2) were established in the invaded area in transects from the seed source to the native forest. Within each plot all pines were tallied when larger than 50 cm in height and their crown projection was recorded, as well as the presence and coverage of all plant species present and their life forms. The results indicate to the establishment of a gradient of invasion and increased richness, abundance and diversity of plant species from the areas closest to the source of seeds (higher invasion) to the native forest. In relation to life forms, only chamaephytes and hemicryptophytes show a significant association to the pine invasion, with lower richness and abundance in areas with higher pine cover. The establishment of pines seems to follow a dispersal Kernel, because the highest density occurred near the original stands and a steady decrease occurs with distance from the seed source. The invasion process in the area is still in development, so it is possible to infer that to progress this situation is expected to reduce species diversity even when the canopy of pines begins to close. This study indicates that P. contorta is capable of reducing plant diversity in mountain areas, especially when invades in high densities. These findings should be considered when controlling this species. A restoration plan will be required in the areas of the gradient where P. contorta has displaced native species.

TI Influence of Changing Plant Food Sources on the Gut Microbiota of

AB Changes in agricultural land-use of saltmarshes along the German North Sea coast have favoured the succession of the marsh grass Elytrigia atherica over the long-established Spartina anglica. Consequently, E. atherica represents a potential food source of increasing importance for plant-feeding soil detritivores. Considering the importance of this ecological guild for decomposition processes and nutrient cycling, we focussed on two sympatric saltmarsh soil macrodetritivores and their associated gut microbiota to investigate how the digestive processes of these species may be affected by changing plant food sources. Using genetic fingerprints of partial 16S rRNA gene sequences, we analysed composition and diversity of the bacterial gut community in a diplopod and an amphipod crustacean in relation to different feeding regimes representing the natural vegetation changes. Effects of syntopy on the host-specific gut microbiota were also taken into account by feeding the two detritivore species either independently or on the same plant sample. Bacterial community composition was influenced by both the host species and the available plant food sources, but the latter had a stronger effect on microbial community structure. Furthermore, bacterial diversity was highest after feeding on a mixture of both plant species, regardless of the host species. The gut microbiota of these two detritivores can thus be expected to change along with the on-going succession at the plant community level in this environment. Cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments further indicated a host-related effect since the two detritivores differed in terms of predominant bacterial taxa: diplopods harboured mainly representatives of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Gammaproteobacteria. In contrast, the genus Vibrio was found for the amphipod host across all feeding conditions.

AB Vendetta sulfuris Barnard and Ingram, 1990 is the most abundant amphipod species inhabiting the Eastern Pacific Rise (EPR 9 degrees N) vent fields. This vent-endemic species is frequently encountered near colonies of Pompeii worms Alvinella pompejana. V. sulfuris specimens were collected during the oceanographic cruise LADDER II at the Bio9 (9 degrees 50.3' N, 2508 m depth) hydrothermal vent site. Main objectives were to highlight the occurrence of bacterial symbiosis in V. sulfuris and to hypothesise their implications in nutrition. Observations in light and electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) showed that the outer body surface and appendages are free of microorganisms. In contrast, the digestive system revealed two major microbial communities settled in the midgut and in the hindgut. Gut contents showed bacterial traces together with abundant fragments of Alvinellid cuticle and setae, from A. pompejana, suggesting that V. sulfuris could directly feed on Alvinellids and/or on their bacterial epibionts. Molecular analyses based on the 16S rRNA genes revealed the diversity of bacterial communities in the digestive system, of which, the Epsilonproteobacteria phylum, could be considered as one of the major bacterial group. Hypotheses were proposed on their symbiotic features and their implications in V. sulfuris nutrition. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Small mammals usually constitute the main prey for Leopardus geoffroyi throughout its distribution. We studied the patterns of small rodent selection by this felid in a semi-arid scrubland of central Argentina, addressing whether prey choice may be related to the availability, morphology, and distribution of the different rodent species. Cat's diet was studied during 2005-2006 through the analysis of 182 scats, along with field estimates of rodent abundances from trapping. The cricetine rodents Akodon molinae and Calomys musculinus were predated according to the availability expected by trapping, indicating that their use was opportunistic. Akodon azarae and Graomys griseoflavus, on one hand, and Eligmodontia typus, on the other hand, were consumed in lower and higher proportion than their availabilities, respectively. Our results suggest that some cricetine rodent characteristics such as abundance, escape ability, microhabitat use, and activity period, appear to be potential factors contributing to differential vulnerability to predation by Geoffroy's cat in central Argentina.

AB Geodiversity, the natural range of geological, geomorphological and soil features, is thought to play a key role in the development of Australian ecosystems and evolution of their biota, due to the widespread occurrence of old soils with impoverished nutritional status and the comparatively restricted occurrence of fertile soils. While associations between soils and vegetation characteristics such as scleromorphy were first noted a century ago, modern theories propose evolutionary and ecological processes that shaped Australian flora and vegetation through interactions between soil nutrition, plant functional traits and flammability. Evidence in support of these generalisations comes mainly from site-specific empirical studies, surveys of plant traits and their associations, classification and mapping of land systems, analyses of regional environmental gradients and phylogenetic studies. The extent to which soils and the substrates from which they are derived place constraints on lie climatic response of biota has important implications for understanding future responses of the biota to anthropogenic climate change. Yet, worldwide, there are few studies that examine the relative contributions of geological substrates and climate to variation in vegetation properties over extensive sub-continental regions. This study used a spatially explicit approach to examine the relationship between vegetation and geological substrates over New South Wales, a region of 80 million hectares in south-eastern Australia spanning,a diverse range of geology, vegetation and climate. It aimed to assess the fidelity of major vegetation types to geological substrates and estimate the overall influence of geodiversity on vegetation composition relative to that attributable to climate. The spatial data were drawn from maps produced by geological and vegetation surveys. Geological maps were re-classified into 16 broad units reflecting textural and mineral characteristics considered likely to be influential on plant growth. They represent a component of total geodiversity related to broad landscape-scale patterns in major bedrock and regolith types. Vegetation maps were re-classified in 16 broad formations reflecting structural, physiognomic and functional characteristics of vegetation, and into a larger number of 99 classes reflecting species composition. The two spatial data sets were analysed to determine the diversity of vegetation types within geological units and fidelity of each vegetation type to each geological unit. The relative influence of climatic co-variables was also examined using spatial surfaces spline-fitted to 30 years of weather station data. The results indicate a strong non-random relationship between vegetation and geodiversity, with most vegetation types restricted to a narrow range of geological substrates. Partial variance analyses indicated that the influence of geodiversity on vegetation composition was stronger than, and largely independent of the influence of climate. Consistent with current theories, sclerophyllous vegetation formations and classes showed a strong association with geological units characterised by low levels of mineral nutrients. It was concluded that landscape patterns of geodiversity are likely to place significant constraints on the response of native vegetation to future climate change.

AB Hard rock quarries are commonly located close to national parks and special areas of conservation and are generally regarded as visually intrusive. Consequently, restoration strategies that effectively accelerate natural plant regeneration processes are required. Slate waste tips present extreme conditions for plant establishment with multiple potential limiting factors (e.g., lack of organic matter, nutrients, and poor water retention). In this study, we investigated ecological strategies to accelerate natural regeneration at the largest slate quarry in Europe. A field experiment was conducted to assess ecosystem restoration using a contrasting set of native woody species. Treatments included amendments of waste tips with: polyacrylamide gel to increase water-holding capacity; mineral fertilizer to increase nutrient supply; and two treatments that increased both (organic waste or boulder clay addition). Ecosystem recovery was evaluated through above- and below-ground productivity (plant and microbial, respectively) and soil analyses. Neither increasing nutrient supply (with mineral fertilizer) nor water-holding capacity (with polyacrylamide gel) was sufficient, alone, to improve plant establishment. However, both boulder clay and organic waste amendment significantly enhanced plant growth. There was a marked positive interaction in the effects on tree growth of the amendment with organic waste and boulder clay. Large interactions occurred between tree species and substrate amendments. The growth of N-2-fixing species was strongly favored over non-fixers where there was no addition of material increasing soil nitrogen supply, whereas the growth advantage of pioneer species over non-pioneers was greatest with fertilizer, organic waste, or clay additions. Organic waste addition had the greatest positive impact on soil processes.

AB P>Movement of organisms will influence their ecology and demographics. Animal movements are often characterized by path structures with directional persistence. The extent to which this impacts on population dynamics is investigated in this paper using theoretical simulations. The effects of different movement strategies on variations in visits to individual patches across a forage area are discussed. Variations in resource biomass across patches are shown to persist after long simulations. Consumer resource equations with movement are used to show how heterogeneity in resources caused by these variations can affect global population dynamics. With directional movements (random or persistent), dynamics change from limit cycles to stable equilibrium solutions. It is suggested that this effect has the potential to increase survival because perturbations from unforeseen factors (like drought) are less likely to crash populations.

AB This study examined the effects of different life stages (first, second, third, fourth, and five instars; adult females and adult males) and feeding regimes (starved and blood fed) on the active movement activity of the tropical bed bug, Cimex hemipterus (F.), under mixed-stage conditions. We used an extended arena made from Tygon tube coils and observed the movement frequency and movement distance at selected time intervals up to 120 h. The fifth instars and adult males and females showed significantly (P < 0.01) greater movement frequency compared with the other stages. The first and second instars showed limited movement (<8 m) over the experimental period. Starved bed bugs showed greater movement frequency compared with blood-fed bed bugs, with the exception of adult females. Blood-fed adult females exhibited significantly (P<0.01) greater movement frequency and distance compared with starved females. Blood-fed females moved up to 42.3 m over 120 h. Regression analysis between movement distance of the fifth instars and adults and the time intervals revealed a positive relationship (r(2) = 0.6583; P < 0.01), suggesting that delays in bed bug control efforts will increase the risk of the greater infestation. During bed bug inspection, the presence of only late instars and adults in premises would indicate a new infestation, whereas an established infestation likely would consist of mixed stages.

AB Pathogen dynamics are inseparable from the broader environmental context in which pathogens occur. Although some pathogens of people are primarily limited to the human population, occurrences of zoonoses and vector-borne diseases are intimately linked to ecosystems. The emergence of these diseases is currently being driven by a variety of influences that include, among other things, changes in the human population, long-distance travel, high-intensity animal-production systems, and anthropogenic modification of ecosystems. Anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems have both direct and indirect (foodweb mediated) effects. Therefore, understanding disease risk for zoonoses is a social-ecological problem. The articles in this special feature focus on risk assessment for avian influenza. They include analyses of the history and epidemiological context of avian influenza; planning and policy issues relating to risk; the roles of biogeography and spatial and temporal variation in driving the movements of potential avian influenza carriers; approaches to quantifying risk; and an assessment of risk-related interactions among people and birds in Vietnamese markets. They differ from the majority of published studies of avian influenza in that they emphasize unknowns and uncertainties in risk mapping and societal responses to avian influenza, rather than concentrating on known or proven facts. From a systems perspective, the different aspects of social-ecological systems that are relevant to the problem of risk mapping can be summarized under the general categories of structural, spatial, and temporal components. I present some examples of relevant system properties, as suggested by this framework, and argue that, ultimately, risk mapping for infectious disease will need to develop a more holistic perspective that includes explicit consideration of the roles of policy, disease management, and feedbacks between ecosystems and societies.

AB In this study, we present a stochastic landscape modeling approach that has the power to transfer and integrate existing information on vegetation dynamics and hydrological processes from the small scale to the landscape scale. To include microscale processes like ecohydrological feedback mechanisms and spatial exchange like surface water flow, we derive transition probabilities from a fine-scale simulation model. We applied two versions of the landscape model, one that includes and one that disregards spatial exchange of water to the situation of a sustainably used research farm and communally used and degraded rangeland in semiarid Namibia. Our simulation experiments show that including spatial exchange of overland flow among vegetation patches into our model is a precondition to reproduce vegetation dynamics, composition, and productivity, as well as hydrological processes at the landscape scale. In the model version that includes spatial exchange of water, biomass production at light grazing intensities increases 2.24-fold compared to the model without overland flow. In contrast, overgrazing destabilizes positive feedbacks through vegetation and hydrology and decreases the number of hydrological sinks in the model with overland flow. The buffer capacity of these hydrological sinks disappears and runoff increases. Here, both models predicted runoff losses from the system and artificial droughts occurring even in years with good precipitation. Overall, our study reveals that a thorough understanding of overland flow is an important precondition for improving the management of semiarid and arid rangelands with distinct topography.

AB Plants growing on seabird-nesting islands are uniquely adapted to deal with guano-derived soils high in N and P. Such ornithocoprophilous plants found in isolated, oceanic settings provide useful models for ecological and evolutionary investigations. The current study explored the plants found on Mount Desert Rock (MDR), a small seabird-nesting, oceanic island 44 km south of Mount Desert Island (MDI), Hancock County, Maine, U.S.A. Twenty-seven species of vascular plants from ten families were recorded. Analyses of guano-derived soils from the rhizosphere of the three most abundant species from bird-nesting sites of MDR showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) NO3-, available P, extractable Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, and significantly lower Mn compared to soils from the rhizosphere of conspecifics on non-bird nesting coastal bluffs from nearby MDI. Bio-available Pb was several-fold higher in guano soils than for background levels for Maine. Leaf tissue elemental analyses from conspecifics on and off guano soils showed significant differences with respect to N, Ca, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Pb, although trends were not always consistent. Two-way ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between species and substrate for Ca, Mg, Zn, and Pb tissue accumulation, showing that for these four elements there is substantial differentiation among species found on and off of guano soil. A compilation of species lists from other important seabird-nesting islands in the region suggested an ornithocoprophilous flora for northeastern North America consisting of 168 species from 39 families, with Asteraceae (29 taxa; 17.3%), Poaceae (25 taxa; 14.9%), Polygonaceae (10 taxa; 5.95%), Caryophyllaceae (9 taxa; 5.4%), and Rosaceae (9 taxa; 5.4%) as the most species-rich families. The taxa were predominantly hermaphroditic (69%) and perennial (66%) species, native (60%) to eastern North America.

AB P>Populations containing both females and hermaphrodites (dimorphic) are generally found in drier sites than those with only hermaphrodites (monomorphic). The sex-differential plasticity hypothesis (SDP) suggests that this is caused by hermaphrodites reducing allocation to seeds in harsh environments, allowing female establishment. We proposed that a similar process could explain sex distribution within populations.
   We compared light availability and soil moisture between sites of three monomorphic and three dimorphic populations of Geranium maculatum and between microsites occupied by females and hermaphrodites within populations. We also correlated seed production in dimorphic populations with environmental measures.
   We found that dimorphic and monomorphic populations occurred in sites with similar soil moisture but within two dimorphic populations females occurred in drier microsites than hermaphrodites, as predicted by the SDP hypothesis. Contrary to the predictions, hermaphrodites' seed production was not influenced by the environment. Rather, females' seed production was correlated with environmental conditions in two populations, although the direction of the correlation differed between populations.
   Our results suggest that in this species, the SDP hypothesis does not explain sex distribution among or within populations. However, microsite environments may influence the distribution of sexes within a population and potentially aid in maintaining gynodioecy.

AB The genus Kniphofia contains 71 species with an African-Malagasy distribution, including one species from Yemen. The genus has a general Afromontane distribution. Here we explore whether Kniphofia is a floristic indicator of the Afromontane centre of endemism and diversity. The South Africa Centre of diversity and endemism was explored in greater detail to understand biogeographical patterns.
   Africa, Afromontane Region, southern Africa, Madagascar and Yemen.
   Diversity and endemism for the genus were examined at the continental scale using a chorological approach. Biogeographical patterns and endemism in the South Africa Centre were examined in greater detail using chorology, phenetics, parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) and mapping of range-restricted taxa.
   Six centres of diversity were recovered, five of which are also centres of endemism. Eight subcentres of diversity are proposed, of which only two are considered subcentres of endemism. The South Africa Centre is the most species-rich region and the largest centre of endemism for Kniphofia. The phenetic analysis of the South Africa Centre at the full degree square scale recovered three biogeographical areas that correspond with the subcentres obtained from the chorological analysis. The PAE (at the full degree square scale) and the mapping of range-restricted taxa recovered two and six areas of endemism (AOEs), respectively. These latter two approaches produced results of limited value, possibly as a result of inadequate collecting of Kniphofia species. Only two AOEs were identified by PAE and these are embedded within two of the six AOEs recovered by the mapping of range-restricted taxa. All the above AOEs are within the three subcentres found by chorological and phenetic analysis (at the full degree square scale) for the South Africa Centre.
   The centres for Kniphofia broadly correspond to the Afromontane regional mountain systems, but with some notable differences. We regard Kniphofia as a floristic indicator of the Afromontane Region sensu lato. In southern Africa, the phenetic approach at the full-degree scale retrieved areas that correlate well with those obtained by the chorological approach.

AB We explored the effects of larval dispersal distance on the impact of no-take marine reserves (NTMRs) implemented in fisheries with catch regulations. NTMRs exist in many fisheries with harvest regulated by annual catch limits. In these fisheries, catch is taken from outside NTMRs, potentially resulting in reduced abundance outside NTMRs and an overall reduction in catch. We used a spatial model with two life stages (larvae and adults) to evaluate the effects of larval dispersal distance for fisheries managed by a total allowable catch (TAC) and an NTMR. We examined effects of the timing of density-dependent mortality in relation to larval movement. Abundance reached similar values for populations with long and short larval dispersal distances. Catch declined substantially for stocks with short larval dispersal distances. When larval dispersal distances were long, catch declined to values below maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but stabilized. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) declined to 9% of CPUE at MSY for stocks with short distance larval dispersal after the implementation of an NTMR; with long distance larval dispersal, CPUE declined to approximately 50% or less of the CPUE at MSY. The CPUE did not reflect trends in abundance after the implementation of an NTMR.

AB An intermoult male American lobster, Homarus americanus, with severe intestinal lesions was encountered while collecting samples of aerobic intestinal bacteria from lobsters held in an artificial sea-water recirculation aquarium system. Grossly, the intestine was firm, thickened, and white. Histologic examination revealed a severe, diffuse, ulcerative enteritis which spared the chitin-lined colon, somewhat similar to hemocytic enteritis of shrimp. The bacterial isolates from this lobster were compared to 11 other lobsters lacking gross intestinal lesions. Two organisms, one identified as Vibrio sp. and another most similar to an uncultured proteobacterium (98.9%), Clustering with Rhanella and Serratia species using 16S rDNA PCR, were isolated from the intestines of the 11, grossly normal, lobsters and the affected lobster. An additional two intestinal isolates were cultured only from the lobster with ulcerative enteritis. One, a Flavobacterium, similar to Lutibacter litoralis (99.3%), possibly represented a previously described commensal of the distal intestine. The second, a Vibrio sp., was unique to the affected animal. While the etiology of the ulcerative enteritis remains undetermined, this report represents the first description of gross and histologic findings in H. americanus of a condition which has morphologic similarities to hemocytic enteritis of shrimp. An additional observation was a decrease in the number of intestinal isolates recovered from the 11 apparently healthy lobsters compared to that previously reported for recently harvested lobster. More comprehensive studies of the relationship between the health of lobsters, gut microbial flora and the husbandry and environment maintained within holding units are warranted.

AB Study of very small dung beetles, less than 5 mm long, belonging to the tribe Canthonini from Afrotemperate forests in South Africa revealed four new genera, three monotypic and one with two new species, and one new species of Peckolus Scholtz & Howden. We describe the new taxa here. They are: Aliuscanthoniola similaris gen et sp. n., Dwesasilvasedis medinae gen et sp. n., Parvuhowdenius harrisoni gen et sp. n., Nebulasilvius gen. n. with new species Nebulasilvius insularis sp. n. and N. johani sp. n., and Peckolus poenskopius sp. n. We provide an updated key to all the African genera in the tribe Canthonini and keys to the species in the genera Nebulasilvius and Peckolus.

AB We studied the effects of sheep [Ovis aries (L.)] and rabbit [Oryctolagus cuniculus (L.)] grazing on the spread of induced fire on an open sand grassland community in the Hungarian Plain. Patches of open sand grassland were grazed by sheep in April and by sheep and rabbit in May of 2003. Half of each patch was burned in July. Canopy cover of the litter and vascular plant species, species number, plant height, burnt area, and the speed of fire-spread were estimated in 1 x 1 m quadrates. The burnt area was significantly smaller with late sheep grazing, while the speed of fire-spread decreased significantly due to rabbit grazing compared to that of the control. Plant height was significantly decreased by early and late sheep grazing, while rabbit grazing resulted in significantly lower canopy cover values of vascular plants compared to the control. Early sheep grazing resulted in overcompensation of the canopy cover of vascular plants. Species number was not affected by the grazing treatments. This 1-year experiment demonstrated that moderate grazing has no short-term effects on the species diversity of the semi-arid open sand grassland. Furthermore, late spring grazing decreased the spread of fire on the grassland portions of the community; thus it may inhibit the burning of large areas of the semi-arid forest-steppe.

AB Indices or density estimators derived from counts of scat can be used as indirect measures of animal population density. An important issue in these studies is that scat decay rates vary across habitats and seasons. This is an often overlooked source of bias when using scat-based indices to make comparisons of relative abundance among sites or over time. I propose a simple method by which experimentally determined scat-persistence rates can be used as a correction factor in such indices. This measured persistence rate also serves as an important parameter in models that convert scat count data into population estimators. I test this method in a relative abundance survey of sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) for 6 sites across 2 national parks in northern Thailand. Using the correction factor changed the qualitative predictions of the abundance survey by altering the rank of the sites ordered by estimated sambar density. The ratio of corrected.-uncorrected index values, which would stay constant across sites if there was no habitat-based variability in scat-persistence rates, changed by a factor of 2.7 when measured across sites and by 1.6 when measured across parks. This suggests that the application of persistence-rate correction factors could reduce the bias of scat-based index or estimator surveys by specifically accounting for decay rate variability.

AB The effect of suspended fine sediments on chrysomonad flagellates was investigated for 'Spumella-like' flagellates in laboratory studies and exemplarily for a flagellate community (with a focus on chrysomonads) originating from the oligomesotrophic Lake Mondsee, Austria, using different clay minerals and silicate beads. In the community experiment, the abundances of Spumella-like flagellates decreased significantly after introduction of suspended clays, but on the community level suspended clays did not negatively affect flagellate abundance. In order to understand this taxon-specific response, the influence of different clay characteristics, specifically of particle concentration and size, was investigated for Spumella-like flagellates in laboratory studies. We used ultra-microbacteria, i.e. typical bacterioplankton of Lake Mondsee, as food. For comparison we also investigated growth rates of the Spumella-like flagellates feeding on the large bacterium Listonella pelagia. These experiments confirmed that at bacterial abundances realized in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes, the flagellates are severely food limited. The presence of suspended sediments generally decreased the growth at any food concentration tested. This decrease was reflected in shifts of the growth kinetic parameters, i.e. in a positive correlation between the half-saturation constant and the threshold food concentration and a negative correlation between the maximal growth rate and the suspended sediment concentration. The clearance rates strongly decreased when small and large particles were present, but were only slightly affected for intermediate-sized particles. We assume that small particles in the size range of ingestible bacteria interfere with the feeding process and cause lower clearance rates, while intermediate-sized particles may serve as substrate for the attachment of flagellates and to subsequently optimize their clearance rates.

AB Procellariiform seabirds (petrels, albatrosses and shearwaters) navigate vast distances over seemingly featureless ocean habitat by mechanisms that are not well understood. These birds have large olfactory bulbs, and the use of smell has been implicated in both foraging and homing behavior. While many olfactory cues relevant to these behaviors have been identified, ammonia is a potentially significant, biogenic, scented compound that has not been studied in this context. Ammonium (NH4+) constitutes a primary waste product produced by many of the prey species on which procellariiforms forage. Nitrogen waste products, including volatilized ammonia (NH3) also scent the terrestrial landscape of sub-Antarctic islands where newly breeding procellariiform seabirds recruit and raise their young. Since an ability to smell ammonia may be relevant to both prey detection and locating colonies or islands, we used a non-invasive, behavioral assay to examine whether this scented compound is detectable by a candidate test species, the blue petrel Halobaena caerulea Gmelin. Our results suggest that these birds can detect volatilized ammonia within a concentration range that they may naturally encounter (10(-11) to 10(-5) M), and point to ammonia as a potential signal molecule in the sub-Antarctic.

AB In western Indian Ocean, Reunion Island remains a hot-spot for biological conservation. Such a biological value is mainly threatened by invasion of alien species. Knowledge of ecological consequences of exotic plant invasions has been assessed, in order to suggest guidelines withstanding a regional strategy for invasive plant management. Despite a strong variability of used methods, studies agree on a general impoverishment of species communities and a decrease of natural regeneration. They plead for prioritizing invasive Plants. Ecological impact mainly consists in competition between exotic and native plants, and in alteration of primary and secondary successions. Some introduced species act as refuges for some native animal species but the impact of invasive plants on animal communities remains poorly documented. Additionally. the role of human activities in plant invasions (e.g.. fluxes of plant species between landscape Units) is scarcely studied. A regional strategy developed at the South-eastern Indian Ocean level is recommended, based oil both prevention programmes (e.g.. control of species introduction, early detecting) and public information.

AB Models commonly used in population ecology have somewhat vague and often misleading connections with physical and biological processes connecting organisms with their environments. The metaphysiological modelling approach offers a conceptual framework that is consistent with basic laws and enables integration across levels of organization from cells to ecosystems. This perspective accommodates the intrinsically disequilibrial nature of biological systems in changing environments, as well as adaptive responses to these changes. More attention needs to be paid to factors governing mortality losses rather than the functional or intake response alone. Models need to be based more firmly on underlying biophysical processes in order to serve as reliable guides to conservation action in novel environments.

AB The microflora of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) fry from a commercial freshwater hatchery, along with important water quality parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH, was analysed. Samples for bacteriological analysis were taken from gill, heart and kidney, from the third to the eighth week after hatching. Pure bacterial colonies were examined macroscopically, with Gram staining and biochemical tests. For final identification, the APILAB Plus programme (bioMerieux, France) was used. The bacterial populations of rainbow trout fry changed depending on age. Most of the bacterial colonies were Cultured from the gills (64.4%), rather than the heart (21.8%) and kidney (13.8%). The bacterial community of fry gills from an incubator was composed mostly of Gram-positive bacteria such as Renibacterium salmoninarum, Lactobacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Corynebacterium aquaticum. After the transfer of fry from incubator into the pools the Gram-negative bacteria increased in number and became the dominant microflora of rainbow trout fry and comprised more than 95% of its bacterial flora. Flavibacterium, Acinetobacter and Yersinia were the predominant Gram-negative genera in fry in the incubator, whereas Aeromonas and Pseudomonas were the main isolates from rainbow trout fry until the end of the experiment.

AB This paper analyses the relationship between Lavandula stoechas subsp. pedunculata, a common Mediterranean scrub species in central Iberia, and perennial grasslands. While Lavandula gives rise to almost monospecific formations in intermediate and upper hill zones, perennial grasses occupy the low areas. The proposed explanatory hypothesis for this spatial distribution is that the scrub is unable to establish itself in grasslands with heavy spatial occupation. We designed two experiments to test this hypothesis, one which analysed the effect of perennial grass cover on Lavandula establishment, and another which focused on its influence on previously implanted seedling survival and growth, distinguishing the effect of shoot and root interference. The results show negative interference during establishment and later in the use of light and nutrients. This results in a very low overall survival probability, with only 1.4% of seedlings surviving the first growth period. This low success rate explains the existence of a clear spatial segregation between scrub patches and perennial-dominated grasslands. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier SAS.

AB The important of melliferous and polliniferous species of the Montana Region found north of the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in the state of Campeche, Mexico, were studied in relation to their flowering phenology and the beekeeping cycle. More than 100 plant species are used by bees, of which at least 67 genera and 31 families were identified. Honey production in this region depends to a great extent on the multiple flowering of the forest, which contrasts with other areas of Yucatan where much of the honey produced depends on recently disturbed areas. At La Montana, apiculture is an activity with historical importance that today represents a viable alternative activity that could be compatible with conservation of the natural resources.

AB In montane meadows of the southern Sierra Nevada mountains (Calif., USA), Rothrock sagebrush (Artemisia rothrockii G.) has expanded into sites once dominated by herbaceous species. We explored the relationship between climate and shrub establishment by estimating Rothrock sagebrush age distributions from growth rings. We compared these age distributions with annual records of spring snowpack and summer precipitation across 4 vegetation types that differed in water table depth, soil moisture, and vegetation cover. In the 2 vegetation types where the water table is consistently deeper than I m, Rothrock sagebrush stands were up to 40 years old and had relatively even age structures that showed no strong relationship to climate. In the 2 vegetation types with a shallow water table - but with contrasting soil moisture and herbaceous cover - the majority of shrubs colonized synchronously between 1984 and 1994, a relatively dry period that followed the wet 1982 to 1983 El Nino. These and other published data suggest that initial shrub colonization of new sites is facilitated by wet years, which may increase seed production, germination, and seedling survival. However, once sagebrush stands are established and local seed supply is abundant, its continued recruitment seems independent of climate.

AB The effect of supplementary feeding and artificial twinning on nestling growth and survival in Australasian Gannets (Morus serrator) breeding at Pope's Eye Marine Reserve in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, was investigated in 1997-98 and 1998-99. Australasian Gannets were capable of raising additional young; however, twin young were generally of poorer quality, had slower development, attained lower maximum weights, and had lower survival rates. Chicks given supplementary food attained maximum weights greater than both single and twin chicks. The reduction in breeding performance of gannets provided with additional offspring, coupled with the greater fledgling masses of supplementary-fed chicks, suggests that parents were unable to provide sufficient food for two young, indicating that this population is potentially limited by food availability. That clutch size in this species is limited to a single egg is supported by their apparent inability to successfully incubate two eggs. Recent increases in the size of the Australasian Gannet population in Victoria indicate that other factors, such as natural or anthropogenic perturbations in environmental conditions may also be important in mediating population changes.

AB The phenomenon of shell wiping in Calliostoma zizyphinum (L.) was investigated with regard to its potential function as a feeding adaptation. It was determined that C, zizyphinum will, on average, wipe the surface of its shell with its foot twice every 24 h, in the process consuming any matter that has adhered to the pedal mucus present on the surface of its shell. Examination of the importance of shell wiping to C. zizyphinum, both as a mechanism to reduce shell fouling and as a source of nutrition, revealed that the prevention of shell wiping resulted in a reduction in shell growth by a factor of 0.67 and an increase in shell fouling by a factor of 9. Measurement of the metabolic rate of C. zizyphinum ascertained that an average sized adult had a metabolic requirement of similar to 117 J 24 h(-1) Examination of the ability of the pedal mucus produced by C. zizyphinum to act as a provendering agent showed that the pedal mucus produced by C. zizyphinum could increase the entrapment of particulate matter by a factor of 8, and increase the chlorophyll a content of a substratum by a factor of 3. Calculation of the potential contribution of the matter trapped by pedal mucus, which is ingested through shell wiping, to the daily energetic requirements of C, zizyphinum revealed that shell wiping can contribute to approximately one-fifth of the daily energetic requirement of C. zizyphinum. Shell. wiping therefore has an important role for both feeding and antifouling in C, zizyphinum.

AB In Mediterranean shrublands, post-fire accumulation of above-ground biomass of resprouters is faster than that of seeders. This suggests that resprouters may have a competitive advantage. To test this hypothesis, we used a removal experiment to study the effect of the presence of the dominant tussock-grass Ampelodesmos mauritanica on the resprouting shrubs Erica multiflora and Globularia alypum and on the seeders Rosmarinus officinalis and Pinus halepensis three and four years after a wildfire. Water potential of target plants was also measured to see if Ampelodesmos removal increased water availability. Ampelodesmos marginally reduced growth of all target species but did not influence survival or water potential of any target species. Our results suggest that the effect of climatically influenced water stress was stronger than the effect of Ampelodesmos neighbours. Plant-plant interactions in this Mediterranean community are weak after fire and the magnitude of the Amgelodesmos effect does not differ between seeders and resprouters.

AB Short-term and long-term movements of the patellid limpet Patella flexuosa Quoy & Gaimard were studied on an intertidal rocky shore where a mytilid, Hormomya mutabilis (Gould), formed an extensive mussel zone. At low tide, all the limpets were found resting within gaps in the mussel zone, which were formed after mass dislodgement of the mussels by waves. The foraging areas of all the marked limpets were restricted to within the gaps during four 24h diving observations. All of these limpets displayed homing behaviour after short excursions with a maximum average distance of 6.7 cm from their homes. During short-term observation periods of about 4-5 days, no marked limpets moved from one gap to another gap across the mussel bed of H. mutabilis. During long-term observation periods of one month, however, 10-30% of marked limpets shifted their homes to different gaps that had a lower limpet density. The shell length of these emigrants was, in general, significantly smaller than that of non-emigrants. The percentage of emigrants tended to be higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. The movement of P. flexuosa within patchy habitats is discussed with a focus on the difference in site fidelity between small and large limpets.

AB Bauxite processing in Porto Trombetas, Brazil, generated a fine particulate effluent that was dumped into Lake Batata over a ten-year period, leading to high suspended solids, reduced water transparency and increased turbidity in parts of the lake. The influence of bauxite tailings on cladoceran feeding was studied by measuring carbon ingestion and carbon incorporation rates in Diaphanosoma birgei and Moina mirzuta.
   Feeding responses of animals exposed to bauxite tailings concentrations of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 mg/l were tested in laboratory experiments at two food levels (0.2 and 2.0 mg C/1) of C-14-radiolabelled Scenedesmus acutus, and compared to bauxite-free experimental controls. Ingestion rates of both species varied in relation to food level and tailings concentration.
   Carbon incorporation rates generally declined with increased bauxite tailings levels in both cladoceran species, but precise responses varied between species and for the different combinations of tailings and food. Both carbon ingestion and incorporation rates were less adversely affected by rising bauxite tailings concentrations in M. mirzuta than D. birgei, indicating a clear differential susceptibility to suspended sediment contamination in these species.

AB The influence of water stress on the rate of transpiration and water-use efficiency (WUE) of the C-4 grasses Themeda triandra Forsk. and Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees was determined for both the vegetative and reproductive phases. Transpiration was determined by means of an infra-red gas analyser, while the leaf water potential was used to quantify water stress. Water-use efficiency is defined as the ratio of mass of CO, fixed, to mass of water released into the atmosphere by transpiration. If water was not limiting, the rate of transpiration was 75.8809 mg H2O m(-2) s(-1) and 101.8384 mg H2O m(-2) s(-1) for T. triandra and E. lehmanniana (P less than or equal to 0.001) respectively. The WUE of T. triandra and E. lehmanniana if water was not limiting was respectively 4.2061 mg CO2 (-1) H2O and 6.7060 mg CO2 g(-1) H2O (p less than or equal to 10.001). The first signs of a decrease in transpiration rate was observed at a leaf water potential of -2054 kPa for T. triandra and -2433 kPa for E. lehmanniana (p less than or equal to 0.01). The decrease in transpiration rate and WUE was significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) correlated with leaf water potential for both species. The rate of transpiration and WUE with water stress differed significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) between the two species.

AB Respiration rates of seven species of intertidal sea anemones from the south-western Cape, South Africa were measured with and without illumination to determine whether zooxanthellae contributed to their nutritional needs. Light had no significant effect on oxygen exchange in any of the species, suggesting that all are azooxanthellate. Diets of anemones from two sites, Wooley's Pool in False Bay and Blouberg on the Atlantic coast some 20 km north of Cape Town, were examined by gut content analysis, Seven species occurred at Wooley's Pool, but only one (Bunodactis reynaudi) at Blouberg. At Wooley's Pool 39.4% of anemones contained food, while at Blouberg only 7.4% did so. A wide spectrum of prey taxa were consumed by the various anemone species, although considerable dietary overlap occurred. Pelecypods, gastropods and isopods were ingested by all the species examined, Pelecypods dominated the diet of B. reynaudi at Blouberg (91% occurrence), but were recorded in only 42% of the same species at Wooleyl's Pool. The frequency of occurrence of pelecypods in the guts of the other species ranged from 9% (Anthothoe stimpson) to 28% (Actinia equina). Gastropods were the main prey items eaten by Anthopleura michaelseni (67% occurrence), Pseudactinia flagellifera (43%) and Pseudactinia varia (42%), while isopods were the most frequently occurring constituent in the diets of A. stimpsoni (62%) and Bunodosoma capensis (16%). A. equina was the only species for which insects were a regular part of the diet (26% occurrence). Platyhelminths were found only in the guts of B, capensis (11%); holothurians only in B. reynaudi at Wooley's Pool (2%), and crinoids only in P. flagellifera (2%). Large quantities of algal material and indigestible debris were also ingested, indicating that sea anemones are non-selective feeders. Cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling techniques revealed four distinct feeding groups among the anemone assemblages, These are characterized as microphagous (A. stimpson), generalist (B, capensis and A. equina), macrophagous (B. reynaudi at Wooley's Pool, A. michaelseni, P. flagellifera and P, varia) and specialist bivalve-feeder (B. reynaudi at Blouberg).

AB Short interval monitoring of isolated females of Streptocephalus dichotomus Baird, S. proboscideus (Frauenfeld), and S. torvicornis (Waga) revealed no resorption of unfertilized oocytes in the lateral pouches of the oviducts or in the ovisac. Oocytes expelled by the female disintegrate in the medium. This finding is in disagreement with earlier studies on S. dichotomus and S. proboscideus, but corroborates findings on S. vitreus (Brauer) and S. rubricaudatus (Klunzinger). Light and electron microscopic studies of unfertilized and fertilized oocytes show polar-body extrusion, vitelline-membrane formation, and egg-shell deposition in fertilized oocytes only. The streptocephalids studied here differ, in this respect, from two other anostracans, Tanymastix and Artemia, where unfertilized oocytes develop a vitelline membrane, and sometimes an egg shell.

AB Lake Batata receive tailings from bauxite mining for ten years (1979-1989). This material. with 7-9% of solid particles, changed some ecological conditions of part of the lake. In order to study the influence of this material on the cladoceran populations, seasonal and intensive studies were made of abundance and brood size of the animals and of some environmental parameters such as transparency, suspended material, POC (<30 mu m), total bacteria and chlorophyll a.
   Reduced transparency and high suspended matter attested to the greater quantity of tailings in the water column, in the area impacted by tailings. Greater oscillations of density and brood size at stations in the impacted area appear to indicate less stable conditions in this part of the lake.

AB Based on the pattern of movement used during the search for prey, predators can generally be placed into one of two categories: active or passive searchers. This study documents an age-related switch in the movement pattern of the pisaurid spider Dolomedes triton. Individual spiders were marked and Followed during two consecutive seasons on two ponds at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Laurel, Maryland. Mean distances moved per day were compared between adult females and juveniles. During both years, and on both ponds, adult females traveled significantly greater distances per day than did juveniles (1.88 +/- 0.33 m vs. 0.19 +/- 0.02 m for adult females and juveniles, respectively; years and ponds pooled). This shift suggests an age-related difference in foraging strategy. Repeated observations on individual female spiders support the notion that juvenile D. triton switch to a more active search mode upon maturation. It is hypothesized that this change in movement represents a switch in foraging strategy in response to increased energy requirements during yolk production.

AB Studies of plant and animal populations have demonstrated the occurrence of multiple and mixed life history strategies such as polymodal timing of germination and emergence from dormancy.  We present the results of a simulation model used to test whether between-year variance in mortality can lead to the persistence of multiple hatching strategies considered over an ecological time scale (50 years).  The model is based on the general life history characteristics of a population of planktonic copepods (Diaptomus sanguineus) in Bullhead Pond, Rhode Island.  Our model results demonstrate that, given a range of between-year variance in mortality, multiple strategies for timing of emergence can persist in a common environment for ecologically relevant periods of time.  A qualitative test of the model comparing field estimates of mean and variance of mortality in Bullhead Pond with the region of persistence indicates that the model results are in approximate agreement with field estimates.  The results suggest that variability in year-to-year selection pressures, such as predation or harsh winters, may play an important role in determining the evolution of life histories.

AB Prey-size use and feeding tactics varied among three cooccurring darter species in the primitive subgenus Hadropterus (genus Percina). These darters span a wide range of body sizes, yet they all utilize the same lotic prey-size spectrum. An optimal-diet index (ODI) showed that small darters had more optimal diets than large darters. However, decelerating ODI curves showed that ontogenetic shifts occurred from number-maximizing to prey-size selective feeding tactics. Interspecific differences in feeding tactics, as characterized by differences in prey size, diet breadth, and numbers of prey, also were reflected by differences in slopes of ODI power curves. Percina nigrofasciata showed a relatively prey-size selective tactic; P. sciera showed a relatively number-maximizing tactic. In darters, prey-size selection corresponded with a broad diet and number maximizing corresponded with a narrow diet. When P. nigrofasciata were compared among four Black Creek sites, relatively optimal diets were found at two sites where large macroinvertebrates also were relatively abundant, as predicted from optimal foraging theory. However, only small differences in ODI values existed between two sites showing the greatest disparity in macroinvertebrate abundance. Prey size was an important diet characteristic related to the feeding tactics of particulate-feeding darters.

AB With little consideration of both natural and social disturbance in previous studies on Ecological security patterns (ESPs), the identification of conservation priority areas is not accurate enough to enhance the structure and quality of the ecosystem for regional ecological security. To address this gap, this study developed a novel framework of "importance-connectivity-disturbance " to identify ESPs, selecting the Pearl River Delta (PRD) as the study area. Ecological sources were identified by combing ecological importance and landscape connectivity. A more integrated ecological resistance was developed to represent natural and social disturbance, and applied to obtain levels of regional ecological security. Ecological corridors were then extracted and classified using the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model and gravity model. The results showed that 9645.77 km(2) of ecological sources and 72 potential ecological corridors were determined, and the region with the higher security grade accounted for 19.18% of the entire area. The optimized ESPs of "one ring, two cores, three zones, and four axes " was developed based on key components of ESPs and local socioeconomic conditions. This study provides a novel perspective on the methodology of identifying ESPs and an essential reference for ecological protection and regional development planning in urban agglomerations.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in ecological systems can result from animal-driven top-down processes, but despite some theoretical attention, the emergence of spatial heterogeneity from feedbacks caused by animals is not well understood empirically. Interactions between predators and prey influence animal movement and associated nutrient transport and release, generating spatial heterogeneity that cascades throughout ecological systems. Here, we synthesize the existing literature to evaluate the mechanisms by which terrestrial predators can generate spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemical processes through consumptive and non-consumptive effects. Overall, we propose that predators increase heterogeneity in ecosystems whenever predation is intense and spatially variable, whereas predator-prey interactions homogenize ecosystems whenever predation is weak or diffuse in space. This leads to several testable hypotheses: 1) that predation and carcass deposition at high-predation risk sites stimulate positive feedbacks between predation risk and nutrient availability; 2) that prey generate nutrient hotspots when they concentrate activity in safe habitats, but instead generate nutrient subsidies when they migrate daily between safe and risky habitats; 3) that herbivore body size mediates risk effects, such that megaherbivores are more likely to homogenize ecosystems and predator loss in general will tend to homogenize ecosystems. Testing these hypotheses will advance our understanding of whether predators amplify landscape heterogeneity in ecological systems.
